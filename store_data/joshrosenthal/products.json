This book is phase two.  Because phase one alone incompletely communicated what he wanted to say, in an attempt to speak outside of his typical outlets, Josh chose the art of narrative to show God's ability to redeem even the most seemingly irredeemable memories.\r\n\r\n<i>If you have any questions or concerns about your order, please email us at JoshRosenthalMusic@gmail.com</i>\r\n","options":[{"id":9627024,"name":"none","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25978958/-/BookNothing.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25978958/-/BookNothing.jpg","width":450,"height":450}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1559407,"name":"Book","permalink":"book","url":"/category/book"}]}]
