It made me think of all the children who are not cherished and I decided to make a token home for this little one. The shantung covered box houses some of the simple things that can make a child happy: love, toys and a small book.\r\n\r\nThe blocks are made from a solar plate etching attached to foam board. One side is printed in black, on the other it is black and pink. The box is lined with paper from an art magazine and one of my own photographs has been used on the inside lid. The little baby's frame is made from vellum covered card and the handmade box is covered in silk bookcloth.\r\n\r\nThe work can be displayed in various ways, for example with the blocks vertically, or lying flat in the box.\r\n\r\nThe box is 5 x 23.5 x 19.5 cm (2\" x 9.5\" x 7.7\"), the print is approx 15cm (6\") square and the photograph is the size of a passport photo\r\n\r\n************\r\nPostage by ordinary mail is included in the price.

The text is \"Australia Suite\" written by Lynn Hard with drawings by Garry Shead. 76 pages. Signed by the Author and Artist.\r\n\r\nThe binding is made from gilded boards held together with scrim which is usually hidden by the spine. Linen and silk thread, and embossed lines on the boards, are used to reflect Shead's linear drawing style. The inside boards are covered in distressed silver coloured leaf. Finished with traditional shellac for protection.\r\n\r\nThe binding has a lovely textured appearance thanks to some of the bole being left exposed and rubbing back to enhance the colour.\r\n\r\n26 cm x 21.5cm (approx 10.2\" x 8.5\")\r\n\r\nContact me if you'd like more information or photos.
