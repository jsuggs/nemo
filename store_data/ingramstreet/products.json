This makes this a one off design - no chance of repeating this exact shape or form!\r\n\r\nThe raindrop is a  3.5mm African Amethyst - a natural gemstone, a rich, transparent pale lilac colour -  cut in a faceted design so it sparkles, just like a delicate rain drop...\r\n\r\nThe large white lustrous freshwater pearl is 6mm in diameter, and perfectly round and unblemished.\r\n\r\nThe pendant is 1.7cm at its widest, and 3cm long. It hangs from a 18 inch (41cm) solid sterling silver chain. It is a simply lovely necklace - not too large - refined, elegant and organic.  The organic texture is emphasised by highly polished veins, which contrast their shine with the chalky dappled texture behind them.\r\n\r\nThe process of making this necklace, with its own carving, means there is no way of recreating this pendant. I have only made three gemstone raindrop necklaces so far, and each is unique in size, shape and gemstone, ensuring you will have a exclusive, designer item of jewellery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":903109,"name":"Default","price":80.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1414671/-/SHOP_DSCF7106.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1414671/-/SHOP_DSCF7106.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":126510,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"},{"id":126512,"name":"One Off Design","permalink":"one-off-design","url":"/category/one-off-design"},{"id":129637,"name":"IN STOCK READY TO SHIP","permalink":"in-stock-ready-to-ship","url":"/category/in-stock-ready-to-ship"},{"id":182085,"name":"Pearl","permalink":"pearl","url":"/category/pearl"},{"id":180572,"name":"Gemstone","permalink":"gemstone","url":"/category/gemstone"},{"id":178174,"name":"£50 to £100","permalink":"£50-to-£100","url":"/category/£50-to-£100"}]}]
