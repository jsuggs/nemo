It is also this that the outside world sees - an outdated institution for the upper class, a product of a bygone age.</p>\r\n<i>The Boys' Side</i> seeks to reveal Eton as it is for a boy. It approaches the school on a personal level, giving a more intimate insight into the life of an Etonian. It is a portrayal to which not only boys can relate, but also the wider public - a portrayal of the diversity and independence Eton fosters, as a school that juxtaposes idiosyncrasies with the very ordinary.\r\n\r\n<p></p><big><b>Excerpt</b></big><p></p>\r\nForeword by Mr Anthony Little, the current Head Master.</p>\r\nAs schoolmasters, we urge boys critically to engage in the examined life. This critical understanding comes in many ways, including the photographer's lens. Anatole and Serge's collection of images views the life of a community from unusual angles, encouraging Etonians to look in a different way at what is so familiar. In particular, the quiet moments - of preparation, rehearsal or repose - give insight into life behind the public face. These are evocative images from a busy world, held for a moment in time. They offer a new insight into the continuing story of an institution and its people.\r\n\r\n<p></p><big><b>About the authors</b></big><p></p>\r\nAnatole Sloan and Serge Mosesov are boys in their final year at Eton. Both became interested in photography during their time at the school, and have received several awards, including winner and runner up respectively in the 2008 Youth \"Classic View\" category of the Landscape Photographer of the Year awards. They have held a number of exhibitions and have used their photography in support of charity.\r\n\r\n<p></p><big><b>Printing</b></big><p></p>\r\nThe book was printed and bound by EBS of Verona, Italy.
