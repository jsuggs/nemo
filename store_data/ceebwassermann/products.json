This is a flat version. Approx 30mm in diameter. I can make this in gold, brass or copper. Contact me if you want to customize it.\r\n\r\nHere's a little bit about Sakuras or Cherry Blossoms:\r\nIn Japan cherry blossoms also symbolize clouds due to their nature of blooming en masse, besides being an enduring metaphor for the ephemeral nature of life, an aspect of Japanese cultural tradition that is often associated with Buddhistic influence, and which is embodied in the concept of mono no aware. The transience of the blossoms, the extreme beauty and quick death, has often been associated with mortality; for this reason, cherry blossoms are richly symbolic, and have been utilized often in Japanese art, manga, anime, and film, as well as at musical performances for ambient effect. There is at least one popular folk song, originally meant for the shakuhachi (bamboo flute), titled \"Sakura\", and several pop songs.\r\n\r\nShipping Options:\r\nInternational: if you do not specify, then I will send Airmail (approx 5-7 days for USA, 5 days for the UK and 10 days for Canada & approx.7-10 days for Europe; please check with me for other destinations)\r\n\r\nAustralia: Items will be sent by Express Post (overnight)\r\n\r\n©Ceeb Wassermann, 2011.
