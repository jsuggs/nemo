So long as you're okay with the idea of stealing drugs from kids to get high while they go Lord of the Flies on each other.  \r\n\r\nIn Freeze Tag on the Highway, Brian Krans ruthlessly intertwines images of picturesque summers and the chaos of being a teenager. \r\n\r\nFreeze Tag on the Highway has been called ‎\"gripping...darkly funny...twisted...\" by Green Apple Books, while readers are calling it, \"raw, completely unfiltered, and... pharmaceutically correct.\" \r\n\r\nThe Midwest Book Review called Freeze Tag on the Highway, \"...a thriller that brings terror in its potential closeness to reality, highly recommended.\"\r\n\r\nWith all that said, the book takes place during the last week of summer at Camp Wazeecha, a therapeutic, confidence-boosting camp for teens with developmental disorders, low self-esteem, and authority issues. \r\n\r\nWhile the brochure promises positive results, the camp’s director, Jake, sedates himself with the kids' medication while leaving them to play on the jungle gyms of their chemical imbalances. When most of the staff quits  in protest, Jake is forced to watch a few of the kids he despises more than the camp itself. \r\n\r\nReleased by Rock Town Press in July 2011. \r\n\r\nRead the first chapter here: http://www.goodreads.com/story/show/268311-freeze-tag-on-the-highway?chapter=342576","options":[{"id":12400458,"name":"Autographed","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13318245,"name":"Not autographed","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":10.0},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35989688/-/FTOHCover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35989688/-/FTOHCover.jpg","width":396,"height":612}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2219649,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":3697160,"name":"A Constant Suicide","permalink":"a-constant-suicide","position":2,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/a-constant-suicide","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-05-04T04:00:17.000Z","description":"Image. Sin. Suicide. Blame. College isn't all kegs and eggs. \r\n\r\nChris feels like a loser. He's sick of his Catholic high school life of obedience and order. He goes to college craving something else, but knows he won't find it on his own. The socially adept Ethan takes Chris under his wing, sharing basement revelry traditions and introducing him to campus terrorism, with a few hundred-dollars' worth of innocent fish as victims. \r\n\r\nEverything seems fine until Ethan puts a gun in his mouth sophomore year. Chris has to find out why the envy of so many chose suicide as his way out. He won't like the answers. \r\n\r\nPart-memoir, part-fiction, this portrayal of the underside of campus life intertwines sarcasm and skepticism to define a culture seeking the never-ending party. \r\n\r\nPublished by Rock Town Press in 2007.
