Its narrative commences with a portrait of the vigorous studio practice Haring had already established after enrolling in New York's School of Visual Arts, and tracks his metamorphosis into an ultra-prolific artist making political public art on downtown streets and responding to the city's graffiti culture, intent on making art that would fall outside the boundaries of the institutions. Reproduced throughout are rarely seen drawings and sketchbooks, video stills, flyers, posters, photographs, subway drawings, word collages, texts and diaries. Keith Haring: 1978-1982 unfolds the nascent career of this tireless creator, philosopher, agitator and activist, one of the most iconic and popular artists of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nPublished by Moderne Kunst Nürnberg\r\nEdited by Gerald Matt, Raphaela Platow.

McGee began as a graffiti artist on the streets of San Francisco, working under such tags as Ray Fong, Twist and Twisto, and his work since then has hugely expanded the terms of both street art and contemporary art. The freshness of McGee''s work stems in part from his virtuoso handling and consolidation of a whole panoply of influences, from hobo art, sign painting and graffiti to comics, Beat literature and much else. His extraordinary skill as a draughtsman is energized by his insistence on pushing at the parameters of art--his work can be shockingly informal in the gallery and surprisingly elegant on the street--and by his keen nose for social malaise.\r\n\r\nThis volume revisits McGee''s most influential installations in art spaces, and considers the evolution of his aesthetic within institutional settings. Previously unseen photographs by Craig Costello document the artist''s work on the streets of San Francisco in the early 90s, highlighting the contributions of his friends and mentors. Also included are images from the artist''s famous slide lecture, compiled and refined over the past 20 years, and an oral history of the Bay Area''s Mission School by McGee''s friends, mentors and collaborators. Featuring 450 images, including many never before published, the book is designed by the artist in collaboration with Conny Purtill.\r\n\r\nBarry McGee (born 1966) began exhibiting his work in the 1980s--not in a museum or gallery setting but on the streets of San Francisco. In the early 90s he was closely associated with the Mission School and the San Francisco Bay Area''s graffiti boom. In 2001 his work was included in the Venice Biennale.","options":[{"id":48227223,"name":"Default","price":58.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127652445/-/book-barry-mcgee-barry-mcgee-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127652445/-/book-barry-mcgee-barry-mcgee-2.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":600721,"name":"Non Clothing","permalink":"non-clothing","url":"/category/non-clothing"},{"id":6666699,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":6666702,"name":"Gift Ideas","permalink":"gift-ideas","url":"/category/gift-ideas"}]},{"id":14877126,"name":"JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT 1981, THE STUDIO OF THE STREET","permalink":"jean-michel-basquiat-1981-the-studio-of-the-street","position":55,"price":70.0,"default_price":70.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/jean-michel-basquiat-1981-the-studio-of-the-street","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-15T22:11:09.000Z","description":"In 1981 Jean-Michel Basquiat made the momentous transition from the street to the studio. He had attracted considerable attention with his Times Square Show the summer before, and reinforced that nascent notoriety with a wall of phenomenal works in Diego Cortez's New York/New Wave at P.S. 1, which opened the following winter. A few months later, the dealer Annina Nosei offered Basquiat an independent space in which to prepare work for her September group show, Public Address. He was only 20. Between the world of spray-painted poetry and what critic Peter Schjeldahl called \"New York big-painting aesthetics\" lies a fantastic coming-of-age: Jean-Michel Basquiat: 1981: The Studio of the Street includes paintings and drawings on everything from note cards to sheet metal to a leather jacket and conventional canvas. In them, as throughout his career, Basquiat married an exuberant spontaneity and art-brut sensibility with a firm command of not only art materials but art history. He would go on to define the 80s Neo-Expressionist idiom, and to remain its most compelling representative. The Studio of the Street examines this charged point of contact in works that show the artist's progression from text to text-and-image, from found materials to traditional canvasses, and from pure drawing to his uniquely evocative hybrid of drawing and painting.\r\n\r\nPublished by Charta/ Deitch Projects\r\nIntroduction by Jeffrey Deitch.

Danzig Baldaev''s unparalleled ethnographic achievement, documenting more than 3,000 tattoo drawings, was made during a lifetime working as a prison guard. His recording of this esoteric world was reported to the KGB, who unexpectedly supported him, realizing the importance of being able to establish facts about convicts by reading the images on their bodies. The motifs depicted represent the uncensored lives of the criminal classes, ranging from violence and pornography to politics and alcohol. A medieval knight is surrounded by the severed heads of his enemies, a naked woman simultaneously services a man and two dwarfs, a crying President Gorbachev grips a human bone between sabre-like fangs, a group of angels drink vodka with God on a cloud--the meanings of these arresting images are explained to the uninitiated eye. Sergei Vasiliev''s graphic photographs show the grim reality of the Russian prison system and some of the alarming characters that inhabit it, while the illustrated criminals of Russia tell the tale of their closed society. This volume, the last in the trilogy, includes an introduction by historian Alexander Sidorov exploring the origins of the Russian criminal tattoo and their various meanings today.","options":[{"id":48226608,"name":"Default","price":33.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127652118/-/russiancriminaltattooencyclopaedia_0.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127652118/-/russiancriminaltattooencyclopaedia_0.jpg","width":435,"height":435}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":600721,"name":"Non Clothing","permalink":"non-clothing","url":"/category/non-clothing"},{"id":6666699,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":6666702,"name":"Gift Ideas","permalink":"gift-ideas","url":"/category/gift-ideas"}]},{"id":14876988,"name":"RUSSIAN CRIMINAL TATTOO ENCYLOPEDIA VOLUME II","permalink":"russian-criminal-tattoo-encylopedia-volume-ii","position":58,"price":33.0,"default_price":33.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/russian-criminal-tattoo-encylopedia-volume-ii","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-15T22:06:01.000Z","description":"Danzig Baldaev''s father was an academic, an ethnologist who found himself imprisoned under Soviet rule as an enemy of the people. In fact much of Baldaev''s family moved through the Soviet prison system, while he became a guard. At his father''s suggestion, Danzig used his access to document and study the tattoos that were pervasive among the truly criminal portion of the prison population, the vory v zakonye, or legitimate thieves, a semi-professional class who kept their own brutal laws. During his 30 years supervising inmates in St. Petersburg''s notorious Kresty Prison, Baldaev recorded more than 3,000 of their tattoos and parsed their meanings, in the drawings and text that made the first volume of the Russian Criminal Tattoo Encyclopedia a bestseller. This essential second volume, which collects all-new, previously unseen photographs and drawings, goes to the extremes of his incredible collection. Sergei Vasiliev''s photographs authenticate the images, Baldaev''s drawings make sense of them and through them both we glimpse an extraordinary world where the criminal''s position, history and even sexual preference are displayed indelibly on his body. \r\n\r\nContribution by Anne Applebaum, Danzig Baldaev\r\nPhotographed by Sergey Vasiliev\r\n\r\nFuel Pub | September 30, 2011 | Hardcover ","options":[{"id":48226560,"name":"Default","price":33.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127652028/-/b9d29f9439.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127652028/-/b9d29f9439.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":600721,"name":"Non Clothing","permalink":"non-clothing","url":"/category/non-clothing"},{"id":6666699,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":6666702,"name":"Gift Ideas","permalink":"gift-ideas","url":"/category/gift-ideas"}]},{"id":14876895,"name":"COVER ART OF STUDIO ONE RECORDS","permalink":"cover-art-of-studio-one-records","position":59,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cover-art-of-studio-one-records","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-15T22:00:13.000Z","description":"100% Absolutely essential!

Divine Styler, founder Fritz tha Cat has unearthed stacks of dusty rap interviews, flyers, photos, and artwork from the mid- to late- 90s to document both the evolution of the zine and his own trajectory from 18-year-old rap fan to one of the leaders of an underground movement.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1996, a gang of skater hip-hop nerds in London, Canada (of all places), tripped out listening to rapper Divine Styler's Spiral Walls Containing Autumns of Light.\r\n\r\nInspired by that evening s revelations, Ryan Somers (a.k.a. Fritz tha Cat) decided he had to bring the Brooklyn-born, one-semi-hit-wonder rapper out of retirement to save hip-hop. Using his welfare cheque, Ryan started a cut-and-paste, photocopied magazine named after Divine himself, hoping that somehow, somewhere, it would get into Mr. Styler's hands, and inspire him to record and release music again. The magazine title also reflected the content of the magazine, representing all of the creative, inspired, forward-thinking, and ultimately slept-on artists in the rising independent underground hip-hop scene of the mid- to late-'90s.\r\n\r\nRyan published eight issues over three years. The magazine grew from 100 copies of the original photocopied zine to 10,000-copy print runs that were distributed across North America.

And this lust started long ago, with family trips across the border into Windsor, Sault St. Marie or Sarnia. And you’d be in a whole ‘nother world. The candy got weirder. Everything was accompanied by a French translation. G.I. Joe guys suddenly came in weird colors, unlike their counterparts in the states. And it was awesome. This is what I remember.\r\n\r\nAnd as I grew older, it was hard not to hate the place. Only because we’d always get fucked with at the borders. Angry, bored, mean-spirited border agents would take great pleasure in ripping apart our cars, grilling the ugliest of us and hell, even one time standing in front of me with his hand on his gun holster, going so far as to unsnap the little snap thingie hold the gun in. Big tough guy, eh? No. Another numbnuts cop who didn’t have anything on us. Wasted time.\r\n\r\nAnd then I grew into a man. Which is debatable, but, as a designer, I noticed all the beautiful governmental graphics, provincial signage and a general beautiful sense of clear, smart Canadian design. I loved Canada for this. And John Candy. Thank you, Canada. This is our ode to you! We really packed it in, and had to jump from our normal 18” x 24” size up to 24” x 30”. There was just much good stuff up there. Thank you!

The canning jar already makes an awesome platform for a travel mug: it’s easy to clean, made of heat-resistant glass, cheap, durable, and when sealed it doesn’t leak. The only problem is that with their large openings, canning jars are not great for spill-free sipping while on the move. So we adapted it - made new lids that lets us drink like a boss from virtually any wide or regular mouth canning jar. It’s a simple eco-friendly alternative to poor-performing and messy disposable hot cups, and over-built and expensive travel mugs.\r\n\r\nCuppow was conceived of and designed by Joshua Resnikoff and Aaron Panone, and we’re proud to have developed a product that we look forward to using every day. That means it works great, it’s super durable, it’s made in the USA, it’s phthalate and BPA free, it’s recyclable, and it doesn’t break the bank.","options":[{"id":32062657,"name":"WIDE MOUTH","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32062660,"name":"REGULAR MOUTH","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123573123/-/lovely-package-cuppow1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123573123/-/lovely-package-cuppow1.jpg","width":475,"height":475},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100682275/-/regular-cuppow.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100682275/-/regular-cuppow.jpg","width":600,"height":400},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100682308/-/tumblr_m6lo9qyXWS1qzvn7h.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100682308/-/tumblr_m6lo9qyXWS1qzvn7h.jpg","width":500,"height":334}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":600721,"name":"Non Clothing","permalink":"non-clothing","url":"/category/non-clothing"},{"id":6666702,"name":"Gift Ideas","permalink":"gift-ideas","url":"/category/gift-ideas"}]},{"id":10246018,"name":"DANESON TOOTHPICKS - SINGLE MALT","permalink":"daneson-toothpicks-single-malt","position":252,"price":9.0,"default_price":9.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/daneson-toothpicks-single-malt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-30T06:46:36.000Z","description":"A recipe with barrel aged Islay single malt scotch from a 200 year old distillery is what makes our Single Malt Nº16 special.

The concept is simple, but achieving this state of functional elegance is more involved. Paul Cunningham, who designs and makes each ball, searched years before finding the right leather, a tough American-tanned skin originally developed for heavy duty boots. \r\n\r\nUnlike the official NFL issues made for the broad and brawny hands of professionals, Leather Head footballs are built to fit roundly in the hand of a layman. Much better for throwing between friends. The footballs are handmade one at a time from start to finish, so the quality is consistent, but each iteration is distinctive. \r\n\r\nLeather Head footballs are an artisanal product, and Cunningham considers himself accountable for the quality of each ball. Along with meticulously sourced materials, carefully designed cutting dies, and hard-earned skills, Cunningham maintains high standards and checks for quality at every step.\r\n ","options":[{"id":31203661,"name":"Default","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123573240/-/Untitled-1.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123573240/-/Untitled-1.png","width":732,"height":732},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98025079/-/leatherhead-football-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98025079/-/leatherhead-football-2.jpg","width":350,"height":446}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":600721,"name":"Non Clothing","permalink":"non-clothing","url":"/category/non-clothing"},{"id":2882825,"name":"Accessory","permalink":"accessory","url":"/category/accessory"},{"id":6666702,"name":"Gift Ideas","permalink":"gift-ideas","url":"/category/gift-ideas"}]},{"id":9978583,"name":"AJ'S TOY BOARDERS - SERIES 2","permalink":"aj-s-toy-boarders-series-2","position":268,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/aj-s-toy-boarders-series-2","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-17T03:54:07.000Z","description":"THIS IS THE SECOND SERIES OF AJ'S ORIGINAL TOY BOARDERS.
