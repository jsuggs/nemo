While other companies are trying to hype up reverse camber construction, Compatriot stays true to our number one priority: performance. Enter EN7 Positive Camber, the ultimate in classic energy-responsive camber construction. Ride faster, ride harder, and experience the essence of snowboarding: the turn.  Employing our proprietary CFX91 carbon fiber backbone and Knuckle Sandwich Sintered Sidewalls, this board has a smooth flex pattern that is stiff enough for Killington park and pipe missions, yet allows the perfect amount of freedom/flex in the right places for when you want to throw a few slashers into the trees.
