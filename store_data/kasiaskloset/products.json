The floral pattern is very fun and perfect for warmer weather, especially if you are attending any outdoor concerts/ festivals!. Looks super cute flats, a hat, feathers/flowers in your hair. The tag says medium, but it seems to be a \"bigger\" medium. (I wear a small between 0-2 and it's big on me...I had to pin it in the back so that it would not fall down during the picture, haha).
