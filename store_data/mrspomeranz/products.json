Morris was inspired and influenced by the charm, colour, sound, scenery, fragrance and beauty of the visible world. Liberty's fabric collection centres around these senses, focusing on Icelandic adventures, audio prints, tattoos on Tana Lawn, almost edible conversationals and fragrant florals, wrapping up with a sixth sense; a sense of Liberty.\r\n\r\nMo Coppoletta has an international reputation for unique and exquisite tattoos, so was the perfect choice to represent this collection inspired by the art of touch. \r\n\r\nDaydream is hand painted by Mo who was inspired by William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement, a style that represents Liberty, as it is a Mecca for Arts and Crafts visuals. Peonies were chosen as they are known as 'the king of flowers' in Eastern tradition and defined as the flower of riches and honour bringing health, wealth and wisdom. \r\n\r\nSilhouette: fitted bodice with 5 big buttons covered with golden silk, three quarter sleeves and super full, gathered midi skirt with side pockets.

Morris was inspired and influenced by the charm, colour, sound, scenery, fragrance and beauty of the visible world. Liberty's fabric collection centres around these senses, focusing on Icelandic adventures, audio prints, tattoos on Tana Lawn, almost edible conversationals and fragrant florals, wrapping up with a sixth sense; a sense of Liberty.\r\n\r\nAward winning actress Tamsin Greig was an obvious choice to represent the Audio fabric stories because of her beautiful and memorable voice. \r\nTamsin visited the Liberty Archive and selected three archival prints from the late 80s and early 90s. These depicted roses, leaves and a fairy tale wall. The inspiration for Kilburn Rose came from Tamsin’s childhood rose garden and her love of fairytales, specifically those that featured a tower shrouded in wild yet beautiful roses. \r\n\r\nThis dress will be custom made once you place an order based on your size and fabric choice. \r\n\r\nSilhouette: classic \"paper doll\" shape with a fitted bodice, hourglass-seamed waist, and a super full, gently pleated skirt. A wide cotton belt (2 stripes) ties around the waist. You can double wrap it across the waist and tie it at the back, centre or front as you prefer. Closes down back with hidden zipper.

It is easy to dress nice too - slip on a pretty flower print dress, a pair of simple shoes and you are ready to charm the world. As the wind changes to cold and the sun hides away, it becomes less fun. The first reaction is to ditch all your beautiful dresses and put on anything warm and cozy - but not flattering at all.\r\n\r\nBut we won't compromise. Even if the snow starts in your country in November and ends in March, you can always wear beautiful dresses in winter, especially if they are made of wool and have a flower print that will always remind you of summer days.\r\n\r\nWe have named this collection \"The winter flowers' .
