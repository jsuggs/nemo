There´s no confusion, just straight forward rock at full throttle that thrusts through until the end. A fast tempo with driven guitars and strong drumming. A catchy melody is thrown into the mix that will get you hooked in no time. The vocals are on key all the way in this immense overall track. Your Bullshit Lacks Intelligence consists of a fast tempo and preppy yet catchy melody that you cant help but like. This track reminds me a little of You Me At Six, which isn’t a bad thing. They most definitely have their pop rock sound down to a T. It doesn’t miss a beat at any point and keeps rocking forward until the last note.\r\n\r\nStand Tall shows off skillful and clever guitars off the first chord. It delivers a fast tempo that matches up to its counterparts. A tight rhythm section that ploughs through strongly and work well together. Another catchy melody that will have you on your feet in no time, then throw in a guitar fueled ending to complete the piece. Learn to Drown is a perfect track to close the EP with. Guitar driven from start to finish with its skillful, powerful drumming to boot. The track has no intention of slowing and moves through until the silence without breaking its flow.\r\n\r\nAll four of the tracks work well and hold their own personality. There isn’t anything bad to say about this EP albeit I wish it held more tracks of the same caliber. I can see the band growing from strength to strength and also perfecting `their´ sound even more every step of the way.\r\n\r\nSo…go grab a copy and support these guys talent because you wont regret it.\r\n\r\nHttp://www.youtube.com/screamtheheadlines","options":[{"id":45306486,"name":"Default","price":3.16,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125515119/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125515119/-/image.jpg","width":960,"height":960}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6382005,"name":"EPs","permalink":"eps","url":"/category/eps"}]},{"id":9449519,"name":"Pembrokshire Mermaid - ASH","permalink":"pembrokshire-mermaid","position":2,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pembrokshire-mermaid","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-12T17:12:39.000Z","description":"Image inspired by the place we live and the tattoos we have.\r\n\r\nIllustrated by Lee Philips\r\nInstagram: @leejohnphillips\r\n\r\n100% cotton pre-shrunk jersey knit.
