Many pieces are from the artist's own collection that have never before been exhibited. \r\n\r\nAlso displayed are several rarely-seen collaborative works with a range of distinguished artists: jewelers Robert Ebendorf and Marcia Macdonald, book artist Daniel Essig, paper artist & poet \r\nBetty Oliver, embroiderer Jane Nicholas, glassblower Sally Prasch \r\nand basketry pioneer Dorothy Gill Barnes. \r\n\r\nThe exhibition took place at Hervey Bay Regional Gallery on the beautiful Fraser Coast in Queensland in July 2010.\r\n\r\nAn atmospheric video takes you through the expansive space, showing intimate details of the work. This is followed by two talks presented during the opening: a thirty-minute address given by the artist on the gallery floor, and the official opening of the exhibition presented by internationally renowned Australian book artist Adele Outteridge.\r\n\r\nIncluded in the booklet is a powerful and poetic essay written by pre-eminent Sydney sculptor Michael Buzacott.\r\n\r\nFilm trailer can be viewed here:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpnZbZF5Wdw\r\n\r\n56 minutes\r\nDVD-R in slimline case","options":[{"id":28746827,"name":"Default","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":8.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90209798/-/wind1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90209798/-/wind1.jpg","width":1000,"height":999},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90209810/-/wind2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90209810/-/wind2.jpg","width":1000,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90209834/-/wind4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90209834/-/wind4.jpg","width":1000,"height":686}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4314656,"name":"DVD FILMS","permalink":"dvd-films","url":"/category/dvd-films"}]},{"id":9233834,"name":"Steel Wire - 20 gauge (.8mm)","permalink":"steel-wire-20-gauge-8mm","position":20,"price":6.99,"default_price":6.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/steel-wire-20-gauge-8mm","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-31T03:39:16.000Z","description":"20 gauge (.8mm) dark annealed steel wire\r\n\r\nAs maddeningly elusive in some areas as it is easy to find in others (in fact, this is the only place you're likely to find it in this gauge in Australia), this is the magic stuff I'm always crowing about...\r\n\r\nNon-galvanized, dead-soft steel wire that is a wonder to work with.

But the single doll that dominates my memory is the two foot tall Dr. Doolittle that spoke when a cord was pulled in his hip.  I played with him until he was in pieces, then kept playing with his disembodied head for a few years more.\r\n\r\nSince so much about the personal meaning of a doll is generated by a sense of character, I simply began with a face. Taking a wonderful spoon from the early 1800's and cutting features into its surface, the gruff but inquisitive little Spoonfed emerged and demanded the appropriate body. And some soup.\r\n\r\nAs a table object, he will be better placed rather low, so the viewer towers over him, giving his questioning stare added humor. His dripping spoon hovers over a soup bowl, as if he is pausing for permission to, as it were, eat his words.","options":[{"id":27626450,"name":"Default","price":2199.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":45.0,"amount_with_others":45.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":90.0,"amount_with_others":90.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86519882/-/spoonfed1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86519882/-/spoonfed1.jpg","width":805,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86519921/-/spoonfed2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86519921/-/spoonfed2.jpg","width":737,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86519945/-/spoonfed3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86519945/-/spoonfed3.jpg","width":1000,"height":721},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86519957/-/spoonfed4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86519957/-/spoonfed4.jpg","width":687,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86519969/-/spoonfed5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86519969/-/spoonfed5.jpg","width":1000,"height":702}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4314647,"name":"SCULPTURE / OBJECTS","permalink":"sculpture-objects","url":"/category/sculpture-objects"}]},{"id":10879671,"name":"Pair of Handmade Mobile Balance Wands","permalink":"pair-of-handmade-mobile-balance-wands","position":24,"price":39.99,"default_price":39.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pair-of-handmade-mobile-balance-wands","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-01T03:50:08.000Z","description":"Pair of Handmade Mobile Balance Wands\r\n\r\nWith handles individually hand-turned in beautiful Tasmanian oak, these two wands will rarely be out of your hands while creating a mobile or stabile construction.

Described as 'museums of dreams' by one critic, \r\nLo Bue's artwork conjures a world in which the Brothers Quay might sit in Joseph Cornell's lap reading Jules Verne.\r\n\r\nFramed as an imaginary play in six parts, Within and Without treats the tiny wearable sculpture as a developing narrative; each component part adds another piece to the evolving puzzle, and we watch with the artist as that 'plot' takes form chapter by chapter over the course of a week.  In Lo Bue's miniature realm the commonplace becomes the extraordinary as a ragtag cast of typewriter parts, accordion keys, chandelier crystals, centuries-old books and much more are transformed into a final object of wonder and beauty.  The film is suffused throughout with a mesmerizing score by New York's celebrated avant-garde composer Guy Klucevsek.\r\n\r\nAnyone with an interest in how things are made will find themselves drawn into the maze of surprises, setbacks and solutions that lead to the finished artwork.  \r\n\r\nCompletely unrehearsed, unscripted and documented in close-up detail, Within and Without is an intimate portrait of discovery and delight in the possibilities of the physical world, wedded with the limitless potential of the imagination!\r\n\r\nFilm trailer can be viewed here:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUTXsBlXTPI\r\n\r\n39 minutes\r\n\r\nNote for North American Orders: North American orders of this DVD are not eligible for a multi-item shipping discount, as it ships separately to other items.","options":[{"id":28746704,"name":"Default","price":44.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":14.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90209018/-/within_without1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90209018/-/within_without1.jpg","width":621,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90209030/-/within_without2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90209030/-/within_without2.jpg","width":897,"height":671},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90209042/-/within_without3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90209042/-/within_without3.jpg","width":1000,"height":744},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90209054/-/within_without4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90209054/-/within_without4.jpg","width":1000,"height":749},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90209066/-/within_without5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90209066/-/within_without5.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4314656,"name":"DVD FILMS","permalink":"dvd-films","url":"/category/dvd-films"}]},{"id":9235046,"name":"Miniature Linesman's Pliers","permalink":"miniature-linesman-s-pliers","position":37,"price":23.99,"default_price":23.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/miniature-linesman-s-pliers","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-31T04:55:29.000Z","description":"After my large round-nose pliers, this miniature version of the ubiquitous linesman's plier gets the most use in my studio!\r\n\r\nAble to grip steel, brass, nickel and bronze wire securely to squeeze, crimp and otherwise manipulate it to your bidding.

What makes it so great is that the snap-down cap ensures that you can store the sealant inside for years without it drying out (as long as you always replace the cap right after use!).\r\n\r\nIn the US, the brand of caulking I recommend ('DAP Kwik-Seal') comes in a large squeezeable tube, which can decant easily into this syringe\r\nand then top-up as necessary.\r\n\r\nThose in Australia have a harder time of finding the equivalent stuff - the only one sold in AU is 'Fuller Ultra-Clear', and it only comes in a\r\nfull-size caulking-gun tube, so it simply must be decanted into a syringe for use in artwork. And sadly, it seems to be getting harder to find, as Selley's pushes into more stores. So if you are outside the US and you're having trouble finding Fuller Ultra-Clear, you may choose to order a syringe that I've pre-filled with Fuller Ultra-Clear (found on this site).","options":[{"id":28904198,"name":"Default","price":7.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90749558/-/syringe.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90749558/-/syringe.jpg","width":1000,"height":449}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4314650,"name":"TOOLS","permalink":"tools","url":"/category/tools"},{"id":4513622,"name":"SUPPLIES","permalink":"supplies","url":"/category/supplies"}]},{"id":9232319,"name":"Perfect Wire Brush","permalink":"brass-brush","position":39,"price":7.99,"default_price":7.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/brass-brush","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-31T02:04:52.000Z","description":"A no-fuss, good quality brass-plated steel bristle soft brush that has the perfect hardness and spacing of bristle to clean and polish the steel wire I work with as well as scores of other metals.

What makes it so great is that the snap-down cap ensures that you can store the sealant inside for years without it drying out (as long as you always replace the cap right after use!).\r\n\r\nIn the US, the brand of caulking I recommend ('DAP Kwik-Seal') comes in a large squeezeable tube, which can decant easily into this syringe\r\nand then top-up as necessary. The empty syringe can be found for sale on this site.\r\n\r\nThose in Australia have a harder time of finding the equivalent glue - the only one sold in AU is 'Fuller Ultra-Clear', and it only comes in a\r\nfull-size caulking-gun tube, so it simply must be decanted into a syringe for use in artwork.
