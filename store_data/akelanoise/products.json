Self-released by the bands and distributed via Midsummer Records, there are no dedicated A- and B-sides on this split, no hierarchies or label politics. Just four new, passionate songs, recorded by two bands consisting of nine friends.\r\n\r\n/// Tracklist ///\r\n\r\n<strong>Akela</strong>\r\n01. Burt Cokain\r\n02.
