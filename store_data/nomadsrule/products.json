It is 8 to 9 foot length (depending on size ordered) of nylon paracord that's braided into a bracelet form—with a plastic encased, tungsten carbide coated wire saw woven into the braided cord.\r\n\r\nIn the emergency survival event that you had to use the cordage and/or wire saw, you simply unravel the bracelet. The Para-Saw™ paracord survival bracelet uses a quick release buckle to easily secure it on your wrist, or on your gear.\r\n\r\nNow you can have along two very handy survival tools, in one easy to travel package! Cordage for securing, lashing, or paring down for other uses and an effective wire saw to cut limbs, wood, or any number of things in a survival situation.\r\n\r\nIf you are the type that gets outdoors, be prepared. These are a must have!\r\n\r\nAvailable in two sizes/lengths and colors including desert camo, green, and black.","options":[{"id":41473413,"name":"OLIVE DRAB GREEN SMALL","price":29.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":41473416,"name":"OLIVE DRAB GREEN LARGE","price":29.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":41473419,"name":"DESERT CAMOUFLAGE SMALL","price":29.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":41473422,"name":"DESERT CAMOUFLAGE LARGE","price":29.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":41473425,"name":"BLACK SMALL","price":29.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":41473428,"name":"BLACK LARGE","price":29.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.99,"amount_with_others":1.99,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122864907/-/NOMAD-PRODUCTS-SURVIVAL-CRKTPARASAW.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122864907/-/NOMAD-PRODUCTS-SURVIVAL-CRKTPARASAW.jpg","width":835,"height":835}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6006360,"name":"Survival","permalink":"survival","url":"/category/survival"}]},{"id":12999558,"name":"NOMADS RULE [ORIGINAL] T-SHIRT","permalink":"nomads-rule-original-t-shirt","position":4,"price":29.99,"default_price":29.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nomads-rule-original-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-16T08:51:48.000Z","description":"A great T-Shirt for the range, the gym, or just an average day out.
