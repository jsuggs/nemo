But as it turns out, Flowers to Care are a wonderful gift for anyone, no matter where they live.\r\n\r\nHere's how it works. When you order Flowers to Care, Jaime designs a small arrangement using whatever is local, fresh and beautiful. She then sends you an email containing a link to a hidden web page where you can view and download a professionally shot digital photo of the flowers. (See an example <a href=\"http://www.themonkeyflowergroup.com/sampleftc.html\" target=\"0\">here</a>). This photo makes a great desktop image, print, and conversation starter, and can be shared freely for personal use with as many \"recipients\" as you like- simply forward along the email. The actual fresh flower arrangement is delivered to <a href=\"http://www.copefamilycenter.org\" target=\"0\">Cope Family Center</a> to be enjoyed by members of the community.\r\n\r\nIn addition to benefiting local flower growers and sharing the joy of flowers, the petite size and simplified delivery of Flowers to Care allow the Monkey Flower Group to offer them at a lower price point than is available through conventional delivery. It's just another reason why Flowers to Care make a wonderful gift for any occasion, no matter how big or small.
