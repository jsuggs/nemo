Part of a limited series run in 2010, these pop-art skate decks were created by Alien Workshop as part of their artist series and sold out immediately via the Alien Workshops website and select skateboard outlets.  \r\n\r\nSafely stored the deck remains still sealed in mint/new condition.  Even more impressive in person, these look incredible wall mounted or displayed.  The ultimate gift for any fan and a truly rare piece that will continue to grow in value.

Although this deck may not have the recognition in the collectors scene as of yet, this series is now officially over and all of the pieces have begun selling for substantial amounts of money\r\n\r\nWorking with a plethora of creative minds across the globe Mekanism Skateboards has built a name for itself as curators/creators of some of the most interesting decks out there. Delta, John Maeda, Invader, Peter Zimmermann, Warren Du Preez, Nick Thornton Jones and many more have taken the canvas and reinvented the visual. \r\n\r\nThe Mekanism Skatedeck Art Series emphasized skate decks as art.  The goal for each chosen artist was to create pieces that truly transcended the skateboard medium and create works that stood alone as serious pirces of artistic creation. The end results were truly remarkable and most all of the decks gained the attention of the international art collectors scene.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps most notable of the series was Invader's Rubiks Cube deck, one of the more highly valued and sought after pieces for the serious skateboard deck collector.  The rest were a line of successful and striking pieces all based on unique themes and reflecting the artists signature approach.  \r\n\r\nWhen finished, the series was universally applauded as successfully gaining the attention of art critics and artists alike, and started the trend very much alive today of traditional skateboard companies collaborating with high profile contemporary artists, one that Supreme Skateboards, Alien Workshop, and others have received much attention for by the mainstream media, especially when those skate decks begin attracting buyers on the secondary market commonly paying thousands for certain series.\r\n\r\nDesigned in 2006 by fashion photographer and mixed media artists Warren Du Preez & Nick Thornton, this limited series is reminsiscent of Ecsher and others from the modern abstract school.  From a very limited run of 20 that were signed by the artists, this deck is sure to be a great addition to the collection of the serious skateboard art collector, and while not in a style typically seen on many skateboard, it is a piece that stands alone as a piece of art.  Based on the small number of decks made and also based on how rare it is for artists from other mediums create original skateboard art, this deck is highly prized as part of our collection and is sure to appreciate in value and in recognition as the number of skateboard art collectors looking for original contemporary pieces has skyrocketed in the wake of the attention Supreme has gained for its decks released over the past few years.  With an extra deck in our collection, and given there are only 20, we felt it only right to share and offer a way for the serious collector to get for themselves a deck we had to search in the small cracks of Europe for, and of which there are few to no of these decks being sold on the open market.  Before these a purchased for good and retired to pemanent collections, we give you the Warren Du Preez and Nick Thornton Jones Mekanism Deck.  Enjoy and avoid staring at the design for too long, it can cause dissyness and mild hallucinations.

He runs a media outlet and record label and has published several books. Influenced by the growing underground punk rock scene of the mid-eighties, he is credited for solely reviving the art of the concert poster.\r\n\r\nIn his series of politically charged skateboard decks, Kozik takes aim at a group of world figures taken right of the height of the Western excess of the 1980s, with the companion deck to the Margaret Thatcher deck being Ronald Reagan. \r\n\r\nThe Sk8Room has this hand signed limited edition deck (out of a series of 100) valued at $500 (350 EUROS), an estimate that can be verified using the following link:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.thesk8room.com/products/skateboard-frank-kozik-margaret-tatcher#\r\n\r\nWith Thatcher's passing last week, the deck is certain to become the focus of more intensive efforts to round up the remaining available deck from this very limited hand-signed skateboard deck.  A collectable sure to impress even the most seasoned and well financed of collectors.  \r\n\r\nGiven our mission to end the prohibitive price increases seen on eBay, we always seek to offer our decks at a price below that of any verifiable estimates and below the average price we have noted from recent comparable eBay sales.  \r\n\r\nThe skateboard deck is in MINT condition and is still in shrink-wrap with a portion cut out so that Kozik could sign, number and date the signature. \r\n\r\nAs we want you to feel comfortable purchasing the board without being able to look at it in person, we guarantee its condition to the extent we accept returns of any deck we send you that does not meet your expectations or does not appear as it did in the picture.  \r\n\r\nThis is an issue we don't expect to ever occur, but an assurance we believe we owe our clients as we work to build our own brand and reputation in this area of the skateboard retail market. \r\n\r\nIf you purchase this deck before 4/15, we will include free of charge a Sk8tologu wall mounting kit.
