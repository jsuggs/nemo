When unraveled, parachute cord can be used for (but not limited to):\r\n\r\n- shoelaces\r\n- fishgill nets\r\n- fishing line\r\n- sewing (inner string)\r\n- clothesline\r\n- tooth floss\r\n- splints\r\n- tourniquet\r\n- binding\r\n\r\nThe possibilities are endless! Military grade 550 paracord is a Kernmantle rope known as Mil-C-5040 Type 3. It is made of nylon so that is dries quickly and is mildew resistant. It is 1/8 inch in diameter and is rated for 550 lbs.\r\n\r\nI can do 1 color or 2 colors, for any size wrist (perfect for sports teams!). I use plastic side release buckles that are curved for extra comfort. Please let me know which color(s) you would like as well as your wrist size when checking out. Thanks for looking!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/sHBhk.png\">Color List</a>\r\n\r\n****PLEASE NOTE: Please select \"Everywhere Else\" ONLY if you are within Wilmington, NC.

They are knit out of extremely soft superwash wool (that's wool you can toss in the washer, no handwashing here!). The yarn is hand-dyed and spun in Uruguay. I currently offer 6 different colors in one-size-fits-most. After placing your order, please let me know which color you would like according to the number on the picture (I should note that color #6 has WIDELY varying colorways, if you have any questions about it, please don't hesitate to request more pictures!!). Your handwarmers will arrive to you in 3 weeks (this allows for me to order the yarn, knit it up, and ship the finished product out to you). They are extremely warm and won't unravel and pill like department store knits. They'll keep your hands warm for years, through summer, autumn, winter, and spring!\r\n\r\nIf you have a custom color/idea in mind, please let me know and we'll see what we can work out.","options":[{"id":11805262,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/34150020/-/handwarmer.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/34150020/-/handwarmer.png","width":526,"height":526}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
