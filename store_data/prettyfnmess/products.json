but while artists were happily trading cards, the general public was left out in the cold, having no art cards to trade. a group of artists realized this, & quickly made their cards available for sale at remarkably low prices so that everyone could join in the fun! cards are sold either as originals or editions & are collectible.\r\n\r\npeace to you, thanks for looking!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://prettyfnmess.etsy.com\"><img src=\"http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz274/kindovermatter/visitetsy.jpg\"></a>","options":[{"id":4338661,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/10858901/-/carryaceo2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/10858901/-/carryaceo2.jpg","width":800,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
