Commercial advent calendars never seemed to meet all of our requirements so we made one ourselves.  For us, the Angel represents the true Christmas spirit and we love the option of filling the pockets with a variety of surprises that don’t always have to be a sweet treat.  Stickers, toys or a note to lead to a hidden surprise is always fun and of course, the occasional chocolate or lolly is always welcome.  Also, for families with multiple children the pockets can be filled with the required number of surprises.  No turn taking required, every day, everyone is involved in the countdown.  Your surprises are only limited by your imagination!
