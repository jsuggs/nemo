The prose-style is vivid and sensitive.” Christopher Rice, <em>Author, Los Angeles, CA</em></p>\r\n<p>“Not since I read The Perks of Being a Wallflower have I read a story about teenagers that allowed me to engage deeply and emotionally with the characters without censor, leaving me with a beautiful melancholy longing for more.”  -Kate Doherty, <em>Youth Minister, Oakland, CA</em></p>\r\n<p>“How are you sending me on this nostalgic trip!?!”  -Greta Genace, <em>Teacher, Jersey City, NJ</em></p>\r\n<p>“Excellent book!
