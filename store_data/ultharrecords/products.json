Musically, they have been compared to paragons of the genre such as Emperor, Mayhem, and Dissection; but Ninkharsag has their own unmistakable style which sets them apart from other contemporary bands and drags the classic 90's black metal sound into the 21st century.\r\n\t\r\nHaving played with the likes of Bal-Sagoth, Dark Fortress, Wodensthrone, Cauldron and Ancient Ascendant, Ninkharsag are already known for their incendiary live shows, and this first single displays the power that shall be summoned forth by their soon to be released debut album.\r\n\r\n1.
