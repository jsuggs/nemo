German painter-sculptor Markus Lupertz wanted to give an unusual gift to his friend Klaus, and he decided on Daddy Hemingway's idea to have the band Kamikaze Queens play with Hemingway singing, accompanied by pianist Rashidi Graffitti & the Queens. Daddy & Rashidi drove up from Berlin, while the Kamikaze Queens, finishing up a blitz tour, came straight from Rome! For Hemingway a new band-sound was born, flat-out rock & roll with a Black Blues edge! Also in the package was the Mistress Polly Pinkerton, coming out of a box onstage with almost nothing on, singing \"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\" - Klaus was wowed!\r\n\r\nThe next engagement was at 2 galas back-to-back in Berlin's penthouse-nightclub-in-the-sky, 40 SECONDS. There wasn't enough money to pay the girls so the band and Hemingway decided to go on as BLACK KAMIKAZE. \r\n\r\nNovember 4, 2008. US elections and the big Obama question: Will he or won't he? \r\n\r\nThe night we all waited for. Will he or won't he? And of course he DID. Black Kamikaze was there playing at the highest Wahlparty (Election Party) in the city, in the chic penthouse club 40 Seconds.\r\n\r\nChic to chic, Berlin's IN bar, Bar Tausend, called the BLACK KAMIKAZE into play once a month after that, a schedule they are still fulfilling. The tracks on this cd were all recorded in Bar Tausend, January 2010. All except one track, \"Breakin' Ma Heart\" which was recorded at Berlin's WHITE TRASH FAST FOOD Valentine's Day 2009.\r\n\r\nOccasionally Rashidi appears with the band, and also saxophonist Detroit Gary Wiggins, and sometimes Ms. Pinkerton dances suggestively, but the set personnel consists of Daddy Hemingway, vocals & kazoo; Tex Morton, guitar & vocals; Luscious Lloyd Clark, contrabass & vocals; Soren Birken, electrified mouth-harp; Nico Lippolis, drums & percussions.\r\n\r\nTheir last engagement was in Berlin at BAR TAUSEND, Schiffbauerdamm 11, Berlin-Mitte, July 1, 2010. Majda's going to California, and it was a going-away party. They danced all night to the rhumba-boogie of \"My Puerto Rican Girl\" and the country licks of \"The Dalai Lama Blues\", interlaced with Gene Vincent's \"Be Bop A Lula\" and \"Lets Twist Again\" - \"Jambalaya\" jumped out big-time!\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://myspace.com/blackkamikaze\r\nfacebook: black kamikaze\r\n","options":[{"id":9421759,"name":"Default","price":14.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25762399/-/Bildschirmfoto_2010-07-26_um_22.21.36.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25762399/-/Bildschirmfoto_2010-07-26_um_22.21.36.png","width":565,"height":561}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1597279,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
