Great riders including Bernard Hinault, Greg LeMond and Eddy Merckx all managed to attain this ultimate cycling accolade, here's our somewhat easier route to achieving it!\r\n\r\nTaken from our original illustration; this giclee art print depicts a rider wearing the rainbow jersey, which is worn by the World Road Race Champion, or 'Champion du Monde' as they say in France.\r\n\r\nThe great thing about this print is that you can customise it by making different choices from the following options: \r\n\r\n1. HAIR COLOUR\r\nBlonde, Brown, Dark Brown/Black, Grey or Ginger \r\n\r\n2. EYE COLOUR\r\nBlue, Brown, Brown/Black, Grey or Green \r\n\r\n3. BIKE COLOUR\r\nRed, Blue, Green, Yellow or Orange \r\n\r\n4. RACE NUMBER\r\nThis could be a favourite rider’s number, a lucky number, birthday, anniversary etc.\r\n \t\r\n5. TEXT\r\nYou can choose a name, name & surname or nickname, with or without the title: ‘Champion du Monde’ (see pictures for examples)\r\n\r\nThis print would make a unique personalised gift for a cycling mad friend, loved one, or of course as a treat for yourself!\r\n\r\nAll you have to do is take a look at the pictures, which include illustrated instructions along with some examples, then make your choices to create your unique personalised cycling print.\r\n\r\nWhen you’ve placed your order, simply click the ‘contact’ button at the top of the screen and email us with your five customised choices.\r\n\r\nYour finished design will be printed with pigment inks onto smooth, archival acid-free paper, creating a beautiful high quality art print.\r\n\r\nThis print measures 10 x 10 inches square (25.4 x 25.4 cm) and will fit any 10 x 10 inch frame which are readily available. It also looks great in a 12 x 12 inch frame with a mount/matt (not included) \r\n\r\nYour print will be carefully wrapped in acid-free tissue paper and packed in a sturdy cardboard tube, to ensure that when shipped it reaches you in tip top condition.\r\n\r\nSold unframed.\r\n\r\n© gumo 2013.
