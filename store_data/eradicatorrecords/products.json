Formed in 1977 by a cross-section of childhood friends and misfits, the Pirates culled inspiration from The Stooges, MC5, and the New York Dolls, as well as 60's garage and the Mothers Of Invention. Quirky and fearless, these guys made it up as they went along, quickly becoming Chicago’s go-to opening band for the Ramones (five times), the Undertones, and the Pretenders. True to punk credo, they lived hard and played harder, and within a few short years the rot set in and the group disbanded. Yet despite their influence in and on the Chicago punk scene, the legendary Midwestern pioneers of punk never managed to release an album until now. A new recording of \"Berlin\" proves that even three decades later, they can still rock the fuck out.

If Bradley from Almighty Do Me A Favor filled up a pair of Hasil Adkins’s boots with moonshine and drank ‘em both, decided to play a set one-handed, and someone recorded it with a Strawberry Shortcake tapedeck down the street, it’d sound pretty similar to this. It’s rough, to say the least—not even mentioning the fact that there are apparently three people in this band. To their credit, there’s a certain authenticity to this album as well—there seems to be very little posturing here. The recording’s in the red and bright as hell, and yes, they sound like the Cramps trying to do “Surfing Bird” with their hands glued to their pelvises, but I’ll freely admit they also sound like they’re having a fucking blast.\" –Kurt Morris (Razorcake)","options":[{"id":19327905,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59367311/-/1162401468-1too.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59367311/-/1162401468-1too.jpg","width":350,"height":350}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1597240,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"},{"id":2675335,"name":"Other Labels LPs","permalink":"other-labels-lps","url":"/category/other-labels-lps"},{"id":2675373,"name":"Other Labels Releases","permalink":"other-labels-releases","url":"/category/other-labels-releases"},{"id":2675451,"name":"garage","permalink":"garage","url":"/category/garage"},{"id":2675463,"name":"punk","permalink":"punk","url":"/category/punk"}]},{"id":5141609,"name":"The Normals \"Almost Ready\" 7\"","permalink":"the-normals-almost-ready-7","position":25,"price":5.75,"default_price":5.75,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-normals-almost-ready-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-12-27T08:07:37.000Z","description":"From the same label that released the incredible The Skinnies 7″(coming up don’t worry) and the not so great The Buns 7″.

This Rollerball was a pre-Elton Motello thing involving Alan Ward and Mike Butcher (Jet Staxx). Here's what Mike revealed... 'Rollerball was just a one off, with me on guitar, Alan on vocals and 2 studio assistants, Alex on bass and his brother Pascal on drums. Pascal also played the drums on the Jet Staxx singles. We never played a gig and I don't think we even got many radio plays.'\"Savage Eyes\" and B-side \"Lay You Down\", both Ward/Butcher compositions, were recorded late 1976 in their adopted home of Brussels, Belgium (the mecca of pseudo punk), with a production credited to Rollerball as a band. It seems that it was only released in Holland on CNR Records in the first half of 1977 with the Dutch copies also being distributed in Belgium.The B-side is a decent rock number with a few New York Dolls moves, but the real action is on the glorious glam/punk of \"Savage Eyes\". Considering who was behind this record and how great it is, it's a total mystery why it's remained unknown for over 30 years.

It was the surf issue if I recall correctly, and editor Greg Shaw, in the course of a pretty positive review, mentioned Clap's ability to mix up what seemed like a healthy late-sixties punk rock attitude with the prevailing hard rock winds of the early-seventies from whence this album came. The album was a charm with the hefty Rolling Stones influences so common of the day being reshaped by a strong Shadows of Knight snarl all filtered through an early seventies heavy metal consciousness giving us...a sound and style that although part and parcel to the stoner seventies mentality had a totally unique and refreshing approach that sounded as if it could stand on its own not only in 1972 but 1966 or even 1987 for that matter. It was teenage rock & roll that continued to sound so long after the entire teen mystique of the sixties and seventies shriveled away, yet it was hard enough for even the most experienced pothead at the supermarket to roll joints to during his coffee break. \r\n\r\nSo for you youngsters here's an example of what \"do it yourself\" rock used to mean when you pretty much had to create your own fun, energies, and lives even from scratch and for your oldsters, now's the time to drag out the boas, the mascara and the nylons and re-live the post-Vietnam era the right way. Of course if you get arrested don't come complain' to me, but then again wouldn't that only add to the overall glam/slam effect so common during those rather peculiar times? \r\n(Chris Stigliano). \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":16693593,"name":"Default","price":11.75,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50486685/-/sing029.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50486685/-/sing029.jpg","width":266,"height":266}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1597240,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"},{"id":2675335,"name":"Other Labels LPs","permalink":"other-labels-lps","url":"/category/other-labels-lps"},{"id":2675373,"name":"Other Labels Releases","permalink":"other-labels-releases","url":"/category/other-labels-releases"},{"id":2675451,"name":"garage","permalink":"garage","url":"/category/garage"},{"id":2675463,"name":"punk","permalink":"punk","url":"/category/punk"},{"id":2739829,"name":"Rock","permalink":"rock","url":"/category/rock"}]},{"id":5141491,"name":"Onion Dolls - The Kids 7\"","permalink":"onion-dolls-the-kids-7","position":44,"price":5.25,"default_price":5.25,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/onion-dolls-the-kids-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-12-27T07:16:30.000Z","description":"The Onion Dolls, a four piece punk band from Belgium managed to release this lone 45 before changing their name to Crossfire and fully embracing the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal movement that was sweeping Europe in the early 1980's.

A-side is atmospheric synth-pop perhaps somewhat similar to Mazzy Star or Lush. B-side is keyboard driven again, but this time more upbeat pop on this Daniel Johnston cover (I’ve never heard the original, but I can’t imagine it’s anywhere near as good as this). This woman can do no wrong.\" - Underground Medicine\r\n\r\n\"I just have been exploring all the offshoots of Jay Reatards career ever since it ended, including the Lost Sounds era that Alicja was a part of. Lost Sounds included a lot of electronics, and seemed to be both Jay's and Alicja's Metal Machine Music / Trans period, where you try to apply where you've been going as an artist to a completely different genre. Its exciting as an artist I'm sure, just to push those boundaries and not know what you're doing anymore. To be able to push through that period where you start to get disappointed as songs don't come as easy anymore. But that was the thing about Jay, he wasn't 19, and nothing he was about to do was a fluke...he had been playing around with all these styles and ended up where he was, and it was perfect. I couldn't wait to hear album after album. But these side projects and the Reatards are getting me to work backwards and hear what kinds of things led to Watch me Fall....Ah Fuck! Did you have to use that title!\r\n\r\nThe two of them, Alicja and Jay split guitar/vocals and synth and made real electronic-punk...I get all excited about SIDS and Black Bug and the Units, but here was this collaboration in my own backyard with the stuff I've been listening to practically and it took me this long to get there. There should be a rerelease of this....maybe Matador can put something together now.\r\n\r\nThis one sounded like it started out as a contribution to a children's album compilation and then there was a Daniel Johnston cover done for something else...and Certified PR would be damned if this never saw the light of day. It's a no brainer.\" - Jason (7 Inch Blogspot)\r\n\r\n\"If you haven’t listened to I’m Your Negative by the River City Tanlines at least 1,000 times, I highly encourage you to track down a copy and indulge in the brilliance that is that full-length. Within that album you are exposed to a vast array of tempos and variances of hostility. From the most seemingly mellow to the most completely unchecked, unhinged, borderline psychotic aggressiveness. Moral of the story; Alicja Trout (songsmith of the River City Tanlines and the 7” at hand) has this ability to write these incredibly diverse songs that ooze of passion and complexity while always being completely and undeniably hers. So when a 7” single comes through that’s Alicja Trout recording two nonchalant synthy slow jams, it’s very easy for me to exit my world of angry, hostile, prejudices against stuff of the sort, and enter her world of tried and true songwriting, hence, me enjoying these songs for what they are. And they are awesome. (Certified PR)\" –Daryl Gussin (Razorcake online)\r\n\r\n\"Alicja Trout has done \"pop\" before. To name off a bit of her musical background there's the Lost Sounds, Mouserocket and the River City Tanlines for starters. Sure, the \"pop\" elements may have been disguised in those projects from time to time but she's always known her way around writing something that sticks and really isn't that the basis of all good \"pop\" music anyway?\r\nOn this record the \"POP!\" on a side one's \"Shining Apple\" is 80's DIY pop such as the Young Marble Giants equipped with a better tape machine so they can layer some girl group harmonies while getting sidetracked by some motorik hypnotics.\r\nSome years ago I recall reading an interview with Daniel Johnston where he was asked what his influences were and how he would describe his music to someone who may not have heard it before. His reply mentions some a contemporary bands at the time as well as him discussing his love for the Beach Boys. One thing I've learned by knowing quite a few real deal outsider musician's like him is that in their heads that is what they hear but it usually takes someone else to cover a song wrote by them to bring those kind of sounds to the forefront. Here, on the b-side's cover of Johnston's \"Walking The Cow\", Alicja brings them out with a 60's sunshine feel rubbing shoulders with melodic beep-beep-boop synth bits.\" - Dale Merrill (Smashing Transistors)\r\n\r\n\"Truth in advertising, this is Alicja Trout (River City Tanlines, Mouserocket, Lost Sounds) playing straight-up, ‘60s-inspired pop by way of Oranges and Lemons XTC with gentle keyboard caresses. One original, one Daniel Johnston cover. It’s extremely pretty, full of innocence, and very far afield from what I normally listen to… but goddamn it if Alicja Trout can’t hold my hand far into a scary land that I’m fearful of—”indie rock I don’t understand made by members of once-frenetic punk bands”—and show me something, well, something that’s beautiful.\" –Todd Taylor (Razorcake)\r\n\r\n\"I was very excited when I saw this. (No, I was not that excited.) Given the spelling of ALICJA and the fact that this is from Memphis, this is clearly Alicja of River City Tanlines fame. I love me some River City Tanlines! Others probably know her from the The Lost Sounds. This is very mellow, pretty, quiet, synth-driven pop music that showcases her voice. The only thing that it has in common with her River City Tanlines stuff is that both are extremely catchy. It reminds me of the great pop band From Bubblegum To Sky. Great record.\" - Kenny Kaos (Maximum Rock N Roll)\r\n\r\n\"Any Alicja Trout record is instantly welcome in my home.\r\nShe's made a ton of them and I like 'em all. This one offers up sweet homemade synth-pop. It hearkens back to The Clears, Trout's band back in the late 90s. The spare, twinkly A-side lets nothing get in the way of its pretty melody. On the flip, she covers one of the best pop songs of all-time, Daniel Johnston's \"Walking the Cow\". Nobody can top Johnston's own version, but Trout's take has plenty of charm riding along its bouncy new wave/power pop arrangement.\" - Jason Hernandez\r\n\r\n\"So here’s something for the Dr. Spock parental set out there. Rumor has it Alicja Trout was set to work on a children’s album, and this is what came of it. Being a new mom, I assume she’s been pretty busy. But 2010 is the year she comes up out of the diaper trenches and starts to do some record releasing and touring again. Welcome back! As for the A-Pop recordings, it’s what they is: sweet and catchy tunes that shimmer about like rnr lullabies. I’m getting an Oly-vibe off of it for some reason. Imagine if Mouserocket or Lost Sounds had to perform for a day care back in 2002. This is possibly what would come forth. Synth and indie goodness for the wholesome youth. The B-Side is Daniel Johnston’s’ Walking The Cow…faithful? Probably better. Amped up a little bit over the A-side for maximum playpen/tire swing enjoyment. Maybe I’m getting soft & old, but this is CUTE. I said it. And I don’t even like kids. Well, most kids. A friend of mine dresses his two year old in Misfits onesies…she’s pretty rad. Same goes for Stella Hayes (Daughter of Tim: Fallout Records). She has a finger painting series based on Cramps songs. That’s so cool. And with a mom like Alicja, I bet a fiery little red head named Valentine is gonna’ be A-OK as well. Pick one up while yer shopping for Yo Gabba Gabba DVD’s.\" - Terminal Boredom\r\n\r\nKind Turkey \"Best Tracks of 2010\": Alicja Pop! \"Walking The Cow\".\r\n\"Obvious choice here cuz it rules.

That record was a loud & brash mash of Brian Jones era Stones worship, Back From The Grave digging and punk rock taking a psychedelic trip. The songs were jammed with abandon and teenage frustration. Hell, at the time they recorded it I believe a couple of them were still in high school. HOW COULD IT NOT BE FUELED WITH ABANDON TEENAGE FRUSTRATION?!?! That is, of course, what rock-n-roll is suppose to be all about, right? At the time we thought \"They've really done their homework on how to do it RIGHT. Give them some time to develop at little more and they'll be the successors to the Black Lips crown\" or something like that. After all, the Black Lips guys are all over 25 years old now. Heh! Over the hill. Who will be the hope for real ROCK-n-ROLL next young kings until the backlash starts and so on.\r\nOn these more recent recordings by the brothers Szegedy and brothers Young and other than both bands playing 60's tinged slop and jangle, the Black Lips references go out the window because these guys got their own thing going on.\r\n\"You Don't Know\" has the sound of surf music gone to hit some waves in some sinister part of outerspace all lead by a Rob Tyner pushing the vocals into red testimonial. \"Shoot Her Down\" is loaded with wailing harp and dirt floor stomp. It's kinda like a tune everyone would like to hear Iggy Pop do for the last 35 years but know he probably wont. The flip is the total bad ass \"Raft\" where the band shows what they're excelling a super fast clip at. Psychedelic blues bliss all the way through. Guitar lines slither between the serpentine and Spacemen 3 swooshes & splatter while the vocals trade off with all of them sounding like a Saturday night sermon.\" - Smashin' Transistors\r\n\r\n\"Their debut single on MNH showed some promise that I think People's Temple are realizing on their sophomore effort. Title cut is pretty blistering, Sixties moves that hit equally on the punk and psych tips, with a surfy break even. Excellent spaceman guitar action with a hippies-gone-bad feel, and a killer rave-up part with some great echoplex and panned vox parts as well. A truly great song and a weird trip, it makes you wish the Black Lips were still writing 'em this good. \"Shoot Her Down\" is a decent Brimstone Howl-ish rooter to fill the side. \"Raft\" fills up the flip with a side-long heavy garage-rock jammer ... A step forward from the last record, they're heading in the right direction it seems and the title cut of this one is real keeper that stands up to repeat listens... I'm gonna stay tuned, I think they could be on to something ...\" - Terminal Boredom\r\n\r\n\"First of all, let me tell how sore my butthole is after taking quite the pounding from my boyfriend earlier today. Oops - that was a little off subject... Where were we?\r\nOh yes, The lastest, greatest record by The People's Temple!!!!\r\nI feel if you have a name that references Jim Jones, you better “bring it like a tranny, sister.”\r\nThese strapping gents are packing the heat and are settting the world on fire with this record! It’s mind altering garage rock with surf guitars.\r\nThe title track is the best of the three, but they all slay, brother!!!\r\n It’s fast and hyper, but not a mess of noise.\r\nThey have the sound wired and deliver the stuff that warrants repeated listens.\" –Matthew \"Slightly Less Than\" Average (Razorflake)\r\n\r\n\"Two sets of brothers sounds like double the fun right? I didn’t think so. So right off the bat I’ve gotta give The People’s Temple props for staying together for 3+ years. But then I’ve gotta take it right back for un-Google-friendly band name (an homage no doubt to BJM, itself an homage to the Stones). Their name isn’t the end of the tribute; “You Don’t Know” is a direct reference to said influences. Fortunately this double duo knows better than to be blatant rip-offs, so they take that 60s psychedelic sound and blast it right into space. The title track off of their Certified PR 7” is blown out to the max. And they really manage to pull it off, the surfy guitar riffs stay prominent despite the uber-fuzz and the chant vocals are simple enough to withstand the heavy distortion. This is shit-fi that you can actually listen to without losing that 60s sound and managing to remind me of new garage akin to Moonhearts and Melted-era Ty Segall. We all know life in Michigan ain’t easy and TPT is working to keep the Lansing sound alive. But when the blessed light of HoZac shines upon you it does little to keep your ego in the same realm as your humble roots. C’mon guys, if your best piece of press is siphoned from an L.A. Times review of the Woven Bones LP it might be time to update the ole’ Wikipedia page (shudder). And if you manage to make it to a show be forewarned: these guys might come off like punk rock protégé, but please keep your beers at a safe distance from their very expensive gear.\" - Britta Hussy (Kind Turkey)\r\n\r\n\"We have a winner! Title song starts off fast enough that I thought 45 must be the wrong speed, then a quick taste of Link Wray/Dick Dale riffing before lurching into a song that recalls the 13th Floor Elevators' \"You Don't Know (How Young You Are)\" in the classic\r\nkids-who-don't-care rewrite fashion.\r\nPlus it sounds like the Traditional Fools with some weird guitar sounds and has a nice freak-out at the end. \"Shhot Her Down\" is a nice shot of garagey R&B and \"Raft\" is another dip in the garagey end of the psychedelia pool.\" - Dr. Dante (Maximum Rock 'n Roll)","options":[{"id":15339613,"name":"Default","price":4.5,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/45886969/-/pt_mailorder.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/45886969/-/pt_mailorder.jpg","width":200,"height":200}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1597239,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":2675337,"name":"Other Label 45's","permalink":"other-label-45-s","url":"/category/other-label-45-s"},{"id":2675373,"name":"Other Labels Releases","permalink":"other-labels-releases","url":"/category/other-labels-releases"},{"id":2675451,"name":"garage","permalink":"garage","url":"/category/garage"}]},{"id":4682727,"name":"Brimstone Howl - Hell Shovel \"split\" 7\"","permalink":"brimstone-howl-hell-shovel-split-7","position":56,"price":4.5,"default_price":4.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/brimstone-howl-hell-shovel-split-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-10-21T23:34:41.000Z","description":"\"I’m a big Jeff Clarke fan; best known for fronting The Demon’s Claws.

Joel Kopp sits as ...their drummer and is a monster live. The A-Side opener, “Tiger Don’t Change Its Stripes” has a multitude of great guitar solos. It’s a guitar players dream, complete with some jagged chord changes, a breakdown and dual vocals that shine. The guitar playing is impeccable (and it’s not just straight chordin’ yo!). I like how it sorta gets heavy after the choruses, but it doesn’t really stay in that territory too long. “Good Tyme Johnny” is more of a 50’s tune with some great keyboard lines and funky drum rhythms. It’s more rollicking than punk. Those keyboard lines are pure ’65 Paul McCartney piano. EXCELLENT. Sorta like “Lady Madonna” and “Hey Bulldog” mixed together in a vat of Pabst and high grade Mescaline. It’s a quick burn and is over before you notice.\r\n\r\n“Truthin’” is more 50’s love like the A-Side closer. Really good track worth being an A-Side in and of itself. Probably why it ended up starting off the B-Side. Stock riff, but steps it up with really classy dual vocal delivery. “Kiss You” starts really menacing, then kicks in with another great glam riff upswing. Drums space it out nicely with pertinent and completely on fills. Ryan’s vocals are a bit harsher than Wendy’s, and they definitely fit in with the more punky/attacky approach of “Kiss You”. It’s still sweet and poppy, but it’s definitely more blasting and in your face. Overall Ramma Lamma’s debut 7” is a nice EP with some great art touches. First off, the mixed vinyl is a plus…but the real piece of art is the great sleeve art designed by the one and only Ben Lyon! It’s hot!

This is straight-up driving rock 'n roll, sort of like Flamingo-era Flamin' Groovies with a bit more of a bubble-glam edge. Norton and King have been behind a ton of entertaining bands over the past decade-plus (and many 7-inches), and they're not slowing down; Ramma Lamma already has another single just out on FDH Records which I haven't tracked down yet.\" - Bob Koch (The Daily Page)\r\n\r\n\"The pic sleeve for this record fits just perfectly, with the cartoons giving it a Hanna-Barbera feel.

Catchy and mind-bending, Two Tears' new single features 3 cuts of garage glory. Howling vocals and great production that's sure to appeal to all sorts of chums rounds it out nicely.

Taking note from their peers (Midwest Beat, Goodnight Loving, Jaill, etc.), Trent Fox honed their skills in the seedy basement scene of Riverwest. Shit, Trent Fox even runs one of the longest-standing and most beloved basement venue of the neighborhood, The Vault. Kind Turkey favorites like Black Time, Bare Wires, Nobunny, Wax Museums, and plenty more have bashed brains in at the Vault. Trent Fox's brand of garage-punk-twang is definitely a fresh breath of air in a constantly evolving scene. This new EP features 5 tracks of instantly catchy garage/punk/rock n roll anthems. Songs about drinking, fights, girls, tomfoolery, drinking, Mario 3, old ladies and working class life in Milwaukee. Required listening for anyone who spends their summers drinking beer and soaking up the sun on their porch right after the Winter frost has thawed. This will make you bump 'n boogie.\r\n\r\n500 copies - First 100 on color vinyl - All copies hand-numbered. Screen printed art by Zabby of Big Action Records.

Gun Club, The Saints, Jon Spencer, ‘68 Comeback, Rolling Stones, Lightnin Hopkins, James Brown and The Scientists were certainly records strewn amongst the floor right  next to their balled up home made T Shirts emblazoned with the words: REATARDS, SPACESHITS, REGNING SOUND and GORIES written in faded black magic marker.  On ‘Magnetic Problems’ the FORBIDDEN TIGERS bash out 12 tracks with precise, acuracy all the while sounding pretty care free and unrehearsed.  ‘Son Of A Carnivore’ and ‘Forbidden Tigers’ certainly stand out as two tracks that aim to maim.  They completely nail the fast n hard approach and the mid-fi recording perfectly accentuates the fierce, decimating, guitar tones.  The rhythm track alone on ‘Forbidden Tigers’ is pure perfection and brings to mind an early GG pickin away in the basement with a cig hangin off his lip and a spilled bottle of Jim Bean on the floor.  Just pure reckless, care free rock n roll that grabs your ear drums and doesn’t let go.  But the entire album isn’t a whirl-wind of noise, feedback and distortion.  The majority of ‘Magnetic Problems’ contains a pleasant mish-mash of mid tempo, blues amped, rock n ravers all tied together with the loose, raspy baritone howl of what sounds like the ghost of Jeffrey Lee Pierce.   From the Black Lips gone country twang of ‘Can of Beans’ to the neo primativee Gories clatter of ‘Magnetic Problems’, they cover alot of ground on their debut and certainly strum, pluck, beat and scream like the best of their mentors.  It’s nice to see such a young new band write a solid album and not fall into the standard new band, riff-rip trappings of most bands their age.

These songs scream about lousy jobs, barely having enough money to make your mortgage payments, paying for prescriptions, having the electricity shut off when you can’t pay the bill etc. On this album, instead of going for any sort of slick sound, things sound rougher. Especially with the vocals. To my ears they sound cruder and that’s meant in the most positive sense of the word since it really enhances Gabby’s larynx-shredding utterings. There’s an abundance of go-for-the-throat thrash and other climactic elements as well. The circle-pit inducing breakdown of \"Another Wave\" is one such moment. So is the stop/start thrash of \"It’s Always Darkest After Shutoff,\" interspersing guitar and bass atonalities, if that’s the right term. Everything comes to a screeching halt for the final cut, \"A Bird In The Hand Means You’ve Been Dead For A Few Days\" and it’s a slower, desperate-droning song, building up and then slowing down as the guitars mimic the sound of something/someone barely clinging to life before it abruptly ends. Think of the album as a cautionary tale and, as Black Flag sang on \"Depression\" all those years ago, \"they say things are gonna get better—all I know is THEY BETTER.\" ‘Swallowed By The World’ may not make you feel better but it’s still some damned good scream therapy.\"","options":[{"id":9419904,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":22.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25752263/-/bill.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25752263/-/bill.gif","width":175,"height":175}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1597240,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"},{"id":2675335,"name":"Other Labels LPs","permalink":"other-labels-lps","url":"/category/other-labels-lps"},{"id":2675373,"name":"Other Labels Releases","permalink":"other-labels-releases","url":"/category/other-labels-releases"},{"id":2700123,"name":"hardcore punk","permalink":"hardcore-punk","url":"/category/hardcore-punk"}]}]
