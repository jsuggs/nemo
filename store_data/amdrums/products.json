Our experience and expertise promise you a unique and special musical instrument of the finest quality, which many find to be the perfect alternative to a hang drum from Panart.\r\n\r\nMaking AM Drums is an art, with our main focus on the quality of sound and tuning, which we believe to be most important, as this is what gives them the soothing, magical sound, which has been likened to Tibetan bowls (or to the Swiss hang or idiopan instrument). \r\n\r\nAM Drums can be tuned to any musical scale. Here are some example scales which we use to tune our hank drums:\r\n\r\nOriental - C D F A A# C D F\r\n\r\nAke Bono (Japanese) - G, C, D, Eb, G, Ab, C, D\r\n\r\nBanshiki cho (Japanese) -: F C D# F G# A# C D# F\r\n\r\nPentatonic C Major - G, C, D, E, G, A, C, D\r\n\r\nPentatonic G Minor - G Bb C D F G Bb C\r\n\r\nPygmy - G C D D# G A# C D D#\r\n\r\nRaga Vutari - C E F# G A Bb C\r\n\r\nRock 'n Roll - C D# E F G A Bb C\r\n\r\nAM Drums can also be painted in the colour of your choice (according to their usual design) at no extra cost, with your slit drum ready for dispatch in 2 weeks. \r\n\r\nListen to AM Drums on Youtube:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/AMRDRUMS\r\n\r\n'Like' us on Facebook:\r\nwww.facebook.com/pages/AM-Drums/168619476501078\r\n\r\nVisit our website:\r\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/amrustic \r\n\r\nFor more information, questions or just to say hi, email: amdrums@live.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*We do not take any responsibility for taxes/customs duties to be charged in your country.

Please note - this drum is made to order and therefore will be delivered after Christmas.\r\n\r\nHere you can order an AM Drum tuned to the Chakra scale, in the frequency of 432Hz.\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/f99zpn-ojTU\r\n\r\nThe Chakra AM Drum is made to order, so please see below for delivery details.\r\n\r\nChakras, in Hindu and Buddhist belief systems, are centres of Prāṇa, life force, or vital energy.  Chakras correspond to vital points in the physical body i.e. major plexuses of arteries, veins and nerves.\r\n\r\nWeak Chakras can cause problems in all areas of your life, so it is beneficial to try to energize these centres. Alongside meditation, music therapy can also be used to awaken the Chakras, as they have been found to be stimulated by particular sound frequencies.\r\n\r\nA steel tongue drum, tuned to the right musical frequencies, would be the perfect companion to meditation for awakening the Chakras.\r\n\r\nAM Drums make a special Chakra drum for this purpose. Please see link to Youtube to listen, and to see the paintwork/design.\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/f99zpn-ojTU\r\n\r\nVisit our website and buy online:\r\n\r\nwww.amsteeltonguedrums.com\r\n\r\nFor more information, questions or just to say hi, email: amdrums@live.com\r\n\r\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \r\n\r\nCertain musical notes are often associated with individual Chakras of the human body. While there are in excess of 300 Chakras, these are the notes (and colours) believed to awaken the first 7 Chakras:\r\n\r\n.  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n\r\nRoot chakra - Muladhara - Represents our foundation and feeling of being grounded.\r\n\r\nRed - note C\r\n\r\n.  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n\r\nSacral chakra - Swadhisthana - Our connection and ability to accept others and new experiences.\r\n\r\nOrange - note D\r\n\r\n.  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n\r\nSolar plexus chakra - Manipura / Nabhi - Our ability to be confident and in-control of our lives.\r\n\r\nYellow - note E\r\n\r\n.  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n\r\nHeart chakra - Anahata - Our ability to love.\r\n\r\nGreen - note F\r\n\r\n.  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n\r\nThroat chakra - Vishuddha - Our ability to communicate.\r\n\r\nBlue - notes G\r\n\r\n.  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n\r\nThird eye chakra - Ajna - Our ability to focus on and see the big picture.\r\n\r\nIndigo - note A\r\n\r\n.  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n\r\nCrown chakra - Sahasrara - Represents our ability to be fully connected spiritually.\r\n\r\nViolet - note B\r\n\r\n.  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n\r\nSeat of the Soul - also know as the Soul Star - the 8th Chakra - a hand width above the head, the point where spiritual energy... and Divine love, enters the body.\r\n\r\nWhite - Note C (an octave higher than the first C).\r\n\r\n.  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n\r\nWe recommend an AM Drum in the Chakra scale for meditation, healing, personal awakening, spiritual transformation etc... But we also find that everyone is different, and maybe another music scale could also help with these things. \r\n\r\nIts best to choose a scale that speaks to you, that you feel reflects your soul.\r\n\r\nAM Drums can be tuned to any musical scale. Here are some example scales which we use to tune AM Drums:\r\n\r\nOriental -  C D F A A# C D F\r\n\r\nAke Bono (Japanese) - G, C, D, Eb, G, Ab, C, D\r\n\r\nBanshiki cho (Japanese) -: F C D# F  G# A# C  D# F\r\n\r\nPentatonic C Major - G, C, D, E, G, A, C, D\r\n\r\nPentatonic G Minor - G Bb C D F G Bb C\r\n\r\nPygmy -  G C D D# G  A# C  D  D#\r\n\r\nRaga Vutari - C E F# G A Bb C\r\n\r\nRock 'n Roll - C D# E F G A Bb C\r\n\r\nAM Drums can also be painted in the colour of your choice (according to their usual design) at no extra cost, with your AM Drum ready for dispatch in less than one week. \r\n\r\nAvailable to buy online.\r\n\r\nListen to AM Drums on Youtube:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/AMRDRUMS\r\n\r\n'Like' us on Facebook:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/AM-Drums/168619476501078\r\n\r\nVisit our website and buy online:\r\n\r\nwww.amsteeltonguedrums.com\r\n\r\nFor more information, questions or just to say hi, email: amdrums@live.com\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis drum is made to order.
