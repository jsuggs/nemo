Together they played locally and recorded this one release on Keith&#8217;s own label, Keiper records.  Over the years this local Chicago release has found its way into the hands of Dj&#8217;s and collectors worldwide. The B side of the record, &#8220;Ooh Baby&#8221;, with it&#8217;s superior drum mix &#38; haunting vocal, has over the years been established as a top billing dance jam the world over.\r\n\r\n\t<span class=\"caps\">JEWEL</span> was established a couple of years after Pamoja folded with Keith&#8217;s close friend Oliver Miller.  The two assembled a group and recorded &#8220;Paradise&#8221; in an attempt to capitalize on the new sound of Earth Wind &#38; Fire.  The record was released in small quantity on the band&#8217;s own label, Jewel Star.  After releasing this record local impresario Jim Porter discovered the band and quickly signed them to his own Erect Records (also home of <span class=\"caps\">IND</span>, Wrecking Crew, &#38; Alexander O&#8217;neal).  It was on this label the team released a full LP (Cut &#8216;n&#8217; Polised) &#38; and 12&#8221; disco single for the band&#8217;s theme song, &#8220;Jewel&#8217;s Groove&#8221;.
