The large rings have successfully been used with a gathered shoulder, and are preferred for double-layered slings of nearly any material, as well as thicker wraps that are turned into slings.\r\n\r\nMedium Size\r\nInner diameter: 2.5\" Outer diameter: 3\" If you are using a medium weight fabric, in widths of 26 \"-30\", you might be more comfortable with the medium size rings. This is also true if you are planning on making an open tail sling, or are using a pattern that yields a narrower shoulder. In general, the medium size rings will give you a sling that is secure, but may not be as easy to adjust as the large rings if your fabric is on the thicker side. Many people prefer medium rings when making a single-layer dupioni or shantung silk sling, especially if it will be machine-washed.\r\n\r\nSmall Size\r\nInner diameter: 2\" Outer diameter: 2.5\" Our small rings are best used with light weight and/or very smooth fabrics. They are well-suited to closed tail slings. If you plan to make your sling very narrow (22\"-26\"), you might also want the small rings. The small rings tend to be very secure, though not as easy to adjust as the larger rings.

Beautiful, subtle gradation of colours from black to orange, with purple, pink, yellow and cream in between. \r\n\r\nAvailable in creme and purple weft - the purple weft version has a darker, more dramatic hue.\r\n\r\nOnly pure untreated cotton that has neither been pre-bleached nor chemically finished is used for Girasol woven wraps. There is no use of formaldehyde, halogen-organic compounds, aromatic amines or brighteners. And their fabrics are not treated subsequently with chemicals or finishes. \r\n\r\nGirasol's select weavers are masters of a very difficult and ancient skill: diagonal weaving. A high-quality baby carrier produced with this method of weaving will always adapt elastically and never stretch out of shape. The hems have been doubled to prevent the edges from causing any unpleasant pressure. \r\n\r\nAll Girasol fabrics may be washed in the machine at 60°C . Baby carriers and slings shrink a little after the first wash – the lengths stated refer to the lengths after washing.
