Bill Anderson plays ud, and wind instruments including, ney, kaval and tin whistle. Greta Kelly plays violin and kemanche (a spikefiddle with Persian/Turkish origins). Miranda Deutsch, on guitar, plays with a manouche flavour. Steven Cuttriss is on the accordion, and percussionist Jordan Stamos plays darabuka and bendir.\r\n\r\nMzaza’s first record “Parliament Of The Birds” showcases the band’s versatility and guarantees to transport you to faraway places.\r\n\r\n\"Each track displays such a high level of musicianship [...] I was particularly impressed by Pauline's easy vocal style which belies her level of skill and technique and astounded by her capability to sing in such a range of languages.  I have rarely heard such diversity and versatility in a World \"Fusion\" band.  Mzaza's driving rhythms and haunting melodic lines made me yearn for exotic places and adventures.\" Lonnie Martin, The Folk Rag, May 2009 Issue.","options":[{"id":1195508,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.24,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2160952/-/mzazapromoshot_flat_small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2160952/-/mzazapromoshot_flat_small.jpg","width":708,"height":708}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":244032,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
