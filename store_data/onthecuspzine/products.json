Some people call this twilight. But I’ve always thought of it as 'the magic hour.' When anything can happen, everything is golden, and I am a boy again. That is the place these poems occupy.\r\n\r\nJake Hurley’s photographs stunningly accentuate and are accentuated by the poems in this book. He is able to capture the magic in the ground, opening it for the sky to rest. Rustic, strange, and beautiful. These pictures will leave you warm, I have no doubt.\r\n\r\nIn this book you will find stars, you will find birds, you will find hearts, you will find a boyhood doing its best to stay present, and I hope, goodness gracious, you find a little magic.\"\r\n\r\n50 pages\r\nfull color\r\n5.5x8.5\r\n80# full-bleed, glossy cover\r\nhand-sewn binding\r\n\r\nWe are ridiculously proud to publish this collection.
