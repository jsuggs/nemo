Since we put out the full-length \"Out of Earshot\" LP in 2010, Rocket Heart Records been itching to do a 7-inch with the band. When they went into Art House Studios to record \"She Laughed a Little,\" we knew we had the perfect single. It's full of the upbeat, hooky rock that The Dead Girls are known for, and is guaranteed to get stuck in your head all day.\r\n\r\nThe B-side, \"It's All Happening,\" is a treat as well. It's a one-off song written and recorded in four hours when Motion City Soundtrack singer/guitarist Justin Pierre came into town for a day. The Dead Girls then called up former Blackpool Lights/Creature Comforts/Ultimate Fakebook multi-instrumentalist J.D. Warnock to create a three-vocal/four guitar/six-man wall of sound. The epic super-catchy thumper of a song has since been remixed and remastered exclusively for this release. Simply put, it rocks.\r\n\r\nLimited pressing of 500 records divided into 400 black and 100 red/black swirl. Includes a digital download of the EP, plus 2 bonus tracks!\r\n\r\nTrack List:\r\n\r\n01. She Laughed A Little\r\n02.
