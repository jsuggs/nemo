Thankfully, those four guys happen to be established punk legends. \r\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen, Kung Fu Records is proud to present Hollywood Potato Chip. By bringing in a few heavy-hitters to the cause, namely Jerry Finn (AFI, Blink-182, Alkaline Trio and 100 others) who mixed the album, makes Hollywood Potato Chip an exceptional album among a history of exceptional albums. Keeping in the tradition of fast-tempo melodies and numerous inside jokes, The Vandals remain one of the last bastions of punk rock that can be fun without compromising musicality and performance ability. As an ode to the shady industry in which many people strive to be a part of, The Vandals have created an album that pays tribute to the darker side of Hollywood, where naive and starry-eyed transplants are put through the twisted ringer of head shots and casting calls, and once the energetic drive is over, all that is left behind are remnants of a once-powerful Producer and a filthy couch on the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nWhere were we?

Selwyn Hills (Fitzgerald) is a down-and-out guy with a special gift for baking cakes in the shapes of female body parts. While his skills are evident to anyone who's seen his creations, Selwyn doesn't get much credit around town. In fact, everyone picks on him-- especially his abusive girlfriend. When circumstances require Selwyn to skip town, he joins the punk band No Use For A Name and embarks on a journey of roadie hell. Working for the band is barely an improvement over the life he left behind, but things start looking up when Selwyn meets an attractive young woman in a wheel chair. This new relationship and his experience on the road give Selwyn the confidence to enter the ultimate baking competition in which he competes against a masterful French baker. \r\n\r\nEscalante approached making this film from a do-it-yourself standpoint, shooting on 16mm and 35mm film on nights and weekends without a crew. He went on to edit the film himself, completing the entire project for under $30,000. \r\n\r\nCAKE BOY (formerly entitled SELWYN'S NUTS) includes a  separate CD punk rock soundtrack and a cameo by Bob Odenkirk of MR. SHOW. Featured bands include No Use For A Name, The Vandals, Ozma, Hunter Revenge, Jackson, Audio Karate, Useless ID, and Piebald.\r\n\r\nWritten by Warren Fitzgerald \r\nDirected by Joe Escalante  \r\n\r\nDVD Features:\r\nNumber of Discs: 2\r\nRated: Unrated\r\nRun Time: 1 hours, 30 minutes\r\nVideo: Color\r\nEncoding: Region 0 (Worldwide)\r\nOriginally Released: 2005\r\nLabel: Kung Fu Records\r\nAspect Ratio: Full Frame - 1.33\r\nAudio:English\r\nSubtitles - English - Optional\r\nSubtitles - Japanese - Optional\r\n\r\nAdditional Release Material:\r\nDeleted Scenes\r\nAudio Commentary: Joe Escalante and Warren Fitzgerald - Director, Star/Writer\r\nFeaturette: MAKING OF CAKE BOY\r\nMusic Video: THIS AIN'T NO WAY TO LIVE","options":[{"id":26063919,"name":"Default","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81323181/-/cakeboy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81323181/-/cakeboy.jpg","width":314,"height":447}],"artists":[{"id":156855,"name":"Kung Fu Records","permalink":"kung-fu-records","url":"/artist/kung-fu-records"}],"categories":[{"id":4110753,"name":"DVD","permalink":"dvd","url":"/category/dvd"}]},{"id":8271792,"name":"\"THAT DARN PUNK\" DVD A Feature Film by Jeff Richardson","permalink":"that-darn-punk-dvd-a-feature-film-by-jeff-richardson","position":31,"price":11.0,"default_price":11.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/that-darn-punk-dvd-a-feature-film-by-jeff-richardson","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-29T09:53:00.000Z","description":"That Darn Punk is the first feature from the film production leg of Kung-Fu Records.
