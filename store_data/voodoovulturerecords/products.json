The band has toured South Africa intensely as well as being seen at many festivals such as Woodstock and Ramfest. The bandâ€™s aggressively melodic sound is a result of the elegant combination of elements drawn from a range of different genres, the main ones being death metal and hardcore.\r\n \r\nThe mixture of the two, along with other sub genre elements, results in a melodic but brutal sound that is aggressively delivered with a fervent energy. Melodically based guitars are layered with pure perfection over the destructively solid drumming and the result is a fast paced delivery of brutal melody. The listener is taken on a head twisting journey as the songs flow from the melodic to the churning and pounding breakdowns. The band has been playing live for three years and has a stage act that can rival any. Their songs are delivered with ferocious focus and the result is a chaotic dream of both the brutal and the melodic. \r\n<br/>\r\nwww.myspace.com/thedeadwilltellband\r\n","options":[{"id":9744024,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26911299/-/hollpoesALBUM-front-01.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26911299/-/hollpoesALBUM-front-01.gif","width":310,"height":291}],"artists":[{"id":46494,"name":"THE DEAD WILL TELL","permalink":"the-dead-will-tell","url":"/artist/the-dead-will-tell"}],"categories":[{"id":1656180,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
