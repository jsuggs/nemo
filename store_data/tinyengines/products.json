From hardcore, post-punk, shoegaze, americana, roots rock and even stoner metal, the overwhelming consensus that Restorations' singular sound is difficult to pin down (though it's fun to try) and originates from an undeniably earnest place - something that is universally easy to get on board with.\r\n\r\nSo from what I can tell, \"grown-up punks\" is merely a term used to describe what the band is not.  It's not music made solely for adults; on the other hand, you're not going to find much in the way of buzz-saw riffs, throat-shredding screams or breakneck drumming.  And if you're searching for a record where playing loud and fast trumps playing well, I'd go elsewhere.  Of course, that doesn't mean that Restorations' brilliant <strong><em><a href=\"http://www.tinyengines.net/releases/restorations/\">Self-Titled</a></em></strong> debut full-length isn't exploding with passion and electricity (it is) and we're certainly not inferring that these eight amazing songs won't rip through your skull before knocking the wind out of you with repeated sonic gut punches (they do).  What we are emphatically stating is that if you've been searching for a thoughtful, nuanced take on punk and indie rock - and all the sub-genres they entail - Restorations might just be your new favorite band.\r\n\r\nNeed proof?  Listen no further than the stunning opener \"Nonlocality,\" with its atmospheric, spine-tingling intro, gorgeous harmonies and crushing wall of sound which closes out a track that feels nothing short of epic.  For the album's 33 + minute duration, Restorations follows a similar trajectory, creating songs that are intricately layered, tension-building monsters which lean heavily on a rhythm section that could probably knock a hole in the side of a Sherman tank.  Still, that never takes away from the band's ability to craft warm, stirring melodies, enduring hooks and dense, dynamic song structures.  Cascading guitars, pulsing waves of reverb and spacey flourishes are held together by Jon Loudon's raspy-yet-tuneful growl.  His delivery is one that transmits confidence, wisdom and a bit of wear and tear - perhaps from years fronting post-hardcore heroes Jena Berlin - but he also sings with a soulful, youthful exuberance that feels like he genuinely loves the process of creating music.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that is Restorations' strength as a cohesive unit - that even though this <em>Self-Titled</em> record is a serious work of art with many subtle complexities, achingly intense moments of restraint and driving need to find a unique voice, it also resonates as if it were an absolute joy to write and perform.  Even the pristine recording and production from Algernon Cadwallader's Joe Reinhart allows the band to maintain a raw, loose aesthetic and foundation-shaking low end that owes a much to the members' punk and hardcore roots.\r\n\r\nIf we were to speak in metaphors, Restorations is like a menacing storm on the horizon, steadily rumbling  across dusty plains and jagged mountains and enveloping everything in its path.  Its impending arrival is a nail-biting experience and the anticipation is nearly as dramatic as the actual event, which in itself is a moving, white-knuckled affair. Pouring down dense sheets of cathartic sound, Restorations washes away the throngs of  stale, unimaginative bands that pollute the once-inspired reservoirs of independent music and breathes new air into tired lungs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that's why this <em>Self-Titled</em> effort speaks so loudly to us \"over-the-hill\" punk rockers.  It's not that Restorations is a band comprised of jaded old punks; it's that some of us have been around long enough to hear (what feels like) everything music has to offer. Every once in a while we need a group to cleanse our palates and get us stoked on the scene again.  For these ears - and I'm sure many of yours - Restorations is that band, and the term \"grown-up punk\" is not about leaving behind the fire of our youth but rather the exciting possibilities and new frontiers that years of experience can underline.\r\n\r\nRestorations' <em>Self-Titled</em> full-length was recorded by <strong><a href=\"http://algernoncadwallader.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Algernon Cadwallader</a></strong>'s Joe Reinhart (Monument, My Heart To Joy, Snowing) at <strong><a href=\"http://headroomphiladelphia.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Headroom</a></strong> in Philadelphia, P.A. mixed by Jonathan Low (Dr. Dog, Danielson, Me Without You) at Miner Street Recorings in Philly and mastered by Dave Eck (Off With Their Heads, Dead Mechanical, Iron Chic) at <strong><a href=\"http://www.luckylacquers.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lucky Lacquers</a></strong> in Madison, W.I.

More strikingly is how the members of quartet have grown by leaps and bounds as songwriters.

On paper, <em>Goes Canoeing</em> doesn’t seem like a record that would drill itself into your brain and stay there for days and days, but songs like “Glass House,” “This Is 113″ and “Diamond Age” are teeming with loads of off-kilter pop moments: contagious sing-along choruses, background whoa-ohs, chunky riffs and a propulsive rhythm section that simply doesn’t quit, to name just a few. You’re as likely to discover a bout of animated hand clapping or an off-the-cuff trumpet solo as you would a wiry, complex guitar line, gruff call-and-response shouting or a swelling instrumental interlude that’s more indicative of the current batch of emo revivalists.\r\n\r\nObviously, we love that Monument’s foundation was built by bands like Braid and Cap’n Jazz, but there’s just as much Meneguar or Teenage Cool Kids thrown in the mix as well. More importantly, let’s recognize <em>Goes Canoeing</em> for blazing its own unique path. These are wonderfully skewed, raucous anti-anthems for emo, indie, punk and hardcore kids alike. We thought that Monument would probably dream up with something amazing, but we never expected them to compose a record that would establish a new template for this type of underground DIY music for years to come.\r\n\r\n<em>Goes Canoeing</em> was recorded and mixed by Algernon Cadwallader’s Joe Reinhart (My Heart To Joy, Restorations, Snowing) at The Headroom in Philadelphia, P.A. and was mastered by Ryan Schwabe at The Maniac Mansion.

Cranking out richly textured indie-pop tunes, skewed by punk's rough-around-the-edges urgency and tightened by the DIY community within which the band operates, the Kent, OH quartet has been winning over fans, peers and critics alike with heartfelt songs that are straightforward and immediate enough to be considered catchy yet complex and nuanced enough to warrant careful repeat listens.</p>\r\nContinuing that trend, but ratcheting up the the immediacy quotient tenfold and tapping into an even more aggressive punk spirit, Annabel's newest five-song offering provides a seemingly endless supply of  exclamation point moments.  While it's unclear where where time will rank <em><strong><a href=\"http://www.tinyengines.net/releases/here-we-are-tomorrow\" target=\"_blank\">Here We Are Tomorrow</a></strong></em> amongst the band's catalog, it unquestionably establishes itself as the juncture when we stopped putting Annabel  into the \"consistently great\" category and promoted it to the \"frequently amazing\" subset.</p>\r\n\"The Forgetting Of Names And Faces\" kicks off proceedings with a scratchy, upbeat riff and and some of Annabel's most infectious melodies to date. The song is propelled by a driving, almost-bouncy rhythm section and signature moments such as a chorus of joyous backing vocals and dynamic guitar lines retain a strong presence the mix.  Without missing a beat, \"Repetition, Etc.\" and \"We Came As Today\" - crashing dynamics, soaring harmonies and \"whoa oh oh's\" abound - tear through the middle part of  <em>Here We Are Tomorrow</em> while closer \"Summer Health\" makes a strong case for being the band's most complete offering to date.  It's a mix of Annabel's most sweetly innate qualities and the formidable talents they've developed along the way: engrossing melodies, a kinetic, pulse and an underlying warmth and honesty that simply can't be faked.</p>\r\nIt's clear that Annabel has blossomed into a singular songwriting force and fully intends on making a definitive statement with <em>Here We Are Tomorrow</em> ... and that statement resonates longer and more emphatically than ever before with these four magnetic tracks.</p>\r\n<em>Here We Are Tomorrow</em> was produced, recorded and mixed by Ben Hendricks at Cerulean Studios in Kent, OH and was mastered by Tim Gerak at The Mammoth Cave Studio in Akron, OH. Tiny Engines will release the 7\" on December 14, 2010 in both vinyl and digital formats.</p>\r\nEach Copy of the EP will contain a free mp3 download code for all the songs, including a 5th digital-only bonus track.</p>\r\n<strong>Track List</strong>\r\n<strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">_______________________________</span></strong>\r\n\r\n01.
