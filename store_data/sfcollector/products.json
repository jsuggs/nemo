CADAVERIC INCUBATOR is a tasty Finish abnormality which features members from such well-known acts like Deepred and Torture Killer. They're butchering corpses with outstanding sound of savage gore death/grind which have its roots in a stinking legacy of early Carcass, Exhumed, Impetigo and Gruesome Malady. FETAL DECAY comes from Russia and presents you NY-style brutal death metal in the vein of early Dying Fetus and Internal Bleeding. Having one full-length album and split-CD with USA's Detrimental, those boys know how to make your head bang. MORTALIZED is a Kazakhstan breed which unchains filth with excellent Mortician-like sound and makes you feel that you're enough brave to spend a night in morgue. Don't miss this chance. Featuring amazing cover-design by Satyr, 20 tracks and 50 minutes of embalming madness, this split is definitely what you need if you want to find a good sound-track for a full-length whore-butchery.","options":[{"id":9204995,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25026449/-/rel05-001.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25026449/-/rel05-001.jpg","width":250,"height":250}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1773477,"name":"---- by band name ----","permalink":"by-band-name","url":"/category/by-band-name"},{"id":1773383,"name":"Fetal Decay","permalink":"fetal-decay","url":"/category/fetal-decay"},{"id":1773463,"name":"Mortalized","permalink":"mortalized","url":"/category/mortalized"},{"id":1773497,"name":"Other bands","permalink":"other-bands","url":"/category/other-bands"},{"id":1773475,"name":"---- by category ----","permalink":"by-category","url":"/category/by-category"},{"id":336038,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":1554459,"name":"CDs (SFC records)","permalink":"cds-sfc-records","url":"/category/cds-sfc-records"},{"id":1773487,"name":"---- by offer ----","permalink":"by-offer","url":"/category/by-offer"},{"id":1549478,"name":"Last copies","permalink":"last-copies","url":"/category/last-copies"}]},{"id":2605615,"name":"Destructive Explosion of Anal Garland -
