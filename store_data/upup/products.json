Your sample kit will include the following:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>one invitation sample (choose your design when you add to cart. NOTE: I cannot accommodate custom colors or wording for samples)\r\n<li>Paper samples (one is 100% recycled post-consumer waste; the other is 100% cotton)\r\n<li>A card displaying ink-color samples (see last image above, also)\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nTo order your wedding stationery without purchasing a sample kit, please see the individual item listings or <a href=\"http://shop.upupcreative.com/contact\">contact me</a>.\r\n\r\n(click here for <a href=\"http://shop.upupcreative.com/wedding-stationery-pricing-ordering\">pricing information</a>)\r\n\r\n<h3>ABOUT UP UP CREATIVE WEDDING INVITATIONS</h3>\r\n\r\nAll printing is done in my attic studio on a digital inkjet press using archival inks. The inks I use are exceptionally vibrant and are water-insoluble, meaning they won’t blur or run when your mom cries at the thought of her baby getting married. (Interested to know why I don’t outsource my printing? It was a big decision, and you can read about it <a href=\"http://bit.ly/insourcing\">here</a>.)\r\n\r\nBecause I print these myself, I do not have print minimums. Some wedding invitation designers, for example, require a minimum order and/or that you order in increments of 25. I don’t do that. If you need 72, you can have 72. No need to waste 3 or 8 or 28 more. This saves paper and ink and ultimately saves you money. I do recommend you order a few extras just in case, but that's up to you.\r\n\r\nAll paper used by Up Up Creative is EITHER 100% cotton OR contains 100% post-consumer recycled content. All envelopes are at least 30% PC content. In addition, all papers are acid-free, lignin-free, and archival. Non-cotton papers used are FSC-certified.\r\n\r\nOrders are shipped USPS Priority Mail with delivery confirmation and insurance. Expedited shipping is available for an additional cost. I do ship worldwide but please contact me for shipping costs and expected delivery times to your country.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>IF YOU DECIDE YOU’D LIKE ME TO MAKE YOUR WEDDING STATIONERY</h3>\r\n\r\nSTEP ONE: To order your wedding stationery without purchasing a sample kit, please convo me (http://www.etsy.com/convo_new.php?to_username=upup) or email upupcreative [!at] gmail.com BE SURE TO INCLUDE WHICH PIECES YOU’D LIKE TO PURCHASE AS WELL AS WHAT QUANTITY\r\n\r\nSTEP TWO: I will set up a custom listing for you and will send you an email requesting your wording and design choices.\r\n\r\nSTEP THREE: Once you purchase the custom listing and send me your details, you can expect a digital PDF proof emailed to you within 3-4 business days.\r\n\r\nSTEP FOUR: You have 2 rounds of revisions to ensure everything’s just as you want it.\r\n\r\nSTEP FIVE: Once you give me approval to print, I’ll get to work printing and assembling your order, which will ship in 7-10 business days.\r\n\r\nThe whole process usually takes 2-5 weeks.

It’s one part sugar and one part sass. It’s silly and serious and meaningful and just the tiniest bit irreverent. \r\n\r\nIt’s about two real people making one real(ly big) commitment. \r\n\r\nIt’s about details. It’s about connections. It’s about choosing invitations that can change things – how you feel about weddings, maybe, or how you think about the word “tradition.”\r\n\r\nIn a way this wedding collection is about juxtaposition. It’s about designs that look amazing at first glance but also invite further perusal. It’s about style and substance. It’s about being eco-friendly without (necessarily) hugging a tree. It’s about you and your guests. It’s about well-chosen fonts and small, organic details. It’s about invitations that are printed on professional quality papers with professional quality, non-water-soluble inks by the person you’re buying them from. It’s about knowing that two careful hands (and two discerning eyes) took the time to create your wedding suite for you.\r\n\r\n<h3>Invitation Suite Includes:</h3>\r\none 5x7 inch or 5x5 inch flat invitation with envelope, one 3.5x5 inch response card with envelope, and one additional 3.5x5 inch enclosure of your choice w/o envelope (could be used for accommodations, save the date, direction card, etc.) \r\n\r\nAlso included : your choice of up to 3 colors, a pdf proof and 2 rounds of changes before printing. \r\n\r\n<b>to order invitation, paper, and ink samples, please see the sample kit listing in the shop.</b>\r\n\r\n(click here for <a href=\"http://shop.upupcreative.com/wedding-stationery-pricing-ordering\">pricing information</a>)\r\n\r\n<h3>ABOUT UP UP CREATIVE WEDDING INVITATIONS</h3>\r\n\r\nAll printing is done in my attic studio on a digital inkjet press using archival inks.
