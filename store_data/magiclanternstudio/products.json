The main point of differentiation between Mike Leigh’s method and Lucien’s process is the way in which Lucien works with the actors to build their characters. \r\n\r\nThe character development process involves visualization techniques to physicalize the character. Once the physical form is defined, the actor then builds a memory map that is, in turn, connected to the physicality of the character. Not only does the actor build a unique physical presence but the actor also creates a defined history that is linked to the physical body thus causing the actor, when at risk, to have spontaneous physical and memory reactions when performing.\r\n   \r\nMaster-Class participants will develop a unique character as well as improvise and devise scenes using that character.\r\n\r\nSUITABLE FOR:  \r\nThese Master Classes are for Actors, Directors & Writers interested in learning this character development process.\r\n","options":[{"id":40954437,"name":"Default","price":315.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122543769/-/character_creation_lucian_simon.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122543769/-/character_creation_lucian_simon.jpg","width":827,"height":818}],"artists":[{"id":223932,"name":"Lucian Simon","permalink":"lucian-simon","url":"/artist/lucian-simon"}],"categories":[{"id":5948664,"name":"ADULT'S WORKSHOPS","permalink":"adult-s-workshops","url":"/category/adult-s-workshops"}]},{"id":12846399,"name":"WEAVING.
