Pyrography, also known commonly as wood burning when done on wood, is the art of making an immage by burning it into your material.  It takes patience and a good sense of what you are trying to produce since you must frequently turn your workpiece to get proper burning thus losing perspective very easily.\r\n\r\nThe Frame is not included, however, ask at time of purchase if you want a custom frame.  I am a framer also.  Otherwise you can purchase a suitable frame just about anywhere. \r\n\r\nView my total collection of pyrographs, acrylic paintings, pen and ink drawings, and scroll saw creations at www.dewaynewilliams.etsy.com","options":[{"id":9239247,"name":"Default","price":80.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25131741/-/Fire_053_1mb.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25131741/-/Fire_053_1mb.jpg","width":395,"height":480}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1549558,"name":"Artwork","permalink":"artwork","url":"/category/artwork"},{"id":1549570,"name":"Pyrography","permalink":"pyrography","url":"/category/pyrography"}]}]
