It is the story of a very poor farmer named Mr. Wei. Mr. Wei lived in Anxi county of China's southeastern Fujian province. Everyday, as he walked to his fields, Mr. Wei passed a dilapidated temple which housed an iron statue of Kwan Yin, the Bodhisattva of Compassion. He was distressed by the sad state of the temple, and wished he could rectify it, but as he was only a poor farmer, there was not much he could do. But he decided to do what he could, and a couple times a month he brought his broom from home and swept out the temple. He then offered a stick of incense to the iron statue of Kwan Yin. This continued for many months.\r\n\r\nOne night, as Mr. Wei slept, Kwan Yin came to him in a vision. She told him that behind the old temple he would find a cave, and that waiting in this cave was a great treasure. The next morning, he found the cave, and inside the cave was a small tea sprout. He took the sprout to his own field and planted it, where it produced the finest tea. He gave cuttings to his neighbors, and soon the whole area was thriving. The tea had brought prosperity to Mr. Wei and all his neighbors. Soon, the rundown old temple with the iron statue was repaired and became an important beacon in the region.\r\n\r\nContains Oolong Tea.\r\n\r\nYou will receive 4 oz of loose leaf tea in a brown resealable, glassine lined paper bag.
