By mid-summer, I am amazed by the 7 foot flowers and their ability to provide sustenance, shelter and joy. \r\n\r\nNamed for Helianthus asteraceae, the botanical name for the sunflower, this one of a kind lighting sculpture was inspired by the overall shape and multiple helix pattern of that amazing provider the sunflower. The shadowscape gives the illusion of a surreal ceiling medallion, which looks at home in my Neo-Georgian house filled with mid-century modern furniture. This swag in ReDesign Technologies Moderna Line, measures 22\" wide x 6\" deep.\r\n\r\nLike all of ReDesign Technologies' paper clip lighting, the structural elements are sourced from carefully deconstructed cast-off lamp shade. The paper clips form a patterned design of patinaed upcycled clips and shiny new gold toned clips. The wiring elements are all Canadian Standards Approved and are appropriate for North American electrical systems. Options are available for international systems.

Hundreds of paper clips are woven to a deconstructed steel framework system in a diamond hyperbola motif. A single Satco mirror bulb projects a patterned shadow on walls, ceiling and architectural elements. \r\n\r\nThe deconstruction process strips away all glues, adhesives, plastics and textiles from vintage thick gauge steel rings (of various provenance), leaving bare steel frames. The frames are sanded, buffed and left raw to reveal their past.\r\n\r\nThe small Operetta chandelier is made to order and outfitted with a ceramic socket or steel capped socket if you prefer and a simple white plug-in cord. Canopy kits are available if you want to hardwire to the ceiling just ask me for details. All electrical elements are CSA (Canadian Standard Agency) approved and are appropriate for North American outlets, but can be easily modified. \r\n\r\nThe frame measures approximately 16 inches in diameter and 18 inches in length and is shipped with a DIY wiring kit package at a discounted price. Orders of 24\" to 56\" diameter are available but require custom listings.
