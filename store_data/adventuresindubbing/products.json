The gentleman on top of the white rectangle hurls a leather wrapped sphere that travels faster than a car through the air, the single sticked man, swings his wooden club toward the fast moving ball and makes contact. Throughout the stadium the contact with the bat and ball is heard relative to your distance from the contact. Many witnesses and participators in this ritual wear a baseball cap on their head.
