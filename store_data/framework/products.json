I have had it for 5 years. It was inspired by a flower, but I have abstracted it, so many people have seen different things. Fire was the most common reference. It is inspired by the style of Georgia O'Keefe. I love it, but I need to start parting with some of my pieces to make room for the new. This is big and I am not sure what it will cost to ship, so feel free to let me know if you are interested for a quote  before you buy it. While you are purchasing the original, I still reserve to use the right of the image itself for products and portfolio work.
