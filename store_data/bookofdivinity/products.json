Roman Catholics, the Eastern Orthodox, Anglicans, and Lutherans refer to him as \"Saint Michael the Archangel\" and also as \"Saint Michael\". Orthodox Christians refer to him as the \"Taxiarch Archangel Michael\" or simply \"Archangel Michael\".\r\n\r\nIn Hebrew, Michael means \"who is like God\". Michael is mentioned three times in the Book of Daniel, once as a \"great prince who stands up for the children of your people\". The idea that Michael was the advocate of the Jews became so prevalent that in spite of the rabbinical prohibition against appealing to angels as intermediaries between God and his people, Michael came to occupy a certain place in the Jewish liturgy.\r\n\r\nIn the New Testament Michael leads God's armies against Satan's forces in the Book of Revelation, where during the war in heaven he defeats Satan. In the Epistle of Jude Michael is specifically referred to as an \"archangel\". Christian sanctuaries to Michael appeared in the 4th century, when he was first seen as a healing angel, and then over time as a protector and the leader of the army of God against the forces of evil. By the 6th century, devotions to Archangel Michael were widespread both in the Eastern and Western Churches. Over time, teachings on Michael began to vary among Christian denominations.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":32787127,"name":"Default","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102894736/-/ARCHANGEL.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102894736/-/ARCHANGEL.png","width":952,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":10466188,"name":"DANTE ダンテ","permalink":"dante","position":5,"price":39.99,"default_price":39.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dante","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-10T19:25:18.000Z","description":"Dante is a mercenary and demon hunter dedicated to exterminating them and other malevolent supernatural foes, a mission he follows in pursuit of those that killed his mother and corrupted his brother. He is the son of Sparda, a demon of great power that rebelled against the demon emperor and defeated his army. As a result of his demonic heritage, he possesses numerous powers beyond that of any human, which he uses in combination with a variety of weapons to accomplish his goals.\r\n\r\nDante is one of the twin sons of Sparda, the demon knight who sided with humanity and drove back an invasion of the human world by demons 2,000 years ago. After Sparda's death, Dante and his identical twin brother Vergil were raised by their human mother, Eva. When Dante and Vergil were children, the family was attacked by demons, resulting in Eva's death. This event led to Dante's commitment to hunting demons in pursuit of those that killed his mother.","options":[{"id":32782606,"name":"Default","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102882421/-/DANTE_original.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102882421/-/DANTE_original.png","width":952,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
