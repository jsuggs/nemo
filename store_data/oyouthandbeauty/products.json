Just released.</big> \r\n\r\nContains the songs:<b>\r\nChoose Sides\r\nMisanthropy\r\nCynic\r\nFashion\r\nApocalypse\r\nPagan\r\nand Lust!</b>\r\n\r\nFIRST REVIEW OF \"CHOOSE SIDES\" \r\nAt a casual listen, O' Youth and Beauty's \"Choose Sides\" comes across as a helter skelter jumble of motley musical styles and lyrical structures that leaves the listener intrigued and reminded of a Jackson Pollock painting. A little heavy metal dripped here, a little power pop splattered over there. Some Silent Escape scattered here, some 90's alt rock sprayed right across the middle. But, like a true Pollock, closer examination shows the scattered fragments closing together to form one symphony of sound and color that comes together to form an insightful and entertaining work of art that spurs meaning and profundity that America's youth so desperately needs. \r\nO' Youth and Beauty's \"Choose Sides\" is eponymous in that it forces us to do just thatâ€¦choose a side. The potent, freethinking lyrics and forward aimed riffs and melodies leave the listener either embracing change in both a social and musical sense and dreaming of a society free of religious hypocrisy or at least questioning the foundations of structured spiritual belief. Clearly defining the lines of a never-ending social and spiritual battle, the listener cannot help feeling inclined to solidify his/her beliefs in one direction or the other.\r\nEither way, O' Youth and Beauty moves forward in the evolution of experimental rock, borrowing from the past and present and writing toward the future as the band blazes its part of the trail into what is to become of rock music.\r\n\r\n-William Usry \r\n","options":[{"id":605126,"name":"Choose Sides","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/740516/-/frontinsert.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/740516/-/frontinsert.jpg","width":800,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":109049,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":242853,"name":"Moth","permalink":"moth","position":2,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/moth","status":"sold-out","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-02-24T03:16:39.000Z","description":"Bay Island Slim fit tee.","options":[{"id":1040007,"name":"YL (only 17 left)","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":1040046,"name":"Small (only 7 left)","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1755666/-/moth.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1755666/-/moth.jpg","width":600,"height":715}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":109052,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":242856,"name":"Skull","permalink":"skull","position":3,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/skull","status":"sold-out","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-02-24T03:18:30.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":1040054,"name":"YL (only 18 left)","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":1040059,"name":"Small (only 1 left)","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1755682/-/skull.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1755682/-/skull.jpg","width":600,"height":715}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":109052,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]}]
