Digitalizing nature sounds she makes sugary and salty sound scapes, coloring them with airy and determined vocals. She is somewhat a one-woman army writing, recording and mixing tracks herself. Galvanizing the head, the heart and the feet, Lotte\r\nRose produces what she calls dustified electro.\r\nShe grew up in a small town with a daily doze of nature from wide-open fields, dense woods to the sea right at her hand. Humming with the trees is a huge cliché and exactly what Lotte Rose did. Her father, an all-round musician playing everything from the fiddle\r\nto the washboard, quickly taught her, that instruments are everywhere in everything. It was quite late in her childhood or even early adulthood the digital world unfolded itself to her. She got deeply smitten by\r\ncomputer realms and their endless opportunities. There was an immediate desire to unify the two worlds.\r\nAnd so with a tiny set up, a field recorder and a two months stay on a hardly noticeable island, Lotte Rose started recording the sounds and produce the songs for her first EP 'Tentacular'.\r\n\r\n”Nature is the generator for all the digital shit that's dripping. It's great”\r\n","options":[{"id":17687725,"name":"Default","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53846857/-/TentacularCover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53846857/-/TentacularCover.jpg","width":1000,"height":994}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2806339,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]}]
