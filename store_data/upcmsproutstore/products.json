Printed without words, the parent gets to make up the story, or just cuddle with baby while they explore together. \r\n\r\nThe creators of Indestructibles are Amy Pixton, a mother of triplets, and her mother-in-law, Kaaren Pixton, an artist and children’s educator.  Plip-Plop Pond! is about a frog who visits his friends in the pond. Kaaren Pixton’s art is bright, swirling with color, and reminiscent of Eric Carle, and it attains an almost 3D richness on the special paperlike stock of the book. \r\n\r\n**Please allow 5-7 business days for shipping**\r\n\r\n~ All sales go towards supporting the Upper Peninsula Children's Museum, and keeping it a great and safe place to engage youth and families to discover through interactive exhibits and learning opportunities!! ~\r\n\r\nwww.upcmkids.org - www.upcmsproutstore.com","options":[{"id":20532543,"name":"Default","price":4.95,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.99,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63594405/-/9780761158578.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63594405/-/9780761158578.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3285163,"name":"TOP PICKS","permalink":"top-picks","url":"/category/top-picks"},{"id":3285283,"name":"Fun Stuff","permalink":"fun-stuff","url":"/category/fun-stuff"},{"id":3285129,"name":"Animals","permalink":"animals","url":"/category/animals"},{"id":3285119,"name":"Books, Movie & Music","permalink":"books-movie-music","url":"/category/books-movie-music"},{"id":3285139,"name":"Learning","permalink":"learning","url":"/category/learning"},{"id":3285125,"name":"For The Baby","permalink":"for-the-baby","url":"/category/for-the-baby"}]},{"id":6451235,"name":"Flutter Fly - INDESTRUCTIBLE BOOK!","permalink":"flutter-fly","position":71,"price":4.95,"default_price":4.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/flutter-fly","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-14T21:16:25.000Z","description":"Flutter Fly - INDESTRUCTIBLE BOOK!\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nAnnouncing a brand new idea in publishing books for babies: the completely durable, completely safe Indestructibles.
