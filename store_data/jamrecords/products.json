What followed was a fitful and productive period culminating in a discarded album’s worth of tracks, the crucial introduction of vocalist James Buttery to the fold and, finally, the release of their debut full-length ‘North’, to wide acclaim. By this time \r\nDarkstar had aptly been framed as a very intriguing proposition, one of the first proper ‘bands’ to rise from the UK’s current electronic underground. \r\n• The band decamped to a house in the West Yorkshire countryside, secluding themselves from the distractions of London and writing as a trio for the first time. Ultimately, ‘News From Nowhere’ is a reflection of the time they spent together there. Says Young, “Every place warrants a story. There are moments in people’s everyday lives, no matter how subtle, that can be documented and talked about in great detail. The instances spiral and ascend and take on their own course, altering the perception of how even the slightest change in a day can be felt deeply.” \r\n• Eventually proceedings moved from the band’s makeshift digital studio in their house to producer Richard Formby’s (Sonic Boom / Hood / Wild Beasts) dusty studio enclave, full of tape machines and analogue synthesizers. The songs that had been inspired by English prog rock and obscure techno and created as loops based on the band’s affinity for hip hop production (“literally everything from Lex Luger to Geoff Barrow”) grew into sublimely arranged works. In the end, the album arrived at an altogether singular existence, delving into the moments between moments and elevating them to epic, kaleidoscopic heights. \r\n• Double vinyl format with download code, limited to 500 copies for UK & Eire.","options":[{"id":30752890,"name":"Vinyl LP","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30752893,"name":"Compact Disc","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96564103/-/darkstar.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96564103/-/darkstar.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4383542,"name":"Latest","permalink":"latest","url":"/category/latest"},{"id":4427354,"name":"Electronic","permalink":"electronic","url":"/category/electronic"}]},{"id":9829354,"name":"Julia Kent - Character","permalink":"julia-kent-character","position":17,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/julia-kent-character","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-09T22:40:17.000Z","description":"This is quite the most beautiful thing I've heard this year... or last year come to that...\r\nCharacter is New York­based cellist and arranger Julia Kent’s third solo album, and first for The Leaf Label.

Nils experienced an unfortunate accident, which saw him fall from his bunk bed located directly above hisstudio, which resulted in a broken thumb. But through inspiration from his fans and despite the 4 screws that hadjust been surgically placed inside his thumb, he started recording with 9 fingers, which later resulted in 9 intimate piano recordings. Nils chose his 30th birthday to offer these recordings as a free download to his fans via screws.durtonstudio.com where they have been freely available since. IN HIS OWN WORDS: “I am sitting in front of a sheet of paper. My right hand is bending over my left thumb. The first day I got out of my cast I could bend it by15°. Now I am already at 50° and that makes me happy. Things are going uphill… As you can imagine, it is really bad news for a pianist when he gets diagnosed with a broken thumb. That day I was sitting in the emergency room, feeling rather dizzy while thinking of a zillion shows coming up and all the people involved around it. I realised in that moment how busy things have become. It is hard to turn down interesting projects and opportunities, since I surely love my work. It actually never felt like work. Playing piano and playing it for wonderful people is the greatest joy I can imagine. For a couple of days I felt like this could all be over. How pathetic, but hey – also feeling sorry for yourself has its place somewhere. All of a sudden I had so much time, an unexpected holiday. I cancelled most of my schedule and found myself being a little bored. Even though my doctor told me not to touch a piano for a while, I just couldn’t resist. I started playing a silent song with 5 fingers on my right and the remaining 4 on my left hand. I set up one microphone and recorded another tune every other night before falling asleep. The day I got rid of my cast I had recorded 9 little songs. They have helped me feel less annoyed about my accident and reminded me that I can only achieve something good, when I make the most of what I’ve got.” – NILS FRAHM\r\n\r\n...or you could just say this is a beautiful, beautiful record...\r\n \r\n ","options":[{"id":29765573,"name":"Vinyl LP","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29765576,"name":"Compact Disc","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/93523178/-/nils_frahm_screws.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/93523178/-/nils_frahm_screws.jpg","width":625,"height":625}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1752817,"name":"Ambient","permalink":"ambient","url":"/category/ambient"},{"id":4383542,"name":"Latest","permalink":"latest","url":"/category/latest"},{"id":4427522,"name":"Home Listening / Modern Classical","permalink":"home-listening-modern-classical","url":"/category/home-listening-modern-classical"}]},{"id":9516845,"name":"Jon Porras - Orilla Oscura","permalink":"jon-porras-orilla-oscura","position":23,"price":21.0,"default_price":21.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/jon-porras-orilla-oscura","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-16T14:18:23.000Z","description":"*Orilla Oscura is the new album from Barn Owl’s Jon Porras.

The musical vision of Portlander-via-New Zealand Ruban Nielson started as an anonymous home-recording project that fused psychedelia, soul, choppy percussion and funk. \r\n• Unknown Mortal Orchestra came to life in basements and bedrooms after Nielson moved from his native New Zealand to Portland, Oregon with his family. Following the recruitment of bassist Jacob Portrait, new drummer Greg Rogove and a deal with Jagjaguwar, UMO toured the US with Grizzly Bear and Liars. \r\n• ‘II’ builds on the breakbeat, junk shop charm the 32-year-old multi-instrumentalist and songwriter came to be renowned for following his self-titled 2011 debut, and signals the solidification of Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s position as an endlessly intriguing, brave psychedelic band. Unknown Mortal Orchestra is unafraid to dig deeper than the rest, to lock into their intoxicating, opiate groove and bring rock ‘n’ roll’s exaggerated myths to life. \r\n• Written during a punishing, debauched touring schedule during which Nielson feared for his sanity and health, ‘II’ illustrates the emotional turmoil of life on the road, painting surrealist, cartoonish portraits of loneliness, love and despair. \r\n• These conflicting themes are evident immediately; on the album’s sleeve is an unnerving image of Janet Farrar, the famous British witch Wiccan, author and teacher of witchcraft. The chilling refrain of opener ‘Into The Sun’ sees Nielson deliver the line “Isolation can put a gun in your hand,” softly, his words starkly intelligible above a warm, slow-burning melody that quickly brands itself onto your brain. His playful imagery (“I’m so lonely I’ve gotta eat my popcorn all alone”) mirrors the melody, before a solo that borders on psychotropic ends ‘II’s introduction. \r\n• As it unfolds, ‘II’ does find Nielson reenergized. ‘One At A Time’ and ‘Faded In The Morning’ boast dizzying choruses and instrumentals - these crusty hunks could have been excavated from a lost 1960s treasure trove. ‘Monki’ unravels over seven minutes like the yarn from a stoner’s cardigan with an eye-frying pattern. ‘Dawn’ is a minute of disconcerting noise that stands out between the nooks and crannies of the choruses, guitar solos, groove-heavy bass and drums that were recorded live by newly-recruited drummer Greg Rogove and Kody Nielson in a move away from the electronic percussion employed on album one. ‘II’ closes with ‘Secret Xtians’, a tender observational puzzle that fizzes to a satisfied end. \r\n• Pulling Pink Floyd, The Family Stone, The Beatles and the Soft Machine through his warped rock ‘n’ roll filter, Nielson has created a collection of expressive psychedelia. \r\nUnknown Mortal Orchestra was once Nielson’s closeted concern. With an album that uses his singular musical imagination and extraordinary talent to parade his emotions with unyielding honesty, it is now a fully realized band operating at the peak of its powers. \r\n","options":[{"id":28987790,"name":"Vinyl LP","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28987793,"name":"Compact Disc","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91017554/-/unknown_mortal.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91017554/-/unknown_mortal.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1634043,"name":"Indie / Rock / Alternative","permalink":"indie-rock-alternative","url":"/category/indie-rock-alternative"},{"id":1709806,"name":"Psych Folk & Rock","permalink":"psych-folk-rock","url":"/category/psych-folk-rock"},{"id":4383542,"name":"Latest","permalink":"latest","url":"/category/latest"}]},{"id":9261860,"name":"Olof Arnalds - Sudden Elevation","permalink":"olof-arnalds-sudden-elevation","position":29,"price":16.0,"default_price":16.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/olof-arnalds-sudden-elevation","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-01T16:14:03.000Z","description":"Recorded in her native Iceland, ‘Sudden Elevation’, Ólöf Arnald’s third full album - her first sung entirely in English - captures a rare and idiosyncratic songwriting talent in full bloom. \r\n• From the breezily skipping rhythm of opener ‘German Fields’ to the pealing vocals of closer, ‘Perfect’, ‘Sudden Elevation’s particular brand of heartache is magical, dislocated and otherworldly; its harmonies complex and quietly electrifying. \r\n• Produced again by longtime collaborator Skúli Sverrisson, ‘Sudden Elevation’ was largely recorded in a late autumn 2011 stint in a seaside cabin in Hvalfjörður (literally ‘Whale-fjord’), in the west of Iceland. \r\n• Perhaps because it is the first album that Ólöf has recorded from start to finish, with no protracted breaks, it possesses a stronger narrative thread than its predecessors. “I was always trying to see the record as a conceptual whole, keeping a certain order of songs in mind as we recorded,” explains Ólöf. “I drew different maps of how the record would sound and feel as one complete work, which was something I really felt like doing, given the first opportunity in my life to have a continuous recording process.” \r\n• Classically educated on the violin and self-taught on viola, guitar and charango, none- the-less Ólöf’s most distinctive asset is her captivating voice, possessing spring water chasteness, seemingly innocent yet ancient (Björk once described Ólöf’s uniquely compelling vocal sound as “somewhere between a child and an old woman”). \r\n• 2010’s ‘Innundir skinni’ and last year’s ‘Ólöf Sings’ covers EP attracted worldwide critical acclaim, Mojo venturing a Rising piece while Q named Ólöf as one of their Most Exciting People In Music. Major features followed in Dazed & Confused, The Guardian, Stool Pigeon, Clash and, at the end of the year, ‘Innundir skinni’ appeared \r\nin Uncut magazine’s 50 Best Albums Of 2010, as well as appearing amongst the finalists for the prestigious Nordic Music Prize that year. \r\n• LP includes digital download coupon. \r\n• “Navigating melody, melancholy and joy like Joanna Newsom’s little sister” - The Independent \r\n• “Ethereal, sonic heaven” - Sunday Times \r\n• “Gentle, vocally pure and warmly whimsical, Arnalds creates beguilingly pretty folk lullabies” - Daily Telegraph \r\n• “A rare and charming talent” - The Times \r\n","options":[{"id":28987667,"name":"Vinyl LP","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28987670,"name":"Compact Disc","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91016978/-/olof_arnalds.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91016978/-/olof_arnalds.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1634043,"name":"Indie / Rock / Alternative","permalink":"indie-rock-alternative","url":"/category/indie-rock-alternative"},{"id":4383542,"name":"Latest","permalink":"latest","url":"/category/latest"}]},{"id":9261794,"name":"Night Beds - Country Sleep","permalink":"night-beds-country-sleep","position":30,"price":16.0,"default_price":16.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/night-beds-country-sleep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-01T16:09:20.000Z","description":"Welcome to the sound of Winston Yellen and Night Beds, who in one stunning ten-track debut album - ‘Country Sleep’ - have shown that there is plenty of life left in the world of American music if you have the voice, the songs and the gift to touch hearts and souls. Think of a space between Mark Kozelek (Red House Painters / Sun Kil Moon), Gram Parsons and the dreamier side of My Morning Jacket; a heavenly place of pure country soul, touched by an endearing innocence and honesty that can only come from someone still in their early twenties. \r\n• From Colorado Springs, and now a resident of Nashville where he first moved to study, Yellen’s road to ‘Country Sleep’ has been anything but the straightest and easiest. In 2006, he formed Night Beds and self-released three rudimentary EPs between 2008 and 2011. \r\n• Waylaid by what Yellen’s friend Nika States recalls as, “a lot of alcohol, and a lot of irreverent tuning,” he dropped out of college. After losing his job and girlfriend, and in the spirit of the country classic ‘Me & Bobby McGee’ (“Freedom’s just another word for nothing left to lose”), Yellen took off on a five-month sojourn. Moving from state to state, he lived out of his hatchback car performing menial odd jobs and mopping church floors until, he says, “a \r\nfriend instilled in me the need to cut the bullshit and move back to \r\nNashville.” Taking out a loan, Yellen rented an out-of-town, pre-civil war home in the woods that was previously owned by the late Johnny Cash and June Carter (and still maintained by the couple’s friends). Inspired by the serendipity of the discovery, he started working on Country Sleep, both in his country retreat and back in civilisation at Nashville’s Brown Owl studio. \r\n• Country Sleep begins with just a voice, a high and tender lament, for 71precious seconds; a spirit to be reckoned with. Next up, a full band kicks up some dust behind a deliciously bittersweet melody. After that, more beautiful crooning unfolds over a violin / guitar backdrop that keeps building until the pace momentarily quickens to the sound of handclaps before a sudden, heartaching fade. The album concludes with ‘TENN’, as in Tennessee, written the next day after the night before, hungover and lost. Yellen admits the songs were often born out of “destructive circumstances, and many varied attempts to sedate myself.” \r\n• For fans of Whiskey Town, Ryan Adams, Fleet Foxes and Bon Iver. \r\n","options":[{"id":28987496,"name":"Vinyl LP","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28987499,"name":"Compact Disc","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91016114/-/night_beds.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91016114/-/night_beds.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1634043,"name":"Indie / Rock / Alternative","permalink":"indie-rock-alternative","url":"/category/indie-rock-alternative"},{"id":4383542,"name":"Latest","permalink":"latest","url":"/category/latest"}]},{"id":9010415,"name":"Rick Redbeard - No Selfish Heart","permalink":"rick-redbeard-no-selfish-heart","position":31,"price":17.0,"default_price":17.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rick-redbeard-no-selfish-heart","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-18T16:06:23.000Z","description":"Debut solo album by Rick Redbeard of The Phantom Band.

Guitar, cello, organs, electric \r\npiano, and more are seamlessly combined with modular electronics, \r\nsynthesizers and other sound sources.

To make their second album, Esben And The Witch questioned, challenged and rewired their past to find the way to their future and have produced their first masterpiece. \r\n• To quote Daniel Copeman, “We had a clearer idea of what we wanted to achieve on this album, and how we could achieve it. We’re more focused, more confident.” \r\n• Their first album took them on the road, and the road took them all over the globe. It was on these journeys, during van-held conversations, that their second album began to take shape, the band happening upon an ancient Greek palindrome ‘Nipson anomēmata mē monan opsin’ which, when translated, gave ‘Wash The Sins Not Only The Face’ its title. \r\n• They wanted the album to unfurl like a journey, like a day, where opening songs are possessed of a brightness, an optimism that ebbs away over the record’s course. The radiant glide of opener ‘Iceland Spar’, gives way to the bleak lonesomeness of ‘Yellow Wood’, the moment where the sun sets, with closing track ‘Smashed To Pieces InThe Still Of The Night’ ending proceedings at a peak of drama and intensity. \r\n• Previously, lyrics were written more collaboratively between the trio; this time Rachel assumed the sole responsibility herself, honing her words and stories. The lyrics are inspired by TS Eliot and Sylvia Plath, by the works of Vladimir Nabokov and Philip Pullman, Salvador Dali and the surrealist movement; that, and van conversations questioning what it would be like to meet your doppelganger thousands of miles from home. \r\n• The result is an album that finds new shades within the Esben palette, and when placed alongside ‘Violet Cries’, feels like a fuzzy image that’s pulled successfully into focus. \r\n• All of this makes you wonder where this road will take them next. More to the point, it makes you want to savour where Esben And The Witch are at now, because ‘Wash The Sins Not Only The Face’ is a sublime experience, an album whose mysteries and riddles will entrance. \r\n• LP formats include a CD copy of the album. \r\n• Deluxe LP format, available exclusively to independent retailers, also includes a bonus 7”. \r\n","options":[{"id":28247972,"name":"vinyl plus  7\"","price":21.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28247975,"name":"compact disc","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/88554014/-/esben_witch.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/88554014/-/esben_witch.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1634043,"name":"Indie / Rock / Alternative","permalink":"indie-rock-alternative","url":"/category/indie-rock-alternative"},{"id":1634040,"name":"Folk Americana","permalink":"folk-americana","url":"/category/folk-americana"},{"id":4383542,"name":"Latest","permalink":"latest","url":"/category/latest"}]},{"id":9008708,"name":"Arbouretum - Coming Out of the Fog","permalink":"arbouretum-coming-out-of-the-fog","position":37,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/arbouretum-coming-out-of-the-fog","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-18T13:29:24.000Z","description":"Rather than spending their time searching for fame, Baltimore’s Arbouretum have instead concentrated on honing their craft. The band’s poetic lyrics and slow, heavy build are not stuff of the quick fix. Their music stands in stark contrast to a culture more concerned with video and track placement than criticism and discourse. \r\n• Arbouretum have been praised in Mojo 4 star reviews that end with phrases like “It just does not get much better,” a Guardian piece proclaiming that they are “One of the most distinctive voices around” and an Uncut 4 star review calling the music \r\n“Dense, thrilling and literate.” \r\n• Fifth full length album ‘Coming Out Of The Fog’ continues Arbouretum’s journey as their most focused and best-recorded album to date. Dave Heumann’s vocals soar atop his guitar solos and Corey Allender’s crunchy bass lines. Arbouretum have reigned in some of their maximalist tendencies, with every song coming in under 7 \r\nminutes. Heumann, Allender, Brian Carey (drums), and Matthew Pierce (keyboard, synthesizer, percussion) continue to mine the same breadth of styles made familiar on ‘The Gathering’ and ‘Song Of The Pearl’, notably the languid ballads, fuzzed-out burners, and heavier songs that have defined the group’s unique doom laden folk- \r\nrock sound. \r\n• Throughout ‘Coming Out Of The Fog’, Heumann’s vocals take on a meditative quality, melodies unravelling effortlessly over Carey’s steady grooves. Syncopated rhythms come to the fore on ‘The Promise’, building tension, and leading to a climax of synth swells and chromatic guitar lines. Elsewhere, on ‘Oceans Don’t Sing’, guest musician Dave Hadley’s plaintive pedal-steel guitar lays a bed for some of Heumann’s most impassioned singing set to tape. Spending time on pre-production allowed for a more detailed approach to recording. Carey’s drums were tuned specifically for almost every track on the album, and tape was used to achieve the warmth only found in analogue. \r\n• CD version comes in a 4 panel mini-LP style gatefold package.

It weaves themes of aging, personal tragedy and emotional bonds into a fully-realized whole that recalls career-defining statements like ‘Blood On The Tracks’, ‘I Want To See The Bright Lights Tonight’ or Al Green’s ‘Call Me’. \r\n• “Nothing ever stays the same / Nothing’s explained”, the band sing in unison on the reflective opening track ‘Ohm’. “We try not to lose our hearts / Not to lose our minds” - a straightforward sentiment for a band that prefer private intimation to forceful expression, making the song’s resistance to resignation feel that much more earned. \r\n• This is the first time Yo La Tengo have collaborated with producer John McEntire, best known for his work in post-rock band Tortoise as well as his work with such artists as Bright Eyes, Stereolab and Teenage Fanclub. He has helped the band hone a set of songs as multifaceted as they are seamless, flowing from the low key \r\nshimmy of ‘Well You Better’ to the muted motorik kick of ‘Stupid Things’, to the cozy distortion of ‘Paddle Forward’ and right through to the cagey groove, horns and strings of the gorgeous album closer, ‘Before We Run’, in which the band’s Georgia Hubley and Ira Kaplan sing “Take me to your distant lonely place / Take me out \r\nbeyond mistrust.” \r\n• ‘Fade’s emotional core sits at its very centre with two songs, one sung by Kaplan and one by Hubley. The tender, raw, Kaplan-sung ballad ‘I’ll Be Around’ pivots around a circular guitar figure set against James McNew’s calm, pulsating bassline. The song’s simplicity and starkness stand like a beacon against the emptiness. \r\n• ‘Cornelia And Jane’ features Hubley gently singing “I hear them whispering, they analyse, but nobody knows what’s lost in your eyes / Sending the message that doesn’t get to you, how can we care for you?”, supported by whispering cushions of horns and delicate vocal harmonies. The effect is both heartbreaking and reassuring. \r\n• “In the best possible sense, Yo La Tengo can feel less like a band and more like a beloved national trust” - Stereogum \r\n• Special deluxe edition LP + 7” format exclusively available to independent retailers. \r\nThe deluxe LP comes in a numbered edition printed on rainbow foil with a bonus 7′′ featuring two exclusive covers: ‘I Saw The Light’ (Todd Rundgren) and ‘Move To California’ (Times New Viking), plus an MP3 download accompanying the deluxe edition including an additional 11 minute jam as a bonus track. \r\n","options":[{"id":28246718,"name":"vinyl plus  7\"","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28246823,"name":"compact disc","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/88550150/-/yo_la_tengo_fade.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/88550150/-/yo_la_tengo_fade.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1634043,"name":"Indie / Rock / Alternative","permalink":"indie-rock-alternative","url":"/category/indie-rock-alternative"},{"id":4383542,"name":"Latest","permalink":"latest","url":"/category/latest"}]},{"id":9007892,"name":"Alasdair Roberts & Friends - A Wonder Working Stone","permalink":"alasdair-roberts-friends-a-wonder-working-stone","position":40,"price":17.0,"default_price":17.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/alasdair-roberts-friends-a-wonder-working-stone","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-18T12:16:18.000Z","description":"Drag City Records release the new album by Alasdair Roberts & Friends, entitled ‘A \r\nWonder Working Stone’.

All these styles are part of the new approach Los Pirañas offer within today's frenetic music scene in Colombia.\r\n\r\nThe sound in \"Toma tu jabón Kapax\" is deliberately strident but nevertheless can be danced to. On one hand, it retains the dense cadence of Andrés Landero's legendary cumbia bass sounds and the marked percussion of Afrobeat and champeta. On the other hand, verging towards rock and electronica, Los Pirañas resort to an out of control computer and the distorted chaos of a guitar that owes as much to surf music as it does to Peruvian chicha.\r\n\r\nMatik Matik, a cultural space in Bogota which promotes music experimentation, was the venue where \"Toma tu jabón Kapax\" was recorded live in December 2010. Originally released in Colombia by Festina Lente Discos, Vampisoul is proud to make this groundbreaking album available to a worldwide audience.","options":[{"id":28217324,"name":"Vinyl LP","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/88447250/-/LOSPIRANAS-toma.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/88447250/-/LOSPIRANAS-toma.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1634043,"name":"Indie / Rock / Alternative","permalink":"indie-rock-alternative","url":"/category/indie-rock-alternative"},{"id":1709806,"name":"Psych Folk & Rock","permalink":"psych-folk-rock","url":"/category/psych-folk-rock"},{"id":4383542,"name":"Latest","permalink":"latest","url":"/category/latest"}]},{"id":8997743,"name":"konkoma - Konkoma","permalink":"konkoma-konkoma","position":42,"price":16.0,"default_price":16.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/konkoma-konkoma","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-17T21:20:29.000Z","description":"Another gem from the reliable Soundaway imprint, this is the debut of London based Afro-funk band KonKoma.

Needless to say they know their craft, and having a band that they can truly excel in sounds like exactly what they needed and has given the Londoners surprising focus.

They really get their hands on-the-job, taking time off from touring to smudge out Indris' vocal and allow the grooves to spill off the lines in well smoked form. In particular 'Cosmick Dub' gets well loose with the double-timed drum flux and billowing, weedy chord clouds and 'Live Dub' comes off as one of the baddest new age house psych-outs we've heard from this scene. Likewise, 'Midnight Dub' is prime dancefloor material in the right situations - secret beachside bars in Ibiza or Aruba, maybe - and 'Beautiful Dub' again harks back to that halycon early '90s daze with beamin' glimmers of Happy Mondays, Weatherall at his best.

'sun' is the new studio album from cat power. six years after her last album of original material ('the greatest', 2006), chan marshall has moved on from her collaborative forays into memphis soul and delta blues. she wrote, played, recorded and produced the entirety of 'sun' by herself, a statement of complete control that is echoed in the songs' themes. marshall calls 'sun' - \"a rebirth,\" which is exactly what this confident, ambitious, charismatic record feels like. \"moon pix (1998) was about extreme isolation and survival in the crazy struggle,\" she says. \"sun is don't look back, pick up, and go confidently into your own future, to personal power and fulfilment.\" the music on 'sun' employs a sweeping stylistic palette: there's the classic cat power haunting guitar and provocative vocal hook in 'cherokee' (\"marry me to the sky...bury me upside down\"); the irresistible latin-sounding nine-piano loop of 'ruin'; upbeat, almost dancey electronic anthems like 'real life' and '3,6,9'; and the stirring, 8-minute epic 'nothin but time,' featuring a vocal cameo by iggy pop. the swagger of 'silent machine' brings to mind mid-70s jagger, contrasted with the unusual, sparse production of 'always on my own'. the narrative arc of the record is deeply optimistic; the music is defiantly modern and global. though devoid of grave bedroom confessionals, 'sun' is possibly cat power's most personal album to date. for all its layered expansiveness, it is as handcrafted as her debut, and never has a cat power album so paralleled her personality and state of mind - channelling her humour, anger, deep empathy, musical inspirations, technical skill, and spiritual inquiry into an album that's both surprising and comforting. those versed in the cat power discography will detect elements of 2003's landmark album 'you are free', which experimented with vocal forms and beats borrowed from urban music, and the spellbinding authority of songs like 'american flag'. \r\n\r\nSonically, however, with credit to mixer philippe zdar (phoenix, chromeo, beastie boys), 'sun' is incredibly fresh, reflecting its forward-looking mindset. 'sun' was recorded over the past three years in malibu (in a studio she built herself), silver lake (in the dust brothers' studio the boat), miami (south beach studios), and paris (motorbass), where she mixed with zdar in spring 2012.

Crazy time, crazy place. To a few thousand internet people, the release of Animal Collective’s Merriweather Post Pavilion seemed like a happening of such monolithic import that the inauguration of Barack Obama, continued implosion of the world’s economy, etcetera, etcetera felt like trivial, even presumptuous distractions in comparison.\r\n\r\nAlmost four years and one tangential ‘visual album’ later, Animal Collective’s ninth LP proper has conspicuously failed to reduce the internet to a quivering nerdgasm. Partly that's because Centipede Hz comes out in release-packed September, not desolate January; partly it's because bands just don’t sustain that sort of hype over two records; partly it's because the cover art is, frankly, less rad than MPP’s.\r\n\r\nBut mostly, I’ve got to confess, it’s because Centipede Hz is less good than Merriweather Post Pavilion, and I suppose in this review I should be taking Animal Collective to task over it. Curse you Animal Collective, for Centipede Hz’s knotty, over-tangled electronic sounds, wherein a general over-abundance of pounding, luminous noises – possibly ushered in by the need to accommodate the returning Deakin, who has been off allegedly defrauding people on Kickstarter on sabbatical – tends to obfuscate the actual songcraft. Damn your eyes, Animal Collective, for constructing a record whose busily chattering electronics tend to baffle and entangle the joy in Avey Tare and Panda Bear’s voices, shielding us from the radiant rush that made MPP and Feels so transcendent.

And while those particular sounds might not be immediately traceable among the elements arranged herein, the desolate, isolated nature of the abandoned settlement pervades the album that it inspired.\r\nIt’s a mood fitting for these songs, more sober and ambitious than Efterklang have previously attempted. Past albums enchanted with music box electronica and neo-classical chamber pop, but Piramida is weightier, grappling with loss and with feeling lost, with the crises that come with age, the self-doubt that follows heartbreak.\r\n\r\nHollow Mountain sets the tone, finding Casper Clausen in the dark of an endless night, sounding courageous but exhausted: “And I wonder, I wonder, I wonder / What I am.” His baritone recalls the solemn richness of Scott Walker, evoking an existential restlessness, a resigned heroism, perfectly suiting Piramida’s darker moments.\r\n\r\nOn Apples, Clausen bids farewell to his love, murmuring forlornly “Run away, run away… you are forgotten,” as Morricone-esque horns sound stoic reveries behind him, lending a widescreen sweep to the melodrama. Sedna slips from choral blare into a muted soul groove, as Clausen finds himself (as Stevie Nicks once sang) drowning in the sea of love, submerged, overwhelmed, claustrophobic.\r\n\r\nAmid such moments of sublime drama and high stakes balladry – understated but never undernourished – Piramida’s flashes of brightness are powerful. The interlacing polyrhythms and gossamer harmonies of Told to Be Fine evoke Wild Combination-era Arthur Russell, and Talking Heads at their sweetest, a deep confection rush. The falsetto soul croons of Between the Walls are heady and joyous, and The Ghost might be Piramida’s finest stroke, a chimeric glide of a song moving to a sleek Afrobeat shuffle and irresistible bassline.\r\n\r\nThis see-saw, between exquisite gloom and bruised hope, is part of what makes Piramida so powerful. Their other albums proved Efterklang’s playfulness could charm, but here the group bravely embraces darker themes and moods, grazing the profound but never throwing off their lightness of touch. Rarely have the Serious Young Man Blues been articulated with such grace, so affectingly.\r\n\r\n--Ian Wade - BBC","options":[{"id":28254296,"name":"Vinyl LP","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28254299,"name":"Compact Disc","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/88438766/-/efterklang-piramida.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/88438766/-/efterklang-piramida.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1634043,"name":"Indie / Rock / Alternative","permalink":"indie-rock-alternative","url":"/category/indie-rock-alternative"},{"id":4383542,"name":"Latest","permalink":"latest","url":"/category/latest"}]},{"id":8997224,"name":"Purity Ring - Shrines","permalink":"purity-ring-shrines","position":57,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/purity-ring-shrines","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-17T20:46:44.000Z","description":"An unholy welding of glassy, minimal rap production and the sort of robotic vocals Dubstar used to do so well (miss u), Purity Ring scream of 2012, but just about have enough heart to carry them out of the novelty realm into real life.

But none of his hired-gun gigs – Isobel Campbell, Greg Dulli, Soulsavers – holds a candle to his first solo album since 2004’s Bubblegum. Blues Funeral deepens his pitch while exhibiting a range and grace beyond his death’s-head profile: you wouldn’t mistake it for anyone else, but its intoxicating potency and surprise swerves elude concerns that his outlaw front might calcify in cliché.\r\nThe Gravedigger’s Song packs pile-driving proof that he’s more than anyone’s side-man. Wise to the shadow his walking-dead reputation casts before him, Lanegan sings of \"piranha teeth\" bared, invoking images of a vampire (or ex-junkie) driven by dark appetites. His muscular band size up to his voice with the required fearlessness; Dulli and Queens of the Stone Age’s Alain Johannes and Josh Homme number among the powerhouse posse thickening the album’s air.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent heart-stopping plummet into Bleeding Muddy Water’s soul-sick dirge typifies the high-drama rollercoaster sequencing here: vertiginous highs, queasy comedowns. Detours to the book of hard-living clichés (\"these tears are liquor\") occur but Lanegan also conjures stop-you-dead images of an evocative, lived-in power (\"a mountain of dust that burns in your mouth\"). Phantasmagoria Blues and St Louis Elegy haunt familiar turf – wracked confessional and high-plains howler respectively – but he sells them with the conviction and character he invested in his magisterial 1999 covers set, I’ll Take Care of You.\r\n\r\nAnd the double-takers? On Ode to Sad Disco, Lanegan essays gliding electro-pop, a jaw-dropping move executed with jaw-dropping assurance; on Harborview Hospital, his vocal verges on rueful (\"All around this place / I was a sad disgrace\"), a rarity for a man not renowned for looking back. Both take his voice’s weathered grace to fresh heights, as does the lysergic, synth-laced psychedelia of the closing Tiny Grain of Truth, where Lanegan casts himself as a \"firewalker… neon priest… junky doctor… shadow king\", drifting into the \"city at night\". Whichever Lanegan you prefer, his is a mighty voice of formidably expressive multitudes, here given room to roam, and to roar.\r\n\r\n--Kevin Harley - BBC","options":[{"id":28215203,"name":"Vinyl LP","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/88440974/-/marklan-bluesfuneral.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/88440974/-/marklan-bluesfuneral.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1634043,"name":"Indie / Rock / Alternative","permalink":"indie-rock-alternative","url":"/category/indie-rock-alternative"},{"id":4383542,"name":"Latest","permalink":"latest","url":"/category/latest"}]},{"id":8997035,"name":"Grizzly Bear - Shields","permalink":"grizzly-bear-shields","position":61,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/grizzly-bear-shields","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-17T20:37:25.000Z","description":"Few guitar bands capture the ethereal quite as well as Warp veterans Grizzly Bear, and while they might welcome comparisons with fellow New Yorkers The Dirty Projectors or revered post-rockers Tortoise they’re pretty much unmistakable to listen to. ‘Shields’ is a grandiose continuation of the themes explored on ‘Veckatimest’, and keeps up the nauseatingly high production value too – again giving us the thought that there’s not a snare out of place. What makes ‘Shields’ so listenable though is not the silky, tape-saturated production (although that helps) – it’s the songs, buoyed by Daniel Rossen’s characteristically melancholy vocals. Just flip to ‘Yet Again’, which sidesteps the usual Grizzly Bear complexity (hello ‘Sleeping Ute’) in favour of good old-fashioned songwriting. This is the kind of writing that no doubt endears the band to their throng of famous fans (hey, when Jay-Z’s singing your praises you’ve probably made it) and it’s certainly the glue that holds ‘Shields’ together.","options":[{"id":28214885,"name":"vinyl LP","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/88439846/-/grizzlybear-shields.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/88439846/-/grizzlybear-shields.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1634043,"name":"Indie / Rock / Alternative","permalink":"indie-rock-alternative","url":"/category/indie-rock-alternative"},{"id":4383542,"name":"Latest","permalink":"latest","url":"/category/latest"}]},{"id":8997005,"name":"Actress - RIP","permalink":"actress-rip","position":62,"price":21.0,"default_price":21.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/actress-rip","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-17T20:35:53.000Z","description":"Two years since 'Splazsh' topped a stack of annual polls, Actress presents his 3rd, and most coherent album, 'R.I.P' - his 2nd for Honest Jon's. Despite being a vital cog in the machinery of underground UK dance and electronics since at least 2004 (when he released his 'No Tricks' debut), it's fair to say that it's only in the last few years he's made the shift from cult concern to acknowledged auteur of some repute. His work with Damon Albarn's DRC Music, beside a legendary DJ set at Sonar and killer remixes of Shangaan Electro, Panda Bear and Radiohead all certify the fact; so expectations are no doubt set high for 'R.I.P'. Produced exclusively on hardware and inspired by Milton's classic poem 'Paradise Lost', he's arranged his most labyrinthine, esoteric release to date; a timeless set of 15 tracks traversing crystallized radiophonics and subterranean Techno with a psychedelic sideswipe that leaves us dazed and beguiled. By assimilating machine-like characteristics - his notions of \"seeping yourself liquid into the machinery\" and \"I'm just an instrument, I'm completely dead when I write\" - he's become an interpreter, a symbiotic conduit of semi-lucid visions into the interzone whose revelations contain the potential to manipulate your consciousness in magical ways compared to the prosaic intentions of so much bland and overwrought electronic music out there. The newfound clarity and fluid narration of 'R.I.P.' makes this the most intriguing chapter in the Actress saga so far - an unmissable experience.","options":[{"id":28214792,"name":"vinyl LP","price":21.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/88439606/-/actress_rip.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/88439606/-/actress_rip.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4383542,"name":"Latest","permalink":"latest","url":"/category/latest"},{"id":4427354,"name":"Electronic","permalink":"electronic","url":"/category/electronic"}]},{"id":8996984,"name":"Field Music - Plumb","permalink":"field-music-plumb","position":63,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/field-music-plumb","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-17T20:33:50.000Z","description":"A new Field Music album is always a delicious proposition – and this, the band's fourth, offers much to sate the appetite. Off-kilter song structures, a rhythm section reminiscent of the kitchen drawer being emptied at the top of the stairs, and frequent homage paid to the protagonists of new wave all characterise the approach of Sunderland brothers Peter and David Brewis throughout Plumb.\r\nThe pair recently joked that the band had become more multicultural – Peter's moved up to Newcastle and their new bassist, Andrew Lowther, has a season ticket at St James' Park. But Field Music's endearingly weird Wearside aesthetic remains in place. Plumb ploughs furrows that the band and its listeners have explored together before. As Loyd Grossman might intone: \"The asymmetric pop, the slinky sing-alongs, the noirish noises...\" All are present and correct.\r\n\r\nIf anything the brothers have upped the wonk factor on Plumb: the home-made beats and undersea bubbling on Choosing Sides present a real challenge to your ears. It’s a particularly good example of the fare this lot trade in, its tempo and character shifting like the sands. In comparison, some of the straighter songs can seem a little underwhelming – for example, A Prelude to Pilgrim Street is a decidedly flat glam blowout. But such lacklustre moments are few.\r\n\r\nUnusually, Plumb’s final song sounds like it should be its first. First single (I Keep Thinking About) A New Thing is a rousing, pleasing stomp, comprising this album's answer to previous 'hits' such as Effortlessly and In Context. Although there aren't more efforts like this, there is a thread of romantic disappointment which neatly and appealingly runs through the record. On the wonderfully English-sounding Sorry Again, Mate – the song title alone will have Anglophile Americans reaching for Skype to contact someone (anyone) they know across the Pond for some soothing British diction – there are lovely licks of sadness and solitude. \"Can I afford another day on my own / Sat in the kitchen with the radio on?\" the band asks, forlornly.\r\n\r\nThis suburban, provincial sweetness – a tasty concoction far removed from the fashion-focussed silliness of London in both geography and intent – is eminently loveable. Not that the Mackem minstrels can't go glitzy. Listen to A New Town. It sounds like a Justin Timberlake track. That alone is a boggling but brilliant statement of intent, wouldn't you say?","options":[{"id":28214729,"name":"vinyl LP","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/88439402/-/fieldmusic-plumb.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/88439402/-/fieldmusic-plumb.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1634043,"name":"Indie / Rock / Alternative","permalink":"indie-rock-alternative","url":"/category/indie-rock-alternative"},{"id":4383542,"name":"Latest","permalink":"latest","url":"/category/latest"}]},{"id":7013091,"name":"James Yorkston - I Was a Cat from a Book","permalink":"james-yorkston-i-was-a-cat-from-a-book","position":64,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/james-yorkston-i-was-a-cat-from-a-book","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-20T18:30:25.000Z","description":"His first album since 2008's When The Haar Rolls In, I Was A Cat From A Book finds James playing with a new band comprised of members of Lamb & The Cinematic Orchestra alongside old friends.

No other Australian band has ever impacted on international music in such a subversive fashion. This is a band that exists within itself and outside of itself, generating a massive (and massively influential) body of work.\r\n\r\nNothing else sounds like the Dirty Three. They are one-off phenomena. As Warren Ellis says: “There is a dialogue within the group that we are all still keen to explore”.\r\n\r\nToward The Low Sun is not a cosy, nice-to-be-back, return to the comfort zone. There is an energy and a raw excitement evident from the first electrifying opening moments through to the album’s finale. In Warren’s words, “Dirty Three has always been about the way we play together and feed off each other. We wanted this one to be a return to the more improvised and instinctive approach of the earlier recordings”. And indeed Toward The Low Sun sounds like a first ever recording, a punk avant-garde art-jazz record!

Whether he initiated the slide, and/or faked it are the kind of questions you're left with, but either way it was a heavy trip.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not bringing this up in order to compare characters (even though James Jackson Toth is attended by more than his share of myths and tragedies) I'm just thinking that this record would make the perfect soundtrack. But if you haven't seen the movie or heard Wooden Wand before you're probably feeling bored and mildly alienated by now. So... well, he's an American songwriter...\r\n\r\nIt's a lot like Richard Thompson circa 73, in that it delivers a dose of spiritual nourishment with the occasional bitter after taste (Toth also has that shade of a snarl in his voice on the darker tracks). Introspection, fear (of oneself and others), drunken debauchery, redemption, lostness and plain happy-to-have-made-it-throughness make this a grippingly honest record. \r\n\r\nThe songs are built on brittle acoustic strums, electric guitars haunt and taunt. If this captures your imagination you'll be ripe for the abundant lyrical harvest - Wand tells you how he sees the world in no uncertain terms, except when he's feeling uncertain.","options":[{"id":10330837,"name":"vinyl","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29050823/-/wooden-wand-death-seat-400x400.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29050823/-/wooden-wand-death-seat-400x400.jpg","width":400,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1634040,"name":"Folk Americana","permalink":"folk-americana","url":"/category/folk-americana"},{"id":1709806,"name":"Psych Folk & Rock","permalink":"psych-folk-rock","url":"/category/psych-folk-rock"}]},{"id":2929703,"name":"Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings - I Learned the Hard Way","permalink":"sharon-jones-and-the-dap-kings-i-learned-the-hard-way","position":77,"price":14.0,"default_price":14.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sharon-jones-and-the-dap-kings-i-learned-the-hard-way","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-11-25T15:47:15.000Z","description":"Another top notch funky outing from the estimable Sharon Jones and her band of soul brothers.

Simple acoustic fingerpicking, kind of lazy, kind of urgent, just like the lyrics. Callahan’s voice is only getting better with time, it sounds a resonant deep brown, with occasional flashes of black, blue, green and red. The string arrangements are sublime, with gusts carrying scents of an old world, rich spices and sea air. I reckon this is a record for the afternoon. It is up there with the first Callahan release ‘Woke On A Whaleheart’ and with some albums from his previous Smog moniker like ‘Supper’ (both also available from us). It’s a new direction, with a defiantly new feel which seems already settled on the mans brooding/shrugging shoulders.

The singers voice is deep, richly coloured and heavy. When it trembles it rings like a bell. Trouble is, I hate most alt-country. The ones that use old sounds and arrangements to plump up the same duff heart-yawn-sleeve songwriting that used to paddle the backwaters of grunge in the 90's and moved on to country/folk after a brief dabble with a synth in 2002. \r\n\r\nBut I love this record so very much, so I constantly feel like beating those pesky music journalists with the yard stick they rode in on. This doesn't mean that you won't like this if you do happen to like Yawn McYawnsville and the Yawners (and Sons), it just means there's something different going on here which elevates it. The lyrics take classic images and drape them over the funny shaped pathos that I'm trying to wrestle with myself...

Recorded at Bryn Derwen within the wilds of the Snowdonian mountains, and during all night sessions in the relative tranquillity of their local village hall, Shape Of The Shape is an album of contrasting styles, themes and approaches that coheres beautifully into a seamless entity. We get guided through verses and choruses of swamp rock, gothic bluesy chanson and smoky acoustic ballads, as well as a jazz-folk tinged instrumental – after all the band take their name from the classic 1965 Stan Tracey cut – but the apogee of this collection is the driving drone-choral opus, Les Furies - sung in French, this is a very Gallic observation of after hours culture. And while this album traverses all these different styles, the band never deny the importance of a fine tune and a fine song.
