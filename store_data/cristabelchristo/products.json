Of course, I also owe a lot to Andr√© Breton. However, my work is never purely surreal. There is always a germ of a story behind each piece\". Her assemblages address specific subjects - while retaining some mystery.\r\n\r\nThere is a strange aura surrounding this artist, an almost impenetrable wall that so obscures her it is impossible to differentiate fact from fiction. She seems lost in a world of her own and the number of followers peering into this world is growing steadily. Only collectors of her art can truly get close to understanding this incredible artist.\r\n\r\nCristabel's work is best described as Outsider Art, or Art Brut, a label created by French artist Jean Dubuffet to describe art created outside the boundaries of official culture; Dubuffet focused particularly on art by insane asylum inmates and this is a subject that pre-occupies Cristabel. Her art illustrates extreme mental states, unconventional ideas, and elaborate fantasy worlds. For many reasons, she prefers to remain outside the \"art world\" mainstream.\r\n\r\nCristabel talks of being inspired to become an artist when she came across the work, \"Rendezvous du Dimanche 6 Fevrier 1916\", by Duchamp. It consisted of four postcards fitted together implying a message but without actual meaning, which Duchamp presented to his neighbors Walter and Louise Arensberg. \"I don't particularly feel the need to be understood, but I do have a strong compulsion to communicate\", she explains.\r\n\r\nHand-signed.\r\n\r\nSize: approx 13 inches x 9 inches. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<img src=\"http://img687.imageshack.us/img687/586/abox2300.jpg\">\r\n</p><p>\r\n<img src=\"http://img248.imageshack.us/img248/6091/abox2450.jpg\">\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\n<img src=\"http://img685.imageshack.us/img685/6834/abox1450.jpg\">\r\n</p><p>\r\n</p><p>\r\n<img src=\"http://img14.imageshack.us/img14/3746/aboxdet1450.jpg\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<img src=\"http://img5.imageshack.us/img5/4566/aboxdet2450.jpg\">\r\n</p><p>\r\n</p><p>\r\n<img src=\"http://img16.imageshack.us/img16/9028/aboxdet3450.jpg\">\r\n</p><p>\r\n</p><p>\r\n<img src=\"http://img266.imageshack.us/img266/3796/aboxdet4550.jpg\">\r\n</p><p>\r\n</p><p>\r\n<img src=\"http://img594.imageshack.us/img594/7761/aboxdet5800.jpg\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p></p><p>\r\n<img src=\"http://img853.imageshack.us/img853/2580/aboxdet6800.jpg\">\r\n</p><p>\r\n</p><p>\r\n<img src=\"http://img853.imageshack.us/img853/165/aboxdet7450.jpg\">\r\n</p><p>\r\n<img src=\"http://img22.imageshack.us/img22/4221/aboxdet8800.jpg\">\r\n</p><p>\r\n<img src=\"http://img407.imageshack.us/img407/5679/aboxdet9450.jpg\">\r\n</p><p>\r\n</p><p>\r\n<img src=\"http://img706.imageshack.us/img706/9546/aboxbw450.jpg\">\r\n</p><p>\r\n","options":[{"id":28850156,"name":"Default","price":240.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":39.0,"amount_with_others":45.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90563462/-/abox1-450.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90563462/-/abox1-450.jpg","width":450,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4526174,"name":"Artwork","permalink":"artwork","url":"/category/artwork"}]}]
