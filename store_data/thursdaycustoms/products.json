kit is the same as the (vb) kit, apart from an updated LED PCB within the backlight. the wires coming from the backlight are in a reversed order than those of (vb). this doesn't affect which color wire is soldered during installation, it only mean you no longer need to cross the wires during installation, making it cleaner to install. follow the instructions for the (vb) kit, paying attention to the color of the wire you are soldering. when in doubt, the black wire is ground, the colored wire is 5V.","options":[{"id":31997257,"name":"Purple

It is built right into the PCB!\r\n\r\n-Panel mounting:\r\nThis kit should be mounted directly the Game Boy case with the provided screws and spacer.\r\n\r\n-High limiter:\r\nThis will limit how fast it will go. Many devices will crash if pushed too far. \r\nA 10K SMD resistor is pre-soldered for installation into an Original Game Boy(DMG) or Game Boy Pocket(MGB).\r\nIt can easily be removed with a razor blade and you may install a different through hole resistor(an 8K resistor is ideal for the Game Boy Color(CGB).\r\n\r\n-Low Limiter: \r\nWith a 100k-500K pot(higher resistance = lower speed and pitch) this kit will go so slow and low that the LCD will not be visible and the notes will sound like a droning \"growl\"(this can actually be a very awesome effect for music). \r\nThe VCv4.5 comes with a 200K trim pot pre-installed. This will allow you to set the low limit before you install the kit or you can install it at the top or side of an Original Game Boy(DMG) and the low limiter can be accessed through a small hole with a screw driver so that it can be adjusted on the fly. \r\nCheck out this video for a demonstration of how this feature works: \r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHV7cbHpcSU\r\n\r\nYou can purchase this as: \r\n\"Basic kit\" supply your own wire, switch, potentiometer and knob. \r\n\"Full kit\" includes a sub-mini SPDT toggle switch, a micro potentiometer, knob and enough wire to install it into a Game Boy.\r\n\"Installed\" when you order a DMG-01, Pocket or Color and it will be installed in that Game Boy.\r\n\r\nInstallation instructions are in the last picture. \r\nSave the image for higher quality.\r\nA printed version comes with every order!\r\n\r\nThe assembled V4.5 PCB and components measures approximately 1 1/4\"(25mm) long x 3/8\"(9mm) wide x 1/4\"(7mm) thick.","options":[{"id":30532957,"name":"Basic kit","price":15.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30534435,"name":"Full kit","price":20.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":31218760,"name":"Installed","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125810853/-/VCfamilyv4-1.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125810853/-/VCfamilyv4-1.JPG","width":1500,"height":1500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125800023/-/VCv4-01.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125800023/-/VCv4-01.JPG","width":1700,"height":1700},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122596446/-/VCv4.4_installation_guide.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122596446/-/VCv4.4_installation_guide.jpg","width":1275,"height":1650}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2122550,"name":"Original Game Boy","permalink":"original-game-boy","url":"/category/original-game-boy"},{"id":2122552,"name":"Super Game Boy","permalink":"super-game-boy","url":"/category/super-game-boy"},{"id":3402701,"name":"DIY Gear","permalink":"diy-gear","url":"/category/diy-gear"},{"id":4983673,"name":"Variable Clock","permalink":"variable-clock","url":"/category/variable-clock"}]},{"id":6859711,"name":"250K miniature potentiometer","permalink":"250k-miniature-potentiometer","position":28,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/250k-miniature-potentiometer","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-02T09:44:30.000Z","description":"The perfect pot to go along with the Variable Clock DIY kits.
