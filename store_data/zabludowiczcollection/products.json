There are countless dead.  Those who have survived now need urgent help including emergency shelter, clean water and food.\r\n\r\nUsing the silk scarf as a contemporary reimagining of the vanitas still life, the edition features digital scans of ink drawings produced by the artist from an expanding personal archive of images. Here flotsam gathered on the beaches of the Northern Philippines lies alongside domestic objects recovered from zones of conflict and forgotten artefacts stored deep in museum archives. Laid out in a decorative formation, these objects, all that is left of someoneâ€™s life or possessions, become reminiscent of the stars on a flag or jewels on a necklace. Silk scarves are the ultimate luxury object; beautiful and desirable. Abad has regularly returned to this unusual material as his medium, stripping them of their wearable function and employing them as surfaces for the telling of (hi)stories. Here for the first time he has decided to edition one of his usually unique silk artworks in order to raise funds for rescue efforts in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":49816929,"name":"Default","price":500.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128928042/-/Untitled_(Inventory)_I__Updated_web2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128928042/-/Untitled_(Inventory)_I__Updated_web2.jpg","width":1486,"height":1447}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1633163,"name":"Editions","permalink":"editions","url":"/category/editions"}]},{"id":15329856,"name":"Matthew Darbyshire, Holstein Cow, 2013","permalink":"matthew-darbyshire-holstein-cow-2013","position":2,"price":550.0,"default_price":550.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/matthew-darbyshire-holstein-cow-2013","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-04T18:21:43.000Z","description":"John Beswick Holstein cow chromed and distressed by the artist\r\n29.8 x 22 x 14.8 cm\r\nEdition of 10 + 1 AP\r\n\r\nMatthew Darbyshire's latest edition following the sell-out success of his previous collaborations with the gallery: <a href=\"http://shop.zabludowiczcollection.com/product/matthew-darbyshire-i-goldfinch-1-to-10-i-2011\">Goldfinch</a>, 2011 and <a href=\"http://shop.zabludowiczcollection.com/product/matthew-darbyshire-africa-baby-elephant-calf-2011 \">Africa Baby Elephant Calf</a>, 2011.\r\nLimited Edition Artwork produced for the Zabludowicz Collection.","options":[{"id":49854705,"name":"Default","price":550.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128813184/-/Matthew_Darbyshire_Cow_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128813184/-/Matthew_Darbyshire_Cow_3.jpg","width":4752,"height":3168},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128813088/-/Matthew_Darbyshire_Cow_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128813088/-/Matthew_Darbyshire_Cow_1.jpg","width":4752,"height":3168},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128813130/-/Matthew_Darbyshire_Cow_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128813130/-/Matthew_Darbyshire_Cow_2.jpg","width":4752,"height":3168},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128813208/-/Matthew_Darbyshire_Cow_4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128813208/-/Matthew_Darbyshire_Cow_4.jpg","width":4752,"height":3168}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1633163,"name":"Editions","permalink":"editions","url":"/category/editions"}]},{"id":13989321,"name":"Andy Holden, Happy Woodlidays: When The Stars were The Map Of All Possible Paths, 2013","permalink":"andy-holden-happy-woodlidays-when-the-stars-were-the-map-of-all-possible-paths-2013","position":3,"price":310.0,"default_price":310.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/andy-holden-happy-woodlidays-when-the-stars-were-the-map-of-all-possible-paths-2013","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-05T15:01:14.000Z","description":"Laminated wood and stickers\r\nDimensions variable\r\n\r\nEdition of 7    \r\n\r\nPlease contact us for more details and to select your edition at info@zabludowiczcollection.com.       \r\n\r\nLimited Edition Artwork produced for the Zabludowicz Collection to accompany the exhibition <a href=\"http://www.zabludowiczcollection.com/london/exhibitions/annual-commission-andy-holden\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Andy Holden, Maximum Irony, Maximum Sincerity 1999-2003: Towards a Unified Theory of MI!MS</i></a>  (26 September 2013 -

The phrase â€˜the thin red lineâ€™ derives from the Crimean War, when during the Battle of Balaclava on 25th October 1854 the heavily depleted British Armyâ€™s 93rd regiment faced a Russian cavalry charge with a line of men only two deep instead of the conventional four. The soldiers were led by Sir Colin Campbell, who is said to have told his men â€™There is no retreat from here, men. You must die where you standâ€™.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.zabludowiczcollection.com/collection/artists/iain-forsyth-jane-pollard\" target=\"_blank\">Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard at zabludowiczcollection.com</a>\r\n\r\nAll proceeds from our editions are split equally between the artist and the Zabludowicz Collection <a href=\"http://www.zabludowiczcollection.com/london/events/\" target=\"_blank\">Interaction Programme.</a>","options":[{"id":9850667,"name":"Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard","price":275.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":20.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27254964/-/_MG_9610.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27254964/-/_MG_9610.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27254972/-/_MG_9601.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27254972/-/_MG_9601.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27282940/-/_MG_9595.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27282940/-/_MG_9595.jpg","width":667,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1633163,"name":"Editions","permalink":"editions","url":"/category/editions"},{"id":1672610,"name":"Featured","permalink":"featured","url":"/category/featured"}]},{"id":2816321,"name":"Gerry Fox, <i>Living London Vanitas</i>, 2008","permalink":"gerry-fox-living-london-vanitas-2008","position":47,"price":140.0,"default_price":140.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/gerry-fox-living-london-vanitas-2008","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-10-22T22:25:59.000Z","description":"2 channel DVD\r\n\r\nEdition of 40\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.zabludowiczcollection.com/collection/artists/gerry-fox\" target=\"_blank\">Gerry Fox at zabludowiczcollection.com</a>\r\n\r\nAll proceeds from our editions are split equally between the artist and the Zabludowicz Collection <a href=\"http://www.zabludowiczcollection.com/london/events/\" target=\"_blank\">Interaction Programme.</a>","options":[{"id":9850692,"name":"Gerry Fox","price":140.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":20.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27255032/-/_MG_9529-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27255032/-/_MG_9529-2.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27255036/-/_MG_9522-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27255036/-/_MG_9522-2.jpg","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27255040/-/_MG_9525.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27255040/-/_MG_9525.jpg","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27255049/-/_MG_9527.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27255049/-/_MG_9527.jpg","width":667,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1633163,"name":"Editions","permalink":"editions","url":"/category/editions"},{"id":1672610,"name":"Featured","permalink":"featured","url":"/category/featured"}]},{"id":2816332,"name":"Ryan Gander, <i>Investigation #4 - Meaning's all around me now</i>, 2010","permalink":"ryan-gander-investigation-4-meanings-all-around-me-now-2010","position":48,"price":385.0,"default_price":385.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ryan-gander-investigation-4-meanings-all-around-me-now-2010","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-10-22T22:30:51.000Z","description":"3D Viewfinder and reel\r\n\r\nEdition of 25\r\n\r\nProduced to coincide with The Library of Babel / In and Out of Place, an exhibition of more than 200 works from the Zabludowicz Collection curated by Anna-Catharina Gebbers as a result of her residency with the collection.\r\n\r\nGander created a hanging model depicting elements of the Didactease emblem in 3D form; the image reel features 14 3D photographs of this model, an image of the emblem itself is shown on the centre of the reel.

FEW AVAILABLE\r\n\r\nA reminder of one of the busiest and most fun series of events the Zabludowicz Collection has ever hosted, this T-shirt is a must for anyone who visited, participated or wishes they'd been to Club Ponderosa, created by Matt Stokes in 2009.\r\n\r\nThe T-shirt is emblazoned on the back with a graphic adaptation of the Sioux symbol for shelter, designed by Stokes as the logo for Club Ponderosa.\r\n\r\nClub Ponderosa was established by Matt Stokes during an artist's residency with the Zabludowicz Collection 176. The impressive building that houses the gallery was formerly a Methodist Chapel, built in 1867, and once home to the infamous London Drama Centre. Drawing from this history, the club occupied the rear exhibition space (which was often used by the chapel and LDC for public performances), and operated as part meeting house, nightclub, theatre, village hall and social club. It opened its doors on the 22nd February 2009.\r\n\r\nThe aim of Club Ponderosa was to create an informal and flexible social-space that would foster new encounters between groups, and act as a catalyst for the creation of events designed and programmed in collaboration with people living or working in the Camden area. Use of the space and entry was free, and events had a non-commercial emphasis. Participants included non-profit theatre groups, musicians and bands, ecological and historical societies, informal collectives, craftspeople, fashion designers and artists â€¦ and many more.\r\n\r\nThe club closed on the 27th June 2009, and the myspace page that publicised events during its existence, now acts as a record of what took place:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/clubponderosa/\" target=\"_blank\">Club Ponderosa on Myspace</a>\r\n","options":[{"id":9857425,"name":"Classic Girl Fit - Medium","price":16.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9857426,"name":"Classic Girl Fit - Large","price":16.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9857427,"name":"Standard Fit - Large","price":16.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":20.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27283407/-/_MG_9702.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27283407/-/_MG_9702.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27283411/-/_MG_9700.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27283411/-/_MG_9700.jpg","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27283415/-/_MG_9701.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27283415/-/_MG_9701.jpg","width":667,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1633163,"name":"Editions","permalink":"editions","url":"/category/editions"},{"id":1672610,"name":"Featured","permalink":"featured","url":"/category/featured"}]},{"id":3352780,"name":"Jack Strange <i>Â£100 - Â£200</i>, 2010","permalink":"jack-strange-i-100-195-i-2010","position":67,"price":200.0,"default_price":200.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/jack-strange-i-100-195-i-2010","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-02-28T23:51:34.000Z","description":"Single hole punches from different five pound notes mounted free hand in a circle onto smooth plate finished bristol board.\r\n\r\n209 x 296 mm (unframed)\r\n\r\nSeries of 21\r\n\r\nLimited edition artwork produced exclusively for the Zabludowicz Collection.
