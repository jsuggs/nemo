The Kinfolk team explores how the older folks in our lives can teach us how to live more fully and how to embrace each new candle on our cake with style and grace. As some anonymous old chap once said, “Age is an issue of mind over matter. If you don’t mind, it doesn’t matter.” While many magazines pressure readers to hang on to youth, Kinfolk investigates how our lives are enriched by the people, meals and traditions of things past. One writer considers the inevitable day you realize you’re turning into your mother, while another reflects on the way life—like fruit—is about picking that perfectly ripe moment. Chefs share family recipes they’ve perfected over time, classic recipes updated for the modern era and a holiday menu that's easy to chew. There are gray hairs and salt-and-pepper beards, napping tips and ancient culinary tools. The connection? Everything in this issue gets better, or tastier, with age.\r\n\r\nKinfolk caters to a growing readership of young artists and food enthusiasts by focusing on simple ways to spend time together.\r\n\r\nEach issue combines lyrical essays, recipes, interviews, personal stories and practical tips with a keen attention to design and details.\r\n\r\n“Kinfolk is a food magazine about people. Kinfolk is about\r\ngatherings, the meetings of minds around the table and\r\nthe rituals that surround eating, rather than big blow-out\r\nmeals and complex culinary feasts.”\r\n\r\n144 pages, offset-printed, perfect bound, full colour on uncoated paper.

They are fascinating, striking human depictions of the natural world and a beautiful way of displaying data.\r\n\r\nDeep Blue Maps are a fantastic way to share 'secret' camping and fishing spots or even landmarks to be discovered. They're a real conversation piece, and a great gift for hard-to-shop-for Brisbane boys (and design savvy girls) in your life.  \r\n\r\nSize: 675mm by 500mm by 40mm\r\nEach map comes framed in white wood grain.\r\n\r\nColours are cream white and blue. \r\n(We can also do one in brass for you for a cool 9k!) \r\n\r\nAvailable to be shipped to anywhere in Australia.\r\n\r\nEach map is custom made, so if you'd like to discuss any preferences, please get in touch with me via the contact section and I'll pass your message on to Tom, the artisan cartographer. \r\n\r\nFor more information about Tom and how he makes his maps, you can check out <a title=\"The Spring Blog\" href=\"http://www.thespringblog.com/2013/11/3d-maps-brisbane-bayside-deep-blue-maps/\" target=\"_blank\">our blog post on Deep Blue Maps over here</a>.\r\n\r\n*Our 10% 'Welcome to the List' gift code is not valid on this piece of art.
