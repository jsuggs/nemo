This well loved swivel rocker was stripped bare to its hard wood frame, new cushions of high density foam cut, fresh Dacron padding and EXQUISITE gray mohair fabric added to create what amounts to a brand new chair that will last another 50 years!\r\n\r\nMohair is the soft, velvety fabric often used in high traffic areas like symphony seats and train benches. Wool comes from sheep. Mohair comes from a goat. So if you are allergic or sensitive to wool, this is a perfect long wearing fiber for you.\r\n\r\nThe color is a deep, neutral charcoal gray that catches the light and just radiates, as seen by the photos. It is a very easy color to work with and hides a multitude of sins...like cheeto fingers.\r\n\r\nPlease contact me regarding shipping for this item.

Perfect for placing in front of a vanity (as shown here) or a corner in a bedroom or closet...or just about anywhere in a perfectly groomed chick pad!\r\n\r\nThere are casters on the bottom of the hardwood frame for ease of rolling from place to place. The soft velvet fabric has a black and white diamond pattern that is reminiscent of Gabrielle Coco Chanel (that's why I nick-named her the \"Gabrielle\" chair). A little black pillow is all she needs to dress it up or down. Ask me about a custom design!\r\n\r\nThis little beauty started out a bit bedraggled. SOMEBODY had the audacity to PAINT the fabric from blue to pink...really? So what was once a great fabric, was stripped off, new foam and Dacron added and every diamond in the soft velvet matched up with precision.\r\n\r\nPlease convo me regarding shipping for this item.
