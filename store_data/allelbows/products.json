It's loose and slightly oversized, but shorter than our regular t-shirt. I like to pair it with leggings and ballet shoes.  Or leg warmers and booty shorts.  \r\n\r\nThis is a limited edition, there are only 19 of them left as of this post. \r\n\r\nIt's super soft just like our black tee, but with cuffs at the bottom of the shirt and sleeves.  Perfect for sudden dance moves. A little heavier weave than the tee.  Seriously comfy.\r\n\r\nNote: I am 5'3\" and usually a small -- I wear a medium in this shirt because it looks awesome oversized.  Keep that in mind when ordering.","options":[{"id":16486167,"name":"Small","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16486169,"name":"Medium","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16486171,"name":"Large","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":17.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49862201/-/002_shirt.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49862201/-/002_shirt.jpg","width":950,"height":633}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":253470,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":2672524,"name":"Black Heather All Elbows Logo Tee","permalink":"black-heather-all-elbows-logo-tee","position":2,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/black-heather-all-elbows-logo-tee","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-07-27T03:43:01.000Z","description":"RESTOCKED! Lovely All Elbows Logo Tee, on a soft tri-blend shirt of Cotton, Polyester, and Rayon in a black heather (think athletic shirt) fabric.  They're thin and lightweight and make me extremely proud.  We'll have real photos up later but for now, that's me in a women's extra small.  I'm 5'3\" with a small build. \r\n\r\nThese are slimmer fitting than say, Hanes shirts, similar in width to our previous shirt (but longer in the body).  We stock XS to XL and I heartily recommend the XS for midgets like me and S and M for normal women.  <a href=\"http://www.allelbows.com/sizechart.html\">Click here for size chart.</a>  Measure your chest and natural waist, that's the best way to find your size.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheck out our <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=196449&id=77726452230\">facebook gallery with awesome people wearing out shirt!</a>\r\n\r\n\r\nAs always, we travel quite heavily and ship these out ourselves.  If you order while we're on the road, I can't ship it until we return.  But these are worth waiting for.  Generally, we ship once a week, every Monday.\r\n\r\nIt's my favorite shirt in my entire wardrobe and I rarely wear t-shirts. Actually, everyone who has one writes me and tells me how much they love their shirt. So what are you waiting for?\r\n\r\nReceive a coozy with every t-shirt ordered! \r\n\r\nWE ARE SOLD OUT OF LARGE and XL SHIRTS! But we have TWO small shirts (Unisex Small). Very very low stock. We will be restocking in about four weeks, with new stuff too!\r\n","options":[{"id":9423809,"name":"Extra Small ","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9423812,"name":"Small","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16476155,"name":"Medium","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16476157,"name":"XXL","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25777667/-/101.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25777667/-/101.jpg","width":900,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":253470,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]}]
