The decorative night sky seemed like the perfect companion to explore my dreams and desires to balance a sense of freedom and integrity in my work.\r\n\r\nThe result is a deeply layered, commanding and insightful Artwork, which you can stare at for hours and find new symbols and riches.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nARTWORK DETAILS:\r\n\r\n- Large Original Artwork on Canvas \r\n- Dimensions = 20\" x 24\" x 1.5\" deep \r\n- Features Acrylic paint, printed papers and rich, thick texture throughout\r\n- Artwork extends around edges of Canvas \r\n- Comes signed, dated and ready to hang\r\n\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nSHIPPING & PAYMENT:\r\n\r\n- Payment via Paypal and Credit Card \r\n- Lay By available within Australia, please see 'Shop Info' tab for terms and conditions \r\n- Packaged in bubble wrap and carefully boxed for postage \r\n- Shipped by professional courier \r\n- Price includes FREE shipping for all capital cities within Australia.\r\n\r\n**Please contact me for shipping quotes for locations outside of Australia capital cities and international orders. art@chrissyforemanc.com.au\r\n\r\nThank You for viewing my work!\r\n\r\nâ™¥ Chrissy Foreman C.","options":[{"id":43034595,"name":"Default","price":1000.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124000737/-/Grounded_shop_border.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124000737/-/Grounded_shop_border.jpg","width":624,"height":734},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124000752/-/Grounded_central_detail_shop.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124000752/-/Grounded_central_detail_shop.jpg","width":570,"height":380},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124000773/-/grounded_shop_detial_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124000773/-/grounded_shop_detial_2.jpg","width":570,"height":380},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124000758/-/grounded_shop_detial_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124000758/-/grounded_shop_detial_1.jpg","width":570,"height":380},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124000785/-/grounded_shop_detail_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124000785/-/grounded_shop_detail_3.jpg","width":570,"height":380}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4546664,"name":"Paintings","permalink":"paintings","url":"/category/paintings"}]},{"id":13445910,"name":"RISE -
