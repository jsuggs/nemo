Not even the doctor who cradled you into this world can say otherwise, for you were beautiful before he laid his eyes upon you. You were beautiful from your very first heart beat, and to your very last breath, you will be beautiful. The people on the streets; they have yet to know true beauty, for they have yet to see you. But sight is not reliable. Sometimes we see things that are not truly there. Feelings and sounds are unreliable as well. Sometimes we hear and feel things that are fake, but you, you are a new kind of exception: a remarkable breakthrough that naturally occurred.
