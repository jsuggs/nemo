After I fired the first pmc heart out of the mold it was curved so I hit it with a hammer like I usually do with metal…and broke the broken heart in 2 pieces. So, it needed some repair work. \r\n\r\nThe original was reinforced in the rear with a sterling silver Silversmyth tag soldered across the crack and in the front with a Band-aid. I ended up lending the original to a friend going through a tough time.  She's all better now but, there is no way she's giving it back.  \r\n\r\nIt you like it then you ought to put a ring on it… \r\n\r\nI mean if you like it I made a mold of it and I can make more.  \r\n\r\nHearts are Fine Silver .999, Jumpring is Sterling Silver.\r\nNow completely available for purchase!  I make each one at a time so, allow up 2 weeks for delivery.  \r\n\r\nThe necklace will arrive with an adjustable dark brown leather cord but you'll probably want to move it to another more permanent chain for the long haul because life has it's bumps in the road.\r\n\r\nThe individual photo (that has grass in it) is of the original... the picture of two is what they look like molded up in fine silver.\r\n\r\nemail: info@silversmyth.com","options":[{"id":50999364,"name":"Default","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129682500/-/bandaidheart.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129682500/-/bandaidheart.jpg","width":918,"height":670},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129682191/-/Patched_Heart.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129682191/-/Patched_Heart.jpg","width":2742,"height":2173},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129682143/-/bandaidhearts.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129682143/-/bandaidhearts.jpg","width":1482,"height":1596}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1543067,"name":"necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"},{"id":2094522,"name":"under $100","permalink":"under-100","url":"/category/under-100"}]},{"id":15665772,"name":"Wise Old Owl on Brown Leather Cord in Fine Silver","permalink":"wise-old-owl-on-brown-leather-cord-in-fine-silver","position":2,"price":58.0,"default_price":58.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wise-old-owl-on-brown-leather-cord-in-fine-silver","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-19T23:10:56.000Z","description":" I hand carved this adorable owl and made a mold however each piece is hand finished and additional carving is done before the final product is fired.  \r\n\r\nI will place the owl on and adjustable leather cord but you can switch it out to any chain you like.  \r\n\r\nEach owl weighs approximately 5.5 grams.\r\n\r\nThis fine Silver Owl is only available through this website. \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":50964336,"name":"Owl on brown leather cord","price":58.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129658797/-/owl6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129658797/-/owl6.jpg","width":1056,"height":990},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129658788/-/owl5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129658788/-/owl5.jpg","width":1338,"height":972},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129658809/-/owl7.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129658809/-/owl7.jpg","width":2178,"height":1686}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1543067,"name":"necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"},{"id":2094522,"name":"under $100","permalink":"under-100","url":"/category/under-100"}]},{"id":15089607,"name":"Sterling Silver Cuff Bracelet","permalink":"sterling-silver-cuff-bracelet","position":3,"price":97.0,"default_price":97.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sterling-silver-cuff-bracelet","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-25T15:49:30.000Z","description":"Made from 20 gauge sterling silver (.925) this gorgeous cuff bracelet is handmade by Julie Hiltbrunner of Silversmyth Jewelry.

And now a 4mm wide ring for the guys available.  \r\n\r\nCustom Infinity Wedding Band Design by Silversmyth\r\nArtisan jewelry is so beautiful because of it’s unique handmade look.\r\n\r\nCustom engraving is available for the interior of this ring.  \r\n<a href=\"http://silversmyth.bigcartel.com/product/custom-engraving\">Custom Engraving</a>\r\n\r\n\r\nHere’s how they were crafted:\r\n\r\nTwo small round rings, one slightly larger than the other were formed from sterling silver wire.  They were solder closed, stretched into ovals and twisted into infinity symbols.  Round wire was rolled through a half-round channel in a rolling mill to make the inside of the ring flat and the outside rounded. \r\n\r\nThe wire was shaped into ring bands and then each end was soldered to each the end of the infinity symbols, one at a time.  As these rings have gained in popularity I have moved on to casting them using the lost wax process.  All finish work is done by hand by Silversmyth.\r\n\r\nEach band was stamped, .925, which means the pure silver content is .925% (also known as sterling silver.)  The rings were then filed down and polished to a high shine. \r\n\r\nThis listing is for a single Infinity band.  Hand engraving is $2 per letter or symbol.\r\n\r\nLink to engraving options: http://www.silversmyth.bigcartel.com/product/custom-engraving\r\n\r\nFor questions and engraving please \r\nEmail: info@silversmyth.com \r\nor call Silversmyth at 817.456.4432\r\n\r\nLike Silversmyth on Facebook:\r\nhttp://facebook.com/silversmyth\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":10149745,"name":"Size 5","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10149747,"name":"Size 5.5","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10149749,"name":"size 6.0","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10149751,"name":"size 6.5","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10149753,"name":"size 7","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10149755,"name":"size 7.5","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10149757,"name":"size 8","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10149759,"name":"size 8.5","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10149761,"name":"size 9","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10149763,"name":"size 9.5","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10149769,"name":"size 10","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10149767,"name":"size 10.5","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10149765,"name":"size 11","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":17393943,"name":"Men's Band Size 8","price":104.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17393941,"name":"Men's Band Size 8.5","price":104.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17393939,"name":"Men's Band Size 9","price":104.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17393937,"name":"Men's Band Size 9.5","price":104.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17393935,"name":"Men's Band Size 10","price":104.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17393933,"name":"Men's Band Size 10.5","price":104.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17393931,"name":"Men's Band Size 11","price":104.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17393929,"name":"Men's Band Size 11.5","price":104.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17393927,"name":"Men's Band Size 12","price":104.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17393925,"name":"Men's Band Size 13","price":104.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17393923,"name":"Men's Band Size 14","price":104.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66712733/-/Kerr_2011.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66712733/-/Kerr_2011.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47707789/-/JasonHudson.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47707789/-/JasonHudson.jpg","width":900,"height":410},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66712581/-/5.5BabyRing3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66712581/-/5.5BabyRing3.jpg","width":637,"height":519}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1543066,"name":"rings","permalink":"rings","url":"/category/rings"},{"id":2094522,"name":"under $100","permalink":"under-100","url":"/category/under-100"}]},{"id":11811609,"name":"Silversmyth Cowgirl Silver Horseshoe Necklace  ","permalink":"silversmyth-cowgirl-silver-horseshoe-necklace","position":8,"price":89.0,"default_price":89.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/silversmyth-cowgirl-silver-horseshoe-necklace","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-15T20:46:18.000Z","description":"Each of these horseshoe necklaces is lovingly handcrafted from PMC or Precious Metal Clay that when fired becomes fine silver. \r\n\r\nFine silver is .999 pure silver whereas sterling silver is .925 Silver and .075 Copper.\r\n\r\nFine silver doesn't tarnish.

I run it through my rolling mill into a lovely half round wire.

I solder the join shut and shape it perfectly round.  Then I use hammers and files to get the surface just right.  \r\n\r\nI use several polishing tools to smooth and polish it, then it's good to go... unless you want to have it engraved.  Hover over a pic of an engraved ring in the online store and you can find an option for custom engraving.  \r\n\r\nDuring checkout you can add the actual words to engrave in the Seller Instructions box.
