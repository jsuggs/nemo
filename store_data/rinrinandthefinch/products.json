Shell, wood, silver and clear brown beads are tied together on a deep brown nylon cord and closed with a lobster clasp. The bracelet is 18 centimeters long, an average size. If you want it to be a little longer or shorter, feel free to ask.\r\n\r\nAll the bracelets are made by hand, so the beads can be a little differently placed from the example in the pictures.\r\n\r\nâ™¥ ","options":[{"id":11077537,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31599033/-/shop.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31599033/-/shop.jpg","width":800,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
