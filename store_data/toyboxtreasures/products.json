She has been designed and created to have all the characteristics that a traditional teddy bear would have, long snout, hockey stick shaped arms, long straight legs and a hump.\r\n\r\nBronte is made from a pale pink, sparse effect German mohair, her paw pads are a pale pink suedette fabric, which have been aged and stained and embroidered with black cotton claw detailing.  She has aged black glass eyes and a black threadbare \"D\" shaped embroidered nose which has been slightly waxed.  Bronte seems to have kept her appealing little smile, even though she looks as if she has been left behind to live in the old toy-box.  I have made Bronte a Victorian style cream cotton collar with a pale pink ribbon tie, which has been very slightly aged and stained to complete her overall look of a little old bear.\r\n\r\nThis charming little bear is fully cotter pin jointed and part firmly filled with a granulate and a heavy weight stuffing to give the feel and weight of an old little bear that once had been dearly loved.

This sweet little elephant has the appearance of being well-loved but sadly forgotten about and left to live in the old Toy-Box. Pip is made from a blonde, tufted effect, sparse German mohair, his inner ears and tiny little paw pads are made from a cream and blue stripe ticking fabric. He has tiny matt black aged glass eyes with hand dyed blue cotton circles behind and his little paws have aged, black cotton detailing. Pip loves his old rusty bell hanging off his trunk which he likes to jingle when he thinks no one is looking. Pip is fully cotter pin jointed and part softly filled with a heavy weight stuffing and a granulate for extra weight and texture. Pip is wearing a handmade, slighty aged, vintage style cotton print suit with tiny red, powder blue and pale blue buttons and a matching hand dyed cotton ruff around his neck.","options":[{"id":25347951,"name":"Default","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/78924945/-/IMG_3912.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/78924945/-/IMG_3912.jpg","width":480,"height":640}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":7783632,"name":"HUGO","permalink":"hugo","position":3,"price":95.0,"default_price":95.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/hugo","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-01T18:01:18.000Z","description":"This is Alice's friend Hugo who is a 10 inch One of a Kind Giraffe, who is also made from a blonde with a hint of brown splotches which gives the overall appearance of a very old and well loved Giraffe.
