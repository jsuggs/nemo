Although all the feathers have been dyed black, the peacock’s natural teals and greens transform into the wonderful iridescent petrol purples and greens you can see in the picture.

It would especially appeal to any vintage horror loving comic book readers.\r\n\r\nI have arranged the images and the feathers so they tell a story. \r\nThe damsel in distress (turquoise feather) is being chased by devil creatures (red and black feathers) as her fiance (egg shell blue/grey feathers) looks on helpless. The older man (ivory feathers for an angel) is trying to rescue her from the clutches of the fiery beasts and reaches out to her. I have no idea if this has anything to do with it but from the pictures I have used it works! \r\n\r\nThe ACE button represents Ace magazines, Inc and has been hand embroidered. The french knots represent the pixels in some of the imagery.\r\n\r\n♦ ♣ ♥ ♠\r\n\r\nThe flower is mounted on double hair clip and brooch fastening so it can be worn either as a headpiece or on clothing and accessories. The flower measures 6”/15cm in diameter including feathers and weighs 13g.\r\n\r\nAlthough this truly is a one-off piece, other colours, fixtures and designs are available, just message me with your request.
