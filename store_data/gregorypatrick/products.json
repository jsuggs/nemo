I found a bear on this path of mine that has given me so much more than anything I’ve ever received in life thus far. He gave me a world of friendships all over the planet. He taught me to love again, to not be afraid. He taught me to listen more, and speak less. He taught me that the value in life is not in its possessions, but in its actions.\r\n\r\nMade of a soft sage green in a wool/acrylic blend for gentle washing.

Its not uncommon to hear any of these places in daily conversation.\r\n\r\nAs many of you know, my knits are a reflection of things around me, portraits in the life of a man who found solace in a set of bamboo knitting needles and unprocessed yarn.
