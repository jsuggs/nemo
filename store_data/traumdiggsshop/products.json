On the 15- track project, Traum Diggs tackles various scenarios of love, lust and devotion as seen through the eyes of 4 women and the men they’re involved with.  Through original tracks and a few covers, Diggs rediscovers the lost art of the “concept album” and creates what many are calling his best work to date.  \r\n\r\nFor Colored Girls (& White Chicks Too) is centered on the characters, Kelly, Shonte, Natalie and Ms. Rose.  Each has a unique testimony which is then addressed by a series of songs that follow; almost as if the album were a play with 4 separate acts.   For each “testimony” Diggs borrows from Nina Simone’s classic song, “Four Women” and raps from the perspective (and voice) of each individual lady.
