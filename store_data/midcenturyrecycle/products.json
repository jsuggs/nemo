The house's lineage traces itself back to one of Painesvilles most prominent citizens . \r\nIsaac Gillet[te] was one of the towns most prominent early merchants . \r\n\r\nThe doorway to his house [ now demolished ] is displayed in the Cleveland Museum of Art . \r\nHis daughter married Fred Wilkes of the Wilkes and Coe [ later Coe ] Manufacturing Company . \r\n\r\nTheir daughter married Mr. Childs , a prominent Painesville resident and Trustee of Lake Erie Female Seminary .\r\n\r\n The house from which these doors were removed , was built by Mr. Wilkes for his daughter [ Mrs. Childs]. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Child's daughter married William Knox , an important Architect , who designed , in Cleveland , the Rockerfeller Building at West 6th and Superior for John D. Rockerfeller . Knox had come to Cleveland , after a career which began in Chicago , because his in-laws lived here and gave them this house \" Childhurst . \r\n\r\nNow about the doors .\r\n\r\n People who have looked at these doors don't have a concensus of what type of wood they are . I have been told they are Oak , Ash or Chestnut which are all very similar in appearance except Chestnut is now extinct . \r\n\r\nThe height of both doors is 89 1/2\" with a combined width of 62\" . The doors are 1 3/4\" thick but if you include the decorative molding they are 3 3/4\" thick . \r\n\r\nThey each have a glass window / door that is mounted on the inside face , of the doors , and is 43\" high by 18 1/2\" wide .\r\n\r\n I call them little doors because the open , on the inside , like doors \r\n\r\n. On the outside of these \"little doors\" are Cast Iron Decorative Screens . \r\n\r\nIf you look closely you can see like a tree being held up by Lions legs , Birds of Paradise Flowers and designs . \r\n\r\nThe Cast Iron screens are 3/8\" thick .\r\n\r\n The door with the bolt at the top and bottom is 31 1/2\" wide plus a 1/2\" overlap piece .\r\n\r\n The door with the doorknob is 30 1/2\" wide . \r\nThese can be used anywhere though \r\n\r\nAll offers are considered only a question \r\n\r\nNeed a home they are to beautiful for storage \r\n\r\nBuyer pays shipper freight \r\n\r\nLocated 15 minutes from Cleveland Ohio \r\n\r\nIt is in a heated warehouse so a truck can pull right in to pick up.. \r\n\r\nI will help where possible...
