Dosage: One tablet per day, or as directed \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the tragic events and possible Nuclear disaster unfold after the Japan earthquake and tsunami, many people are calling regarding iodine. \r\n\r\nHere's why taking iodine tablets might help.  \r\n\r\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explain that the body needs iodine -- in a nonradioactive form -- to make thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolism.  People usually get the stable iodine they need from food.\r\n\r\nBut absorbing radioactive iodine-131, which is present in the steam released from failing power plants like the ones in Japan, can cause cancer.  Once breathed into the lungs or consumed by eating or drinking contaminated food or beverages, radioactive iodine travels through the body and quickly is absorbed by the thyroid gland, where it can damage DNA.\r\n\r\nThe body can't tell the difference between stable and radioactive iodine.  Taking stable iodine tablets can protect the thyroid from injury by \"filling up\" the gland -- thus preventing it from taking up radioactive iodine.  It's important for people to take it quickly, the CDC said.  It remains effective for 24 hours.\r\n\r\nIodine tablets do not prevent radioactive iodine from entering the body in the first place, nor do they protect organs other than the thyroid gland.  They also do not reverse thyroid damage that has already occurred.    \r\n\r\nFor information on iodine due to radiation concerns, visit: http://emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/ki.asp\r\n\r\nBefore taking any products containing iodine, please talk with your health care professional.
