Studios, Tex Smith’s second release 2010’s To A Bird Singing Woe beautifully takes on lost love and heartbreak face to face. The album features 12 more Tex Smith original songs full of sentiment, sorrow, with a twist of light. To A Bird Singing Woe highlights his growth as a writer and continued development of his unique sound and delivery. In addition to the original cast of players from his debut record, Tex adds in an extra punch to the rhythm section with friends Jake Erwin playing upright bass (Hot Club of Cowtown), and Pete Coatney on drums (Jack Ingram, Deadman). As an added bonus HalleyAnna Finlay (Texas singer-songwriter) makes a guest appearance on the duet “Come On” creating a whole new element and feel to Tex’s recordings. A few other guest artists and friends round out a solid cast of musicians. The end result is a much more crisp, down to the essentials roots record that is sure to make you cry, laugh, and tap your feet; it’s a solid effort all the way through. To A Bird Singing Woe was recorded in the Spring/Summer of 2010 in Austin, TX. Its a more stripped down acoustic record than the debut \"Tex Smith\". Loss, redemption, and remembering the good times are all common themes on To A Bird Singing Woe.\r\n\r\nTRACKS:\r\n1.\tI Cant Stand Beautiful Women\r\n2.\tCome On\r\n3.\tThe Little Things\r\n4.\tThe Future May Never Come\r\n5.\tZuzu's Petals\r\n6.\tStar of Bethlehem\r\n7.\tHe Is Crazy About You\r\n8.\tChains\r\n9.\tAvery's Blues\r\n10.\tMe And You Blues\r\n11.\tLovely Laura\r\n12.\tUsed To Be My Favorite Season\r\n13.\tGoodbye Songs\r\n","options":[{"id":28061798,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87957272/-/ToABirdSingingWoe_Cover_450x450.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87957272/-/ToABirdSingingWoe_Cover_450x450.jpg","width":450,"height":445}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4374749,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":8946572,"name":"Tex Smith (CD)","permalink":"tex-smith","position":3,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tex-smith","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-15T00:11:54.000Z","description":"The debut album from Tex Smith.
