The style of this artwork is very typical for the encaustic paintings Larry Calkins has created for over 15 years. Here, the work is on a seemingly smaller scale.  (Visit www.calkinsart.net)\r\n\r\nEach side of the individual tabs is a small piece of art and - like his paintings - they are parts of a series that are to be seen as elements of a congruous whole. In this unique piece, they are for once combined to create a Complete Statement.\r\n\r\nThe necklace has a faint scent of beeswax since that is what is used as encaustic medium. \r\n\r\nDimensions of each tab: approx 1.75 x 1.75 inches\r\nLength of necklace top to bottom (folded): 14.5 inches \r\nWeight: 6.5 ounces\r\n\r\nEach metal tab attaches to the chain with a small handcrafted loop, close together, so they overlap and form a vibrant, dense layer. At each end there is a chain with a hook closure which allows for adjustable length.\r\n\r\nThe wire chain elements are coated with a clear sealer. Nonetheless, it is advisable to keep the necklace away from moisture.\r\n\r\nPlease contact us for additional images.","options":[{"id":24872979,"name":"Default","price":495.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/77383872/-/enctabs3.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/77383872/-/enctabs3.JPG","width":1000,"height":732}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3959766,"name":"Statement Necklaces","permalink":"statement-necklaces","url":"/category/statement-necklaces"}]},{"id":7877757,"name":"Red Hearts Necklace,statement necklace with rusted offbeat charm, by Larry Calkins","permalink":"red-hearts-necklace-artistic-statement-necklace-with-rusted-offbeat-charm-bold-and-unique","position":2,"price":275.0,"default_price":275.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/red-hearts-necklace-artistic-statement-necklace-with-rusted-offbeat-charm-bold-and-unique","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-07T19:08:14.000Z","description":"Bold red hearts necklace with special offbeat charm, made to look old and worn. \r\nThe hearts are hand shaped, cut from a sheet of metal, painted on both sides and then aged. \r\nEach metal heart attaches to the chain with a small handmade loop, close together, so they overlap and form a colorful, dense layer. \r\nThere is a chain on either end of the necklace with a hook closure which allows for adjustment as is suitable.\r\n\r\nDimensions of each heart: approx 1.75 x 1.75 inches\r\nLength of necklace top to bottom (folded): 18 inches\r\nWeight: 5.5 ounces\r\n\r\nThe hearts and wire chain are coated with a clear sealer.\r\n\r\nVisit calkinsart.net for a look at available paintings and sculpture.\r\nGallery representation in NYC, Seattle, Provincetown.

The cut-out paragraphs are attached to both sides of a piece of metal, aged and sealed under a coat of amber shellac. \r\n\r\nAnd ther you have it: Rock Paper Scissors \r\n\r\nOver time, the scissors have morphed into something surreal - they got bent and time as eaten away at the metal. Of course, that just adds to their mystique!\r\n\r\nThe ends of the blades have been dulled with brass dots but the curve of the handle makes one of the blades angle out when it hanging vertically. This might be a bit of a hazard, so wear it with caution.\r\n\r\nThe rock and \"paper\" pendants each attach with loops to one of the scissors' handles and hang freely. The chain itself attaches to the other handle and closes with an eye and a hook. Any of the loops can be used to adjust for a custom fit. All parts of the chain are handmade by the artist.\r\n\r\nSpecs:\r\nPendant: 8\" long, from the top of the handle to the bottom edge of the metal pendant. The handle sticks out 1.75 inches at a 90 degree angle where it is bent.\r\nLength of necklace top to bottom: 22 inches when folded \r\nWeight: 2.8 ounces\r\n\r\nThe pendants are coated with a clear sealer which makes the metal soft to the touch.
