Piet Mondrian was a Dutch artist born in the latter part of the 19th century that developed the unique style of grid based paintings. What seems so simple carries its unique beauty with thick black lines forming rectangles filled only with primary colors or left white. In a time where virtually any pattern, color, or material can be applied to a sneaker, sometimes it is the most basic and simplistic styles that look right. Paying homage in the best way, these Dunk Lows are made of canvas tying back to Mondrian’s medium for this artwork.

The design is very subtle from afar, but when the light catches the print it gives off a shimmer that makes them pop. The heel tag is Lance Mountain blue suede and features metallic platinum stitching which matches the tongue tag and interior lining. The insoles are black with the SPoT 20 Year Logo on the heel. A white midsole and black outsole finish off the design. The shoes also come with a special box lined in the same all over print that is featured on the uppers. They will have a wooden hang tag which is laser engraved with the SPoT 20 Year Logo. In place of the standard tissue paper inside the box, there will be a mini-mexican blanket to represent the crusty tapestry that has been used to block the front door of the park's Pro Shop during off hours for the last 20 years.

In 2004, Nike created the Nike Doernbecher Freestyle initiative which would allow a child from the Doernbecher Children's Hospital to design a color way of a Nike shoe for which all proceeds from retail sales would go to the Doernbecher Foundation. This year six children were allowed to design their own shoe creating for the first time a variety of different Doernbecher models and increasing the funds raised. This Air Force 1 was designed by Chad Berg, a 15 year old who had a kayaking accident and nearly lost his life. He was in full cardiac arrest with no pulse and was transferred to the hospital after three hours of CPR. A machine which could function as his lungs and heart kept him alive while he recovered. Miraculously after 2 weeks, Chad was recovered without any neurological damage. Chad designed this Air Force 1 in the green of his favorite college team the Oregon Ducks. He chose to include carbon fiber panels and a glow in the dark outsole. The insole features his favorite saying, \"The people who turn out the best are those people who make the best out of the way things turn out.\" Add the Nike Air Force 1 Low \"Doernbecher\" to your collection today from KicksOnUs.com.","options":[{"id":43829919,"name":"Size 10","price":125.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124554699/-/IMG_3754.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124554699/-/IMG_3754.jpg","width":3264,"height":2448},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124554702/-/IMG_3755.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124554702/-/IMG_3755.jpg","width":2448,"height":3264},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124554705/-/IMG_3756.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124554705/-/IMG_3756.jpg","width":3264,"height":2448},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124554711/-/IMG_3757.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124554711/-/IMG_3757.jpg","width":2448,"height":3264},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124579437/-/IMG_3818.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124579437/-/IMG_3818.jpg","width":3264,"height":2448}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5065990,"name":"other nikes","permalink":"other-nikes","url":"/category/other-nikes"}]},{"id":13665522,"name":"Nike Blazer Mid Premium QS \"Area 72\"","permalink":"nike-blazer-mid-premium-qs-area-72","position":42,"price":115.0,"default_price":115.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nike-blazer-mid-premium-qs-area-72","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-19T16:24:58.000Z","description":"This is a beautiful sneaker released on February 14, 2013, along with the rest of the All-Star collection.

Paying homage to an area dubbed the “Combat Zone” by writer John Cole in the ’60s, the Concepts x Vans Syndicate “Combat Zone” Sk8-Hi draws upon the debauchery and rebelliousness of a locale once known for violence, crime and prostitution. Made from premium pig suede, the sneakers feature laser-etched leather quarter panels, pink satin linings, and crystal-clear waffle treads with checkerboard patterns. Each pair also comes finished with a Combat Zone/Vans Syndicate-specific graphic package complete with dust bags and a satin-lined slider box, resulting in a delightfully decadent take on a classic skateboarding silhouette. These were released exclusively at the Concepts store in Cambridge, MA.

Collaborating with Frank The Butcher this time around, the sneaker is based off the Classic Leather R12 silhouette and boasts an upper made from premium navy leather and rich khaki suede. With an emphasis on making the shoe look “faster,” color blocking is used to give the sneaker the appearance of leaning forward — as seen in the navy heel portions of the cap and outsole. Frank leaves his mark in the form of a “Business as Usual” sock liner, a flow-molded hangtag, a custom “BAU” deubré for each side, and Frank The Butcher tabs at the tongue.
