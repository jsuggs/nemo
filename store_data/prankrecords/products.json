Empassioned screams swap hard and fast with gutteral growls over rocking guitar leads, crushing riffs and ferocious hardcore pummel ignited  by speeding drum blasts. Following several well received EP's, This debut album was originally released by the band in a small edition sold primarily at shows. For first time in general distribution, This Deluxe Vinyl edition of \"Luctus\"  on Prank  features the full  cover artwork by drummer Adrian Balderrama re-printed on a heavy weight sleeve with metallic inks, an exclusive sticker to the first pressing, a large 11\" x 22\" insert, hand stamped inner sleeve and download code.  \r\n\r\n\"Precision, speed, and volume coalesce in to one of the most bad-assed, rippingest, slayingest bands of the genre \" - Razorcake.\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"175\" height=\"125\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/AleGVyT8168\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n<iframe width=\"175\" height=\"125\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/LLeGhQDqeqM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","options":[{"id":45125727,"name":"Colored Vinyl","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":45187662,"name":"Black Vinyl","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":16.6,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":6.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125429094/-/Prank142-Bumbklaatt-400x400.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125429094/-/Prank142-Bumbklaatt-400x400.jpg","width":400,"height":400},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125451084/-/IMG_1064.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125451084/-/IMG_1064.JPG","width":1935,"height":2592},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125451090/-/IMG_1505.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125451090/-/IMG_1505.JPG","width":1440,"height":1440},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125451138/-/IMG_1702.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125451138/-/IMG_1702.JPG","width":1936,"height":2592},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125476131/-/IMG_2749.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125476131/-/IMG_2749.JPG","width":2592,"height":1936}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2020040,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"},{"id":2020044,"name":"Colored Vinyl","permalink":"colored-vinyl","url":"/category/colored-vinyl"}]},{"id":14008155,"name":"SLANG \"GLORY OUTSHINES DOOM\" LP ","permalink":"slang-glory-outshines-doom-lp","position":4,"price":11.0,"default_price":11.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/slang-glory-outshines-doom-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-06T18:28:32.000Z","description":"**OUT NOW***\r\nSapporo, Japan's SLANG 6th's LP may be the most definitive expressions of the bands long Journey as part of and evolution within the History of Japanese hardcore. Starting in the late 1980's a classic sounding Japanese hardcore band, SLANG's sound became heavily influenced in the 1990's by NYHC like AGNOSTIC FRONT, MADBALL and slower breakdowns as a means for impact, In the 00's the band embraced more metallic influences and slowly began to seam all of it together,: the tough, growling vocals, the slow, crushing breakdowns, raging guitar leads, lightening fast hardcore charge. Their Previous two albums \" The Immortal Sin\" and \" Life Made Me hardcore\" began the road to this, but \" Glory Outshines Doom\" goes to another level of combining all these elements to create an intense, dark,  completely and totally brutal record, crashing barriers between Punk, Metal and hardcore. Issued on CD by the PIZZA OF DEATH LP, this is it's first appearance on vinyl and comes in a heavy weight sleeve with full color inner sleeve and labels.

Parts surface the melody riffed, guitar-driven hardcore of their classic 1980s records, but fumble a little in their complexity and a modern recording that doesn’t ever seem to pull a cohesive direction to the attack. The bass plunks, the drums hammer, and the vocals have a really uneven delivery. Add in all the different influences—from modern metal to classic ’77 style moves—and it’s just slightly off and sort of just rambles and stews. But you know what? RATTUS were fan-fucking-tastic in LA, and are still one of the world’s greatest punk bands. Ever. So I’ll keep spinning this—like any of their diehard fans—to try to glean their inspiration. Lyrics are Finnish with no translation. On the flip, Riverside, CA’s HOLOKAUST delivers three solid, meaty standard issue DISCHARGE blasts. These tracks distinguish themselves in the basic, wadded up crunch that the guitars get in their semi-lo-fi recording—a recording akin to the happy accidents of ’90s crust records, as opposed to a current intentionally lo-fi noise fest. The drums sturdily roll around this thick, dumpy chunk of simple riffs, as the vocals blast standard issue punk declarations over the din “Brainwashed into Submission!” “Waves of Fire! Mushroom cloud! Incinerated!” making for a familiarly satisfying, two fingers in the air, dose of good punk rock fun.

I reviewed this record for MRR and dug it so much I got some copies. here's the review I did:\r\n\r\nLEFT IN RUINS “ Ensam Hatisk Psykstord” 10”\r\nReturning with their most savage effort after a decade long absence, Sweden’s LEFT IN RUINS 14 tracks here amp up several knotches -if not an entire dial -from their Split with MRTVA BUDOUCNOST and 7” EP almost ten plus years ago. A totally excellent dose of brutality fueled by the nail gun, jackhammer delivery of unrelenting throttling thrash, with only a few seconds to catch a breath in this 45 RPM onslaught-as it largely zig-zags through blastbeat tempo changes at high speed. A Precise recording grounds this chaotic mayhemfrom turning into a total blizzard of noise.

A Uniquely Original band like their contemporaries HIS HERO IS GONE, IN/HUMANITY, END OF THE CENTURY PARTY and with a sound way ahead of the same stop-melody-start-grind that became popular in the late nineties / early 00's by half a decade, Prank was originally slated to release an LP by ICE NINE in 1996, but the band broke up before it was recorded. Band members went on to play in TIME IN MALTA, BURN IT DOWN, MAHJAS, THE PROBLEMATICS, YOU WILL DIE and THE DREAM IS DEAD. A successful CD collection of ICE NINE's material from the Bovine, Ebullition, Rhetoric labels was released on Happy Couples Never Last in 2004 and in 2009, the band reunited with all original members to play Indianapolis's DUDEFEST.

Sounds like none of those bands with their own unique bent , but just as great! \r\n\r\nOn LP & CD","options":[{"id":12663444,"name":"Vinyl","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12663446,"name":"CD","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":16.6,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":6.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36896410/-/siglostsm.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36896410/-/siglostsm.jpg","width":375,"height":375}],"artists":[{"id":63268,"name":"Signal Lost","permalink":"signal-lost","url":"/artist/signal-lost"}],"categories":[{"id":2020038,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":2020040,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"},{"id":2020044,"name":"Colored Vinyl","permalink":"colored-vinyl","url":"/category/colored-vinyl"}]},{"id":3798088,"name":"Signal Lost - You'll Never Get Us Down Again","permalink":"signal-lost-you-ll-never-get-us-down-again","position":182,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/signal-lost-you-ll-never-get-us-down-again","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-05-23T08:52:17.000Z","description":"Austin,Texas's SIGNAL LOST's second record follows their debut LP in an inventive mix of melodic guitars,impassioned female vocals, and mid-tempo Hardcore-edged punk rock with a hint of garage, new wave and '77 punk.
