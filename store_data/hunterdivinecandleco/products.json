Ions act upon our capacity to absorb and utilize oxygen, and therefore cause powerful effects on our lives and well being. The ions in the air can affect our mood, energy and health. Negative ions actually feel good. Too many positive ions make us feel bad and they are loaded down with pollution and allergens that are drawn to them and suspended in the air. Negative ions, on the other hand, remove the pollution and allergens from positive ions, allowing them to drop harmlessly to the ground.\r\n\r\nBeeswax candle fuel is the only fuel that actually produces negative ions, which not only helps remove pollution from the air but increases the ratio of negative ions to positive ions, the ideal and necessary scenario for clean air.\r\n\r\nBees wax is long burning & gives off a wonderfully light honey smell.\r\n\r\n60ml Votives will burn for 16 hours. \r\nIt is recommended that you burn these for 2 hours for their first burn to establish a burn pool that goes from wick to glass.","options":[{"id":36258090,"name":"PURE BEESWAX","price":13.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":37874823,"name":"MANDARIN BEESWAX (Essential
