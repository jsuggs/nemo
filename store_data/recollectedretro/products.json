Since the very beginning, the range has been an undisputed icon of Scandinavian design. Today, this legendary range is part of numerous permanent collections at design museums all over the world. The Cylinda Line is known for its understated beauty and utter functionalism. Its design is based on different variations of cylindrical forms. Every piece gains its own characteristics through slight alterations in design. Although the Cylinda Line range is a collection, its pieces work very well alone or mixed with other tableware. The Cylinda Line includes pieces for complete tea and coffee set and all the essentials for your home bar. \r\n\r\nThe Cylinda concept was originally sketched on a napkin in 1964, and it literally took three years to bring into production. It required and new technology to make Cylinda Line stainless-steel hollow-ware possible. Arne Jacobsen insisted on seamless tubes with perfect, brushed surfaces, and he continued to add new pieces to the collection until 1971. Jacobsen's insistence was awarded the 1967 ID Prize by the Danish Design Council, and pieces of the line are included in the permanent collections of the MOMA and the Victoria and Albert Museum. \r\n\r\nThis piece is in very good condition for its age, it does have slight scuffing and a small scratch that is barely noticeble (see pictures) also a teeny chip out of the handle \r\n\r\nIf you have any queries please dont hesitate to ask.
