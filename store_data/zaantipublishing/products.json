Miraculously, they survive. Convinced her survival from the blast is an auspicious sign, Ellé makes a rash, career-ending decision by adopting Safiya.\r\nLiving a quiet life on the northwest coast of Florida, Ellé’s marriage and motherhood seems idyllic. Then, anomalies with Safiya begin surfacing…\r\nApart from being unusually tall for her age, Safiya speaks any languages fluently; dead creatures resuscitate when her shadow touches their corpses; and ominous forces are seeking to destroy the girl before she awakens to an ancient legacy of watery dreams and an apocalyptic destiny.\r\nEntangled in the vagaries of her circumstance, Ellé arrogantly denies the real issues of post-traumatic stress and becomes lost in the spirituality of her imaginary world, hoping that serendipity will “fix” her troubled daughter; however, the sober truth about Safiya is a piece of gravel hitting the windshield of Ellé’s mind. The crack spreads as mother and daughter struggle for their sanity before Ellé’s good intentions destroy everything. Inevitably, Ellé accepts what must be done and makes a bittersweet decision about Safiya before the windshield shatters.\r\n\r\n With the End of Days at hand, the child-empress of mystical Pemako offers a poignant warning: There is a price for serendipity…\r\n\r\nCategory:Psychological Thriller, Visionary Fiction\r\nPublisher: Zaanti Publishing\r\nSeller: Zaanti Publishing\r\nPrint Length: 380 pages\r\nLanguage: English\r\nFormat: Paperback\r\nTerritory: For sale in the US only.\r\nRelease Date: September 8, 2011","options":[{"id":13902829,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61568471/-/Big_Cartel_Update.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61568471/-/Big_Cartel_Update.jpg","width":662,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":76255,"name":"Roy C.
