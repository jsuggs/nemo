This record clearly exemplifies 2 sorts of progressive hardcore associated with Realicide Youth Records, and will also serve as the precursor to the upcoming Realicide “Resisting The Viral Self” LP on this label, among other more concentrated releases by bands and artists that do not necessarily share an identical aesthetic, but more importantly find common ground in their ideologies and general methods of seeking dialogue with the world surrounding them... 500 copies, December 2008 by Realicide Youth Records & Outfall Channel www.outfallchannel.com Distributors, get in touch about distro rates!\r\n\r\nRealicide / Half Gorilla split 7\" $5\r\n…released by Detournemont Media (DC) – Realicide offers 2 studio tracks recorded later 2007 (Dead And Ground Flat On Cement + Head Perfect) featuring noisy hardware speedcore by Vankmen with the voices of Robert Inhuman and Jim Swill; topics of misanthropic compassion and the erosion of personal privacy via a double-edged sword called technology. Half Gorilla is an intense grindcore band from Milwaukee drawing equal influence from traditional hardcore punk and various offshoots of deviant metal, offering 4 songs (All Your Sores, Shit In The Well, Rabies Diet, Birth), from 2007 when Peter J. Woods was the bassist. This record brings together two drastically different aesthetic adaptations of hardcore, but in a situation in which they can coexist with mutual open-mindedness! Try it instead of default prejudices?! Edition of 500, August 2009.\r\n\r\nCloud Rat / Autarkeia split 7\" $5\r\nAnother rad Cloud Rat split record, with Autarkeia from Florida, on the IFB label.\r\n\r\nCloud Rat 12” LP $10 \r\nOutstanding central Michigan grindcore!\r\n\r\nXtra Vomit / Positive Noise split 7” $5 \r\nTwo of our favorite high energy hxc punk bands from west Michigan!\r\n\r\nBestial Mouths \"Hissing Veil\" 12\" $10\r\nHighly recommended contemporary LA goth / synthpunk! Debut LP via Dais label - one of the most unique bands of this sort to emerge in recent history! Awesome vocal work, raw and heavy synth over primal drumming... http://bestialmouths.tumblr.com/\r\n\r\nBRANES \"Anatomically Correct\" 7\" $5\r\n...very fun 7\" from another new spooky Californian synthpunk duo. Basic drum machine rock beats backing great layered synths and catchy energetic singing. I'm pretty sure this is the band Lydia from Beetlejuice (or Betelguese) started after she finished school, but I haven't got confirmation on that yet. Their live show is a lot of fun too; great presence! These days, when spiders are sick of crying in the shadows, they put on this record and dance until another unwanted dawn!\r\n\r\nV.A. \"The Neighbors Are Dead\" 2x12\" compilation $15\r\nDocument of the Murfreesboro TN d.iy. music scene surrounding the life of their House House venue, hosting insane noise / punk / crazy stuff during 2006-2009. Featuring previously unreleased Realicide studio track \"Deliverance\", Social Junk, Mincemeat Or Tenspeed, Lazer Slut, MANY more... What a weird couple of LP's! \r\n\r\nHentai Lacerator “Chelsea Charms R.I.P.” 7” $6\r\nReleased by Austrian extreme music label Hirntrust Grind Media, “Chelsea Charms R.I.P.” offers a vinyl format for 6 of the sickest tracks from Hentai Lacerator’s 2007 studio album, “Sugarsplash!”, previously released via CDR by Realicide Youth and Outfall Channel. Fans of excruciating and bizarre fast hxc, punk-drenched grindcore, and manic brain-damaged noiserock can find a perverse comfort in Hentai Lacerator. Also, individuals who are interested in sexuality may be intrigued to know that the band’s lyrical content focused on scenarios involving Slimer (the green ghost) interacting and pining for various Hentai Prostitute girlfriends. So basically, you can try to rock out to Hentai Lacerator just for the sake of wild noisy hardcore music, but it is at times very difficult to turn a blind eye to its more overtly weird, fucked up, and arrosing qualities. Be warned!!! 7” record cut at 45rpm w/ full color covers, featured songs: A1 Killed By Cum, A2 Fatal Surge of Tits, A3 Sugarsplash!, B1 Stripped Nude In The Slimepit, B2 Blisshole, B3 Dazzle And Kill Them!

which you want from the box at the bottom)\r\n\r\nCIDE TORRENT data-DVDR $12\r\n(data-DVDR, 4.3gb of over 1,800 files) We're living in an age, more and more it seems, in which all information is available if we're able to recognize and accept it. This is a data DVDR that contains around 99% of anything ever publicly available by Realicide, beginning with the project's conception in 2002 through the curation of this release in September 2008, totaling over 37 hours of audio, hundreds of flyers and posters and photos, notes, all organized into 67 folders... For anyone who has not already owned Realicide material, or for anyone looking for any earlier or more obscure previous releases, this disc contains almost everything that the public has ever had access to: tapes, vinyl records, CDR's, zines, \"net releases\", compilation tracks. And as the title suggests, it was painstakingly compiled in order to adhere to the recent surge of Torrent file-sharing online. You can make torrents of it, inject it into your Soulseek files, burn CD's, anything... As bonus material, included are many previous releases by Realicide-related artists such as Evolve, Mavis Concave, Ultra//Vires, aaronquinn, SX, Hentai Lacerator, Jim Swill, No Candy... The DVD case it's packaged in also contains 3 xerox posters and a sticker. Postage-paid US price is $15 because of the massive amount of information on the disc and the labor that went into compiling it, but since the idea behind this release is file-sharing, it is suggested that you get a few friends to throw in a couple dollars each, buy 1 copy, and share it. Any profit from this release will contribute to the next phase of Realicide Youth Records, which will offer new and increasingly focused material by Realicide members and artists of a similar ethic and motivation, including as much collaborative activity as possible with anyone who feels they can truthfully relate to our chosen path and purpose. Please email with any questions, or for distro rates. \r\n\r\nRobert Inhuman “Decimated” CDR $5\r\n14 tracks of reading, pieces from throughout the previous ten years, recorded November 2010, a reclusive month in Cincinnati during the canceled weeks of the Realicide tour of Europe. This writing is generally somewhat morbid, reflecting a period of intense grief and personal struggle. Certain pieces have appeared lyrically within releases of past years; amidst Realicide and other projects. Others are those that have fallen through the cracks, or that have not yet found their final destination. Artwork features various gigantic spiders of Australia, screenprinted disc, very small edition: 30 copies, December 2010.\r\n\r\nEVOLVE \"REALITY GUERRILLA\" CDR $5\r\nThis is an undeniably dark and socio-politically radical hip hop mix tape, the 6th full length Evolve release since its conception in 2002. Created summer 2010 through early 2011 in Cincinnati, REALITY GUERRILLA continues the project's emphasis on the cut-up approach to daily life and decisions, however in this work production is sharper and more reliant on chopping break and sampling music rather than the often garbled tape collages that encoated previous Evolve albums. Colin Murray again handles beat and synth production, both hardware and software, extensive editing along with lyrics aligned to themes of urban anxieties and the general pressures inherent in surviving an American capitalist society. The breakbeat and electronica styles are deviated from at times with dubstep-influenced production by Surgery Games, and Freak One of Cincinnati's Cem Com appears lyrically on several focal tracks. For anarchists, for people with an interest in magick, for people who need the radical origins of hip hop to be reclaimed and maintained, REALITY GUERRILLA is something to investigate... Originally a 62 minute cassette self-published April 2011, now a screenprinted CDR with fold-out lyrics poster via Realicide Youth Records, edition of 100, May 2012.\r\n\r\nEvolve \"Circumstance Reality Defacement\" CDR $5\r\nThe fourth Evolve album, originally released by Tanzprocesz label in France, packaged as colorful collage artwork clippings inside a record sleeve in 2008. This re-release attempts to give more exposure to the album in parts of the world it may have not reached previously. Most of its contents recorded 2007 and 2008, with interjecting bits from years prior. Significant contributions of lyrics, dialogue, and collage by Freak-One (of Cem Com) and Jim Swill (of Realicide). This is warm flutes and chimes, meditative textural looping, urban and confrontational, drum machine and synth, hardware-based, magick-inspired raps unified with psychedelic electronica and tape cut-ups. Evolve sounds like the Skinny Puppy of conscious hiphop, if that makes any sense, there is no other group quite like this. Screenprinted disc, comes with vinyl sticker. Edition: 100, February 2011.\r\n\r\nEvolve “Once it was easy to give up everything you had & wander; before the streets were venomous: we walk” $5\r\nThe third Evolve album, re-issued after its initial release on the Heresee label in late 2006. This is a beautifully warm and passionate album from Cincinnati Ohio; a collection of tape collage blending into spoken pieces, joined by primal hardware drum machine and synth patterns, humble urban hiphop elements with surreal freestyles by guests such as Jim Swill and Freak One. If you have interest in art and music that confronts the dark, edgy aspects of city life, the grit and anxiety, fears and personal conflicts, but still with an overwhelming feeling of awe and compassion, a love for both friends and passing strangers, the Evolve project is highly recommendable. If you are interested in music that’s purpose is to make you feel invulnerably hard and comic-book-like, you might want to skip this and stick with mainstream radio. Screenprinted disc, foldout lyrics xerox poster, and a color photograph. 200 copies, December 2008.\r\n\r\nEvolve “Beyond Limits Being Human” CDR/zine $5\r\nSecond full album featuring CM, DJ Yes, Swill, Freak1, more… art-damaged hiphop, socially charged lyrics, dynamic cut-ups and tripped out chop work. Accompanying book of lyrics and many many graff flicks both local to Cincinnati OH and from various cities visited on tour + fold-out poster of a subhuman skeleton dug up. Screenprinted disc. Edition: 150, February 2006.\r\n\r\nFreak One \"The Recap\" CDR $5\r\nFrequent member of the Evolve project and 1/2 of Chemical Committee, this is the first solo hip hop release by Freak One from Cincinnati Ohio. Known for his raps advocating socio-political pacifism and resistance to American super-corporations, the album has an ultimately compassionate and egalitarian theme. As with Cem Com, there is a strong motif of pharmaceutical experimentation, and an honest critique of its abuse both intimately and within our society as a whole. Other topics include tagging, dumpster-diving, and observation of local police violence. Beats were produced by various Cincinnati friends then mixed by Evolve, riddling the tracks with sound collages mapped out by Freak. The screenprinted CD is supplemented by full color artwork, a xerox zine filled with extensive lyrics and essays and graff, and a vinyl sticker. For the truly adventuresome in obscure avenues of hip hop, this is definitely something to try out. Edition: 100, February 2011.\r\n\r\nFreak One \"The End Is Over\" CDR $5\r\nThe 2nd album of socio-politically-charged hip hop from Freak One, produced by Evolve in Cincinnati, featuring beats and additional lyrics by Beta Max of Cem Com, among various other friends. Topics range from DIY versus consumerism to a predatory pharmaceutical industry to ecological sustainability to the human struggle with vengeance, forgiveness, and mortality. Accompanied by essays, poster artwork by LAIR, screenprinted disc. Edition of 100, June 2012\r\n\r\nChemical Committee “Ill-umi-Nati” CDR $5\r\nChemical Committee (AKA CemCom) is the Cincinnati hiphop duo of Beta Max and Freak One (Evolve project collaborator) rapping about drugs, the cops, tagging, and an array of other presences in their world, both positive and negative – all backed by strongly Wu-influenced beats laced heavily with old video games and movie samples of varying traceable relevance.  This is 100% robo-tripping hiphop, raw from the frustrated and crazed urban midwest American youth. ILL-UMI-NATI was originally self-released in 2007, now re-editioned for CemCom’s debut contribution to the Realicide label. Screenprinted disc, color cover art, fold-out poster. 100 copies, August 2009.\r\n\r\nHentai Lacerator \"Do me before the Hentai Lacerator CD is over\" CDR $5\r\nAppalling and despicable release in 2010 by normally breakcore-related label BRK in Lyon, France. This is the final release of the bizarre grindcore / sped-up noiserock trio of Robert Inhuman and the guys from Capital Hemorrhage and Ultra//Vires. Hentai Lacerator was only active 2005-2007, based in Dayton and briefly toured the midwest and southern regions of the US. This BRK release is a collection of 69 trax of HL at its worst - scathing noisecore, earliest demo and rehearsal recordings, all overtly themed around Slimer and comparable creatures engaging in nympho-maniacal frenzies of orgasmic dementia with human (?) females. BRK has gone all-out in the DIY fashion with a screenprinted disc, several screenprinted vinyl stickers, and a lime green A3 foldout featuring many R.Inhuman drawings dating back to early childhood. Tracklist contains previously unavailable material as well as all releases besides \"Covered In Fun\" and \"Sugarsplash\", which were the two primary HL albums...\r\n- \"Made From The Dreams of Babies\" part I and II (Realicide Youth Records, 2006)\r\n- both cassingles accessorizing \"Covered In Fun\" album (RYR, 2007)\r\n- 7\" (Isle of Man, 2007)\r\n- final live gig 3\" (Jeshimoth, 2008)\r\n\r\nHentai Lacerator “Sugarsplash!” CDR/zine $7\r\nThe long-dreaded release of Hentai Lacerator’s studio-recorded set, 12 songs about Slimer crying slippery with anxious joy onto animated dreamlike girlfriends (vocal by Robert Inhuman of Realicide), backed by manic and infuriating blasts of abstracted hardcore, grind, and sped-up noiserock (by members of Capital Hemorrhage). D-beat purists will vomit in utter disapproval (it will sound ironically much like the vocal on the CD) but true noisecore and musically-perverted freaks are sure to rejoice about an album that references many punk styles of the past decade while not sounding like the same shit you’ve been into since you were fucking 15, and it’s recorded totally decent as well! So if you love Slimer, or any of the substances that spray off of him, or any of the robust babes that hang out with him, and are sick of pretending like crust isn’t just metal that dresses like “Road Warrior” bullshit, check out “Sugarsplash!” …and if your parents are coming up the stairs just throw that shit under your bed and everything will be cool. Co-released by Outfall Channel (www.outfallchannel.com) and Realicide Youth, packaged in a lime green DVD case w/ screenprinted discs and large fold-out poster, lyrics sheet, booklet of extensive illustrations and interviews with crucially influencial (to HL) figures in adult entertainment such as Amber Evans, Petra Verkaik, Belladonna... Edition: 100, January 2008. GIVE ME PINK. 2nd edition: 100, July 2008.\r\n\r\nHentai Lacerator 3” CDR $4 \r\nPublished by something called Jeshimoth in Joplin MO; intense recording of the final Hentai Lacerator show 21 October 2007 in Saint Louis.\r\n\r\nDJ Immolation \"Morgue of Human Sanity\" CDR $5\r\nSophmore release of increasingly punishing and relentless gabber speedcore with elements of terror and breakcore, from the outskirts of Cincinnati by DJ Immolation. 16 trax ensuring no survivors, if not in the physical sense then at least in terms of total psychological disfigurement beyond any shred of hope for reconstruction. So if you need electronic music to be raw, fast, and brutally inane, this is what's up. Cover art by LAIR, screenprinted disc, comes with a vinyl sticker. Edition: 100, February 2011.\r\n\r\nDJ Immolation “a Product of Dementia” CDR $5\r\nDebut album from this emerging Cincinnati terrorcore / speedcore producer, “A PRODUCT OF DEMENTIA” is a collection of relentless electronic high-speed strife created 2007-09. Wrenching anxiety through harsh gabber kicks, slashing synth lines, segways from classics like Clockwork Orange and Fear And Loathing… DJ IMMOLATION is a reminder that raw hardcore techno is alive and well within contingents of midwest US youth. 100 copies, screenprinted disc, December 2009.\r\n\r\nMavis Concave “Survive This” CDR $5\r\nMavis Concave of Realicide, SX, DJ Thumper – 5 track EP produced summer 2009 in Saint Louis – a narrative trudging though complete emotional devastation, intense self-doubt and identity conflicts, vengeful and defeated confessions, and finally the tempered strength to move forward – wrenching vocal performances all to a soundscape of raw digital glitches, scathing breakcore rhythms, and the driving force of memorable synth lines backed by immaculate gabber kicks. There is even an amped up digital hardcore cover of Dystopia’s song “Socialized Death Sentence” for anyone whose job has them considering suicide as a reasonable alternative. If you’d always thought hard electronic beats were nothing besides a cheap accessory to raver drugs – here is another fierce counterexample. EMBRACE YOUR DOOM – IN FORWARD MOTION! Screenprinted disc with fold-out poster (artwork by Nick Francel) 150 copies, August 2009.\r\n\r\nPraey CDR $5\r\nDebut songs from the Saint Louis hardcore trio (Kerns Lane, Mavis Concave, Jack Callahan) that was formed, playing gigs in surrounding cities, and recorded all within June 2009! Strong influence from the youthful urgency of fast, oldschool HxC combined with heavy, dissonant guitar doom and calculated bursts of mic feedback and other scraps of noise amidst otherwise conventional punk rock song structures – this self-titled Praey EP contains 8 studio tracks, including renditions of “Pressure” by Negative Approach and “Shit For Reality” by Realicide, and 3 live recordings from gigs and a radio session. Screenprinted disc, color cover art (by Nick Francel), fold-out poster. 150 copies, August 2009.\r\n\r\nSplit Horizon “Thunder In The Ground” CDR $5\r\nDetroit’s noisy politically-driven hardware sequencer / synth techno by Matt Schultz, accompanied by a series of short essays and an informative interview about the motives and general perspective of Split Horizon. Matt is a central figure in Detroit’s From The Gut collective, www.fromthegut.org which attempts to organize electronic music events and record releases that are both socially exciting and also intellectually critical of its own artistic output and the political environments in which it is being produced. For fans of things like Praxis / Datacide, the ideas of Split Horizon could be of substancial interest. Screenprinted disc, foldout essays / interview xerox. 100 copies, December 2008. 50 copies, December 2009. \r\n\r\nSplit Horizon “Storm Wave” CD $7 \r\n– Detroit hard broken beats, like psychedelic industrial, not unlike something of Praxis both in sound and motivations.\r\n\r\nDimentia “A Vision’s Voice” CD $7 \r\n– dark captivating magick industrial soundscapes from the Katabatik camp in Oakland, released by Void in Detroit 2009.\r\n\r\nSX CDR $5\r\nLong-awaited studio production of the songs performed 2005-06, SX is the hardcore project created by Mavis Concave (Realicide, DJ Thumper) collaborating with alternating female members.

This is the first public performance of the set created by Jon Prunty (of Capital Hemorrhage, Hentai Lacerator) and Robert Inhuman for the Spring 2008 tour of Europe. The songs are militant and reference industrial and harsh noise heavily, while still adhering to the ideas of “contemporary hardcore” put in motion by previous incarnations of the band led by Mavis Concave and Aaron Quinn. The lyrical content (all included on insert sheet)  contains  topics such as street begging, a simplified definition of politics, consideration for straight edge ideals, grim misanthropy, and the ironic alienating effects of sub-cultures. The sound is raw, in a similar style as the “Which Is Your War” disc a few months prior. Released by Outfall Channel with screenprinted covers and discs.

Drawing strong influence from metal and punk aesthetics, dark anime, imagery of the occult, tattoo and street art, MOLT is the first zine of his collected works and features dozens of intricate drawings collaged over photography and supplementary text. LAIR has previously been known for his intensive event posters and album artwork for Realicide Youth Records, among various other collaborative and freelance work. MOLT is a bold and distinct new book of artwork released under Jim Swill's emerging Now Is The Time publications label. 28 pages, two color screenprinted cover, comes with vinyl sticker, 1\" pin, large screenprinted patch of a variation of the cover art, and a small metal key.

But perhaps equally relatable is the private sense of torment and psychological erosion which can accompany indulgence in this longing. Amidst the common shroud of confusion and mortal fear we may find our lives fallen vulnerable to, the past often appears alluring or more fulfilling than various obstacles of the present day, yet by the dictations of time the past is forever a forbidden reality. Jim Swill's Caustic Nostalgia is a collection of poems spanning 2007-2010, documenting and exploring this struggle between self-destruction and enlightenment throughout his own turbulent experiences. Simultaneously brutal and beautiful, these poems convey the precise intensity this author has become known for within the American underground and DIY scenes. Along with his various chapbooks and spoken performances, Swill is known as a core member of Realicide and frequent collaborator within groups such as Evolve, Bunk News, and Get Born. 28 August 2010, edition of 250 books, hand screenprinted gold on black covers, 64 pages.\r\n\r\nJim Swill “Intrusive Elements 1: Temple Ov The Screen” zine $3 \r\n– collection of socio-political collage works of Jim Swill. 2009\r\n\r\nJim Swill “Intrusive Elements 2” zine $3\r\n– 2009\r\n\r\nJim Swill “Intrusive Elements 3” zine $3\r\n– 2010\r\n\r\nJim Swill “Intrusive Elements 4” zine $3\r\n– 2011\r\n\r\nNOT BORED! book $15\r\n\r\nSewer City Breakfast #1 $1\r\n- the premier zine from Franchesca G and Sandrina Slime, Realicide collaborates from Cincinnati, a spatter of comix, articles, collage, just a classic for-fun-punk-zine style.

In contrast to the project's extensive output of live bootlegs and other very rough material, here is a very defined and focused collective energy from artists across the US throughout late 2007 until early 2009. This body of work includes the lyrics and voices of Robert Inhuman and Jim Swill; the hardware and software electronic music of Vankmen, Ryan Faris (of Capital Hemorrhage), Evolve, and Steven Cano (tik///tik); additional sampling by Simon Severe; and mastered by Mavis Concave. Sonically, \"Resisting The Viral Self\" ranges from Realicide's established style of very abrasive gabber punk, inspired by certain sects of harsh noise and classic digital hardcore, yet venturing into other means at times, such as dark ambient soundscapes facilitating spoken tracks and delicate sound collages. Lyrically, the album claims allegiance most strongly to the roots of Anarcho-punk and other combative, yet ultimately constructive, efforts in promoting a lifestyle based in equality and the courage to experiment regardless of social pressures (especially against these social pressures). The 12\" vinyl holds the essentials of the album, at 17 minutes each side, but the CD format has allowed the material to be doubled, at 48 tracks and filling the disc with as much raw hardcore and industrial mania as possible. Both versions of the album are available in full-color printed jackets, featuring artwork by Robert Inhuman, and are accompanied by an extensive zine. Though a modest stack of xeroxed text and drawings, this zine is completely supplemental to the music of \"Resisting The Viral Self\". In addition to all technical credits and lyrics, essays elaborating on the content of almost every track are presented, along with essays regarding the ethical philosophies and policies surrounding Realicide in every aspect of its operation. Vinyl stickers are also included with both CD and LP versions. For anyone who has an interest in Realicide and has waited through years of many less coherent bootleg releases, or anyone who has been increasingly hungry for a band that can very directly utilize electronic hardcore as a vehicle for radical and socio-political propaganda, this is an album that can give you what you've been hunting for - with a terrifying vehemence yet an unwavering message of compassion and self-sacrifice.

For those unfamiliar, Birth (also commonly known as BIRTH!) is Douglas Halbert, of a Denver deathrocker origin then scraping by feverishly in LA much of this past decade. His songs are blunt and driving, and his physical performance is as explosively engaging as any in the rich/depraved history of Californian experimental punk. Since the conception of Birth in 2007, Doug has toured both US coasts (with Realicide and various others), was featured in a European tour surrounding the Drop Dead Festival in 2008, has been a consistent figure in most events bizarre in the LA area, and has had a killer tape of demo recordings in circulation. For those already acquainted, \"I WILL\" shows substantial evolution in this project. Not only is it Birth's first properly produced work with more layering of various keyboards and vocal work, but the songs are overtly more autobiographical. Whereas previous songs dealt in a somewhat more generalized expression of anxiety, lust, rage, etc. the content of \"I WILL\" describes much more personal situations of loss and the struggle to build a life from an array of very broken experiences. The album is dark but conveys a determined optimism, evident not only in the words themselves but within the unhesitant energy of their delivery. Coming from deathrock doesn't have to lead to a lifetime of sulking after all! Watch out for BIRTH! at Drop Dead Fest 2010! Mastered by Mavis Concave. Full color artwork by Robert Inhuman.

Fully inspired by both spiritual and socio-political aspects of the cut-up process, this album is bathed in warm and propagandic tape collage, over thick electronic drums crafted from various hardware, featuring several collaborative beats by Mavis Concave (Praey, Realicide, Thumper). Lyrical performances by the project's founder Colin Murray, as well as Jim Swill (Realicide) and Freak-One (Chemical Committee), run consistent in every way to their electronically collaged platform. Key topics include resisting the slavery of corporate capitalism, both physically literal and that of the mind and soul, dietary consciousness and an emphasis of life as sacred, both individually in animals and our Earth as one collective being, countering social stereotypes of gender, class systems, and the means of sustaining one's self with or without consumerist vices... Art direction by Robert Inhuman includes video stills and imagery from events by Bunk News, the crew that revived an excitement for new DIY arts in Cincinnati throughout 2009 while this music was being created. Mastered by Mavis Concave. \"Breaking Down The Barriers\" is in many ways the Realicide label's follow-up to \"Resisting The Viral Self\", the Realicide album released earlier the same year. Although the aesthetics of Evolve differ greatly from the label's tendencies towards abrasive hardcore, the Evolve project was formed at the same time as Realicide in 2002, and has progressed parallel over the years with similar social aims. \"Breaking Down The Barriers\" is the first Evolve album published on vinyl LP, and its CD version contains dozens of additional songs and cut-up selections. Both formats are accompanied by an extensive zine featuring all lyrics and dialogue clips transcribed, as well as supplementary essays and artwork by various collaborators. This record is highly recommended to anyone who appreciates the urgent themes found in most other Realicide Youth Records and is interested in experiencing comparable ideas through a different array of musical styles. Beyond aesthetic boundaries; beyond the numbing masks and psychick chains any of us may wear; moving forward together in favor of an energy healing One Earth and all its humble cells which we all ultimately are; surely this Earth is rather the One to heal us all. 23 October 2009, for Realicide Youth Records.

This record breaks away from an over-saturated montage of mangled speedcore anxiety found on other Realicide releases, in favor of 4 longer, more straight-forward bastardized gabber punk anthems which largely serve as extended sequels to songs originally found on the “Resisting The Viral Self” LP earlier in 2009. The title track is an elaboration on the 2008 song “Autonomy”, created by Robert Inhuman, Evolve, and Jim Swill. A2 “The Passive Observer” is an elaboration on the 2007 song “The Audience Sucks”, with one of the absolute best Vankmen gabber beats backing Inhuman and Swill. B1 track “No War Can Be Won” is a Crass-inspired remix combining elements of previous songs “Neutralizing Opiate”, “Autonomy”, and “No Xenophobic HxC”. And B2 is a sequel to Mavis Concave’s electribe anthem “Open Eyes”, with extended lyrics by Inhuman and Swill. Overtly combative yet urgently outreaching, Realicide represents a minority contingent of electronic-driven punx in post-911 America, progressing a personalized vision apart from any dogmatic precedents established in hardcore.

All three tracks originated from Mavis Concave wielding raw Korg ES-1 patterns in later 2007, developed and edited in the years following. Open Eyes is the original studio version heard on a 3\" CDR in 2008, pre-dating its extended sequel found on \"The Choice Is Yours\" EP of 2009. For the other two tracks, after many shows and live bootlegs, this is the first time their original studio versions have been released. Deathbomb with lyrics by Robert Inhuman concerning the realities of \"misfit\" subculture versus what it is to really feel like an outcast among outcasts! MyStage  with lyrics by Jim Swill in a frightening description of a social world crippled by pseudo-celebrity mania and the idolization of self-destruction. \"I do not worship icon immortality!

Waking From That Final Dream + B. Lifelong Exit = Two slower synth-driven songs written by Robert Inhuman literally inside a dark closet in the later months of  2007, not released until 2010 with help from War On Records (Oakland, CA). Inspired by the morbid qualities of deathrock and industrial, and with an overtly damaged optimism, these tracks actually predate much of  what is found on previous Realicide 7”s and the “Resisting” LP. More noticeably musical than most other Realicide records, and the element of hardcore is pushed into the far background, making this 7” a unique break from what the group is more commonly known for. 300 copies, September 2010.

This is the final release of the bizarre grindcore / sped-up noiserock trio of Robert Inhuman and the guys from Capital Hemorrhage and Ultra//Vires. Hentai Lacerator was only active 2005-2007, based in Dayton and briefly toured the midwest and southern regions of the US. This BRK release is a collection of 69 trax of HL at its worst - scathing noisecore, earliest demo and rehearsal recordings, all overtly themed around Slimer and comparable creatures engaging in nympho-maniacal frenzies of orgasmic dementia with human (?) females. BRK has gone all-out in the DIY fashion with a screenprinted disc, several screenprinted vinyl stickers, and a lime green A3 foldout featuring many R.Inhuman drawings dating back to early childhood. Tracklist contains previously unavailable material as well as all releases besides \"Covered In Fun\" and \"Sugarsplash\", which were the two primary HL albums...\r\n - \"Made From The Dreams of Babies\" part I and II (Realicide Youth Records, 2006)\r\n - both cassingles accessorizing \"Covered In Fun\" album (RYR, 2007) \r\n- 7\" (Isle of Man, 2007) \r\n- final live gig 3\" (Jeshimoth, 2008)","options":[{"id":48943281,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128156748/-/Hentai_Lacerator_BRK_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128156748/-/Hentai_Lacerator_BRK_1.jpg","width":475,"height":475},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128156730/-/Hentai_Lacerator_BRK_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128156730/-/Hentai_Lacerator_BRK_3.jpg","width":500,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128156727/-/Hentai_Lacerator_BRK_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128156727/-/Hentai_Lacerator_BRK_2.jpg","width":475,"height":475}],"artists":[{"id":40611,"name":"ROBERT INHUMAN","permalink":"robert-inhuman","url":"/artist/robert-inhuman"},{"id":40581,"name":"HENTAI LACERATOR","permalink":"hentai-lacerator","url":"/artist/hentai-lacerator"},{"id":40571,"name":"CAPITAL HEMORRHAGE","permalink":"capital-hemorrhage","url":"/artist/capital-hemorrhage"}],"categories":[{"id":687231,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"},{"id":2528017,"name":"ARTWORK & MISC","permalink":"artwork-misc","url":"/category/artwork-misc"}]}]
