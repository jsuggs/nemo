I chose these images out of nearly fifty runs of the simulation.","options":[{"id":16999843,"name":"8 x 10\" Matted - $30","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16999845,"name":"11 x 14\" Matted","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":16999847,"name":" 8 x 10\" Framed","price":80.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":16999849,"name":"11 x 14\" Framed","price":135.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":45.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/51394287/-/society-of-stickpeople-45.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/51394287/-/society-of-stickpeople-45.png","width":480,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43838381/-/society-of-stickpeople-45-detail.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43838381/-/society-of-stickpeople-45-detail.png","width":480,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/51394295/-/art-sizes-over-couch-2-horiz.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/51394295/-/art-sizes-over-couch-2-horiz.png","width":480,"height":480}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2449043,"name":"Fine Art Prints","permalink":"fine-art-prints","url":"/category/fine-art-prints"},{"id":2462645,"name":"Color","permalink":"color","url":"/category/color"},{"id":2462641,"name":"Society of Stickpeople","permalink":"society-of-stickpeople","url":"/category/society-of-stickpeople"},{"id":2793863,"name":"Show standard description","permalink":"show-standard-description","url":"/category/show-standard-description"}]},{"id":4479619,"name":"Death Mask 1 in Baroque Style Frame","permalink":"death-mask-1-in-baroque-style-frame","position":13,"price":350.0,"default_price":350.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/death-mask-1-in-baroque-style-frame","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-09-21T12:58:31.000Z","description":"<h2 class=\"statement\">Artist Statement</h2>\r\n<h3>Death Mask 1</h3>\r\n\r\nWith a gaping, leering mouth and fractured skull-like forms, this print evokes tribal customs surrounding death or spiritual forces. \r\n\r\n<h3>About the Series</h3>\r\n\r\nThe Faces of Chaos series visualizes a system of equations using a unique mapping of the Lyapunov exponent to the image plane.
