From the downtempo gloss of his Quiet Village project to a half-hour-long remix of Diddy to the audio-visual soundscape immersions of The Machine, he continually strives to push his music forward and keep himself on his toes. It’s this dedication to progression and eclecticism that imbues his 4/4 grooves with such texture and depth, something that runs equally through the releases on his acclaimed REKIDS imprint.\r\n\r\nHis concoction for Balance comes in two distinct parts, its 33 tracks marking a stark contrast to the stripped-back simplicity of his fabric 48 mix. “The idea of a double disc is something that totally suits me down to the ground” he explains. “I’m interested in so many types of music. So with the Balance compilation I knew I’d have to take one mix in a clubbier direction and then the second disc would be all about showcasing tracks from my favourite producers and creating an environment for home listening that isn’t just wallpaper.” He cites Future Sound Of London’s Kiss FM sessions and DJ Harvey’s Sarcastic as inspirational DJ mixes, both visionaries in their own way.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\nCD1 – White Skies\r\n1.

Born to a professional drummer father and a Royal Ballet ballerina mother, he grew up surrounded by music and slowly but surely worked his way into similarly focused endeavours. His highly musical take on house and downtempo 4/4 grooves as a producer is somewhat belied by his prowess as a dancefloor-driven DJ, but it’s exactly this combination that makes him such an exciting proposition. Whether he’s playing the big rooms of a We Love… Space residency, serving up wigged-out grooves alongside his Fist Or Finger label partner Craig Richards or soundtracking a sun-drenched day party in Shoreditch, he always seems effortlessly comfortable – and accomplished.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\n1.

Through attempting to occupy the creative space closer to that of an artist album, rather than a club mix, Henry has delicately created an odyssey in sound.\r\n\r\nCD1 explores how music has the power to contain and store personal emotional experiences. This is the characteristic that Henry loves most about music, that ‘evocative power to send you back to your childhood or to a specific moment of your life’. In order to create that evocative and psychedelic atmosphere, this CD has an elaborated crafted lo-fi sound through the use of varying analogue formats such as cassette or vinyl. Saiz expertly harnesses his intricate knowledge of sound through the use of a multitude of layers, sampling, edits and the use of lot of vocals to create a melodic and intense experience that attempts to connect with memories and complex emotions.\r\n\r\nFollowing the same concept, but offering up a balance is CD2, which is more geared towards the dance-floor. As ever, the track selection is eclectic in its outlook, but has a definite tech-house feel that is tinged with the influence of House, melodic Techno, Disco and Detroit alongside the plethora of styles Saiz uses for his musical motivation.\r\n\r\nAdding to the experience is the fact that Henry has chosen to use only unreleased productions and exclusive collaborations with other artists. So there are plenty of rare inclusions on the track-list that make for a completely fresh listening experience. \r\n\r\nNotable highlights are Saiz’s own new downtempo version of ‘Lady in the Mirror’ and new tracks from him like ‘Eterno Retorno’, which effortlessly fuses the past and present. Exclusively made for this are collaborations with Marc Marzenit, Dosem and Pional. New tracks like ‘Together’ by Border Community’s Ricardo Tobar and Petar Dundov aka Solar Sailor’s ‘Horizons’ revisit Henry’s musical journey with their distinctive progressive and futuristic sound. \r\n\r\nAdditionally Henry’s new moniker ‘Hal Incandenza’ is featured here for the first time and offers up some amazing productions in the form of ‘Little Mountains’ and also ‘Mystical Tree’. \r\n\r\nFollowing the precedence set by previous featuring artists such as James Holden, Agoria and Joris Voorn, Balance 019 is another truly breathtaking outing from one of electronic music’s gifted proponents, and fully lives up to the forward-thinking expectations of the seminal mix series.\r\n\r\nBALANCE CD 1\r\n\r\n01.
