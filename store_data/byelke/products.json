By adding the leather bottom & side zippers to the existing shape it turned into an amazing oversized tote bag.Well, that original bag left my studio quite some time ago but I did have the foresight to copy the shape & make a pattern. This is the result. I love this bag not only for it's bigness (I keep picturing myself going through an airport with it) but also for it's unique shape & it's very convenient 2 zipper side opening. In a pinch, you can even reach into the inside pocket without opening the bag at all. The outside pocket is a great spot to store your phone or your plane tickets. the leather piecing that wraps around the body & the shoulder straps are all hand cut & finished. The bottom is reinforced with a soft, thick vegetable tanned chocolate colored leather. A small red cross has been hand punched & embroidered below the front strap. Inside the bag is a classic natural canvas that will add durability to an already very strong tote. \r\n\r\n19\"w x 17.5\"h x 5\"deep\r\nfront pocket: 6.5\"w  x 8\"h\r\nshoulder straps: 1\"w x 24\"l, 11.5\" drop\r\n2 inside pockets: 5\"w x 7\"d\r\n\r\nLocal pick-up option:\r\nIf you are in the neighborhood (Boulder vicinity) and would like to save yourself a couple bucks on shipping you can pick up your goods at Elke's studio in downtown Boulder! \r\nPlease make sure you select the \"pick-up\" option in shipping choices on PayPal.","options":[{"id":44595108,"name":"Default","price":185.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125120862/-/Carson_stripe_tote_fr.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125120862/-/Carson_stripe_tote_fr.jpg","width":623,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125120856/-/carson_stripe_tote_back.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125120856/-/carson_stripe_tote_back.jpg","width":619,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125120868/-/carson_stripe_tote_wear.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125120868/-/carson_stripe_tote_wear.jpg","width":646,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125120865/-/carson_stripe_tote_in.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125120865/-/carson_stripe_tote_in.jpg","width":692,"height":900}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4537136,"name":"Totes","permalink":"totes","url":"/category/totes"},{"id":6334602,"name":"One of a Kind","permalink":"one-of-a-kind","url":"/category/one-of-a-kind"}]},{"id":13976970,"name":"Old National Bank Clutch","permalink":"old-national-bank-clutch","position":36,"price":75.0,"default_price":75.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/old-national-bank-clutch","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-04T19:42:24.000Z","description":"One-Of-A-Kind\r\nThis very unique bag was repurposed from an actual vintage bank bag.

Each bag is branded with the date it was issued on the front lower strap. I encourage you to look at the available pictures of all 3 bags listed to get a good idea of all the details involved in these bags.
