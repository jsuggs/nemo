In the 27-minute experimental documentary \"Parasites: A User’s Guide,\" ecologist and filmmaker Sharon Shattuck embarks on a journey to decode some of the most misunderstood creatures on earth. \r\n\r\nThe dramatic rise in autoimmune diseases, asthma, and allergies since the turn of the last century has confounded scientists, but some researchers think they have uncovered the key to controlling the skyrocketing rates: tiny parasitic worms called 'helminths.'  Using a blend of handmade and digital animation and indie music, Sharon dives headlong into the controversial discourse surrounding 'helminthic therapy,' with help from scientific researchers, active patients and a renegade entrepreneur named Jasper Lawrence.  Through the seeming oxymoron of the 'helpful parasite,' Sharon questions the nature of our relationship with parasites--and suggests a new paradigm for the future. \"Parasites: A User’s Guide\" is a film about ecology, healing, and worms.\r\n","options":[{"id":13386277,"name":"Default","price":135.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.75,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/39442643/-/DVD_exhibition__.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/39442643/-/DVD_exhibition__.jpg","width":1000,"height":996}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2230763,"name":"DVDs","permalink":"dvds","url":"/category/dvds"}]},{"id":4038597,"name":"Parasites: A User's Guide DVD (for nonprofits & one-time public screenings)","permalink":"parasites-a-user-s-guide-nonprofit-small-public-screening-copy","position":3,"price":45.0,"default_price":45.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/parasites-a-user-s-guide-nonprofit-small-public-screening-copy","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-07-06T02:20:10.000Z","description":"Please note: this DVD of 'Parasites: A User's Guide' is intended for purchase by nonprofit groups or individuals, for use at small public screenings.
