Recorded in the city of brotherly love at Uniform Recording by engineer/producer Jeff Zeigler (Kurt Vile, The War on Drugs, Purling Hiss, etc.)\r\n\r\nThink the Minutemen meets early My Bloody Valentine meets the Swirlies meets Dave Baker era Mercury Rev married with early period New Weird America bands like Animal Collective, Gang Gang Dance, and Ariel Pink, and your at somewhere close to what this record sounds like. Freaky, frazzled, beautiful and abrasive, this record is wonderfully strange. \"FACE PEEL\" is destined to be a future classic. \r\n\r\nHere's how the press describes Aunt Dracula's sound:\r\n\r\n  Hailing from Philadelphia, they are as roomy as a pharaoh’s crypt. Lush and eerie, their music is like a haunted greenhouse, full of bizarre musical fauna and the distant echoes of passing voices that rave with layered incantations. It’s pop music with heart, and it’s got enough vision and room reverb to make it fully mammalian and four chambered, even if we aren’t exactly certain of the sub species. With Aunt Dracula, mood runs to exotic highs. \r\n\r\nIf there were such a thing as a postmodern post-apocalypse, and the world existed in a kind of warping shift of dark hues, Dalí-esque imagery and Technicolor, Philly’s Aunt Dracula is the band that would write its surf music. Whorls of twisted, reverby guitar, trippy, demented vocals and shifting paces of mania and loopy languidness can be found in any Aunt Dracula song. But so can bombastic, aggressive, sharply rendered passages that suggest a psychotic breakthrough. Guitar rock this inspired and experimental is a rarity, and Aunt Dracula gives sonic adventurers much to sink their teeth into.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":36800946,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114797934/-/969264_518025221593624_1810251862_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114797934/-/969264_518025221593624_1810251862_n.jpg","width":960,"height":541}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":92768,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":11633745,"name":"AD \"PSYCHEDELIC MAGICIANS GUILD\" Tee","permalink":"ad-trucker-psychedelic-magicians-guild","position":2,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ad-trucker-psychedelic-magicians-guild","status":"sold-out","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-06-07T03:38:38.000Z","description":"Cop this insanely awesome design, and become one with the mysterious, otherworldliness of Aunt Dracula's music.
