We were hangin’ out in the sweat lodge when the shaman asked “What’s the deal with your last album?” \r\n“What do you mean?” Abe said.\r\n“Well, I liked the music, but I want to talk to you about the art…”\r\n“You didn’t like the art?” Dave asked.\r\n“My concern is that you put the Kokopelli in the dreamcatcher”, said the shaman. “Do you even know what you’ve done?”\r\n“We just thought it looked cool as a design—a Kokopelli superimposed on a dreamcatcher background…”\r\n“--Listen to me you two,” the Shaman interrupted, “The Kokopelli is a pedophile, a child molester, and you put him in the dream catcher which captures bad dreams in its web and lets the good ones go through—so basically, you’re saying: fuck the world!”\r\nWe were both naked except for the rawhide dreamcatcher necklaces we were wearing: the shaman reached out and grabbed our dreamcatchers and tore them off simultaneously.\r\n“You don’t even know what these mean!” \r\nWe sat quietly in the sweatlodge for a moment, not knowing what to say.\r\nThe shaman spoke again, “You will not grow until you make it right with the spirits. You will write another album and you will not leave this lodge until it is finished...”\r\nHe handed us an old Casio keyboard with a Kokopelli sticker on it and said, “Compose songs of happiness, joy, beauty, truth and motivation…I also would like to hear a song about an ipod and the emergency pregnancy test.”\r\n\r\nPRICE INCLUDES SHIPPING!","options":[{"id":10005167,"name":"Default","price":8.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27828195/-/k3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27828195/-/k3.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[{"id":46468,"name":"Treasure MammaL","permalink":"treasure-mammal","url":"/artist/treasure-mammal"}],"categories":[{"id":1655155,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":2781405,"name":"The Chronicles of Sheriff Joe Arpaio 7\"","permalink":"the-chronicles-of-sheriff-joe-arpaio-7","position":4,"price":14.99,"default_price":14.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-chronicles-of-sheriff-joe-arpaio-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-10-03T11:43:12.000Z","description":"This is a legendary release called \"The Chronicles of Sheriff Joe Arpaio\" which is out on Kingdom Mammalia Records. It features 4 of Phoenix, Arizona's best bands (Andrew Jackson Jihad, Treasure Mammal, Father's Day, and Porches) and is on pink vinyl. This compilation is about Joe Arpaio who is the Sheriff of Maricopa County in Arizona: he is one of America's biggest racist/bigot/egomaniacs. This record has received quite a bit of press already and has been in the news again because a band named \"The Crocodiles\" from San Diego called a song \"Kill Joe Arpaio.\"  Well, sorry crocodile, Andrew Jackson Jihad said they were going to kill Joe first and it was on this awesome record! \r\n\r\nSide A \r\n\r\nTrack 1: Father's Day - Americas Toughest Sheriff\r\nTrack 2: Porches - Fascist Burritos\r\n\r\nSide B: \r\n\r\nTrack 3: Treasure Mammal - Arpayaso\r\nTrack 4: Andrew Jackson Jihad - Joe Arpaio is a Punk\r\n","options":[{"id":9738612,"name":"Default","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.99,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26891434/-/bc.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26891434/-/bc.jpg","width":640,"height":480}],"artists":[{"id":46467,"name":"Andrew Jackson Jihad","permalink":"andrew-jackson-jihad","url":"/artist/andrew-jackson-jihad"},{"id":46468,"name":"Treasure MammaL","permalink":"treasure-mammal","url":"/artist/treasure-mammal"},{"id":46469,"name":"Fathers Day","permalink":"fathers-day","url":"/artist/fathers-day"},{"id":46470,"name":"Porches","permalink":"porches","url":"/artist/porches"}],"categories":[{"id":1655168,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":2781417,"name":"Expect the Max","permalink":"expect-the-max","position":5,"price":7.99,"default_price":7.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/expect-the-max","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-10-03T12:01:33.000Z","description":"Treasure MammaL \"Expect the Max\" is the soundtrack to your next DMT trip.
