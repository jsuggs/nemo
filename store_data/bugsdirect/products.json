A strong grounding in the real world provides a foundation for the imagined worlds, creatures and characters Carim creates. The Bumble-Bee is a particularly important species to man, being one of many insect pollinators, but perhaps the most iconic now due to their drastic decline throughout the UK. Carim has depicted the Bee like a religious icon as a symbol of hope, almost as a warning of what could be to come if we allow more bee species to die out.","options":[{"id":46387749,"name":"A3","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46387752,"name":"A2","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46387755,"name":"A1","price":90.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126288822/-/Bombus_terrestrisFB.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126288822/-/Bombus_terrestrisFB.jpg","width":800,"height":1079}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6486558,"name":"Insect Art","permalink":"insect-art","url":"/category/insect-art"}]},{"id":7974903,"name":"The Giant Bird Eating Tarantula (H. minax) Double Glass Frame","permalink":"giant-tarantula","position":31,"price":59.99,"default_price":59.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/giant-tarantula","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-11-13T17:14:47.000Z","description":"Haplopelma consists of relatively large specimens, with a typical adult legspan ranging from 4.5\" to 6\" (15 cm).
