Rachel began performing in the musical theater at age seven, appearing in venues throughout the state. By her senior year in high school, Rachel realized that she felt most comfortable at the piano, and began developing the natural songwriting skills that she had since childhood. Growing up Rachel was influenced by the soulful singing and songwriting of artists like Ben Folds, Billy Joel, Carole King and James Taylor, and she incorporated her passion for their art into her own music.\n\n","options":[{"id":360708,"name":"\"I'm up to No Good\"","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/155660/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/155660/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":82547,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
