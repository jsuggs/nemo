The sounds are welcomingly familiar; inspired percussion amid a sea of imaginative guitars and impassioned vocals. However, the underlying unrest is more complex and touching than any previous Touche Amore release before it. Simply put, these are not simple \"love\" songs that dwell in the past, but complex \"life\" songs about living in the present. Throughout the entire album vocalist/lyricist Jeremy Bolm digs deeper in search of personal catharsis, allowing us to relate to his drive to be clearly heard, truly understood, and unapologetically remembered. \"Is Survived By\" not only shows growth in subject matter but musicianship for Touche Amore. The jangly guitar work of Clayton Stevens and Nick Steinhardt is on a new level here. Throughout the release they effortlessly entangle one another to construct beautiful yet unexpected melodies. While the explosive rhythm section of Tyler Kirby and Elliot Babin shines in the frenetic pace they keep. Achieving a stunning balance of hook laden listenability and emotion.\r\n\r\nWithout question, \"Is Survived By\" is another masterwork from Touche Amore. More importantly, it is a release that lives up to the promise of past releases while not repeating it. Not a departure, but a continuation down the remarkable road that they alone travel.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n\r\n01. Just Exist\r\n02. To Write Content\r\n03. Praise / Love\r\n04.

With a population of just over four thousand people, Eudora may be a peculiar place for a punk band to go, but nestled in its rural isolation is acclaimed engineer Ed Rose and his Black Lodge Studios (formerly Redhouse Recording Studio). There under Rose's attentive ears, Touche Amore poured their patchwork soul into their latest work, \"Parting the Sea Between Brightness and Me\".\r\n\r\nIn \"Parting the Sea Between Brightness and Me\", Touche Amore's creative formula is driven by emotional affect, not contemporary studio effects. In the purest form possible, raw shouted vocals and clean manic guitars fight for volume over roomy bass and percussion. Creating a sound that is shockingly simple as it is emotionally engaging. The serene and fragile opening notes of \"Tilde\" serve as the album's introductory serenade before Touche Amore pound and jangle into the hook-laden song. And seconds later, when vocalist/lyricist Jeremy Bolm screams \"...I'm parting the sea between brightness and me...\", a tone of desperation sets in that resonates throughout the duration of the album. His straight forward cries convincingly tell his own personal story. To some, this lyrical writing could read as a diary based purely in self deprecation, but his words cut and pull from a much deeper place in the heart. Serving as an open window into his constant soul searching amid life's constant trials and tribulations. Songs like \"Home Away From Here\" and \"Sesame\" are great examples of this, infectious in their sound and moving lyrical spirit. While \"Method Act\" and the emotional \"Condolences\" show the band experimenting with epic leanings while maintaining their beloved trademark character. Without a doubt, Touche Amore's \"Parting the Sea Between Brightness and Me\" is a stunning full length achievement on any scale. Proving that there is true beauty within the concept of artistic simplicity.\r\n\r\nTRACK LISTING:\r\n01. ~\r\n02. Pathfinder\r\n03. The Great Repetition\r\n04. Art Official\r\n05.

Saying the words that we all wished we could say, in the name of the pain, beauty, and the hardship of living.","options":[{"id":46703301,"name":"Default","price":10.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":3.3,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":5.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":5.5},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126520773/-/witness.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126520773/-/witness.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2031666,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"},{"id":560361,"name":"Distro","permalink":"distro","url":"/category/distro"}]},{"id":13086516,"name":"HARMS WAY 'BLINDED'","permalink":"harms-way-blinded","position":53,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/harms-way-blinded","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-21T09:58:43.000Z","description":" \tDW143v\r\nHarm's Way\r\nBlinded\r\n12\"EP\r\n\r\nPrice: $12.00\r\n\r\nVinyl Color: \t\r\nQuantity:\r\n\r\nNotify me when this item is in stock\r\nBookmark and Share\r\n\t\r\n\r\nBuy now and receive an INSTANT high quality MP3 Download of the release!!!\r\n\r\nHarm's Way are an absolute force of a band from Chicago, Illinois. They made a name for themselves with masterful releases on the Organized Crime and Closed Casket Activities labels. With their punishing \"Isolation\" album (Closed Casket, 2011), Harm's Way brutally melded a metal attack, hardcore aggression, and industrial repetition into a new kind of sound. Creating a balance of intensity and originality rare in today's world of music.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of Harm's Way continues with \"Blinded\", their new 12\"EP/CD on Deathwish. Illustrated by Florian Bertmer (Converge, Pig Destroyer, etc) and recorded at Brick Top Recordings by engineer Andy Nelson (Weekend Nachos), \"Blinded\" is a crusher from start to finish. Songs like \"Frontal Lobe\" and \"Live to Loathe\" are the band at their heaviest and most adventurous so far. All of it fueled by a vitriol and pain that makes them stronger than all.\r\n\r\nTRACK LISTING:\r\n01. Frontal Lobe\r\n02. Mind Control\r\n03. Blinded\r\n04. Blind Stare\r\n05.

Amongst their ranks are veterans of the underground hardcore/metal scene: Kevin Baker (the Hope Conspiracy) is the throat and Ben Koller (Converge) is the battery. Although the band's members hail from these known modern hardcore/metal acts they turn their more crust punk/d-beat-driven aggression outward with ALL PIGS MUST DIE. All Pigs Must Die (APMD ) is a band committed to uncompromising sonic warfare. Its sound and lyrics assault the listener in a fury of blackened death filled anthems. Owing as much to the Cro-Mags and Discharge as Entombed and Celtic Frost. APMD mix powerful riffs, relentless tempos and a dark presence to bulldoze a grim path of destruction. Recorded and mixed by KURT BALLOU (Converge guitarist and master engineer for bands such as Black Breath, Nails, Trap Them, High on Fire etc..) at Godcity Studios. \"Nothing Violates This Nature\" the end result is 11 violence-inducing shredders steeped in utter filth. Aaron Turner (Isis) has lent his nihilistic hand, pen and mind to develop along with the band the dark iconic artwork contained within.

Where \"Maelstrom\" acted as individual fragments of aural shrapnel, \"Eros|Anteros\" is a monstrous shockwave of sound. It is Oathbreaker's story of love and the anti-love (life and death), and the growth they have experienced through these trials.\r\n\r\nIn opener \"Beeltenis\" (Dutch for \"Portrait\") layers of melodious guitar cry out to one another through the blackness. Acting as a ghostlike warning before Oathbreaker whips calm to chaos. \"No Rest for the Weary\" then abruptly crashes forward with breakneck speed and from there the floodgates of \"Eros|Anteros\" are open. As vocalist Caro Tanghe lets out the hair raising screams of \"I'll never know what it means - this deadly calm inside\", it's clear that this album is more potent and personal than most heavy music; this is a collective soul searching for the band. This is most apparent in brother and sister songs \"As I Look Into the Abyss\" and \"The Abyss Looks Into Me\". A stunning pairing that shows Oathbreaker racing through razor sharp metallic riffing before erupting into a vicious emotional explosion. This quarrel continues throughout the \"Eros|Anteros\", finally coming to a head in the haunting closer \"Clair Obscur\". A brilliant eleven minute epic that carefully balances shoe-gaze leanings with their wounded post-metal heart.\r\n\r\nTRACK LISTING:\r\n01. Beeltenis\r\n02. No Rest for the Weary\r\n03.

Most impressive however, is how the band utilizes pop conventions - both vocal and instrumental melody, and a strong and pounding rhythm section - while delving deep into the ethereal power of textured soundscapes. Guitars fuzz and flange, weaving between distinct, identifiable parts and simple brushes of colored noise. The voices similarly drift between carrying delicate melodies and delivering evocative feeling. Calling on the infectious, hooky inclinations of the Pixies, dreary melodies of the Breeders and sonic mass of My Bloody Valentine, Pity Sex's Feast of Love twists and churns with these beautiful yet fleeting vignettes captured in sound. \r\n\r\nClear/ marble green","options":[{"id":46703490,"name":"Default","price":12.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":3.3,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":5.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":5.5},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126520878/-/pity_sex.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126520878/-/pity_sex.jpg","width":960,"height":960}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2031666,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"},{"id":560361,"name":"Distro","permalink":"distro","url":"/category/distro"}]},{"id":14430762,"name":"DADS 'AMERICAN RADASS (THIS IS IMPORTANT)'","permalink":"dads-american-radass-this-is-important","position":68,"price":10.99,"default_price":10.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dads-american-radass-this-is-important","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-26T22:52:15.000Z","description":"Euro pressing, black /150","options":[{"id":46702902,"name":"Default","price":10.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":3.3,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":5.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":5.5},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.9,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126520548/-/dads_american_radass.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126520548/-/dads_american_radass.jpg","width":2500,"height":2500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2031666,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"},{"id":560361,"name":"Distro","permalink":"distro","url":"/category/distro"}]},{"id":14164401,"name":"TURNOVER 'MAGNOLIA'","permalink":"turnover-magnolia","position":69,"price":11.99,"default_price":11.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/turnover-magnolia","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-14T10:56:29.000Z","description":"Two acclaimed release into their short career - a debut EP and a split 7\" with Citizen - Virginia's Turnover have quickly grabbed the attention of a scene of angst filled teens and twenty-somethings who grew up on Drive-Thru records classics and 90's grunge radio.

In May of 2012, the idea was to combine friends (some of whom had never met) from different bands and see what could happen in one afternoon. Jeremy Bolm, vocalist of Hesitation Wounds, commented, \"I told Neeraj Kane (The Hope Conspiracy, Suicide File, Holy Fever), Jay Weinberg (ex-Against Me!), and Stephen 'Scuba' LaCour (Ex-Trap Them, True Cross), 'Let's write as many songs as we can on Sunday and record them on Monday.' Jay was in town and Scuba agreed to come out from Arizona for the weekend. What we came up with was three songs and an intro. We recorded them Monday afternoon with long time friend and always-available-for-my-stupid-shit, Alex Estrada. Lyrically, the songs are about witnessing the murder of a friend, the life and death of the inspirational underdog folk singer Phil Ochs, and the overall reality of life. Sonically, it's an abrasive / no strings attached outpouring of fast and heavy hardcore not far off from the bands we're already responsible for.

This EP marks the second release for Elliot; the Dad Punchers S/T LP opened eyes last year and gave him the platform that he has earned today, writing deeply personal and often charming songs about the struggles of young adulthood that anyone can relate to. This EP was recorded by Elliot himself in his time home from tour. Using his Father's living room and his growing knowledge of recording technique, he managed to produce an enjoyable listening experience while once again playing nearly every instrument. Taking cues from The Beach Boys,The Weakerthans, and a range of No Idea Records alumni, Dad Punchers is a look into who Elliot Babin really is as a musician, songwriter, and human being.\r\n\r\nI couldn't be more proud to call this SV05\" - Jeremy Bolm\r\n\r\nTRACK LISTING:\r\n01.

That night a band opened the show called Single Mothers. They started their set as I was organizing our merch and after about 45 seconds my ears perked up and I dropped what I was doing. I watched their set in entirety with my eyes wide and a rabid feeling of excitement that I knew I was witnessing something very special. Based out of London, Ontario Canada, Single Mothers plays a style of punk/post-hardcore that is both high in energy and layered with creativity. There is a level of honesty that vocalist Andrew Thomson gives with every song and performance that is jaw dropping and hair raising. This 7” EP serves as a unforgiving confessional of late intoxicated nights and sexual deviant behavior. Imagine a hybrid of The Hold Steady and The Bronx with a grimy overtone all it’s own. All of the elements are present for Single Mothers to step out of the shadows of Ontario and be the new Canadian front runners.\" - Jeremy Bolm.
