This painting is about metamorphoses—persons, places and things becoming other realities nearing abstraction. Erps is an idea that’s somewhat hidden, but through insight, inspection and interpretation, one can get the gist. Erps is acrylic on canvas and measures 10”X 15”, 25.4 cm X 38 .1 cm approx.  This painting is stretched on heavy-duty stretcher bars.","options":[{"id":21565629,"name":"Default","price":500.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":20.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":40.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66684437/-/Erps_Small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66684437/-/Erps_Small.jpg","width":750,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":6734883,"name":"Andy Warhol Inspired Painted Display Shoes","permalink":"andy-warhol-inspired-painted-display-shoes","position":2,"price":100.0,"default_price":100.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/andy-warhol-inspired-painted-display-shoes","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-18T23:26:39.000Z","description":" I painted this pair of shoes for Barneys New York Happy Andy Warholidays Christmas windows in 2006.

Before being painted the mannequin head was découpaged, which lends it a papier-mâché appearance. After painting, a light staining is applied giving the form a vintage quality. The head is then coated with a polyurethane or varnish for protection. This head form can be used in a store, home, office, showroom or dressing room to display hats, scarves, or what have you.

The series is called Nudies. With Nudies I painted male and female nude models that I found in various vintage magazines. I painted these vintage models on flat fields of color, in order to contrast the quasi-realistic painting style that I rendered them in. The monotone backdrop lends these caricatures a Pop Art quality reminiscent of the decades they are taken from.  \r\nBonnie Miss March is acrylic on canvas and measures 12”X 22”, 30.5 cm X 55.9 cm approx.
