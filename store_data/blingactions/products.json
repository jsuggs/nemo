Her repetition of important points really helped to reinforce what was important to remember. I could’ve listened to and talked with her for hours! I’m so excited to try out some of the things that I learned…I’ll let you (Nikki) know how it goes.

If your goal is to have a successful photography business classes are a necessity.\r\n\r\n“The most empowering thing you can do for yourself as a budding photographer is to learn your settings. Talent is important but knowing your settings, understanding your camera and being able to adjust those settings on fly will give you much more freedom as an artist. Remember the only stupid question is the unasked one. Get your camera smarts kicked into high gear and take the fear OUT of your shooting equation”\r\n\r\nLearning should be fun and with my classes it is!\r\n\r\nWhat students are saying\r\n\r\nMy Camera 101 class with Nikki Bean tonight was A-MA-ZING!!! She did an awesome job of explaining so many different things about the camera and described each of them in detail to show how they all work together. Her repetition of important points really helped to reinforce what was important to remember. I could’ve listened to and talked with her for hours! I’m so excited to try out some of the things that I learned…I’ll let you (Nikki) know how it goes. Thanks again!!!” Susie Stefaniak Rondeau\r\n\r\n\"I’m so glad that I decided to take this class tonight. Absolutely loved it— TONS of great information. I now have a much better understanding of all the different settings on my camera. I can’t wait to test out what I learned this weekend.

Perfect for on location & in studio sessions. \r\n\r\nMany photographers like to do a ‘clean edit’ on their photos before presenting to their clients.  They want something fast, something they can easily use as a batch clean edit.  Once the clients have reviewed the images and selected their favorites the photographer will then run some more detailed edits before final presentation & lab order or CD delivery. In some cases this action is all that is required!\r\n\r\nThis action was designed with the ‘clean edit’ in mind.   This will run in under a minute and provide just what your image needs for first review by your client. Add this to Photoshop’s Batch Edit and you just gained some YOU time!   {File—>automate—> Batch then select BLING lightening as your action and bam your done!}\r\n[[tab:content:end]]\r\n[[tab:content:start]]\r\n\r\nThis is a one action set that does everything for you. One step, no muss, no fuss! \r\n\r\nHere is what photographers are saying about BLING Lightning\r\n\r\n    “Its a one step action that literally does it all and quickly. I use BLING Lightning on all my clean edits.  Its a time savor while delivering the quality I expect from my actions.” – Nicki Hufford of Hufford Photography\r\n\r\n \r\n[[tab:content:end]]\r\n[[tab:content:start]]\r\n<strong>This set has been designed & tested in CS2 – Cs6 – not available for PSE</strong>\r\n\r\nPhotoshop actions make editing your images fast and easy while giving you the beautiful results you need and want.\r\n\r\nBling Photoshop actions are easy, one click actions that allow full user control for optimal editing results.
