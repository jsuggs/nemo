My concept was to create ornately beaded necklaces that recall more ancient times when gemstones were worn as amulets of protection, strength and power. WARRIOR FAE showcases rustic design with boldness and glamor. The necklace features three strands of brass and terra cotta beads from Africa, plus brass spacers. The necklace is also made with a dark patina clasp and findings. WARRIOR FAE feels and looks substantial. This stunning statement necklace is one-of-a-kind and would look amazing as ceremonial or ritual wear. \r\n\r\nNecklace measures 20 inches.\r\n\r\nCARNELIAN is an agate class of chalcedony that is a stone of creativity, individuality and courage. Like all agates, it has protection energies. It can aid memory, including recall of past lives. It can assist one in finding the right mate. It is also a stone of protection in general and from anger, jealousy and fear. In addition it can help with manifestation of one's desires, and brings good luck. Carnelian can help ease or remove sorrows. It also helps stabilize energies in the home. It is sometimes called the \"actor's stone\". Carnelian is associated with the root and sacral chakras.\r\n\r\nJASPER is called an ornamental rock. It is an opaque and fine grained variety, composed mostly of Chalcedony, microcrystalline Quartz, in association with other minerals, which is what give it those colorful bands and patterns. It is found in almost all colors. The ancient Egyptians wore Jasper scarabs as amulets, as this stone was believed to increase sexual energy. Both Indians in Asia as well as Native Americans, see it as a magical rain stone, and also a powerful healing stone.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

Dramatically accented with two huge iridescent crystal focal beads, SORCERESS includes thoughtful details like African brass spacers, filigree spacers and dark patina findings. A brand new Spinning Castle design, SORCERESS is a dramatic statement necklace that sparkles deep shades of purple and gold. The SORCERESS necklace is a powerful talisman that gleams with gorgeous color and tribal sophistication. It would make a stunning addition to ritual or ceremonial wear. Positively gorgeous!\r\n\r\nTANZINE AURA QUARTZ is a beautiful new gemstone of the Indigo/Violet Ray. It covers the same color spectrum as its namesake, Tanzanite, and indeed its radiance of colors is akin to that displayed by the finest Tanzanite gems. Like its cousins, Aqua Aura and Angel Aura Quartz, Tanzan Aura Quartz is created by the pyroelectric bonding of natural clear Quartz with atomized metal compounds. In the case of Tanzan Aura Quartz, the most important compo­nents are Indium, Gold and Niobium, all three of which are powerful substances in their own right. When combined with pure Quartz, which amplifies their power, these elements make for an intense vibrational pattern. Tanzan Aura Quartz is one of the most powerful materials for the development of one's latent psychic abilities and the enhancement of one's conscious connection to Spirit. It is an incredibly potent aid for intuitives of all sorts—mediums, shamans, readers, channelers, healers—as well as those who simply wish to become clearer in their subtle perceptions. It stimu­lates the third eye and crown chakras, blending and unifying their energies. It supports clear think­ing and aids memory. It helps one find inspiration and can evoke experiences of the 'aha' moment. It aids one in discovering novel solutions to long­standing problems by thinking 'outside the box.' Emotionally, Tanzan Aura Quartz allows one to kindle spiritual passion and to transcend states of indifference and boredom. It renews one's zest for the path of mysticism and self-actualization. -Quoted from Robert Simmons & Naisha Ahsian authors of \"The Book of Stones\"\r\n\r\nNecklace measures approximately 37 inches.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

POSEIDON'S TREASURE is handcrafted by me, Susan Tooker, and made with the best crystals and gemstones that I could find. Blesbok horns are comforting to hold and their pattern is quite dramatic and beautiful. The Blesbok horn wands are larger than the Springbok ones, averaging 14 to 20 inches in length. Adorned with a nautical shell motif, spirals and beautiful blue, orange and AB Swarovski gems, the spirals have an Art Nouveau or Celtic La Tene feel to their design. Centered in the front is a polished Labradorite and Blue Chalcedony cabochon below a gold leafed crescent moon. The sculpting has been antiqued with metallic gold paint and then sealed with clear coat. This crystal wand is part of a series of elaborate wands that feature Blesbok horn handles and also display beaded charm dangles hanging from within the sculpting. The dangles on POSEIDON'S TREASURE are beaded with a genuine Gold Rutile Quartz and a Carnelian bead. The magickal POSEIDON'S TREASURE Wand would be a wonderful addition to a sacred space, reiki healing, Wiccan rital or Pagan altar.\r\n\r\nPOSEIDON'S TREASURE measures 19 inches from tip to tip.\r\n\r\nBLESBOK wisdom Includes: Action, Speed, Adaptability of the Mind. Blesbok teaches survival and how to avoid indiscriminate destruction of life. Blesbok medicine is the knowledge of life’s circle, the knowledge and understanding of death. It is the messenger of a higher purpose and can teach clairvoyance by listening to its voice inside of you. A Blesbok person is intrinsically psychic. Often it is in the form of clear-smelling – fragrances and odors will awaken this power. Meditate using a fragrance with musk in it. Trust your instincts. If a person or situation does not “smell” right, back away from it.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

It has slight ripples on it like the patterns left in the sand as the waves lapse over it. It is comforting to hold it and rub the softness like you would a worry stone. People are instantly taken with its beautiful colors. For those of you who have never been to the ocean, buy a piece of it, and bring a little piece of the ocean to you. Energies of Abalone are protection and emotional balance. Usually found off the coasts of S. America, Japan, and China. Nicknamed the sea ears, the Abalone’s flattened, oval shape with iridescent interior was used by the Native Northwest American Indians as a natural vessel for cleansing, offerings and prayers.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

KEEPER OF SECRETS was created with a genuine Bobcat skull. The skull features fossil ammonite \"eyes,\" a Rutile Quartz \"nose\" and a \"headdress\" made with Buffalo teeth and green Jewel Beetle elytra. The skull is decorated with a leaf motif, sculpted spirals, and is adorned with Swarovski gems, Labradorite, Prehnite, Yellow Tigers Eye, plus a Moonstone cabochon fittingly placed on KEEPER OF SECRETS \"third eye.\" Hand painted with metallic paint by me, the skull and box has also been sealed with a clear coating. The altar box itself is adorned with Swarovski crystals, three Smoky Quartz cabochons, two Yellow Tiger Eye cabochons, four Labradorite cabochons, and a Green Aventurine cabochon in the front. The sculpting includes leaf and spiral motifs. This keepsake box is covered in gemstones. KEEPER OF SECRETS is part altar shrine, part totem protector and all mystery. This is not your everyday box and would look fabulous on a special altar honoring a Bobcat familiar or totem!\r\n\r\nLABRADORITE is a considered by mystics to be a stone of transformation and magic. It is said to clear, balance and protect the aura. It is purported to help provide clarity and insight into your destiny, as well as attract success. It is used in metaphysics for dream recall, and finding ways to use dreams in daily life. Mystically, energies of stress and anxiety are said to be reduced by labradorite. Labradorite is said to increase intuition, psychic development, esoteric wisdom, help with subconscious issues, and provide mental illumination.\r\n\r\nYELLOW TIGER'S EYE is a stone of protection that is also very grounding. It enhances integrity, willpower, practicality and correct use of power. It is a stone that enhances good luck, and brings prosperity, often in the form of money. Tiger's eye is also a very protective stone which is especially protective during travel. It can also help one see clearly without illusion. Tiger's eye brings a special boost to the solar plexus chakra and to one's personal power.\r\n\r\nMOONSTONE is said in crystal healing to help calm responses and avoid overreaction; enhances feminine energies, sensitivity, intuition, and psychic abilities. It is also said to bring strong energies of abundance to one's life. Moonstone is a stone of protection, especially during childbirth, pregnancy, and travel at sea. It is a stone of calm and relief from emotional stress. It is also associated with love of all kinds. Moonstone is associated with the crown and third eye chakras, and sometimes with the heart chakra.\r\n\r\nPREHNITE is a very protective stone and can protect one on all levels. It strengthens the life force and generally increases and stimulates energy, while at the same time bringing powerful calming energies. Thus, prehnite is said to ease worries and restlessness of all kinds. It aids spirit communication through meditation or visualization, out-of-body travel, and is a powerful dream stone. Prehnite is also known as a stone of prophesy which stimulates inner-knowing. \r\n\r\nBOBCAT TOTEM is a sign of patience. Bobcats are superior hunters, and they incorporate stealth, strategy and wield a great deal of patience in their hunting excursions. In this way, the Bobcat sends us a clear message that in order for us to get what we want, we must be willing to plan, adapt, and above all, have the patience to see our ideals manifest. When dealing with social settings (friends, family, work) the Bobcat reminds us to be fully aware. We must be mindful to extend our respect, love and consideration with others. As the Bobcat is primarily a solitary creature, we may take its presence as a sign for us to step back from the company of certain people in our lives. Or, the Bobcat may be trying to tell us that we need some time to ourselves. Alone time is time for us to reflect, and regain our energy. The Bobcat intrinsically knows this, and may be trying to tell you to take a break away from the public eye. Bobcat animal totems encourage us to be more playful in our lives and more flexible. As they are very opportunistic themselves, the Bobcat asks us to reach out for more opportunities, break out of our molds & routines. The Bobcat animal totem is also about creation, and developing our abilities into a higher level of value. Additionally, the Bobcat is also about the unseen and silent aspects of our inner selves. Additionally, when Bobcat appears to us, we need to consider some passions that we have been keeping a secret. Now is the time to unleash our hidden desires - unlock our inner secret wisdom & talents.\r\n\r\nYou can view more photos of the KEEPER OF SECRETS Shrine Box, including several great close-up shots, on my Susan Tooker Facebook page at: \r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151810956532996.1073741945.201283597995&type=3\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

Two flashing Labradorites occupy the front of the skull, as well as a polished Black Tourmaline and a Carnelian cabochon. Two fossil Ammonites serve as the eyes. Embedded in the ornamentation on the horns are two Black Tourmalines and two Agate cabochons. The horns have also been wrapped with leather and ornamentation. Four dangles hang from the horns that include River Amber, Agate, River Stone, African Stone, Peridot and handmade charms that were gold-leafed. Fox fur covers the back of the skull and a fox tail hangs below. Generously covering the skull and staff handle is ornate sculpting with leaf and spiral motifs. All of the adornment is enhanced with beautiful Khaki Green, Jet Black and Topaz Swarovski gems. Included in the decoration are 12 Carnelian cabochons down the length of the staff. The Celtic spirals and leaf motifs were antiqued with a metallic bronze, copper, and gold paint. Three layers of clear coat was applied.The wood handle is a piece of rustic driftwood gathered from the shore of the great Columbia River in Oregon. I wrapped the handle with buttery soft brown leather for added comfort. \r\n\r\nSACRED RAM is handcrafted by me, Susan Tooker, and is the first of its kind to be offered in my Spinning Castle online shop. I have made several personal staffs and decided to start creating them for my collectors as well. I envisioned this staff as a tribute to the mythic Ram. Inspired by ancient religons, Tibetan skulls, ossuaries, charnel houses and modern archelogical finds, my concept was to create a future artifact of Spirit and Ritual. The SACRED RAM Staff took 7 months to complete and is indicative of the direction that some of my major pieces of artwork will take in the future. \r\n\r\nSuitable for Witch, Druid, Wizard, Shaman or Art Collector, the SACRED RAM Staff is one of the finest items I have created for my Spinning Castle online store thus far. I'm super happy with the result! I will be creating major Altar pieces in the near future, as well as, new wands, fans and other tools.\r\n\r\nSACRED RAM measures 59 inches from tip to tip.\r\n\r\nI photographed SACRED RAM in the setting in which I gather driftwood for my ritual tools...along the shore of the great Columbia River, Oregon.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

My concept was to create ornately beaded necklaces that recall more ancient times when gemstones were worn as amulets of protection, strength and power. HATHOR showcases the buffalo teeth with a beautiful Jasper pendant that has wonderful shades of red, gold, white and black. The necklace is accented with beads of Jet, Garnet, Carnelian, and Clear Quartz Crystal. Also included in the design are various brass spacers from Africa. HATHOR feels substantial when worn and is statement necklace that creates a sense of power and protection. \r\n\r\nNecklace measures approximately 43 inches.\r\n\r\nJET, though known as black amber, is not amber at all. It is driftwood, primarily of the family Araucariaceae, that has fossilized, metamorphosed to lignite coal. At high magnification, the structure of the wood can still be seen even though its origin as a tree is millions of years in the past. In Whitby, England jet is mined that came from the Jurassic era around 180 million years ago. Jet is a soft, dull stone, but it will take a very high polish, even to a mirror finish. This is one of the things that has made it popular in talismans, jewelry, and carvings for centuries. Queen Victoria In the Victorian era, jet was used extensively for mourning jewelry. It has also been a traditional stone for rosaries.\r\n\r\nCARNELIAN is an agate class of chalcedony that is a stone of creativity, individuality and courage. Like all agates, it has protection energies. It can aid memory, including recall of past lives. It can assist one in finding the right mate. It is also a stone of protection in general and from anger, jealousy and fear. In addition it can help with manifestation of one's desires, and brings good luck.

Carnelian is associated with the root and sacral chakras. \r\n\r\nQUARTZ CRYSTAL is known as the \"master healer\" and will amplify energy and thought, as well as the effect of other crystals. It absorbs, stores, releases and regulates energy. Clear Quartz enhances psychic abilities. It aids concentration and unlocks memory. Stimulates the immune system and brings the body into balance. Clear Quartz (Crystal Quartz, Rock Crystal) harmonizes all the chakras and aligns the subtle bodies.\r\n\r\nGARNET cleanses and re-energises the chakras. It revitalises, purifies and balances energy, bringing serenity or passion as appropriate.  Inspires love and devotion. Garnet balances the sex drive and alleviates emotional disharmony. It activates and strengthens the survival instinct, bringing courage and hope. Stimulates past-life recall. Sharpens perceptions of oneself and others. Garnet removes inhibitions and taboos. It opens the heart and bestows self-confidence. A stone of commitment, Red Garnet represents love. It revitalises feelings and enhances sexuality, bringing warmth, devotion, understanding, trust, sincerity and honesty to a relationship. Red Garnet controls anger, especially toward the self.\r\n\r\nJASPER is called an ornamental rock. It is an opaque and fine grained variety, composed mostly of Chalcedony, microcrystalline Quartz, in association with other minerals, which is what give it those colorful bands and patterns. It is found in almost all colors. The ancient Egyptians wore Jasper scarabs as amulets, as this stone was believed to increase sexual energy. Both Indians in Asia as well as Native Americans, see it as a magical rain stone, and also a powerful healing stone.\r\n\r\nBUFFALO TOTEM equals Prayer and Abundance. Those who have a Buffalo totem must walk a sacred path, honoring every walk of life.

Above it on the front of the vintage German Roe Deer skull is a polished Carnelian. The remaining four deer skulls have polished Carnelian and Yellow Tigers Eye cabochons adorning the front. The back of the crown also has a Carnelian cabochon, along with four Jasper cabochons. All of the stones are surrounded by sculpted oak leaves, acorns and spirals that have been antiqued with black and bronze metallic paint. A special quartz powder was added to the paint to create a special glimmer. Adorning the entire crown are Siam, Fireopal, and Citrine AB Swarovski crystals. Special, handmade dangles were added to the bottom and feature faceted Carnelian, red quartz, and iridescent beads. \r\n\r\nCustom made by Susan Tooker of Spinning Castle, the BLACK FOREST QUEEN Witch Crown is ready to ship and One-of-a-Kind. Featuring 5 vintage roe deer trophies from Germany, BLACK FOREST QUEEN is the first of its kind to be offered in the Spinning Castle realm. I've had this vision brewing of a Witch Crown for a long time and this became my special Samhain project.\r\n\r\nBLACK FOREST QUEEN was inspired by the Cailleach, Ruler of Winter Hag, Bringer of Storms, the Dark Mother of the winter months, Creator Goddess. This is a special headdress, one-of-a-kind, and not easily repeated. BLACK FOREST QUEEN is a powerful piece and belongs with a powerful woman. Suitable for masquerade, ceremony or high ritual, the Black Forest Queen would be the ultimate crown for a Wiccan High Priestess, Shamaness or Pagan Leader.\r\n\r\nThe crown is medium sized, fitting a head measurement from 22.5 to 23 inches. The inside of the crown is also padded and covered with green velvet for comfort. Meticulously made, I use professional techniques and products when making my headdresses!\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

This process involves heating the Agate to extremely high temperatures (in excess of 1600°F) then adding the purified metal in a vacuum, which bonds it to the surface. The result is a permanent coating which has been bonded with the Agate at a molecular level. Although the coating is very thin, usually only 1 micron, it cannot be rubbed or scratched off and the results are quite spectacular. Only the best quality Agate is used for Aura coating, with any inferior specimens breaking during the heating and bonding process. Metaphysically, coated or Aura Agate have all of the properties of Agate, but with the additional benefits of the individual metal. Gold, in particular, is considered the master healer, with platinum having the highest vibration for spiritual work.\r\n\r\nAGATE is noted in the metaphysical world to be a good protective energy stone, especially for children, and very calming and soothing.

Also, by bringing the elements of one's being into harmony it greatly enhances healing. Agate also enhances creativity and stimulates the intellect.

MERMAID SCEPTER is handcrafted by me, Susan Tooker, and made with the best crystals and gemstones that I could find. Blesbok horns are comforting to hold and their pattern is quite dramatic and beautiful. The Blesbok horn wands are larger than the Springbok ones, averaging 14 to 20 inches in length. Adorned with a nautical shell motif, spirals and beautiful turquoise, orange and pink AB Swarovski gems, the spirals have an Art Nouveau or Celtic La Tene feel to their design. Centered in the front is a polished Amazonite and Chrysocolla below a silver leafed crescent moon. The sculpting has been antiqued with metallic gold paint and then sealed with clear coat. This crystal wand is part of a  series of elaborate wands that feature Blesbok horn handles and also display beaded charm dangles hanging from within the sculpting. The dangles on MERMAID SCEPTER are beaded with a genuine fossiled coral branch and a Tibetan Quartz bead. The magickal MERMAID SCEPTER Wand would be a wonderful addition to a sacred space, reiki healing, Wiccan rital or Pagan altar. \r\n\r\nMERMAID SCEPTER measures 19 inches from tip to tip.\r\n\r\nBLESBOK wisdom Includes: Action, Speed, Adaptability of the Mind. Blesbok teaches survival and how to avoid indiscriminate destruction of life. Blesbok medicine is the knowledge of life’s circle, the knowledge and understanding of death. It is the messenger of a higher purpose and can teach clairvoyance by listening to its voice inside of you. A Blesbok person is intrinsically psychic. Often it is in the form of clear-smelling – fragrances and odors will awaken this power. Meditate using a fragrance with musk in it. Trust your instincts. If a person or situation does not “smell” right, back away from it.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

It absorbs, stores, releases and regulates energy. Clear Quartz enhances psychic abilities. It aids concentration and unlocks memory. Stimulates the immune system and brings the body into balance. Clear Quartz (Crystal Quartz, Rock Crystal) harmonizes all the chakras and aligns the subtle bodies.\r\n\r\nMOONSTONE is said in crystal healing to help calm responses and avoid overreaction; enhances feminine energies, sensitivity, intuition, and psychic abilities. It is also said to bring strong energies of abundance to one's life. Moonstone is a stone of protection, especially during childbirth, pregnancy, and travel at sea. It is a stone of calm and relief from emotional stress. It is also associated with love of all kinds. Moonstone is associated with the crown and third eye chakras, and sometimes with the heart chakra.\r\n\r\nAMETHYST in the psychic and spiritual realms, is an excellent all-purpose stone that can increase spirituality, enhance intuition and psychic powers of all kinds. It does this by making a clear connection between the earth plane and other planes and worlds. Amethyst is also excellent for meditation and lucid dreaming. It is known to open one's channels to telepathy, past life regression, clairaudience, clairvoyance, and communication with angels. Amethyst also protects against psychic attacks, especially during spiritual work, and protects one from thieves, and protects travelers.\r\n\r\nDEER TOTEM- Deer is a keen observer, enabled to see well in low lighting and its sensitive hearing allows it to perceive a twig snap in the distance. The graceful movement and gentle nature of these creatures show us the innocence of nature. Deer is a messenger of serenity, can see between shadows and hear what isn't being said. Deer teaches us to maintain our innocence and gentleness so we can share our open-heartedness with others.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

It makes a stunning statement of Amethyst goodness!\r\n\r\nIce Age fossils direct from Florida are the inspiration for a new series of amulets handmade by me, Susan Tooker of Spinning Castle. The fossils serve as the base for a pendant that I combine with crystals, cabochons, sculpting, and Swarovski crystals. Each amulet is truly one-of-a-kind because each these fossils date from the last Ice Age and are over 10,000 years old! The color, texture and feel of the fossils is fascinating.\r\n\r\nNecklace measures 18 inches with a 2 inch extender.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

The iridescent blue to purple crystals are wire wrapped with oxidized and plum copper. CRYSTAL SHARDS also feature faceted crystal beads that are iridescent and shift in color, plus copper African spacers. I love the look of the rough crystal points with dark, oxidized findings and sparkling beads. CRYSTAL SHARDS are a brand new design!\r\n\r\nEarrings measure approximately 4 inches long.\r\n\r\nTANZINE AURA QUARTZ is a beautiful new gemstone of the Indigo/Violet Ray. It covers the same color spectrum as its namesake, Tanzanite, and indeed its radiance of colors is akin to that displayed by the finest Tanzanite gems. Like its cousins, Aqua Aura and Angel Aura Quartz, Tanzan Aura Quartz is created by the pyroelectric bonding of natural clear Quartz with atomized metal compounds. In the case of Tanzan Aura Quartz, the most important compo­nents are Indium, Gold and Niobium, all three of which are powerful substances in their own right. When combined with pure Quartz, which amplifies their power, these elements make for an intense vibrational pattern. Tanzan Aura Quartz is one of the most powerful materials for the development of one's latent psychic abilities and the enhancement of one's conscious connection to Spirit. It is an incredibly potent aid for intuitives of all sorts—mediums, shamans, readers, channelers, healers—as well as those who simply wish to become clearer in their subtle perceptions. It stimu­lates the third eye and crown chakras, blending and unifying their energies. It supports clear think­ing and aids memory. It helps one find inspiration and can evoke experiences of the 'aha' moment. It aids one in discovering novel solutions to long­standing problems by thinking 'outside the box.' Emotionally, Tanzan Aura Quartz allows one to kindle spiritual passion and to transcend states of indifference and boredom. It renews one's zest for the path of mysticism and self-actualization. -Quoted from Robert Simmons & Naisha Ahsian authors of \"The Book of Stones\"\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

These power stones are surrounded by green and AB Swarovski gems and hand-sculpted leaf motifs plus Celtic spirals. The sculpting was antiqued with metallic green, bronze and gold paint, after which a clear coat is applied. The mini handle is a wonderfully textured deer antler tine that is comforting to hold!\r\n\r\nA Spinning Castle creation: Pocket-sized magic wands with real antler tine handles! The perfect size for travel or display on your altar, each wand is completely unique and handmade by me, Susan Tooker, in my Secret Lair!\r\n\r\nABUNDANTIA'S PRAYER measures approximately 7 inches from tip to tip.\r\n\r\nCITRINE is solidified sunshine! It emits a solar ray of joy, expansive and potent. It connects your centre of will with the Divine, allowing you to use your personal power, mental focus and creative ideas to create a beautiful life. Citrine brings clarity, positivity and joyous transformation. Where you have indecisiveness, fogginess or uncertainty, Citrine can be used to become clear as to which direction to follow. Some keep a piece of Citrine in their wallets to bring a constant flow of money into it! \r\n\r\nGREEN MOSS AGATE Moss Agate provides strength in all endeavours and efficiency in all pursuits. It is great for increasing self-esteem and helps balance your emotions while strengthening your positive personal traits. It is a wonderful stone that allows everything you see around you to be seen as a thing of beauty. An excellent stone for communicating with the plant kingdom and successfully growing new crops, maintaining gardens and caring for healing herbs. Moss Agate works with the Earth’s energy of abundance, bringing you abundance and wealth in all forms. It is thus often used to help with the acquisition of riches and the powers of expedience. Growing plants in conjunction with its use enhances its abundance-manifesting energies. \r\n\r\nAGATE is noted in the metaphysical world to be a good protective energy stone, especially for children, and very calming and soothing. It is also said to help strengthen the body's connection to the earth. It is reported to mystically give courage, energy, strength, and dispels fears, all of which increase self-confidence. It is said to lessen feelings of envy by grounding the emotions. Agate is also used in crystal emotional healing for resolving bitterness and resentments. It is also called and believed to be a stone of harmony. These two factors makes it a stone that's said to help improve and harmonize relationships. Also, by bringing the elements of one's being into harmony it greatly enhances healing. Agate also enhances creativity and stimulates the intellect. Agate is considered a stone that brings good luck.\r\n\r\nDEER TOTEM- Deer is a keen observer, enabled to see well in low lighting and its sensitive hearing allows it to perceive a twig snap in the distance. The graceful movement and gentle nature of these creatures show us the innocence of nature. Deer is a messenger of serenity, can see between shadows and hear what isn't being said. Deer teaches us to maintain our innocence and gentleness so we can share our open-heartedness with others.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

I complimented the Quartz points with golden African recycled glass beads, gorgeous iridescent crystal beads, and an antique copper chain. A truly substantial bracelet and wrist amulet.\r\n\r\nBracelet measures approximately 8 inches with a 2 inch extender.\r\nThis bracelet can be adjusted to fit your wrist. Just write the needed measurement in the note to seller.\r\n\r\nTANZINE AURA QUARTZ is a beautiful new gemstone of the Indigo/Violet Ray. It covers the same color spectrum as its namesake, Tanzanite, and indeed its radiance of colors is akin to that displayed by the finest Tanzanite gems. Like its cousins, Aqua Aura and Angel Aura Quartz, Tanzan Aura Quartz is created by the pyroelectric bonding of natural clear Quartz with atomized metal compounds. In the case of Tanzan Aura Quartz, the most important compo­nents are Indium, Gold and Niobium, all three of which are powerful substances in their own right. When combined with pure Quartz, which amplifies their power, these elements make for an intense vibrational pattern. Tanzan Aura Quartz is one of the most powerful materials for the development of one's latent psychic abilities and the enhancement of one's conscious connection to Spirit. It is an incredibly potent aid for intuitives of all sorts—mediums, shamans, readers, channelers, healers—as well as those who simply wish to become clearer in their subtle perceptions. It stimu­lates the third eye and crown chakras, blending and unifying their energies. It supports clear think­ing and aids memory. It helps one find inspiration and can evoke experiences of the 'aha' moment. It aids one in discovering novel solutions to long­standing problems by thinking 'outside the box.' Emotionally, Tanzan Aura Quartz allows one to kindle spiritual passion and to transcend states of indifference and boredom. It renews one's zest for the path of mysticism and self-actualization. -Quoted from Robert Simmons & Naisha Ahsian authors of \"The Book of Stones\"\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

The wings are very light and make a wonderful tinkling sound when worn.\r\n\r\nNecklace measures 19 inches.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

These power stones are surrounded by pink and purple AB Swarovski gems and hand-sculpted leaf motifs plus Celtic spirals. The sculpting was antiqued with metallic rose and gold paint, after which a clear coat is applied. The mini handle is a wonderfully textured deer antler tine that is comforting to hold!\r\n\r\nA Spinning Castle creation: Pocket-sized magic wands with real antler tine handles! The perfect size for travel or display on your altar, each wand is completely unique and handmade by me, Susan Tooker, in my Secret Lair!\r\n\r\nAPHRODISIA measures approximately 5.25 inches from tip to tip.\r\n\r\nPINK LEMURIAN CRYSTALS were discovered in one pocket of the same mine in Minas Gerais, Brazil where the Lemurian Star Seed crystals were originally found. The pale pink coloring is due to a dusting of Hematite during the growth process. This coloring is within the layers of crystal growth. All the properties of Lemurian Seed Quartz Crystals, plus: Pink Lemurians, or ‘Temple Hearts,’ further connect you to the Universal Heart. They create open doorways between the hearts of everyone on the planet, fostering kindness, compassion, forgiveness and love between the splintered cultures and peoples of the World. Temple Hearts are one of the crystals intended to awaken your Heart and connect you to the rest of humanity, breaking down barriers to understanding and love!\r\n\r\nROSE QUARTZ is a stone of unconditional love. It opens the heart chakra to all forms of love: self-love, family love, platonic love, and romantic love. Rose quartz has excellent protection energies during pregnancy and childbirth. The elevated energy of quartz gives rose quartz a property of enhancing love in virtually any situation. It also brings gentleness, forgiveness, and tolerance. Rose quartz is also said to be helpful with weight loss. Rose quartz is associated with the heart chakra.\r\n\r\nAMETHYST in the psychic and spiritual realms, is an excellent all-purpose stone that can increase spirituality, enhance intuition and psychic powers of all kinds. It does this by making a clear connection between the earth plane and other planes and worlds. Amethyst is also excellent for meditation and lucid dreaming. It is known to open one's channels to telepathy, past life regression, clairaudience, clairvoyance, and communication with angels. Amethyst also protects against psychic attacks, especially during spiritual work, and protects one from thieves, and protects travelers.\r\n\r\nDEER TOTEM- Deer is a keen observer, enabled to see well in low lighting and its sensitive hearing allows it to perceive a twig snap in the distance. The graceful movement and gentle nature of these creatures show us the innocence of nature. Deer is a messenger of serenity, can see between shadows and hear what isn't being said. Deer teaches us to maintain our innocence and gentleness so we can share our open-heartedness with others.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

African teal blue recycled glass beads, faceted crystal beads, and rhinestone spacers compliment this absolutely stunning statement necklace. Also included in the design are copper spacers and a copper clasp. This amulet is substantial and the weight of it feels awesome and gives one a sense of protection. RAINBOW PRINCESS is a powerful talisman that gleams with gorgeous color and tribal sophistication. It would make a stunning addition to ritual or ceremonial wear.\r\n\r\nNecklace measures 24 inches.\r\n\r\nANGEL AURA QUARTZ CRYSTAL (Also known as Opal Aura Quartz or as Pearl Aura Quartz) are created by bonding a natural clear Quartz crystal with a precious metal infusion of pure platinum and silver, resulting in an immensely powerful protection combination which fuses the White, Blue, Violet and Silver Rays into an iridescent display of Light. Angel Aura Quartz Crystals are excellent Aura Cleansers and act to stimulate and clear all of the Chakra Energy Centers. Intuitive sources say Angel Aura Quartz helps bring one into the higher realms in meditation, facilitating conscious contact with angels, spirit guides and inner realm teachers. It is said to assist one in communing with Angels, accessing the Akashic records, channeling higher knowledge, remembering past lives and gaining insight into one's spiritual mission in this lifetime. In addition to transmitting it's own unique vibrational signature, Angel Aura combines the energetic properties of Clear Quartz Crystal with Platinum and Silver. Use at the 4th Chakra (Heart Chakra) or 7th Chakra (Crown Chakra) to open oneself to divine knowledge, to stimulate deep spiritual experiences, to promote successful meditation, to aid in establishing a connection to one’s angels or guides, to bring love and light into any situation, to promote feelings of safety and security, to enhance loving and kindness, to facilitate peace and calming, to mend broken relationships, to enhance forgiveness on oneself or of others, and to enhance compassionate attitudes.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

Just write the needed measurement in the note to seller!\r\n\r\nAURA QUARTZ is natural Clear Quartz which has undergone a special infusion process using pure gold, silver, platinum, indium, titanium or copper. This process involves heating the Quartz to extremely high temperatures (in excess of 1600°F) then adding the purified metal in a vacuum, which bonds it to the surface. The result is a permanent coating which has been bonded with the crystal at a molecular level. Although the coating is very thin, usually only 1 micron, it cannot be rubbed or scratched off and the results are quite spectacular. Only the best quality Quartz is used for Aura coating, with any inferior specimens breaking during the heating and bonding process. In nature, Quartz can be found with inclusions of all the above metals, but they are often quite rare and therefore tend to be very expensive. Metaphysically, coated or Aura Quartz crystals have all of the properties of Quartz, but with the additional benefits of the individual metal. Gold, in particular, is considered the master healer, with platinum having the highest vibration for spiritual work.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

This process involves heating the Agate to extremely high temperatures (in excess of 1600°F) then adding the purified metal in a vacuum, which bonds it to the surface. The result is a permanent coating which has been bonded with the Agate at a molecular level. Although the coating is very thin, usually only 1 micron, it cannot be rubbed or scratched off and the results are quite spectacular. Only the best quality Agate is used for Aura coating, with any inferior specimens breaking during the heating and bonding process. Metaphysically, coated or Aura Agate have all of the properties of Agate, but with the additional benefits of the individual metal. Gold, in particular, is considered the master healer, with platinum having the highest vibration for spiritual work.\r\n\r\nAGATE is noted in the metaphysical world to be a good protective energy stone, especially for children, and very calming and soothing. It is also said to help strengthen the body's connection to the earth. It is reported to mystically give courage, energy, strength, and dispels fears, all of which increase self-confidence. It is said to lessen feelings of envy by grounding the emotions. Agate is also used in crystal emotional healing for resolving bitterness and resentments. It is also called and believed to be a stone of harmony. These two factors makes it a stone that's said to help improve and harmonize relationships. Also, by bringing the elements of one's being into harmony it greatly enhances healing. Agate also enhances creativity and stimulates the intellect. Agate is considered a stone that brings good luck.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

A truly substantial bracelet and wrist amulet. DANU is designed with absolutely gorgeous Tanzine Aura Quartz Crystal points that are naturally rough and generously wire wrapped with deep purple wire! The color of the Tanzine Quartz points shift from gold to indigo blue to purple! I complimented the Quartz points with teal blue African recycled glass beads, gorgeous iridescent crystal beads, rhinestone beads, and an antique copper chain.\r\n\r\nBracelet measures approximately 8 inches with a 2 inch extender.\r\nThis bracelet can be adjusted to fit your wrist! Just write the needed measurement in the note to seller!\r\n\r\nTANZINE AURA QUARTZ is a beautiful new gemstone of the Indigo/Violet Ray. It covers the same color spectrum as its namesake, Tanzanite, and indeed its radiance of colors is akin to that displayed by the finest Tanzanite gems. Like its cousins, Aqua Aura and Angel Aura Quartz, Tanzan Aura Quartz is created by the pyroelectric bonding of natural clear Quartz with atomized metal compounds. In the case of Tanzan Aura Quartz, the most important compo­nents are Indium, Gold and Niobium, all three of which are powerful substances in their own right. When combined with pure Quartz, which amplifies their power, these elements make for an intense vibrational pattern. Tanzan Aura Quartz is one of the most powerful materials for the development of one's latent psychic abilities and the enhancement of one's conscious connection to Spirit. It is an incredibly potent aid for intuitives of all sorts—mediums, shamans, readers, channelers, healers—as well as those who simply wish to become clearer in their subtle perceptions. It stimu­lates the third eye and crown chakras, blending and unifying their energies. It supports clear think­ing and aids memory. It helps one find inspiration and can evoke experiences of the 'aha' moment. It aids one in discovering novel solutions to long­standing problems by thinking 'outside the box.' Emotionally, Tanzan Aura Quartz allows one to kindle spiritual passion and to transcend states of indifference and boredom. It renews one's zest for the path of mysticism and self-actualization. -Quoted from Robert Simmons & Naisha Ahsian authors of \"The Book of Stones\"\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

African royal blue recycled glass beads, faceted crystal beads, and rhinestone spacers compliment this absolutely stunning statement necklace. Also included in the design are copper spacers and a copper clasp. This amulet is substantial and the weight of it feels awesome and gives one a sense of protection. HEAVENLY HERA is a powerful talisman that gleams with gorgeous color and tribal sophistication. It would make a stunning addition to ritual or ceremonial wear.\r\n\r\nNecklace measures 24.75 inches.\r\n\r\nCOBALT AURA QUARTZ (Also known as Royal Aura Quartz, Steel Blue Aura Quartz, or as Azure Aura Quartz) is the result of a special ion treatment of clear quartz crystals with a liquid solution of pure titanium via electrical current, resulting in a deep blue, purple and gold blend. These crystals are very attuned to reiki and chakra work. Royal aura crystals seem to be excellent tools to assist the individual in developing self esteem and enhancing one's personal power. Cobalt Aura Quartz is the trade name of an attractive metallic blue Quartz. The surface treatment is proprietary, but is believed to involve a Cobalt based coating that is deposited by spraying at high temperatures. Cobalt Aura Quartz has a metallic sheen and a substantial dichroic appearance. The surface coating cannot be removed once applied. Cobalt Aura Quartz actualizes creative pursuits, removes self limiting blocks, and stimulates the imagination. Cobalt Aura lifts the mood, and during contemplation helps to maintain a state of grace and inner peace. Cobalt Aura stimulates third eye visioning and lends itself to being programmed for clairvoyant purposes. Use at the 6th Chakra (Third Eye Chakra/Brow Chakra) to dissipate feelings of anger, to aid in developing a state of non-attachment, to aid in enhancing meditative states, to facilitate a connection with the emotional body, and to provide the opportunity to learn from the water element.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

The graceful movement and gentle nature of these creatures show us the innocence of nature. Deer is a messenger of serenity, can see between shadows and hear what isn't being said. Deer teaches us to maintain our innocence and gentleness so we can share our open-heartedness with others.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

African recycled glass indigo focal beads, silver wood and Moonstone beads compliment this absolutely stunning statement necklace. Also included in the design are silver spacers and a silver clasp. This amulet is substantial and the weight of it feels awesome and gives one a sense of protection. POWER OF ZEUS is a powerful talisman that gleams with gorgeous color and tribal sophistication. It would make a stunning addition to ritual or ceremonial wear.\r\n\r\nNecklace measures 28 inches.\r\n\r\nAURA QUARTZ is natural Clear Quartz which has undergone a special infusion process using pure gold, silver, platinum, indium, titanium or copper. This process involves heating the Quartz to extremely high temperatures (in excess of 1600°F) then adding the purified metal in a vacuum, which bonds it to the surface. The result is a permanent coating which has been bonded with the crystal at a molecular level. Although the coating is very thin, usually only 1 micron, it cannot be rubbed or scratched off and the results are quite spectacular. Only the best quality Quartz is used for Aura coating, with any inferior specimens breaking during the heating and bonding process. In nature, Quartz can be found with inclusions of all the above metals, but they are often quite rare and therefore tend to be very expensive. Metaphysically, coated or Aura Quartz crystals have all of the properties of Quartz, but with the additional benefits of the individual metal. Gold, in particular, is considered the master healer, with platinum having the highest vibration for spiritual work.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

VEDAVA is designed with absolutely gorgeous Cobalt Aura Quartz Crystal points that are naturally rough and generously wrapped with electric royal blue wire! I complimented the Quartz points with deep blue African recycled glass beads, gorgeous iridescent crystal beads, and a black chain. A truly substantial bracelet and wrist amulet.\r\n\r\nBracelet measures approximately 7 inches with a 2 inch extender.\r\nThis bracelet can be adjusted to fit your wrist. Just write the needed measurement in the note to seller.\r\n\r\nCOBALT AURA QUARTZ (Also known as Royal Aura Quartz, Steel Blue Aura Quartz, or as Azure Aura Quartz) is the result of a special ion treatment of clear quartz crystals with a liquid solution of pure titanium via electrical current, resulting in a deep blue, purple and gold blend. These crystals are very attuned to reiki and chakra work. Royal aura crystals seem to be excellent tools to assist the individual in developing self esteem and enhancing one's personal power. Cobalt Aura Quartz is the trade name of an attractive metallic blue Quartz. The surface treatment is proprietary, but is believed to involve a Cobalt based coating that is deposited by spraying at high temperatures. Cobalt Aura Quartz has a metallic sheen and a substantial dichroic appearance. The surface coating cannot be removed once applied. Cobalt Aura Quartz actualizes creative pursuits, removes self limiting blocks, and stimulates the imagination. Cobalt Aura lifts the mood, and during contemplation helps to maintain a state of grace and inner peace. Cobalt Aura stimulates third eye visioning and lends itself to being programmed for clairvoyant purposes. Use at the 6th Chakra (Third Eye Chakra/Brow Chakra) to dissipate feelings of anger, to aid in developing a state of non-attachment, to aid in enhancing meditative states, to facilitate a connection with the emotional body, and to provide the opportunity to learn from the water element.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

I complimented the Quartz points with two types of ultramarine blue African recycled glass beads, gorgeous iridescent crystal beads, and a black patina Deco chain. ARIANRHOD is absolutely loaded with quality beads and will dazzle in the sunlight. A truly substantial bracelet and wrist amulet.\r\n\r\nBracelet measures approximately 8 inches with a 2 inch extender.\r\nThis bracelet can be adjusted to fit your wrist. Just write the needed measurement in the note to seller.\r\n\r\nAURA QUARTZ is natural Clear Quartz which has undergone a special infusion process using pure gold, silver, platinum, indium, titanium or copper. This process involves heating the Quartz to extremely high temperatures (in excess of 1600°F) then adding the purified metal in a vacuum, which bonds it to the surface. The result is a permanent coating which has been bonded with the crystal at a molecular level. Although the coating is very thin, usually only 1 micron, it cannot be rubbed or scratched off and the results are quite spectacular. Only the best quality Quartz is used for Aura coating, with any inferior specimens breaking during the heating and bonding process. In nature, Quartz can be found with inclusions of all the above metals, but they are often quite rare and therefore tend to be very expensive. Metaphysically, coated or Aura Quartz crystals have all of the properties of Quartz, but with the additional benefits of the individual metal. Gold, in particular, is considered the master healer, with platinum having the highest vibration for spiritual work.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

I was instantly excited about this new crystal and thought my customers would appreciate it too! Alongside the Aurora Quartz is a Tibetan Laser Quartz, a Clear Quartz Crystal and a Golden Feldspar creating a \"cornucopia\" of crystal magic! Adorned with Celtic spirals and beautiful topaz Swarovski gems, the spirals have an Art Nouveau or Celtic La Tene feel to their design. Centered in the front is a wonderful pink Stillbite surrounded by Apophyllite. The spirals have been antiqued with metallic copper paint and then sealed with clear coat. This Dragon Crystal Wand is part of a new series of elaborate wands that feature Blesbok horn handles. Look for more new Dragon Crystal Wands to be listed in the future!\r\n\r\nSpinning Castle is proud to present the next incarnation of Crystal Magic Wands! Featuring a Blesbok horn for the handle, each wand is unique and lovingly made. COPPERCLOUD SKYEHOARD is handcrafted by me, Susan Tooker, and made with the best crystals and gemstones that I could find. Blesbok horns are comforting to hold and their pattern is quite dramatic and beautiful.

TARANIS CONSORT showcases this beautiful Petrified wood pendant that is wonderful shades of earth tones and black. The necklace is super long with black leather ties that are accented with African brass beads that hang in front.

Featuring a wire-wrapped Coyote and Buffalo tooth, MESSENGER also has Garnet, Labradorite, vintage beads, rhinestone spacers, and African beads. Super long at a whopping 63 inches, it can be worn many different ways! MESSENGER is a glamorous talisman honoring Coyote and Buffalo totems.\r\n\r\nBracelet measures approximately 63 inches long.\r\n\r\nBUFFALO TOTEM must walk a sacred path, honoring every walk of life. You will achieve nothing without the aid of the Great Spirit and you must be humble enough to ask for assistance and then be grateful for those gifts. A Buffalo totem will seek to help you establish a deep connection to Mother Earth and it will ask you to help the endangered species of our planet. He will bring you strength of character and an independent spirit. It is the totem of abundance. Buffalo medicine is prayer, gratitude and praise.\r\n\r\nCOYOTE TOTEM symbolizes playfulness, nonsense, intelligence, cunning and joy. Coyote people form strong family bonds and have strong preferences. They are highly adaptable, opportunistic, and versatile. They are often considered to be \"pranksters\" or \"tricksters\" in many cultures likely due to their cunning hunting techniques of running prey to exhaustion towards a hidden pack member who then finishes the kill. People with coyote totems will often be cunning as well. Coyote's barks are very shrill and distinctive and how they call their pack together. Coyote people can use their own voice in ways that draw people together as well, but may sometimes have a hidden agenda. \r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

The leaf and spiral adornment has been hand sculpted, painted and sealed by me, Susan Tooker. My concept was to create ornately beaded necklaces that recall more ancient times where gemstones were worn as amulets of protection, strength and power. CAULDRON KEEPER showcases my version of a protection amulet with brass spiral beads from Africa. Sparkling crystal beads and African brass spacers accompany the gemstones. I named CAULDRON KEEPER in honor of the Celtic goddess, Cerridwen, who is known in Welsh mythology as the \"Keeper of the Cauldron.\" Cerridwen brings inspiration, wisdom and the gifts of prophecy to those that work with her. She is seen in Welsh legend as being a crone Goddess, creating a triad with Blodeuwedd and Arianrhod. Cerridwen’s energy resonates with the darker elements of the Goddess and has connections to the Underworld. CAULDRON KEEPER is part amulet, part totem protector and all fantasy! This is not your everyday necklace and would look fabulous for that special ritual, event or masquerade!\r\n\r\nNeck measures 19 inches from clasp end to end.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

I complimented the Quartz points with golden African recycled glass beads, gorgeous iridescent crystal beads, rhinestone spacers, and a black patina Deco chain. FREYJA is absolutely loaded with quality beads and will dazzle in the sunlight! A truly substantial bracelet and wrist amulet.\r\n\r\nBracelet measures approximately 8 inches with a 2 inch extender.\r\nThis bracelet can be adjusted to fit your wrist. Just write the needed measurement in the note to seller.\r\n\r\nAURA QUARTZ is natural Clear Quartz which has undergone a special infusion process using pure gold, silver, platinum, indium, titanium or copper. This process involves heating the Quartz to extremely high temperatures (in excess of 1600°F) then adding the purified metal in a vacuum, which bonds it to the surface. The result is a permanent coating which has been bonded with the crystal at a molecular level. Although the coating is very thin, usually only 1 micron, it cannot be rubbed or scratched off and the results are quite spectacular. Only the best quality Quartz is used for Aura coating, with any inferior specimens breaking during the heating and bonding process. In nature, Quartz can be found with inclusions of all the above metals, but they are often quite rare and therefore tend to be very expensive. Metaphysically, coated or Aura Quartz crystals have all of the properties of Quartz, but with the additional benefits of the individual metal. Gold, in particular, is considered the master healer, with platinum having the highest vibration for spiritual work.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

These power stones are surrounded by pink and AB Swarovski gems and hand-sculpted leaf motifs plus Celtic spirals. The sculpting was antiqued with metallic rose and silver paint, after which a clear coat is applied. The mini handle is a wonderfully textured deer antler tine that is comforting to hold!\r\n\r\nA Spinning Castle creation: Pocket-sized magic wands with real antler tine handles! The perfect size for travel or display on your altar, each wand is completely unique and handmade by me, Susan Tooker, in my Secret Lair!\r\n\r\nAPHRODITE'S JOY measures approximately 7 inches from tip to tip.\r\n\r\nPINK LEMURIAN CRYSTALS were discovered in one pocket of the same mine in Minas Gerais, Brazil where the Lemurian Star Seed crystals were originally found.  The pale pink coloring is due to a dusting of Hematite during the growth process. This coloring is within the layers of crystal growth. All the properties of Lemurian Seed Quartz Crystals, plus: Pink Lemurians, or ‘Temple Hearts,’ further connect you to the Universal Heart. They create open doorways between the hearts of everyone on the planet, fostering kindness, compassion, forgiveness and love between the splintered cultures and peoples of the World. Temple Hearts are one of the crystals intended to awaken your Heart and connect you to the rest of humanity, breaking down barriers to understanding and love!\r\n\r\nOCEAN JASPER helps you with your emotional health. Holding this stone is like holding on to an anchor, a safe haven, while allowing deeply buried feelings to well up like a rising sea. Ocean Jasper helps these feelings to be released in a way that allows you to process them calmly, without drowning in them. For those who don’t need such emotional work, it offers a soothing, grounding effect helpful in dealing with change. Ocean Jasper is very soothing and helps you to love yourself as well as others. It is very emotionally healing and brings you peace of mind. It helps with acceptance of responsibility and increases patience. The circular patterns in Ocean Jasper symbolize and help you realize that we are all interconnected and nature is a cyclical pattern. It can also help with circular breathing for healing or meditation. Being a type of Jasper, it is a very protective stone, and any orbs (eyes) enhance this in regard to protect you from the evil eye.\r\n\r\nROSE QUARTZ is a stone of unconditional love. It opens the heart chakra to all forms of love: self-love, family love, platonic love, and romantic love. Rose quartz has excellent protection energies during pregnancy and childbirth. The elevated energy of quartz gives rose quartz a property of enhancing love in virtually any situation. It also brings gentleness, forgiveness, and tolerance. Rose quartz is also said to be helpful with weight loss. Rose quartz is associated with the heart chakra.\r\n\r\nDEER TOTEM- Deer is a keen observer, enabled to see well in low lighting and its sensitive hearing allows it to perceive a twig snap in the distance. The graceful movement and gentle nature of these creatures show us the innocence of nature. Deer is a messenger of serenity, can see between shadows and hear what isn't being said. Deer teaches us to maintain our innocence and gentleness so we can share our open-heartedness with others.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

TALISMAN OF JUPITER is handcrafted by me, Susan Tooker, and made with the best crystals and gemstones that I could find. Polished Kudu horns are comforting to hold and their coloring is quite dramatic and beautiful. Adorned with an oak leaf motif, spirals and beautiful gold, ruby, brown topaz and green AB Swarovski gems, the spirals have an Art Nouveau or Celtic La Tene feel to their design. Centered in the front is a sparkling Pyrite specimen and a polished Nummite below a gold leafed crescent moon. At the opposite end of the wand handle is a Black Tourmalated Quartz cabochon and a Rainbow Moonstone cabochon. The sculpting has been antiqued with metallic pewter, ruby and gold paint. Three layers of clear coat was then applied. This crystal wand is part of a series of elaborate wands that feature polished Kudu horn handles and also display beaded charm dangles hanging from within the sculpting. The dangles on TALISMAN OF JUPITER are beaded with a genuine Silver Aura Quartz points and Labradorite beads. The magickal TALISMAN OF JUPITER Wand would be a wonderful addition to a sacred space, reiki healing, Wiccan rital or Pagan altar.\r\n\r\nTALISMAN OF JUPITER measures 21.5 inches from tip to tip.\r\n\r\nANTELOPE TOTEM teaches survival and how to avoid indiscriminate destruction of life. The Antelope signifies knowledgeable action. Through Antelope you can learn to truly live and action is the key and essence to living. Antelope is the messenger of a higher purpose; he knows the way and through him, so will you. Antelope can teach clairvoyance by listening to his voice inside of you. An Antelope person is intrinsically psychic.\r\n\r\nLASER WAND CRYSTAL (lazer wand) is recognized by its long slenderness with small faces at the point, with the crystal being wider at the bottom. Laser Wand crystals (Lazer Wand) are pointers of the crystal world. They focus energy very precisely where they are pointed. This makes them excellent tools for psychic surgery. They are also noted for helping with communication and meditation on other dimensions and worlds.\r\n\r\nPYRITE is a stone of intellect and protection. It enhances intelligence, mental stability, logic, analysis, creativity, memory, and psychic development. It can help you tap your own latent mental talents and abilities. Pyrite is a powerful protection stone, and is very grounding. Pyrite is also known as Fool's Gold and Healer's Gold. Pyrite additionally is a stone that brings energies of good luck or good fortune.\r\n\r\nNUUMITE is the oldest mineral in the world. Nuumite was formed over three billion (3, 000, 000, 000) years ago. It crystallizes in the form of laminates and when polished, it is black and nearly opaque with sheets of refractive colour. Nuumite is found in an area slightly north of Nuuk, Greenland - accessible only by boat. The area where Nuumite occurs is in the so-called 'Isuakasia' iron ore region, the origin of which dates back almost four billion years. Sometimes called the Magician's or Sorcerer's Stone, Nuumite can be used to open, activate and balance your Chakras. It is a grounding stone and integrates your spiritual awareness into your physical experience. Nuumite can remove energy blockages and it can draw energy from your etheric body to restore energy to your physical body. You can use Nuumite to patch up and clear your aura. It is a powerfully-protective stone and simply having it on your person deflects negativity on all levels.\r\n\r\nBLACK TOURMALATED QUARTZ also known as tourmaline in quartz, is an excellent protective stone, and brings balance and inner strength. It deflects and grounds negativity, and reduces anxiety and depression.\r\n\r\nMOONSTONE is said in crystal healing to help calm responses and avoid overreaction; enhances feminine energies, sensitivity, intuition, and psychic abilities. It is also said to bring strong energies of abundance to one's life. Moonstone is a stone of protection, especially during childbirth, pregnancy, and travel at sea. It is a stone of calm and relief from emotional stress. It is also associated with love of all kinds. Moonstone is associated with the crown and third eye chakras, and sometimes with the heart chakra.\r\n\r\nIf you live outside the US, email your shipping address.

My concept was to create ornately beaded necklaces that recall more ancient times where gemstones were worn as amulets of protection, strength and power. EPONA'S SHRINE showcases the wire wrapped fossil specimen with a Hebron bead, coconut shell beads, stone beads, brass spacers and yellow recycled glass beads from Africa. The necklace is super long with brown leather ties that are wrapped around twisted fancy rings and can be worn down the back or in front. EPONA'S SHRINE can be worn as a choker or lower on the chest. Also complimented with Black Tibetan Quartz crystal beads, the necklace features dark oxidized wire and findings. EPONA'S SHRINE feels substantial and is reflective of Warrior Spirit!\r\n\r\nIce Age fossils direct from Florida are the inspiration for a new series of amulets handmade by me, Susan Tooker of Spinning Castle. The fossils serve as the base for a pendant that I combine with other gemstones and rare beads. Each amulet is truly one-of-a-kind because each these fossils date from the last Ice Age and are over 10,000 years old! The color, texture and feel of the fossils is fascinating!\r\n\r\nLeather ties measure 23 inches long.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.

Beetle wings have been used for centuries by Indian civilizations, cut into tiny spangle shapes to adorn a range of objects from garments and turban cloths, to canopies and book covers, their reflective properties admired as a means to ward off evil spirits.\r\n\r\nThe iridescent copper of the elytra are complimented with gorgeous iridescent faceted crystal beads, oxidized black brass findings and open filigree hoops. \r\n\r\nThe wings make a wonderful tinkling sound when worn...like the sound of the faeries! \r\n\r\nBEETLE- \"As with many insects the beetle goes through a tremendous metamorphosis from the grub stage to the winged.

The leaf and spiral adornment has been hand sculpted, painted and sealed by me, Susan Tooker. My concept was to create ornately beaded necklaces that recall more ancient times where gemstones were worn as amulets of protection, strength and power. VISION SENDER showcases my version of a protection amulet with genuine Amber, sparkling crystal beads and African brass spacers. I named VISION SENDER in honor of the Greek goddess, Hecate, who is known as the \"Sender of Nocturnal Visions.\" Hecate is an ancient goddess, frequently depicted in triple form and associated with crossroads, entrance-ways, fire, light, the Moon, magic, witchcraft, knowledge of herbs and poisonous plants, necromancy, and sorcery. She has dominion over earth, sea and sky. VISION SENDER is part amulet, part totem protector and all fantasy.

The perfect size for travel or display on your altar, each wand is completely unique and handmade by me, Susan Tooker, in my Secret Lair!\r\n\r\nGARDEN OF DIONYSUS measures approximately 8 inches from tip to tip.\r\n\r\nAMETHYST in the psychic and spiritual realms, is an excellent all-purpose stone that can increase spirituality, enhance intuition and psychic powers of all kinds. It does this by making a clear connection between the earth plane and other planes and worlds. Amethyst is also excellent for meditation and lucid dreaming. It is known to open one's channels to telepathy, past life regression, clairaudience, clairvoyance, and communication with angels. Amethyst also protects against psychic attacks, especially during spiritual work, and protects one from thieves, and protects travelers.\r\n\r\nMOONSTONE is said in crystal healing to help calm responses and avoid overreaction; enhances feminine energies, sensitivity, intuition, and psychic abilities. It is also said to bring strong energies of abundance to one's life. Moonstone is a stone of protection, especially during childbirth, pregnancy, and travel at sea. It is a stone of calm and relief from emotional stress. It is also associated with love of all kinds. Moonstone is associated with the crown and third eye chakras, and sometimes with the heart chakra.\r\n\r\nDEER TOTEM- Deer is a keen observer, enabled to see well in low lighting and its sensitive hearing allows it to perceive a twig snap in the distance. The graceful movement and gentle nature of these creatures show us the innocence of nature. Deer is a messenger of serenity, can see between shadows and hear what isn't being said. Deer teaches us to maintain our innocence and gentleness so we can share our open-heartedness with others.\r\n\r\nPlease message me if you have any questions. \r\nAll Good Wishes, \r\nSusan \r\nSpinningCastle\r\n\r\n...Lovingly handmade in My Secret Lair... \r\n© copyright Susan Tooker \r\nSpinning Castle Studios, 2013. \r\nPhotographs by Susan Tooker\r\n\r\nSusan has sold her handmade items online since 2008.
