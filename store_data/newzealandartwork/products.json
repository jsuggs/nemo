Originally his parents Rangi the sky and Papa the earth clung together in a tight embrace and Tāne was one of 70 sons born into the dark confined realm between them. &nbsp;Yearning for more space and light in which to live, Tāne braced his back against the earth and feet upon the sky and pushed, successfully separating his parents and bringing about Te Aō Mārama or The World of Light, in which we now live. He also fashioned the first human; he adorned the heavens, and brought the baskets of knowledge, wisdom and understanding down from the sky to human beings. &nbsp;Tāne is sometimes given different names to reflect his different roles. He is called Tāne-mahuta as god of the forest, Tāne-te-wānanga as the bringer of knowledge, and Tānenui-a-rangi as bringer of higher consciousness.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Limited Edition Print</strong></a></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality called hahnemuhle photo rag 308gsm.

On a walk through the beautiful Kapadokyan landscape, Sofia briefly encountered the woman waiting patiently with her collection of scarves to display and sell to passers-by. </p>\r\n<p>Unconsciously the ancient history of the land and civilization of Asia Minor weaved its way into this portrait. As Sofia painted the piece, layer-by-layer, the woman's wrinkles deepened and her character strengthened. Her immense whakapapa (genealogy) is suggested in her old yet glowing skin. The vastness of the region's history shows in the seriousness and wisdom of her gaze. The grooves of her face and the dark folds of her headscarf represent the weaving, bending and cyclical nature of life, and the flower-patterned scarf with its ornamental pearl edge brings an intricate, decorative quality to the painting.  </p>\r\n<p>On finishing the work Sofia chose the name Sabire, which is a Turkish name meaning \"woman with patience\". She felt that it encapsulated her own layered, lengthy painting process as well as the breadth of the old woman's spirit, which had continued to reveal itself over the three months it took to create the portrait.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Limited Edition Print</strong></a></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality called hahnemuhle photo rag 308gsm.

Initially she was shy about the idea of this portrait and eventually agreed to it on the condition that its purpose would be to highlight her life's work, rather than adulating her as an individual (although she is very worth celebrating!). However while painting, I knew that it was turning into a soulful and personal piece and I felt that this would greatly enhance its value as a symbol of her life's cause.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  My hope is that for generations to come viewers will be able to firstly connect with Joan's poise, depth and mana in the portrait, and secondly be spurred on to discover the pioneering work she has done for this country to increase understanding between Maori and Pakeha since the 1950s. Although Joan isn't of Maori decent, because of her dedication to this cause I see this portrait as being part of my Contemorary Maori Portrait Series.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  While Joan and I spent time together, our indepth conversations would invariably lead to her lending me a tonne of reading material including her latest book Tuamaka: The Challenge of Difference in Aotearoa New Zealand, which is basically a summation of her life's work and her hopes for this country.\"<br>\r\n- Sofia Minson</p>\r\n<p><strong>Quote from Metge's  Book <em>Tuamaka: The Challenge of Difference in Aotearoa New Zealand</em></strong></p>\r\n<p> \"I once heard a kaumatua describe himself as 'he muka' - a strand - in the taura whiri of his iwi. What we need to weave together is not just head knowledge of each other's cultures, but heart knowledge of the people who are the holders of that knowledge, creating what artist Cliff Whiting has depicted visually as 'the rope of peoples'. Only by supporting each other will we be able to stand upright here.\"<br>\r\n  - Dame Joan Metge</p>\r\n<p><strong>Curator Brian Easton on Joan Metge</strong></p>\r\n<p> \"Joan Metge is an outstanding example of the many Pakeha New Zealanders who have helped non-Maori to come to terms with Maori. It was not so much of a problem before 1950, because most Maori lived in rural areas isolated from Pakeha. When they began arriving in the cities, cultural inter-relations became more common and intense. Joan's life follows that story. She was born and grew up in Auckland with no Maori contacts. She was ten when her family moved to Pukekohe where a warm friendship with a Maori classmate revealed &quot;a whole hidden Maori world that Pakeha didn't know about, that I wanted to explore&quot;. She trained as an anthropologist, doing her first fieldwork in in the Far North and Auckland, tracing the shift from country to city in her first book A New Maori Migration. Her ten books are the printed record of all her teaching in which she has shared the knowledge and insights entrusted to her by Maori mentors, and which highlight the rewards of cross-cultural dialogue. Fittingly The Treaty of Waitangi Companion ends with a quotation from her latest book Tuamaka: the Challenge of Difference in Aotearoa New Zealand, published when she was 80. It advises leaving Hobson's &quot;He iwi tahi tatou&quot; untranslated because of the complexities in its meaning, &quot;while all of us continue to debate and work out how to relate to each other, with the Treaty as our guide.\" Metge is a recipient of the Royal Society of New Zealand's Te Rangi Hiroa Medal for her research in the social sciences and was knighted in 1987 for her services to anthropology.</p>\r\n<p>- Brian Easton </p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality called hahnemuhle photo rag 308gsm.

As is the case with many people who live in Aotearoa today, Tess encompasses  both Maori and Pakeha. The work explores how we are connecting to our ancestors in this contemporary world and in this case Tess, who has very light coloured hair, is pictured with a simple Moko Kauae (Maori chin tattoo).  Moko Kauae is becoming more and more popular nowadays as a way for Maori women to express their connection to their tupuna (ancestors). The generic nature of the design  in this portrait and the young age of the subject suggests that it is a drawn-on moko  commonly seen in Kapa Haka (Maori cultural performances) rather than a real tattooed moko, which would be unique to her status and whakapapa (genealogy).</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality called hahnemuhle photo rag 308gsm.

Taane has worn his moko previously as artwork: inspired by C.F. Goldie portraits, he presents himself with full facial moko on the cover of his Past, Present, Future album.</p>\r\n<p>The painting's title 'Freedom To Be' refers to his 2011 song 'Freedom To Sing'. Sofia says &quot;as a fellow artist I admire Tiki coming out with such an inspirational song. It shows he's overcome recent legal issues and media attention with even more creative power than ever. In this painting he proudly wears his moko, an outward sign of his inner growth and resilience.&quot;<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n  Minson explains how she and the chart-topping musician came to know each other: &quot;We were in the same issue of Mana Magazine a few years ago and Tiki emailed me to say that he liked my art and that we should think of a way to collaborate together in the future, perhaps through album artwork or merchandise for his music. I actually think of this portrait as a collaboration because the painting is so full of Tiki's story and his presence, which comes through his Ta Moko and the intensity of his eyes.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Since Lindauer and Goldie in the 19th century, there has been a surprising lack in the tradition of Maori oil portraiture. While Minson is inspired by their works, she says her <strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/contemporary-maori-portrait-series\" target=\"_blank\">contemporary Maori portraits</a></strong>“are far from Goldie’s recordings of a vanishing race” and are intended to fill an important niche for her generation.  As a Maori artist of mixed heritage (Ngati Porou, Swedish, English and Irish), she uses the traditional Western medium of oil on canvas to show contemporary Maori as a vibrant and evolving people.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Interview with Tiki Taane on Ta Moko:</strong><br />\r\n  <br />\r\n  1. How was the decision made to have you wearing Ta Moko for your album Past, Present, Future?<br />\r\n  Seeing as the album was delving into my story of understanding my whakapapa, I wanted the artwork &amp; especially the cover to be similar to a Goldie portrait.<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n  2. Who designed your moko?<br />\r\n  Inia Taylor from Mokoink, who has tattooed a lot of me &amp; also my mum, drew the moko based upon my whakapapa, new &amp; old. We made the prosthetic moko for the video Tangaroa in which I play the roll of my Tipuna..<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n  3. Would you ever get a permanent full-face moko?<br />\r\n  Yes, the moko that we designed will be the one I will eventually wear, but that will be in many years. Like DNA, it is mine &amp; mine only. My son &amp; his sons will be the only people who could wear that moko.<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n  4. What does moko mean to you?<br />\r\nOne of the biggest reminders for me to keep on pushing, are my Moko &amp; Tattoos. Everyday I have to carry these signs with pride, through the judgement, to never forget who I am &amp; where I have come from, for that sets the foundation of where I am heading.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality called hahnemuhle photo rag 308gsm.

Pouakai eagles - a native bird with the world’s largest wingspan of over 3 metres that went extinct c.1400 A.D. - soar through the forest acting as guardians. The prehistoric New Zealand forest is bathed in the first glow of Te Aō Mārama or The World of Light, which in Maori creationary tradition came into being after Tāne separated earth and sky. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  Long ago Ranginui (sky father) and Papatūānuku (earth mother) clung together in a close embrace and Tāne was one of 70 sons born into the dark, confined realm between them. Yearning for more air, space and light in which to live, Tāne braced his back against the earth and feet against the sky and pushed, separating his parents. Only in this new world of light could all other living things such as birds, forests and mankind, exist. Tāne went on to fashion the first human; he adorned the heavens, and brought the baskets of knowledge, wisdom and understanding down from the sky to human beings. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIn this work Tāne stands strong, holding up the sky. The trees of the forest are intricately connected to each other via a delicate web of vines, representing visually the Maori belief of whakapapa or genealogy, which not only links people to their ancestors but also to all other living things, and to the earth and the sky, and it traces the universe back to its origins.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Limited Edition Print</strong></a></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality called hahnemuhle photo rag 308gsm.

Goldie portraits, he presents himself with full facial moko on the cover of his Past, Present, Future album. </p>\r\n<p> In this painting he proudly wears his moko, an outward sign of his inner growth and resilience.<br>\r\n  <strong><br>\r\n  Interview with Tiki Taane on Ta Moko</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>1. How was the decision made to have you wearing Ta Moko for your album Past, Present, Future?</strong><br>\r\nSeeing as the album was delving into my story of understanding my whakapapa, I wanted the artwork &amp; especially the cover to be similar to a Goldie portrait. </p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Who designed your moko?</strong><br>\r\n  Inia Taylor from Mokoink, who has tattooed a lot of me &amp; also my mum, drew the moko based upon my whakapapa, new &amp; old. We made the prosthetic moko for the video Tangaroa in which I play the roll of my Tipuna.. </p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Would you ever get a permanent full-face moko?</strong><br>\r\nYes, the moko that we designed will be the one I will eventually wear, but that will be in many years. Like DNA, it is mine &amp; mine only. My son &amp; his sons will be the only people who could wear that moko.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. What does moko mean to you?</strong><br>\r\n  One of the biggest reminders for me to keep on pushing, are my Moko &amp; Tattoos. Everyday I have to carry these signs with pride, through the judgement, to never forget who I am &amp; where I have come from, for that sets the foundation of where I am heading.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed giclee prints on matte paper of museum archival quality.

In the dark, confined realm between them, 70 divine sons were born. The strongest, Tanemahuta, along with many of his brothers yearned for more air, space and light in which to live. Tradition tells that in planting his head on the earth and thrusting his feet against the sky, Tane succeeded in separating his parents.\r\n  \r\n  Once liberated, the children of Ranginui and Papatuanuku then became the gods of Aotearoa.</p>\r\n<p> Tawhirimatea, god of the winds, had always opposed the separation. Mournfully he followed his father into the sky and sent mighty winds down upon the other gods. \r\n  \r\n  Tane became progenitor of the forests and supplied people with waka (canoes), spears, and fish-hooks, all fashioned from the timber of his trees. \r\n  \r\n  This work depicts a serine, misty coastal scene with a native toi toi in the foreground. However far on the distant horizon is an element of unrest. Tane in the form of a waka taua (elaborately carved war canoe) is under attack by a storm cloud summoned by Tawhirimatea. \r\n  \r\n  Whether enemies or allied siblings, perhaps the divine children of Rangi and Papa continue to use their power over the forces of nature to this day.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Limited Edition Print</strong></a></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality called hahnemuhle photo rag 308gsm.

Eleven days before the eruption, a number of people, Maori and European alike, reported a waka taua (war canoe) being paddled across Lake Tarawera with its occupants clearly visible and wrapped in flax robes, their heads bowed and their hair plumed as for death with the feathers of the huia and the white heron. Everyone knew there was no such waka on the lake in living memory. To local Maori the occurrence had only one meaning - it was a waka wairua (phantom/spirit canoe), an omen of disaster, dire and inevitable. The volcano violently erupted and could be heard as far away as Auckland to the North and Christchurch to the South. Several hours later, the bed of Lake Rotomahana blew out, burying the Maori villages of Moura and Te Ariki, killing 153 people.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> In this work Minson depicts the taurapa (stern post) of the waka wairua against a vivid scene of the White Terraces, reminiscent of Charles Blomfield&rsquo;s 19th century paintings of the terraces.

What drove them to brave the might of Tangaroa (god of the sea)? Time blurs the edges between myth and history. Was it Maui who fished up Te Ika a Maui (the north island of New Zealand) or was it Kupe’s wife Hine Te Aparangi who first spotted the land of the long white cloud after a perilous journey from Hawaiiki, in which they encountered and defeated an enraged monstrous octopus and high seas? One can only imagine and dream of wild, mysterious voyages.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nFrom dreams and myth to modern society and the economy, Minson has also been inspired by professor Damon Salesa who grew up in Glen Innes and became the First Rhodes Scholar of Pacific descent.  She is interested in his views about how we have the opportunity to view ourselves as not only a nation in the middle of the pacific, but an active, cooperative pacific nation. In a 2012 interview with Kim Hill on Radio New Zealand National he argued that “New Zealand needs to embrace its position as another Pacific Island nation and build those relationships. &nbsp;New Zealand is part of Polynesia. &nbsp;It has this Polynesian foundation, which should be the primary way of relating to the Pacific. &nbsp;It's often not appreciated by New Zealanders that of all the major regions New Zealand trades with, the only one it actually makes a profit with is the Pacific. &nbsp;It owes money at the end of the year to Asia, it owes money to NAFTA, the only one that turns a profit is the Pacific. &nbsp;So it makes business sense, it's our own homeland and home ocean, and yet it seems to be something we've both taken for granted and overlooked.”</p>\r\n<p>This painting was part of Minson's <strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/parnell-gallery-exhibition\">September 2012 solo exhibition at Parnell Gallery</a></strong>.

He has been a friend of Sofia's since he tattooed a kirituhi (Maori design) on the palm of Sofia's left hand in 2008.\r\n  \r\nA matakiti (clairvoyant) once told Tu that he had been a Ta Moko artist in another life. He grew up performing in kapa haka (Maori singing/dancing) groups, which travelled everywhere from New Zealand to Brazil's Amazon Rainforest. </p>\r\n<p>In the next era of his life, Tu completed a Bachelor of Maori Development at Auckland University of Technology. After graduating he thought it natural to get a moko to celebrate his graduation. Traditionally, moko is seen as a sign of achievement, status and ancestral connection.\r\n  \r\nTu studied the art of moko from the best in the world and has been a practitioner touring internationally as a tattooist since 1994. He says \"I was fortunate enough to sit under the tutelage of Mark Kopua from Tolaga Bay who has been, and will always be one of my great mentors concerning things Maori.\" Tu is now at the forefront of moko design and showcases his work in Museums, festivals and exhibitions predominantly in New Zealand, Australia and the Pacific.</p>\r\n<p>When asked what moko means to him, Tu says \"If anything, moko to me has been nothing but positive, I have seen it heal people, I have witnessed the beginnings of new journeys in many peoples lives, journeys of identity. Journeys of discovery. Like our ancestors before us, like Taane-nui-a-Rangi, the Great one of Heaven, who traversed the 12 heavens to seek the baskets of knowledge to benefit mankind, our journeys are just as important\"\r\n  \r\n  For Tu, moko is:\r\n  \r\n  He Tohu Atua! (a symbol from beyond our plane of existence)\r\n  He Tohu Rangatira! (a symbol of mana, or life force)\r\n  He Tohu Wairua! (a symbol of spirit)\r\n  He Tohu Maatauranga!

Like Hawaiiki, Rangiatea is considered an ancient Maori homeland from whence the original canoes voyaged to New Zealand centuries ago. Connection to this homeland is conveyed in the proverb \"He kakano ahau, ruia mai i Rangiatea\", which means \"I am a seed, scattered from Rangiatea.\"  </p>\r\n<p>In terms of narrative \"From Rangiatea\" is informed by the legend of Kupe, the great Polynesian navigator. Kupe is said to have visited Rangiatea and journeyed from his homeland, Hawaiiki, to become the first person to discover Aotearoa. Sofia's interpretation of his great ocean going vessel, the Matawhaorua, is pictured in this work with an intricately carved taurapa (stern piece) and tauihu (bow piece).  </p>\r\n<p>The crew of the Matawhaorua encountered many obstacles on their long voyage including a battle with an enraged, monstrous Octopus. It was Kupe's wife Hine Te Aparangi who finally sighted land naming it Aotearoa, Land of the Long White Cloud.  </p>\r\n<p>The solitary, ancient waka is depicted resting upon the shores of Aotearoa after its immense journey. Two pouakai eagles - a large native species with a wingspan of up to 3 metres that went extinct c.1400 A.D. - are shown flying to greet the newly arrived vessel. As Kupe and the crew of the Matawhaorua leave the waka to explore the discovered land, this painting gives the sense that although the people are gone, the spirit and memory of their great voyage remains.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality called hahnemuhle photo rag 308gsm.

Eleven days before the terraces were utterly destroyed by the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera, a number of people, Maori and European alike, reported a disturbing sight: a ghostly, fully-laden waka being paddled across Lake Tarawera, in the shadow of the mountain. &nbsp;But everyone knew there was no such war canoe on the lake in living memory. To the Maoris in the village the occurrence had only one meaning. It was an omen of disaster, dire and inevitable. The volcano violently erupted and could be heard as far away as Auckland to the North and Christchurch to the South. Several hours later, the bed of Lake Rotomahana blew out, burying the Maori villages of Moura and Te Ariki under a deep layer of liquid mud, stones and ash, killing 153 people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this work Minson was inspired by the history and myths surrounding the terraces, both dark and extraordinarily beautiful. </p>\r\n<p>This painting was part of Minson's <strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/parnell-gallery-exhibition\">September 2012 solo exhibition at Parnell Gallery</a></strong>.

Her ears organically dangle into long earrings similar to leaf-shaped pounamu/greenstone earrings. Growing from the back of her head is a huia feather, which traditionally signifies high status and dignity for Maori.</p>\r\n<p>Sofia explores the notion of culture as being deeply routed in our inner being, or perhaps more like clothing that we wear to learn and distinguish ourselves.

Iti and the Urawera Four were accused of running military-style training camps in the Urewera Ranges in 2007. &nbsp;In May this 2011, he and Te Rangi Kemara were charged with possession of firearms and Molotov cocktails and were sentenced to two-and-a-half years in jail, a hefty sentence that they plan to appeal. The court suggests their actions were dangerous and threatening but in professor Ranginui Walker’s opinion the training camps were just a show, much like when Iti once fired a shotgun at the New Zealand flag. &quot;What you see depicted in the media time and time again is the shooting of the flag. That's all theatre; that's all consistent with Maori culture. It looks spectacular on TV and Pakeha get intimidated by it because they don't understand it's theatre. There is no point rising up against the state, which has all the firepower. It's crazy, no one in their right minds would contemplate that. Pakeha don't have the same sense of history that Maori have. Maori have a different view of reality. For some Maori, history is repeating itself.” &nbsp;<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nMinson modelled this portrait on a photograph by Jos Wheeler of Tame Iti outside the High Court. She is not interested in casting her own aspersions about who is right and wrong, rather she is interested in painting creative and inspiring Maori people who are helping to evolve today's culture through their own art forms or roles in society “and if that happens to be a personality who divides public opinion, so be it” she says. &nbsp;Minson feels honoured to paint this portrait. &nbsp;“There is undoubtedly depth and mana coming from Tame’s face - from his moko and his eyes. As he must have been intending when he wore that outfit to court, the bowler hat and bow tie add a theatrical sense of the colonial.”<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Lindauer and Goldie in the 19th century, there has been a surprising lack in the tradition of Maori oil portraiture.

In 1886 Mt Tarawera violently erupted and could be heard as far away as Auckland to the North and Christchurch to the South. Several hours later, the bed of Lake Rotomahana blew out, obliterating the terraces and burying the Maori villages of Moura and Te Ariki under a deep layer of liquid mud, stones and ash, killing 153 people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this work Minson was inspired by the history and myths surrounding the terraces, both dark and extraordinarily beautiful. Several pouakai, also known as haast eagles or hokioi, are perching and soaring around the terraces. The birds had the world’s largest wingspan of three metres and went extinct c. 1400 A.D. &nbsp;Their presence could be interpreted as heralding change, as an omen for the destruction and ultimate transformation.</p>\r\n<p>This painting is part of Minson's <strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/parnell-gallery-exhibition\">4-18 September 2012 exhibition of new works at Parnell Gallery</a></strong>.

The thought provoking art and social experiment follows six New Zealand artists, three Maori and three non-Maori, as they gain deeper insights into the Treaty of Waitangi and create cross-cultural collaborative artworks during one weekend at Te Tii marae in Northland. Sofia's oil painting of the central blue carved 'pou' in this artwork represents her Ngati Porou ancestors' waka.  The Sanscrit symbol for Om, which is the sound of the universe, is spoken to us from the mouth of the ancestral figure.  Surrounding the painting are Peap's black ink designs influenced by Cambodian legends of the Naga snake.  Within his patterning are the words \"The Treaty is a Tauranga Waka\", which means that the Treaty is New Zealand's first immigration document. He has also written \"Te Pou Tuatahi He Wakaputanga 1835\", which means that the founding legal document for this country is The Declaration of Independence signed in 1835, 5 years before the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>\r\n  \r\n<p><strong>The '<a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/canvassing-the-treaty\" target=\"_blank\">Canvassing the Treaty</a>' Project </strong></p>\r\n The project began with the six artists, three Maori and three non-Maori, being driven an hour and a half north of Auckland to a windswept cliff-top property at Pakiri, for an intensive wananga to learn about the Treaty of Waitangi from Moana Jackson and Ingrid Huygens, two experienced treaty educators. \"The depth of knowledge and considered social and historical perspectives shared that day was priceless\" says Sofia. \"I learnt more about New Zealand's history in one day than I had in all my years at school.\"  </p>\r\n<p>The artists were then paired up. Sofia who is of Ngati Porou, Swedish and Irish descent was to collaborate with Peap, to produce an artwork inspired by ideas about the treaty. The condensed two and a half day process of creating this artwork took place at the historically significant Te Tii Marae.\r\n  \r\nTe Tii was the meeting ground where rangatira (chiefs) from many iwi debated the merits of the treaty on the night before it was signed. The Maori treaty text 'Te Tiriti o Waitangi', which confirms Maori authority and sovereignty and allows a limited legal and administrative system to govern British migrants, was signed up the road from Te Tii Marae at Waitangi by about 43 rangatira. It was then taken around the country where another 500 signatures were gathered.  </p>\r\n<p><strong>Pou Symbolizing Ngati Porou Waka</strong></p>\r\n  <p>The subject of Te Pou Tuatahi is an exaggerated representation of a pou (carved post) symbolizing the Ngati Porou waka 'Horouta'. The pou of Horouta stands in a line up of ten poupou at the grounds at Te Tii and together they represent the great waka traditions linking Aotearoa with the Pacific.\r\n  Sofia found the link between the idea of waka and Te Tiriti o Waitangi very interesting. </p>\r\n<p>Te Tiriti is effectively the first legal immigration document, which affirms the position of various iwi as absolute sovereign states, and welcomes the crown to become its own iwi and to govern its own people migrating to Aotearoa. In essence it is a 'tauranga waka' or a landing place, a vessel to pull people in. This land and this world is meant to be shared and therefore the pou in Te Pou Tuatahi is a waka of inclusiveness, not exclusiveness.</p>\r\n  <p> <strong>Ancestral Consciousness</strong></p>\r\n  <p>On another level, Sofia sees the pou as being our ancestors speaking to us with the consciousness of the next world. The mouth is wide and is a void of blackness, within that blackness is the Sanskrit symbol Aum. Our ancestors are giving us the profound and unifying message of Aum, which is literally the resonating sound of the universe.  </p>\r\n  <p>\"The whole world has evolved from Aum\r\n  The whole world is sustained by Aum\r\n  The whole world will merge into Aum\"\r\n  - Sivayave</p>\r\n<p> Guru Sri Chinmoy said that the role of consciousness is to deepen silence and to expand sound. In his Colour Kingdom book the colour turquoise is connected with the idea of consciousness. The turquoise light glowing from the carved figure in the painting signifies the embodiment of a higher consciousness.</p>\r\n  <p> The figure's eye in the painting is the eye of a humpback whale. Whales are believed to have mass consciousness, not individual consciousnesses like man does. That means, if something happens to one whale, it is somehow known to the rest. Some believe the deeply peaceful presence emanating from whales, which is palpable to divers fortunate enough to experience close contact, as well as the sacrifice that whales make in beaching themselves, are in order to raise the vibration and compassion of humankind. The figure in the painting has essentially the same role as the humpback whale, as guardian of man.  </p>\r\n  <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print  </a></strong></p>\r\n  <p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality called hahnemuhle photo rag 308gsm.

Hikurangi’s snow-capped peaks are pictured on the distant horizon. \r\n  \r\n  In contrast, Hibernia is the latin and poetic name for Ireland. Sofia is also of Irish heritage, with her full-blooded Maori great-grandmother marrying an immigrant Irishman in the late 19th century. \r\n  \r\n  In the background, Magestic Pouakai Eagles soar over the land. The remarkable native creatures with a wingspan of up to three meters went extinct in 1400 AD.\r\n  \r\n  Before one’s eye is drawn to the surreal landscape aspect of this work, the Maori woman in the foreground is the dominant subject. She wears 1960’s western-style clothing and carries a kete (Maori flax bag). She was originally inspired by some old photos of the artist’s own whanau in a marae (maori meeting house) setting. The traditional carved wooden panel and the distant totem pole to her right suggest an ancestral presence that reminds the woman of her origins, her people and her land. \r\n  \r\n  Glistening red and curving into a dark, shadowy centre is the native Kaka Beak flower, which grows from the vine creeping up the carving. This is Papatuanuku (mother earth) from which she was born. \r\n  \r\n  “From Hikurangi to Hibernia” illustrates a time when Maori were experiencing heavy Europeanization in New Zealand. The dreamscape nature of the work brings the subject out of time and place. Her origins, future and worldly influences all converge in an unearthly setting of golden light and cross-cultural style.</p>\r\n<p>As seen in the video above, judge Koltun described the painting as \"a particularly touching portrait\".\r\n  \r\nShe went on to say \"What is particularly impressive about this work is the way in which Sofia’s managed to combine a sense of realism and accuracy in the individual person with a sense that they are meditating and in a dreamland about their own past. There’s an interesting play between the realism of Emma and what she perhaps was meditating on, the family portrait. The colouring that’s used both for Emma and for the space is so similar that she seems to become a part of her landscape and a part of those dreams of the past.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

From the Taurepo flowers, the slender stem evolves into korus and then ruby red Karaka berries, which dangle and fall. A Tui perches on the delicate branch, weighing it down in an attempt to feed from the sweet nectar of the Harakeke flowers. A small Kiwi stands in the centre, casting an unassuming shadow on a flat river stone. \r\n \r\nThis painting describes a primordial world disconnected from our reality of time and space.

This work depicts a Whirling Dervish performing the sema, a Sufi ritual where one revolves meditatively while worshiping the existence and majesty of the Creator. In so doing, one confirms the words of the Qur'an (64:1): Whatever is in the skies or on earth invokes God.\r\n\r\nIn the symbolism of the Sema ritual, the semazen's camel's hair hat (sikke) represents the tombstone of the ego; his wide, white skirt represents the ego's shroud. While whirling, his arms are open: his right arm is directed to the sky, ready to receive God's beneficence; his left hand, upon which his eyes are fastened, is turned toward the earth. The semazen conveys God's spiritual gift to those who are witnessing the Sema. Revolving from right to left around the heart, the semazen embraces all humanity with love. The human being has been created with love in order to love. Mevlâna Jalâluddîn Rumi says, \"All loves are a bridge to Divine love. Yet, those who have not had a taste of it do not know!\"</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75  prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

Ngai Tahu are a prominent South Island iwi (tribe) who trace their lineage back to Tahu Potiki, the younger brother of Porourangi who was one of the great ancestors of Ngati Porou - Sofia’s own iwi.</p>\r\n<p> The legend of Aoraki tells of four brothers who made a grave mistake, which created the spectacular mountain range known today as Te Tiritiri o Te Moana (The Southern Alps).\r\n  \r\n  The story begins when Raki (the Sky Father) wedded Papatuanuku (the Earth Mother). After the marriage, the children of Raki came down from the celestial sphere to greet their father's new wife. Among them were Raki’s four sons named Aoraki (Cloud in the Sky), Rakiora (Long Raki), Rakirua (Raki the Second), and Rarakiroa (Long Unbroken Line). \r\n  \r\n  They descended to earth in a canoe called Te Waka o Aoraki and spent time with Papatuanuku, who lay as one body in an vast continent known as Hawaiiki. After exploring the surrounding ocean, the brothers decided to return to their home. However the karakia (incantation), which should have lifted the waka back to the heavens failed and the canoe fell back into the sea and leaned over onto its side, turning to stone and earth in the process. \r\n  \r\nThus the earthen waka became the South Island of New Zealand, hence the name of the painting and the oldest name of the South Island being \"Te Waka o Aoraki\". Aoraki and his brothers clambered on to the high side and were also turned to stone, remaining there until this day as the mountains of the Southern Alpes.  </p>\r\n<p>This vivid, eerie environment is Sofia’s interpretation of an iconic New Zeland landscape, enriched by stories of ancient peoples, gods and natural history. Aoraki stands firmly as a quiet giant that has endured patiently over generations of human migration, natural evolution, creation and extinction. The ancient mountain bore witness to the rise and fall of New Zealand’s majestic Pouakai Eagle – a native bird known to prey on Moa with a wingspan of up to three meters, which became extinct A.D.1400. These immense, graceful creatures are pictured soaring over Aoraki as the guardians of the history and wairua (spirit) of the land.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Special Limited Edition Print</a></strong>\r\n  </p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Te Waka o Aoraki comes in a special limited edition print of just 30.

There is a stillness and warm glow to this painting that captures and extends what might be a fleeting feeling of peace in the madness of life. </p>\r\n<p>The subject of this painting is a boy who Sofia met in May 2008 in Tbilisi, the capital city of the ex-soviet nation of Georgia. It was only weeks before the crisis erupted with Russia over Georgia’s two breakaway regions, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. However there wasn’t even a whisper on the streets of the conflict to come.\r\n  \r\n  Taking her camera with her on walks through the city, she was enchanted by contrasts of old and new. The old city, with its derelict buildings and fortress, nestled itself comfortably within the plush modern architecture of the new city. Rituals and spirituality were abundant in the Orthodox Christian churches scattered everywhere throughout Tbilisi, even in and around highly commercial areas. The affluent youth came across relaxed, fashionable and concerned with being part of a Western social ideal. Whereas the older generation had an air about them, which seemed to suggest they had not so quickly forgotten their region’s history, the might of Russia and their only relatively new found independence.</p>\r\n<p>The subject of this painting is a young homeless boy that Sofia encountered on one of her explorations through the streets of Tbilisi. He was lying near the footpath, partially hidden by some wooden planks, and he had a serene energy about him. On realizing that the artist was interested in taking his picture however, he jumped up and began with his regular begging techniques. With a bag of strawberries in hand Sofia shared her fruit with him and they were both satisfied. This is not usually the case however. Roma children, as most of Tbilisi’s street children are referred to, often use a very aggressive strategy to get money from passers-by. Many come from other parts of the country and they belong to sophisticated begging networks, which don’t allow them to manage their own funds.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print  </a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed giclee prints on matte paper of museum archival quality.

Like Hawaiiki, Rangiatea is considered an ancient Maori homeland from whence the original canoes voyaged to New Zealand centuries ago. Rangi means 'sky' and atea means 'clear' or 'space'. Rangiatea therefore describes the world that opened up in the creation myth after the separation of Ranginui (Sky Father) and Papatuanuku (Earth Mother).\r\n  \r\n  On one level the phrase expresses the enduring connections that people have with their homelands, their past and their ancestors. On another, it refers to the inner concept of 'home' as being something intangible that we may loose track of sometimes, but deep down is carried with us always. Home is your heart or your soul.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Limited Edition Print</strong></a></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality called hahnemuhle photo rag 308gsm.

Kupe is said to have journeyed from Hawaiiki, the ancestral homeland of Maori, overcoming many severe obstacles at sea, to become the first person to discover Aotearoa. \"He kotuku rerenga tahi\" is a whakatauki or proverb, which means \"a white heron's flight is seen but once\".

The ancient waka rests upon the shores of Aotearoa after its immense journey.

The kuia (female elder) was full-blooded Maori and affiliated with the Ngati Porou iwi. She lived from 1863 to 1938 on the east coast of New Zealand. Matire married an Irishman in her 40s and at the ripe age of 54, she bore the last of their four children, Sofia’s grandmother May McGhee. Consequently, the generations in Sofia's family have been quite spaced out.  </p>\r\n<p><strong>Moko Kauae (Chin Tattoo)</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong> </strong>Matire is pictured in this portrait with a moko kauae on her lips and chin. The practice was an important marker between childhood and adulthood. It signaled status, individuality and was designed to be attractive to the opposite sex.  </p>\r\n<p><strong>Clothing</strong></p>\r\n<p>Matire wears a Victorian dress with an intricate ribbon around her neck. This reflects a time when Maori were experiencing heavy Europeanization.  </p>\r\n<p><strong>Earrings and Pendants</strong></p>\r\n<p>The pounamu (greenstone) earrings worn by Matire and the numerous pendants dangling off the web of necklaces in the background follow the old concept of Te Here Tangata – The Rope of Mankind. As a description of genealogy, the phrase alludes to a long rope or vine, which stretches into the past for generations until the instant of creation and on into the future. The delicate network of chains in this painting represents the ‘rope’. Each earring and pendant signifies an ancestor and they are carved into a variety of manaia designs. The manaia is an ancient mythical being with a bird’s head and a human form. It is said to be the messenger between the earthly world of mortals and the domain of the spirits.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ancestral Presence</strong> </p>\r\n<p>Sofia explains: &quot;The point of this work was not to record an accurate portrait Matire, the woman who physically lived in Aotearoa in the 1800s. Other than a few stories handed down, the fact is I never met her or knew her, and so she tends to be more of a symbol of guardianship and connection to mine or anyone's cultural and spiritual roots.</p>\r\n<p>Matire is painted very softly.  The one photo our whanau has of her is very small and instead of making up detail and realistic wrinkles in her face, I wanted to rather, use my smooth-style of brushwork, which gradually blends the paints, one thin layer at a time, patiently allowing it to dry for days at a time in-between layers, in order to create a depth of tone and a glowing, smooth graduation of colour.  I found this process very meditative and especially when bringing out the reflection in her eyes, I felt like I was closer to her ancestral presence and that she was watching over myself, and all of us.&quot;</p>\r\n<p> <strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Special Limited Edition Print</a></strong>\r\n  </p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Matire Te Horowai comes in a special limited edition print of just 30.

The prominent South Island iwi trace their lineage back to Tahu Potiki, the younger brother of Porourangi who was one of the great ancestors of Ngati Porou, of which Sofia herself is affiliated. </p>\r\n<p>Aoraki stands tall in the centre of this primordial, surreal landscape. The natural, eerie world was born out of Sofia’s imaginings, unfaithful to the confines of history, memory, time and space. ‘The cloud piercer’ as it is translated, slumbers as a quiet giant that has watched patiently over generations of human migration, natural evolution, creation and extinction. </p>\r\n<p>Legends of love and loss have been inspired by the colossal mountain. The myth of Hine Hukatere tells of a beautiful, icy snow maiden who fell in love with Wawe, a man of flesh and blood. Every time Hine and Wawe tried to touch they would scream in pain as she would melt from the heat of his skin and he would freeze instantly from her contact. The two lovers made a plan to go high into the mountains to ask Aoraki for warm breath and pink cheeks for Hine Hukatere. As they climbed Wawe became afraid and the air grew cold and thin. His ancestors had forbidden everyone from climbing Aoraki because it was the home of tribal guardians who jealously defended their resting place. Hine was in her element as she skipped joyfully over the snowy ground but Wawe’s fingers and toes grew numb, his face turned blue and his eyelids became heavy with snow. He heard Tawhirimatea scream in his head. \"Get off this mountain, you mortal!\" and the enraged spirit pushed Wawe off the edge. Hine Hukatere desperately shook millions of snowflakes from her fingers to cushion his fall but Tawhirimatea blew them away and Wawe plunged down to his death. The wintry goddess cries over her lost love and never leaves Aoraki now. Sofia has depicted the mournful, sensual figure of Hine Hukatere lying within the slopes of the snow-covered mountain. </p>\r\n<p>Just as the mountain is the subject of ancient legend, it also bore witness to the rise and fall of New Zealand’s majestic Pouakai Eagle and Huia. Both native species feature in the painting and their extinctions have little gravity in Sofia’s dreamscape of an Aotearoa out of time and space.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Special Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Ko Aoraki Te Maunga comes in a special limited edition print of just 30.

Perhaps not intending to create a conventional portrait, Vermeer may have wanted to capture a simple moment in which the girl in the painting turns her head towards someone whom she has just noticed. Significantly, the identity of the young girl remains uncertain to this day. \r\n\r\nInspired by this historical work, Sofia’s “Girl With a Pounamu” responds with a sense of delicacy, intrigue and innocence. Searching her own questions about ancestry, culture and identity, the artist presents a simple portrait of a young Maori girl. There is a freshness of spirit in child's bright eyes, yet this is contrasted with the very traditional nature of her korowai (cloak), her pounamu earrings and the Huia feathers in her hair. The composition of the work emulates Vermeer’s 17th century portrait, illustrating that a larger global history of art and civilization is part of Sofia’s consciousness. Valuable influences from European art and Maori culture are all present in this contemporary exploration of portraiture.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75  prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

This fabled Polynesian navigator is said to have journeyed from Hawaiiki, the mythical ancestral homeland of the Maori, to discover Aotearoa (New Zealand). “Matawhaorua” is the name of the great ocean-going waka (canoe) that brought Kupe to these shores. The intricately carved taurapa (stern post) and puhi (the adorning feather streamers) depicted in this work were created from the artist’s personal vision of the Matawhaorua. \r\n  \r\n  Before the great voyage began, Kupe who was already married, also desired his cousin’s wife intensely. When out fishing one day, Kupe ordered his cousin Hoturapa to dive down and free the tangled fishing line. Kupe then cut the anchor rope from the waka and rowed furiously back to shore, leaving his cousin to drown. By killing Hoturapa, Kupe had planned to take his wife. However the circumstances surrounding his death at sea caused Hoturapa’s family to be suspicious of Kupe. To escape vengeance, Kupe and his family left Hawaiiki and embarked on the infamous journey to Aotearoa.\r\n  \r\n  Kupe’s wife Hine Te Aparangi was the first to sight the shores of New Zealand. The land appeared to lie beneath a great cloud. Because of this, they named the islands Aotearoa, Land of the Long White Cloud.\r\n  \r\n  As Kupe and his crew sailed along the coast of the newly discovered land they mistakenly disturbed a giant octopus. A battle ensued between the powerful, enraged sea monster and the unassuming waka but due to Kupe’s ingenuity they managed to defeat their formidable opponent.\r\n  \r\n  In this work the ancient, carved waka rests upon the eerie shores of Aotearoa after its immense voyage. The vessel’s solidity and stillness suggest the overcoming of obstacles, the calm after the storm and the final reaching of a destination.\r\n  \r\n  The flying birds introduce a dynamic energy that refers to the Matawhaorua’s tremendous, perilous voyage. Pouakai Eagles (a now extinct New Zealand species), Albatross and a single Kotuku (White Heron) are seen circling the coastline, welcoming the strange newcomers. Significantly, Maori see the Kotuku as a symbol of everything rare and beautiful and the sighting of one as a good omen.  </p>\r\n<p class=\"Green\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Special Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Matawhaorua comes in a special limited edition print of just 30.

Pictured in this painting is an enchanting view of the misty, snow-covered mountains near the Homer Tunnel, just before reaching Piopiotahi (Milford Sound). In Maori legend, the South Island fiords were created not by rivers of ice, but by Tu Te Raki Whanoa, a godly figure who came wielding a magical adze and uttering incantations. Piopiotahi is without a doubt his finest sculpture. \r\n  \r\n  The narrative of this work is an extension of a myth about Maui-tikitiki-a-Taranga, the great Polynesian demi-god. The story begins with the final and most daring venture of Maui - an attempt to win immortality for mankind. Had courageous Maui not tamed the sun? Had he not fished up the North Island of New Zealand? Could he not also overcome the night of death?\r\n  \r\n  The bird pictured in this painting is the now extinct piopio (New Zealand thrush), which is said to have accompanied Maui from Hawaiki. To accomplish his aim of eternal life, Maui was to enter the womb of Hinenui-te-Po (the goddess of death), travel through her body and emerge from her mouth. If he succeeded, death would never have dominion over humans. Maui set out to the place where the goddess lay. Finding her slumbering, Maui demanded silence from the birds of the forest that had come to witness his remarkable endeavour. But when Maui’s head entered Hinenui-te-Po’s gigantic opening, the sight was so absurd that the piwakawaka (fantail) burst into a shrill twitter of laughter and awakened the goddess of death. She brought her huge thighs together in a thunderous crash. Maui died without gaining the treasure of immortality for mankind.\r\n  \r\n  The sorrowful piopio who saw the tragedy, fled south to Milford Sound to mourn for the death of its mate. The Maori name for Milford Sound is therefore “Piopiotahi”, which translates as \"the single thrush\".\r\n  \r\nHere, the little thrush is shown flying towards Piopiotahi towing a colossal bone carving in the form of a manaia. The manaia is an ancient mythical being with a bird’s head and a human form. It is said to be the messenger between the earthly world of mortals and the domain of the spirits illustrating the strong links Maori have with the spirit world. The Manaia is depicted in this work with the three fingers of birth, life and death, representing the inevitable mortality of mankind and of Maui.  </p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Special Limited Edition Print</a></strong>\r\n  </p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The Flight of Maui comes in a special limited edition print of just 30.

He felt a strong tug on the line and after much straining and chanting of karakia (incantations), there surfaced Te Ika a Maui (The Fish of Maui), also known as the North Island of New Zealand.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Hikurangi is the sacred mountain of Ngati Porou, the people from whom Sofia decends. It is said to be the first piece of land to have emerged when Maui fished up the North Island. According to Ngati Porou tradition, Maui's waka Nukutaimemeha remains stranded on the mountain and is depicted in this painting with its intricately carved tauihu (bow piece) emerging from rocks on the peak. Pouakai eagles - a large native species with a wingspan of up to 3 metres that went extinct c.1400 A.D. - are shown flying near the ancient vessel. To this day the pouakai and the mountain itself are guardians or 'keepers' of the Nukutaimemeha. </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Limited Edition Print  </strong></a></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality called hahnemuhle photo rag 308gsm.

Just as mortals live and die and go through a process of karmic evolution, perhaps angels also move towards a union with the ultimate source, the oneness of God. </p>\r\n<p>Everything under God is in flux, is imperfect in so many ways, yet perfect still.\r\n  \r\n  Representation of angels and otherworldly beings is subject to cultural perspectives and bias. In this work, the \"angels\" referred to in the title take different forms. Angels inspired by the christian tradition, but depicted with moth wings and elongated bodies, walk together on the shoreline. Carved manaia figures hang from the sky in the foreground. In Maori carving manaia can be seen with a bird’s head and a serpent's tail. Their three fingers of birth, life and death represent the inevitable mortality of mankind. Manaia are said to be the messengers between the earthly world of mortals and the domain of the spirits. Sofia's interpretation of this is that in essence, manaia are angels.  </p>\r\n<p>The serene setting of this painting provides a place of convergence for these different cultural perspectives on the next world and its messengers. \r\n  \r\n  \"Ye are all the leaves of one tree and the drops of one ocean.\"\r\n  - Bahá'u'lláh</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75  prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

Goldie and to his most notorious forger Karl Sim, Minson has modelled this work after Goldie’s “All e same te Pakeha” from 1905, which is also known as &quot;A Good Joke&quot;. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.newzealandartwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Goldie-A-Good-Joke-Sofia-Minson.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"363\"></p>\r\n<p>In the original, Goldie breaks from his melancholic tone and depicts a laughing Hami Te Piripi wearing a bowler hat and a European suit. &nbsp;In Minson’s “Good As Goldie”, Sims, who was arrested for art forgery in the 1980s and who later legally changed his name to C.F. Goldie, &nbsp;takes centre stage donning his bowler hat and cheeky grin. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nMinson went to meet with “Goldie”, as he likes to be called, in April 2012 to learn more about his story and have a sitting with him for this portrait. He sat back in his lazy boy chair after returning from a busy morning of TVNZ breakfast show interviews and proceeded to relay much of the mischief he got up to in his early days with the catchphrase “bloody beautiful” cropping up often. &nbsp;Minson found his charm and vitality a delight and learned that he was ranked as one of the top ten art forgers in the world in an international magazine. “Bloody beautiful!”</p>\r\n<p>Since Lindauer and Goldie in the 19th century, there has been a surprising lack in the tradition of Maori oil portraiture. Although Karl Sim is not of Maori decent, Minson considers this work to be part of her series of <strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/contemporary-maori-portrait-series\" target=\"_blank\">contemporary Maori portraits</a></strong> because of his role in the evolution of Maori art and culture as well as the fact that he grew up in a predomenantly Maori community and has had close ties with Maori ever since. </p>\r\n<p>In 2003 Sim wrote an autobiographical <strong><a href=\"http://www.wheelers.co.nz/books/9781869589073-good-as-goldie-the-amazing-story-of-new-zealands-most-famous-forger/\"> book called &quot;Good as Goldie&quot;</a></strong>, which is where the title of this painting came from.</p>\r\n<p>This painting is part of Minson's <strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/parnell-gallery-exhibition\">4-18 September 2012 exhibition of new works at Parnell Gallery</a></strong>.

Tuihana married Sofia's great-great-grandfather Popata Pikiuha, probably during the 1850s, and they lived at Te Puia Springs just north of Gisborne.  </p>\r\n<p>The story goes that when Tuihana was a little girl she used to race her brothers, sisters and cousins along the path to the kumara patch. After a while of running the children would look around and say \"hey, where's Tuihana gone?\" and continue confidently towards the finish line. However despite her disappearance, Tuihana would somehow always get to the kumara patch first, beating the rest of the kids. She became known as 'Tuihana with the Magic Feet' because of her mysterious victories. As it turns out, Tuihana had found her own secret and much quicker passage through the nearby forest!  </p>\r\n<p>Now over 160 years later, Sofia listens to this little tale that has been passed down through the whanau over generations and feels inspired to create something in response - a painting that describes a light-filled magical world belonging to her great-great-grandmother.\r\n  \r\n  The artist had no picture from which to gleam a visual form of Tuihana. She simply portrayed a mystical forest and an imagined face of a young girl who lived long, long ago.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality called hahnemuhle photo rag 308gsm.

This work was inspired by the old stories of Maui as told by Sofia’s own tribe - the Ngati Porou iwi from the east coast of the North Island. Maui was a demi-god who came from Hawaiiki, the legendary homeland of Maori. \r\n\r\nMyth has it that long ago Maui and his brothers went fishing far out into the ocean. For lack of other bait, Maui smeared his magic fishhook with his own blood and dropped it over the side of the waka (canoe). He felt a strong tug on the line and after much straining and chanting of karakia (incantations), there surfaced Te Ika a Maui (the fish of Maui), which is now the North Island of NZ.\r\n\r\nSome say Maui’s waka then transformed into the South Island of NZ and call it Te Waka a Maui (the canoe of Maui). According to Ngati Porou tradition however, after the raising up of the land, Maui’s waka Nukutaimemeha lay upside down on our sacred mountain Hikurangi and remains there to this day. Hikurangi is pictured snow-capped on the horizon. \r\n\r\nA kotuku (white heron) is pictured towing a colossal bone carving towards Mt Hikurangi. The graceful kotuku is traditionally a symbol of good fortune and marks the arrival of a rare and sacred visitor. \r\n\r\nIn this work the bone carving is symbolic of Maui’s sacred fishhook. Legend tells that it was fashioned from his grandfather’s jawbone and possessed great mana. Here it is carved into the form of a manaia, which is an ancient mythical being with a bird’s head and a human form. It is said to be the messenger between the earthly world of mortals and the domain of the spirits. The manaia is depicted with the three fingers of birth, life and death and foreshadows the mortality of mankind and of Maui, who eventually tried but failed to conquer the goddess of death Hinenui-te-Po.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75  prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

This painting explores the powerful legend of Ranginui (sky father) and Papatuanuku (earth mother).\r\n \r\nBefore our world existed, tradition tells that Ranginui and Papatuanuku clung together in a close, loving embrace. They are depicted in this work as the large grey panels above and below respectively, leaving just a slither of black space between them. \r\n \r\nThis central dark band describes the confined environment between Rangi and Papa in which their divine children were born. In the middle of the work is a manaia bone carving symbolizing the strongest son - Tanemahuta. \r\n \r\nThe manaia is an ancient mythical being with a bird’s head and a human form. It is said to be the messenger between the earthly world of mortals and the domain of the spirits. The original meaning behind the manaia has been the subject of much controversy. As well as being ascribed the attributes of a bird-headed man, it has also been interpreted as a snake, a raft, a seahorse and a lizard. \r\n \r\nIn some accounts of this myth, the children of Rangi and Papa had to “crawl about like lizards” and others were forced to lie on their sides because there was so little room between their parent’s embrace.\r\n \r\nTanemahuta, along with many of his brothers yearned for more air, space and light in which to live. Legend holds that in planting his head on the earth and thrusting his feet against the sky, Tane eventually succeeded in separating his parents.\r\n \r\nOnce liberated, the children of Ranginui and Papatuanuku then became the various gods of Aotearoa. </p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75  prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

Artworks were donated by over 30 artists – the Little Lotus artists as well as by a number of guest artists including Sofia Minson, Michel Tuffery, Peap Tarr, Martin Horspool and Misery. </p>\r\n<p>Watch this video for more about the Little Lotus project...</p>\r\n<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/49807303\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> \r\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/49807303\">Little Lotus Project - Part 1</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/nektar\">NEKTAR</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality called hahnemuhle photo rag 308gsm.

Enriched by spiritual symbolism, this painting describes a primordial, surreal vision of a world inspired by the one love that unifies everyone and everything in our universe. </p>\r\n<p>Sofia explores this vast concept using the ancient mythology of Aotearoa (New Zealand), which refers to her Maori heritage.\r\n  \r\n  The Maori legend of Ranginui (sky father) and Papatuanuku (earth mother) speaks of the creation of the universe. It is said that their children, who were born into the confined, stifling realm between Ranginui and Papatuanuku’s close embrace, forced the two lovers apart. In doing so, a world with more air, space and light opened up to them and the children of Rangi and Papa became the original essence of human kind.</p>\r\n<p>In this painting, Papatuanuku lies quietly and sensuously beneath the sky and Ranginui caresses her with a warm glow. Amid her curves, she extends tentacles adorned with frangipanis and gardenias up towards her distant lover. As spiritual guardians, the great mother and father watch over this world where the sacred Indian mountain of Arunachala stands on the horizon and owls, which in many cultures are symbolic of the soul and wisdom, soar over the land. \r\n  \r\n  The radiant power of Arunachala is said to have brought Papaji’s guru Ramana Maharishi’s own Self-realization. In this painting the mountain exists as a beacon to understanding who we are as individuals and in our lives together.  </p>\r\n<p>“Where there is love there is life” - Gandhi. </p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75  prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

Te Po is Night. It is darkness and death as well as the womb containing the seed, from which new life is generated. Te Rangi is Day. It is sky, heaven, light and life. </p>\r\n<p>The highest realm of Nga Rangi, The Heavens, is Tikitiki o nga Rangi where Io, The Supreme Being dwells. As light cannot be comprehended except in relation to death, so Te Rangi and Te Po define and complete each other. Together they are united as spiritual realms in contrast with the World of Men. In pre-Christian Maori belief, the spirits of notable chiefs were drawn up into Te Rangi to become stars. Today speakers farewelling the dead often bid them go to join those who have gone before in Te Rangi. </p>\r\n<p>Matariki, the constellation known to the Greeks as the Pleiades, is pictured in the sky of this artwork. Mata Ariki means Eyes of the Lord. Some say that when Ranginui, earth mother, and Papatuanuku, sky father, were separated by their offspring, the god of the winds, Tawhirimatea, became angry, tearing out his eyes and hurling them into the heavens. </p>\r\n<p>This painting shows a movement connecting Te Po, Te Rangi and The World of Men. The carved manaia figures are intermediary beings - messengers between the mortal world and the heavens. Sofia sees the large manaia hanging from the tree on the left as encompassing birth and rebirth, the mania on the right as representing life's experience, and the giant Haast eagle or Pouakai as flying into the heavens with the consciousness of death. The tree has a divine purpose and that is to grow, it is alive and in a state of subtle motion connecting all elements in this painting.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Limited Edition Print</strong></a></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality called hahnemuhle photo rag 308gsm.

Galyhare, also known as the Cave of the Spirits of Knowledge is an outdoor rock wall in Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka, where giant standing and reclining sculptures of the Buddha were carved out of the rock face during the reign of a twelfth century king - a huge task, when one considers it was accomplished with nothing but manual labour. The most imposing statue measuring 46 feet in length is the Reclining Buddha depicted in this painting.

The Dhaasanac, Surma, Mursi, Karo, Nyangatom and Arbore are peoples who are related to one another and who have mixed because of past migrations. At the same time each one is proud of its differences and its own identity. \r\n \r\nThe woman in the painting has a sense of style and poise derived predominantly from the Surma and Mursi tribes. These peoples hold physical beauty and grooming in high esteem. Among other adornments, tight metal arm bracelets that accentuate muscle tone and large earring ornaments are part of a woman’s seductive repertoire. It is common for Surma and Mursi to pierce and widen their ear lobes in order to insert large wooden disks in them. </p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75  prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

The word Nati is also used as a colloquial term for Ngati Porou people (Sofia is affiliated with the east coast tribe of Ngati Porou). \r\n\r\nThe large-scale portrait was first inspired by a photo taken in the 1960s of Sofia’s auntie, who was then age five.\r\n\r\nThis work portrays the little girl’s bright eyes and inquisitive spirit. She wears a korowai (Maori feather cloak) over her shoulders, which in highlighting an aspect of tradition, contrasts to the youth and curiosity of Nati herself. “I feel as though I relate to this portrait of Nati because I’m also in a position of constant discovery and learning. Yet just as she wears a cloak that is sacred to her ancestors, I try and respect the history and tradition of my tupuna in my work” Sofia comments. \r\n\r\n\"Painting gives me an avenue to express my connection to my own whakapapa (genealogy).

Legendary Polynesian navigator Kupe discovered the North and South Islands using the great ocean going vessel.\r\n  \r\n  Once departed from Hawaiiki, the Matahorua’s crew travelled for some time before Kupe’s wife Hine Te Aparangi sighted the shores of New Zealand. The land appeared to lie beneath a great cloud.

Although absent from the frame, Sofia intends the presence of Kupe and the Matahorua’s crew to be felt.

She immediately felt an affinity with the land, the sky and the natural environment of Turkey, in a similar way that she connects with Aotearoa. Its temperate climate, hilly landscape and good-natured people gave it a strong sense of home, of New Zealand. </p>\r\n<p>On the particular day that inspired this work, when the skies were stormy and glowing and there was an excited energy in the air, Sofia was reminded of the Maori creation myth. \r\n  \r\n  Legend has it that long before humans existed, Ranginui (sky father) and Papatuanuku (earth mother) clung together in a close, loving embrace. In the dark, confined realm between them, 70 divine sons were born. The strongest, Tanemahuta, along with many of his brothers yearned for more air, space and light in which to live. Tradition tells that in planting his head on the earth and thrusting his feet against the sky, Tane succeeded in separating his parents.\r\n  \r\n  Tane went on to become god of the forests and birds. Therefore Sofia sees the tree in the painting as representing Tane, a child within the cosmic embrace of sky and earth. </p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75  prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

The soft, eerie landscape depicts a snow-covered Aoraki Maunga (Mt Cook) with the glacial-fed Lake Pukaki in the foreground. This artwork is Sofia’s depiction of an enchanting, primordial world where Aotearoa is still young and the mountains, lakes and birds have only just emerged from the mists of creation.\r\n\r\nAs Ngai Tahu’s sacred tribal mountain, Aoraki is also the highest peak in Aotearoa. Ngai Tahu are a prominent South Island iwi (tribe) who trace their lineage back to Tahu Potiki, the younger brother of Porourangi who was one of the great ancestors of Ngati Porou - Sofia’s own iwi.\r\n\r\nThe legend of Aoraki’s origins enhanced the making of “Young Mists of Pukaki”. It tells of four brothers who made a grave mistake, which created the spectacular mountain range known today as Te Tiritiri o Te Moana (The Southern Alps).\r\n\r\nThe story begins when Raki (Sky Father) wedded Papatuanuku (Earth Mother). After the marriage the four sons of Raki, one of whom was Aoraki (which translates as Cloud in the Sky), came down from the celestial sphere to greet their father's new wife. They descended to earth in a waka (canoe) and spent time with Papatuanuku, who lay as one body in a vast continent known as Hawaiiki. After exploring the surrounding ocean the brothers decided to return to their home. However the karakia (incantation), which should have lifted the waka back to the heavens failed and the canoe fell back into the sea and leaned over onto its side, turning to stone and earth in the process. Thus the earthen waka became the South Island of New Zealand. Aoraki and his brothers clambered on to the high side and were also turned to stone, remaining there until this day as the great Southern Alps. \r\n\r\nIn the painting Aoraki stands as a quiet giant that is destined to endure patiently over generations of human migration, natural evolution, creation and extinction. \r\n\r\nA white Mt Cook Lily peeks into the painting from below, surveying the scene. Life begins to sprout from Papatuanuku, the fertile young land.\r\n\r\nRaki, the sky, is filled with birds. Aotearoa was once home to the Pouakai Eagle, which had an impressive wingspan of up to three meters and became extinct A.D.1400.

It is the world of light, reality and emergence that is the dwelling place of humans and all life. \r\n  \r\n  Legend has it that before humans existed, Ranginui (sky father) and Papatuanuku (earth mother) clung together in a close, loving embrace. In the dark, confined realm between them, 70 divine sons were born. The strongest son, Tanemahuta, along with many of his brothers yearned for more air, space and light in which to live. Tradition tells that in planting his head on the earth and thrusting his feet against the sky, Tane succeeded in separating his parents.\r\n  \r\n  The cosmic mother and father, represented in portrait form in this work, drift apart from each other. They long to remain united in love and this sadness cause fierce, whirling storm clouds to erupt in the space opening up between them. But the glorious light has been let in and life, in the form of soaring native birds, have entered the new, illuminated realm. \r\n  \r\n  Amongst the birds flying out through the dark eye of the storm are large, graceful kotuku (white herons), which have positive connotations in Maori tradition because of their rarity in Aotearoa. Pouakai (Haast) eagles also feature. This majestic New Zealand species had a wingspan of up to three meters and became extinct around 1400AD.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

Kupe is said to have journeyed from Hawaiiki, the mythical ancestral homeland of the Maori, to become the first person to discover Aotearoa. Matahorua was the name of his great ocean going vessel and it is pictured in this painting with an intricately carved bow piece. \r\n\r\nOn their voyage from Hawaiiki, the Matahorua's crew travelled for some time before Kupe's wife Hine Te Aparangi sighted the shores of New Zealand. The land appeared to lie beneath a great cloud. Because of this, they named the islands Aotearoa, Land of the Long White Cloud.</p>\r\n<p>The solitary, ancient waka is depicted in this work resting upon the shores of Aotearoa after its immense journey. \r\n  \r\n  Graceful Kotuku (White Herons) fly towards the shore. They traditionally symbolize peace and mark the arrival of a rare and sacred visitor. \r\n  \r\n  As Kupe and the crew of the Matahorua leave the waka to explore the newly discovered land, this painting gives the sense that the spirit and memory of their great voyage remains.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75  prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

The pou stands in a line-up of ten poupou at the grounds at Te Tii Marae, Northland, and together they represent the great waka traditions linking Aotearoa with the Pacific.  Sofia sees the pou as being our ancestors speaking to us with the consciousness of the next world. </p>\r\n<p>The mouth is wide and is a void of blackness, within that blackness is the Sanskrit symbol Aum. Our ancestors are giving us the profound and unifying message of Aum, which is literally the resonating sound of the universe. \"The whole world has evolved from Aum The whole world is sustained by Aum The whole world will merge into Aum\" - Sivayave.  </p>\r\n<p>Guru Sri Chinmoy said that the role of consciousness is to deepen silence and to expand sound. In his Colour Kingdom book the colour turquoise is connected with the idea of consciousness. The turquoise light glowing from the carved figure in the painting signifies the embodiment of a higher consciousness.  </p>\r\n<p>The figure's eye in the painting is the eye of a humpback whale. Whales are believed to have mass consciousness, not individual consciousnesses like man does. That means, if something happens to one whale, it is somehow known to the rest. Some believe the deeply peaceful presence emanating from whales, which is palpable to divers fortunate enough to experience close contact, as well as the sacrifice that whales make in beaching themselves, are in order to raise the vibration and compassion of humankind. The figure in the painting has essentially the same role as the humpback whale, as guardian of man. </p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75  prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

The painting also explores connections between past and present, between the artist and her own Maori heritage.\r\n\r\nSofia is of Ngati Porou descent but has always lived away from the East Cape of the North Island - the region where her iwi (tribe) settled after the fist waka (canoes) came to New Zealand centuries ago.</p>\r\n<p>Words from the Ngati Porou proverb of identity are central to this work:</p>\r\n<p>Ko Hikurangi te maunga\r\n  <br>\r\n  Ko Waiapu te awa\r\n  <br>\r\n  Ko Ngati Porou te iwi \r\n  \r\n  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  Hikurangi is the mountain\r\n  <br>\r\n  Waiapu is the river\r\n  <br>\r\n  Ngati Porou are the people\r\n  \r\n  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  The environment consists of a vast, smooth stoned, waterless riverbed belonging to the sacred Waiapu river. Sofia, being the water element in traditional Chinese astrology, is absent from this picture of her ancestral homeland. \r\n  \r\n  Papatuanuku (earth mother) lies within the river stones that bathe in the subdued glow of Ranginui (sky father). She gives birth to enchanted plants, which emerge from crevices in the rocks and morph into various native New Zealand species including Karaka berries, Kaka Beak flowers and Ponga. A Tui perches on a delicate branch in the foreground and we share his gaze across the uncanny garden of Waiapu.\r\n  \r\n  Mt Hikurangi appears in the distance, encircled by now extinct Pouakai Eagles. Since the original migration, the mountain has remained a constant, unmoving guardian to Ngati Porou. Wise old Hikurangi has witnessed generations of creation, life and destruction in this fertile garden.  </p>\r\n<p>This painting describes a primordial world disconnected from our reality of time and space. Sofia's vision materializes in this eerie, sensuous environment and is brought to life by the wairua (spirit) of Aotearoa’s ancient land and mythology.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75  prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

The artist explores connections between past and present, between herself and her own Maori heritage.</p>\r\n<p>Sofia is of Ngati Porou descent and words from her tribe’s ancient proverb of identity demonstrate the fundamental importance of land to Maori:  </p>\r\n<p>Ko Hikurangi te maunga\r\n  <br>\r\n  Ko Waiapu te awa\r\n  <br>\r\n  Ko Ngati Porou te iwi  </p>\r\n<p> Hikurangi is the mountain\r\n  <br>\r\n  Waiapu is the river\r\n  <br>\r\n  Ngati Porou is the tribe  </p>\r\n<p>Papatuanuku (earth mother) lies within the river stones that bathe in the subdued glow of Ranginui (sky father). She gives birth to an enchanted plant, which emerges from a crevice in the rocks and morphs into a native Kaka Beak flower with dangling Kaka berries. A Tui perches on a delicate branch and we share his gaze across the uncanny rock garden.\r\n  \r\n  The sacred Waiapu River is not absent from this riverbed, rather it is depicted as an intricate Maori design creeping over the rocks. The koru pattern describes a blood-like flow over the stones, which tells the stories of the past. The lives of ancestors become present in this motif, which reaches all the way to the distant horizon, to creation itself.  </p>\r\n<p>This painting describes a primordial dreamscape. Sofia's vision materializes in this eerie, sensuous environment and is brought to life by the wairua (spirit) of Aotearoa’s ancient people, land and mythology.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75  prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

Cape Reinga at the very tip of the North Island is known as Te Rerenga Wairua or The Leaping Place of the Spirits and it is where Maori believe the spirits of the dead depart the island to return to Hawaiki - the ancestral home. \r\n  \r\n  Sofia has chosen the ambiguous and yet deeply meaningful word Rerenga as the title for this simple seascape with its explosive fiery sky and ancient waka (canoe) resting on the shores.</p>\r\n<p>The painting was originally inspired by the legend of Kupe, the great Polynesian navigator. Kupe is said to have journeyed from his homeland, Hawaiiki, to become the first person to discover Aotearoa. Sofia's interpretation of his great ocean going vessel, the Matawhaorua, is depicted with an intricately carved tauihu (bow piece). \r\n  \r\n  The crew of the Matawhaorua encountered many obstacles on their long voyage including a battle with an enraged, monstrous octopus. It was Kupe's wife Hine Te Aparangi who finally sighted land naming it Aotearoa, Land of the Long White Cloud.\r\n  \r\n  As Kupe and the crew of the Matawhaorua leave to explore the recently discovered land, the solitary, ancient waka is depicted resting upon the shores after its immense journey. Two pouakai eagles - a large native species with a wingspan of up to 3 metres that went extinct c.1400 A.D. - are shown flying to greet the newly arrived vessel.  </p>\r\n<p>The vibrant sunrise of this painting gives the sense that the spirit of the Matawhaorua's voyage and the arrival of new people to Aotearoa ushers in a new epoch for this land. </p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75  prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

It really should just be about the viewer’s liking (or disliking!) of the subject matter, title, painting technique and the essence of the piece”. \r\n  \r\n“This was a spontaneous painting.

This fabled Polynesian navigator is said to have journeyed from Hawaiiki, the mythical ancestral homeland of the Maori, to discover Aotearoa (New Zealand). Matawhaorua is the name of the great ocean-going waka (canoe) that brought Kupe to these shores. Inspired by the old story, Sofia has depicted the Matawhaorua’s intricately carved taurapa (stern post) and also the puhi (adorning feather streamers).</p>\r\n<p> Tradition tells that before the great voyage began, Kupe who was already married, also desired his cousin’s wife intensely. When out fishing one day, Kupe ordered his cousin Hoturapa to dive down and free the tangled fishing line. Kupe then cut the anchor rope from the waka and rowed furiously back to shore, leaving his cousin to drown. By killing Hoturapa, Kupe had planned to take his wife. However the circumstances surrounding his death at sea caused Hoturapa’s family to be suspicious of Kupe. To escape vengeance, Kupe and his family left Hawaiiki and embarked on the infamous journey to Aotearoa.\r\n  \r\n  Kupe’s wife Hine Te Aparangi was the first to sight the shores of New Zealand. The land appeared to lie beneath a great cloud. Because of this, they named the islands Aotearoa, Land of the Long White Cloud.\r\n  \r\n  As Kupe and his crew sailed along the coast of the newly discovered land they mistakenly disturbed a giant octopus. A battle ensued between the powerful, enraged sea monster and the unassuming waka but due to Kupe’s ingenuity they managed to defeat their formidable opponent.  </p>\r\n<p>In this work the ancient, carved waka rests upon the eerie shores of Aotearoa after its immense voyage. The vessel’s solidity and stillness suggest the overcoming of obstacles, the calm after the storm and the final reaching of a destination.\r\n  \r\n  The soaring albatrosses introduce a dynamic energy that refers to the Matawhaorua’s tremendous, perilous voyage. Like the waka that brought Maori to Aotearoa, these birds also undergo a hekenga or migration to new lands.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75  prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

Sofia sees the intricately carved taurapa (stern post) as belonging to Maui and his waka Nukutaimemeha. </p>\r\n<p>Maui was a Polynesian demi-god who lived in Hawaiiki, the mythical ancestral homeland of Maori.\r\n  \r\n  One day Maui and his brothers went fishing far out into the ocean and he dropped his magic fishhook over the side of his waka. He felt a strong tug on the line and after much straining and chanting of karakia (incantations), there surfaced Te Ika a Maui (The Fish of Maui), also known as the North Island of New Zealand.  </p>\r\n<p>Ngati Porou, the people from whom Sofia decends, claim that their sacred mountain Hikurangi was the first piece of land to be fished out of the sea by Maui. Local tradition also says that Maui's waka Nukutaimemeha remains on the mountain in its petrified form to this day.\r\n  \r\n  The risen land may be called Te Ika a Maui but at a more fundamental level the land is Papatuanuku (Earth Mother). </p>\r\n<p>In this artwork the land, Papatuanuku, has returned to her quiet resting place underneath the ocean and she has taken Maui's ancient waka with her. \"The Resting Place\" gives a sense that over time things are circular and what rises, ultimately falls again. The great ocean-going waka belonging to Maui has risen to the top of a mountain peak and returned to the ocean once again. </p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75  prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

The word \"Silence\" is used to make the viewer pensive, calm and receptive to the work. The important process is how the viewer interprets the piece, hopefully with an open mind and heart. Having said that, when I begun the painting I really wanted to find a point where the female form was no longer human, but not yet transformed into actual hills, valleys and landscape. I think this uncanny position of female life almost becoming land, connects the human or goddess element of Papatuanuku from the old stories, and the actual land of Aotearoa (New Zealand) together.\r\n  \r\n  I am of Ngati Porou descent (Ngati Porou is a Maori tribe from the east coast of the North Island of NZ) and words from my tribe’s traditional proverb of identity demonstrate the fundamental importance of land to Maori people:</p>\r\n<p> Ko Hikurangi te maunga\r\n  <br>\r\n  Ko Waiapu te awa\r\n  <br>\r\n  Ko Ngati Porou te iwi \r\n  \r\n  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  Hikurangi is the mountain\r\n  <br>\r\n  Waiapu is the river\r\n  <br>\r\n  Ngati Porou are the people\r\n  \r\n  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  The mountain, the river and the land is deeply ingrained in Maori identity.

The two nation's armies, separated by time, space and culture, wear hauntingly similar uniforms. One wonders whether the war-time experiences or emotional challenges for men in both armies also run parallel? In this picture the soldier, who could be from either time or place, gazes at an ominous cross. For the Anzacs this cross represents many untimely deaths, for the Georgians this cross is their nation's flag and symbolizes all that they are fighting for.</p>\r\n<p>Just before the August 2008 crisis with Russia over Georgia's two breakaway regions, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Sofia spent a week in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi. There wasn't even a whisper to be heard of the conflict to come. \r\n  \r\n  On the eve of Georgian Independence Day, the Army, Navy and Air Force flooded the main street of Tbilisi in their thousands to practice for the following day's parade. Sofia was there to watch the spectacle of marching military personnel, weapons and tanks, to photograph them, and during break times to casually meet and talk with some of the men involved. Sofia sometimes wonders whether the soldiers and officers she spoke to were subsequently deployed during the weeks of violence between Georgia and Russia and what might have become of them?</p>\r\n<p>Not long after visiting Georgia, Sofia then travelled to Gallipoli in Turkey where she took in the solemn sites of the WWI Gallipoli Campaign where 3000 New Zealanders lost their lives.\r\n  \r\n  \"Georgia on my Mind\" presents a mystical vision of an unnamed New Zealand or Georgian soldier gazing at a red cross, a symbol which is both subjective, ambiguous and yet extremely powerful.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Limited Edition Print</strong></a></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality called hahnemuhle photo rag 308gsm.

Judge Tony Clarke described the surreal oil portrait as a mysterious piece that he \"just kept coming back to again and again.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"The Deconstruction of Harriet\" is a surreal portrait of Sofia's mother who's first name is Ruth and middle name is Harriet. Before the artist was born, her parents and two older sisters lived in the Philippines for two years and they had a naughty pet monkey called Cocoa, pictured on Harriet's shoulder. \r\n  \r\n  In this life Harriet has been a life-giver and caregiver and is the voice of rigorous practically and action while Sofia is more of a dreamer and one to listen to her heart.  </p>\r\n<p>In this painting Sofia contemplates Harriet's sacredness, existence and although her mother might not realise it - the absolute beauty and innocence of her soul.  The artist also felt pain during the painting of this piece while considering the separateness and potential non-existence of her mother.  This painting is infused with Sofia's love, confusion, loss and wonder. It is a very powerful and mysterious piece for the artist.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Limited Edition Print</strong></a></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality called hahnemuhle photo rag 308gsm.

In Maori legend, the South Island fiords were created not by rivers of ice, but by Tu Te Raki Whanoa, a godly figure who came wielding a magical adze and uttering incantations. Milford Sound, known in Maori as Piopiotahi, is without a doubt his finest sculpture.</p>\r\n<p>The name “Piopiotahi” comes from a myth about Maui-tikitiki-a-Taranga, the great Polynesian demi-god. It begins with the final and most daring venture of Maui - an attempt to win immortality for mankind. Had courageous Maui not tamed the sun? Had he not fished up the North Island of Aotearoa? Could he not also overcome the night of death?  </p>\r\n<p>The now extinct Piopio (New Zealand thrush), which is the bird pictured in this painting, is said to have accompanied Maui from Hawaiki. To accomplish his aim of eternal life, Maui was to enter the womb of Hinenui-te-Po (the goddess of death), travel through her body and emerge from her mouth. If he succeeded, death would never have dominion over humans. Maui set out to the place where the goddess lay. Finding her slumbering, Maui demanded silence from the Piopio and the other birds of the forest that were present to witness his remarkable endeavour. But when Maui’s head entered Hinenui-te-Po’s gigantic opening, the sight was so absurd that the Piwakawaka (fantail) burst into a shrill twitter of laughter that awakened the goddess of death. She brought her huge thighs together in a thunderous crash. Maui died without gaining the treasure of immortality for mankind.\r\n  \r\n  The sorrowful Piopio who saw the tragedy, fled south to Milford Sound to mourn for the death of its mate. The Maori name for Milford Sound is therefore “Piopiotahi”, which means \"the single thrush\".</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Limited Edition Print</strong></a></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality called hahnemuhle photo rag 308gsm.

Not long into their conversation, the pair discovered that they were in fact quite closely related. This new member of the whanau (family) had an impressive knowledge about Sofia's whakapapa (genealogy) and about her great-grandmother Matire Te Horowai-McGhee’s hometown near Gisborne. The name Whareponga was raised as an example of a contemporary Maori whanau that is actually intricately related to the artist’s own whanau, a piece of information unknown to Sofia until that moment.\r\n  \r\n  The encounter sparked Sofia’s interest about her ancestry, her connection to long-lost living relatives and her affiliation with the Ngati Porou land on the east coast of New Zealand’s North Island. \r\n  \r\nThis artwork presents a curious little scene where a sense of questioning and anticipation reflects Sofia’s feelings about her own journey.

In this work, \"Her Angel\" referred to in the title takes different forms. Angels inspired by the christian tradition, but depicted with moth wings and elongated bodies, are seen flying in the background. A carved manaia figure occupies the foreground. In Maori carving manaia can be seen with a bird's head and a serpent's tail. Their three fingers of birth, life and death represent the inevitable mortality of mankind. Manaia are said to be the messengers between the earthly world of mortals and the domain of the spirits. Sofia's interpretation of this is that in essence, manaia are angels, and this painting provides a place of convergence for different cultural representations of the next world and its messengers.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality called hahnemuhle photo rag 308gsm.

It shows that her painting direction is always evolving and remaining fresh with an element of experimentation.\r\n \r\nPerhaps presenting a dreamscape, the artist’s simple, powerful, delicate vision lives now on canvas. The soft, eerie brushwork offers an evocative way into another realm, free from our confines of space and time.\r\n\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">\r\n<!--\r\n.SofiaMinson {\r\n\tcolor: #bfbfbf;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n</style>\r\n<em class=\"SofiaMinson\">Sofia Minson Oil Paintings | New Zealand Artwork</em>","options":[{"id":13023232,"name":"Limited Edition Print 197x400mm - $410","price":410.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":18.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":40.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38140580/-/emeraldshor.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38140580/-/emeraldshor.jpeg","width":600,"height":298}],"artists":[{"id":67962,"name":"Sofia Minson","permalink":"sofia-minson","url":"/artist/sofia-minson"}],"categories":[{"id":2154712,"name":"Landscapes","permalink":"landscapes","url":"/category/landscapes"}]},{"id":3904588,"name":"He Kakano Ahau","permalink":"he-kakano-ahau","position":118,"price":550.0,"default_price":550.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/he-kakano-ahau","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-06-11T15:24:51.000Z","description":"<p><strong>Original painting Sold, 700 x 1300mm, oil on canvas, 2008</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited edition print</a> available - scroll down and click 'add to cart'</strong></p> \r\n<p>He Kakano Ahau can be literally translated as 'I am a Seed' and is derived from the complete ancient proverb...</p>\r\n<p>&quot;He kakano ahau, ruia mai i Rangiatea&quot; </p>\r\n<p>&quot;I am a seed, scattered from Rangiatea&quot; </p>\r\n<p>Rangiatea or Raeatea is the name given to a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean known as the Society Group. Like Hawaiiki, Rangiatea is considered an ancient maori homeland from whence the original canoes voyaged to New Zealand centuries ago. \r\n  \r\n  Rangi means 'sky' and atea means 'clear' or 'space'. Rangiatea therefore describes the world that opened up in the creation myth after the separation of Ranginui (Sky Father) and Papatuanuku (Earth Mother).  </p>\r\n<p>The painting shows a mystical landscape encompassed by the forces of the divine parents Rangi and Papa, with bird and plant life in between. Two extinct huia birds are perched in the foreground alongside a stylized kaka beak flower and dangling red karaka berries.\r\n  \r\n  \"He Kakano Ahau\" expresses the enduring connections people have with their homelands, their past and their ancestors. We are all intricately shaped by history and our heritage, whether we're conscious of it or not, and this concept is quite humbling, hence the title 'I am a Seed'.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

There wasn’t even a whisper to be heard of the conflict to come. \r\n\r\nTbilisi presented an enchanting contrast of old and new. The old city, with its derelict buildings and fortress on the hill, nestled itself comfortably next to the plush modern architecture of the new city. Rituals and spirituality were abundant in the Orthodox Christian churches scattered everywhere throughout Tbilisi, even in and around highly commercial areas. The cities predominantly well-off youth came across relaxed, fashionable and concerned with being part of a Western social ideal. Whereas the older generation had an air about them, which seemed to suggest they had not so quickly forgotten their region’s history, the might of Russia and their only relatively new found independence. \r\n\r\nOn the eve of Georgian Independence Day, the Army, Navy and Air Force flooded the main street of Tbilisi in their thousands to practice for the following day’s parade. Sofia was there to watch the spectacle of marching military personnel, weapons and tanks, to photograph them, and during break times to casually meet and talk with some of the men involved. \r\n\r\nThe subject of this portrait was one such man - a young, charismatic, kind-eyed Air Force Officer. His warmth, confidence and smile shone through the gatherings of uniform-clad men. He eagerly encouraged the taking of some photographs, not posing artificially but presenting himself contentedly as he was. Although language was a barrier, Sofia experienced an ease and purity of communication with him that belied culture or nationality. Sofia wonders whether he was subsequently deployed during the weeks of violence between Georgian and Russian troops and what he might have been through. At the time his photograph was taken his name was neither asked for nor given. In completing his portrait however, perhaps a fitting name for him is “Son of Tbilisi”.\r\n\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">\r\n<!--\r\n.SofiaMinson {\r\n\tcolor: #bfbfbf;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n</style>\r\n<em class=\"SofiaMinson\">Sofia Minson Oil Paintings | New Zealand Artwork</em>","options":[{"id":13027940,"name":"Limited Edition Print 400x400mm","price":680.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12946820,"name":"Original Oil Painting 1300x1300mm","price":14000.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":18.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":40.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37882790/-/sonoftbilisi.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37882790/-/sonoftbilisi.jpeg","width":598,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":67962,"name":"Sofia Minson","permalink":"sofia-minson","url":"/artist/sofia-minson"}],"categories":[{"id":2154710,"name":"Portraits","permalink":"portraits","url":"/category/portraits"}]},{"id":3886112,"name":"Fishhook of Maui","permalink":"fishhook-of-maui","position":122,"price":680.0,"default_price":680.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fishhook-of-maui","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-06-08T16:27:05.000Z","description":"<table width=\"351\" border=\"1\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td colspan=\"2\"><h4>Original Oil Painting Sold</h4></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width=\"68\">Size:</td>\r\n    <td width=\"267\">300mm high x 300mm wide</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Medium:</td>\r\n    <td>Oil on canvas</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Date:</td>\r\n    <td>2009</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n<table width=\"351\" border=\"1\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td colspan=\"2\"><h4><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print  - $680</a></h4><strong>To order a print scroll down <br>\r\nSelect <em>Limited Edition Print</em><br>\r\nClick <em>Add to Cart</em> </strong></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td colspan=\"2\"><div>\r\n      <div><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality called hahnemuhle photo rag 308gsm.

In the dark, confined area between them, 70 divine sons were born. The strongest, Tanemahuta, along with many of his brothers yearned for more air, space and light in which to live. Tradition tells that in planting his head on the earth and thrusting his feet against the sky, Tane succeeded in separating his parents.\r\n \r\nThis work shows a surreal landscape of riverstones as far as the eye can see. Emerging from crevices in the stones, a stylized kaka beak flower trumpets with the vibrant redness of life and karaka berries dangle from the delicate branches. Papatuanuku’s nude form lies within the rocks that bathe in the caressing glow of Ranginui. The divine mother and father’s love is enduring. Their connection is just expressed in more subtle ways since the great separation.\r\n\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">\r\n<!--\r\n.SofiaMinson {\r\n\tcolor: #bfbfbf;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n</style>\r\n<em class=\"SofiaMinson\">Sofia Minson Oil Painting | New Zealand Artwork</em>","options":[{"id":13025242,"name":"Limited Edition Print 300x300mm - $370","price":370.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":18.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":40.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38147860/-/A-World-Between.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38147860/-/A-World-Between.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":67962,"name":"Sofia Minson","permalink":"sofia-minson","url":"/artist/sofia-minson"}],"categories":[{"id":2154712,"name":"Landscapes","permalink":"landscapes","url":"/category/landscapes"}]},{"id":3890440,"name":"I'll Meet You There","permalink":"i-ll-meet-you-there","position":124,"price":950.0,"default_price":950.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/i-ll-meet-you-there","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-06-09T05:07:09.000Z","description":"<table width=\"351\" border=\"1\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td colspan=\"2\"><h4>Original Oil Painting - $950</h4></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width=\"68\">Size:</td>\r\n    <td width=\"267\">300mm high x 300mm wide</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Medium:</td>\r\n    <td>Oil on Belgian portrait linen</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Date:</td>\r\n    <td>2009</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n<table width=\"351\" border=\"1\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td colspan=\"2\"><h4><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print  - $350</a></h4> <strong>To order a print scroll down <br>\r\nSelect <em>Limited Edition Print</em><br>\r\nClick <em>Add to Cart</em> </strong></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td colspan=\"2\"><div>\r\n      <div><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality called hahnemuhle photo rag 308gsm.

The right arm is always directed heavenward, to Ranginui (sky father), ready to receive God's beneficence. The left hand, upon which their eyes are fastened, is turned toward the earth.

It began in July 2008 when she returned to New Zealand from several months in the Middle East, where she was exposed to diverse cultures, religions and worldviews. \r\n\r\nWithout pre-planning the work she first took to the canvas with a solid layer of red paint, applying the colour with rhythmic, meditative strokes throughout the night. Then, having just listened to the audiobook of Eckhart Tolle's 'The Power of Now' she began an out-pouring of a stream of consciousness text on canvas. This is the noise of the mind that Eckhart talks about, the ramblings of our thoughts, which are most often left unchecked. The portrait is the unconscious self, inundated with images, words and broken ideas. The enlarged eye symbolizes our ability to observe or listen to the expected noise of the mind and thereby become extremely present, awaiting its arrival. In 'watching' or 'waiting' one actually creates space and connects to a higher level of consciousness. The ray of light illuminating the clear, open eye depicts this ascension into the 'now' and this heightened state of awareness.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75  prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

Kotuku is the name of the bird keeping guardianship in the foreground of this painting and also gliding above the mountainous male and female forms. Also known as the Great White Heron, the Kotuku is a rare migratory bird in Aotearoa. Admired for its angelic beauty, the bird flaps its wings slowly and purposefully as it takes flight.\r\n  \r\n  The feathers of Kotuku, like Huia, were highly prized by Maori and were used to adorn the heads of chiefs. The most telling compliment is to liken someone to a Kotuku as it symbolizes everything rare and beautiful. It is said that Kotuku are inhabitants of the nether world, the spirit land of Reinga.  </p>\r\n<p>In this otherworldly scene, the three Kotuku become angels watching the female form enveloping the male form underneath. To the artist this has little to do with human gender, but rather masculine and feminine emotional/energy polarities. \r\n  \r\n  \"The masculine is sovereignty, the crown upon your soul. Femininity is humility and unconditional love, the heart within the breast of your soul and together they make the whole soul essence.\"\r\n  - St. Germain  </p>\r\n<p>To gift, to allow, to give up, the word Tuku has very feminine qualities. In essence Tuku means to surrender. In the ultimate experience of unconditional love or enlightenment there is a surrendering that occurs, a letting go of the ego. One must become entirely female in the face of God.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Limited Edition Print</strong></a></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

Maori legend tells that this rhythmic oscillation is the effect of a monster’s slow, steady heartbeat from the depths. The lake was formed when an evil giant was set on fire by a daring youth. The resulting heat melted the snow and ice of surrounding mountains, which then filled the long double-dogleg-shaped hollow. The lake’s name, according to this myth, should actually be “Waka-tipua”, which translates as \"hollow of the giant\". </p>\r\n<p>For this painting Sofia imagined the burning giant sinking to the bottom of the lake and the once bubbling, boiling water beginning to calm.

When out fishing one day, Kupe ordered his cousin Hoturapa to dive down and free the tangled fishing line. Kupe then cut the anchor rope from the waka (canoe) and rowed furiously back to shore, leaving his cousin to drown. By killing Hoturapa, Kupe had planned to take his wife. However the circumstances surrounding his death at sea caused Hoturapa’s family to be suspicious of Kupe. To escape vengeance, Kupe and his family left Hawaiiki in the waka called Matahorua and embarked on the infamous journey to Aotearoa.\r\n  \r\n  When Kupe and his crew sailed along the coast of the newly discovered land they mistakenly disturbed a giant octopus. A battle ensued between the powerful, enraged sea monster and the unassuming waka but due to Kupe’s ingenuity they managed to defeat their formidable opponent.  </p>\r\n<p>The water spouts, the wind and the flight of the native birds in this painting are intended to evoke an unsettled energy that mirrors that of the voyage. The Kotuku (White Heron), which is symbolic of peace and good fortune in Maori culture, as well as the stillness of the solitary waka suggest the overcoming of obstacles, the calm after the storm and the final reaching of a destination.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75  prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

They are depicted in this painting as the grey panels above and below respectively, leaving just a slither of black space in between. \r\n  \r\n  This central dark band describes the confined environment between Rangi and Papa in which their 70 divine sons were born. </p>\r\n<p>In the middle of the work is a manaia bone carving symbolizing their strongest child - Tanemahuta. \r\n  \r\n  The manaia is an ancient mythical being with a bird’s head and a human form. It is said to be the messenger between the earthly world of mortals and the domain of the spirits. The original meaning behind the manaia has been the subject of much controversy. As well as being ascribed the attributes of a bird-headed man, it has also been interpreted as a snake, a raft, a seahorse and a lizard.  </p>\r\n<p>In some accounts of the creation myth, the children of Rangi and Papa had to “crawl about like lizards” and others were forced to lie on their sides because there was so little room between their parent’s embrace.\r\n  \r\n  Tanemahuta, along with many of his brothers yearned for more air, space and light in which to live. Legend holds that in planting his head on the earth and thrusting his feet against the sky, Tane eventually succeeded in separating his mother and father.  </p>\r\n<p>Once liberated, the children of Ranginui and Papatuanuku became the various gods of Aotearoa who now govern the forests, sea, wind and other natural forces.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75  prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

There is a quiet yet burgeoning energy about the painting that also signalls our inherent potential  for growth. We are all intricately shaped by our history and  heritage, whether we're conscious of it or not, which is a humbling truth.</p>\r\n<p>He kākano (meaning &quot;seed&quot;) conveys growth, development, and expansion. Even before a seed is planted or nourished, it has inherent promise — the capability to take root, develop and grow. A person, like a seed, is inextricably linked to generations who have gone and are yet to come. He kākano comes from somewhere, it belongs to someone or something, and it cannot be isolated or detached from those connections. It has both history and potential.</p>\r\n<p>Ruia means to plant, to sow, or to establish a foundation from which to develop. Ruia earths the seed – he kākano – so that it can be nourished with time and energy. Ruia is the link between potential and realisation. It sets the direction for development, travelling forward to Rangiātea and from it as well. Rangiātea is the start and finish, depicting the cyclical nature of growth and development.</p>\r\n<p>Rangiātea represents the wider world, it is a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean also known as Raeatea or the Society Group. Like Hawaiiki, Rangiātea is considered an ancient Māori homeland from whence the original canoes voyaged to New Zealand centuries ago. Rangi means 'sky' and atea means 'clear' or 'space'. Rangiātea therefore also describes the world that opened up in the creation myth after the separation of Ranginui (Sky Father) and Papatuanuku (Earth Mother). Rangiātea marks the start and the end of the journey of potential – he kākano – as well as arrival at the point of opportunity to realise it – ruia.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75  prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

Kaitiakitanga is the exercise by humans of stewardship and protection of the vital life force (mauri) of all entities animate and inanimate within the whakapapa. Maori accumulated extensive and intensive knowledge of every aspect of the natural world and the interrelationship of this natural world to them. From this information they established a system of prohibitions that governs every aspect of the protection, management, use and extraction of all natural resources. This system provides the essential matrix for resource management and resource sustainability.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75  prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

He had a rough childhood, which he has compared to the 1994 Once Were Warriors film. &nbsp;Walker’s parents were drug dealers and have both spent time in jail, he got involved in drugs and thieving himself and was sexually abused by a relative. After several violent episodes his family moved to Queensland and being inspired by his passion for music and church, Walker went on to win Australian Idol in 2009. &nbsp;Since then his music career has gone from strength to strength with number one hit singles and three albums under his belt. &nbsp;<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nMinson is a fan “I admire his resilience, spirit and voice, plus I feel a sense of pride that he’s a talented Maori making a success of himself on the international stage.” Minson says she is “interested in painting creative and inspiring Maori people who are helping to evolve today's culture through their own art forms or roles in society.” <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince 19th century New Zealand artists such as Lindauer and Goldie, there has been a surprising lack in the tradition of Maori oil portraiture.

Sofia has a particular affinity with Ohope Beach in the Bay of Plenty as she has family connections there and visits the beach frequently. The rest of the piece is painted with softly blended oils.\r\n \r\nThe work describes a layering of earth and sky, symbolically referring to the Maori legend of Papatuanuku (Mother Earth) and Ranginui (Sky Father). The river stones and the bands of sand represent the earth of Papa. Rangi is the grey sky above, casting his glow on the rocks. As the two intertwined koru (spirals) suggest, Papa and Rangi once clung together in a close, loving embrace. The myth of Rangi and Papa describes the creation of Aotearoa and of the world, through their eventual separation by their divine children that were born between them. This work also represents creation and evolution, inspired by the ancient myth of the two lovers.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

Manaia can be seen in traditional Maori carving with a bird’s head and a serpent's tail.

Eagles are impressive predators wherever they are found throughout the world – but this one must have been awesome. Its wing span was three metres. Its talons, as big as tiger’s claws, could penetrate a moa’s pelvis bone. &nbsp;Haast's eagle preyed on all large New Zealand birds – kereru, ducks, swans, geese, rails, and all moa. &nbsp;They were only in the South Island (where their bones have been found at more than 50 sites). &nbsp;&nbsp;and like most predators at the top of the food pyramid, they were probably never numerous.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nCave drawings confirm people’s knowledge of the eagle. Tools made of eagle bone add to the picture. One or two traditional Maori stories too, suggest an enduring folk memory of such a bird. The Haast's Eagle became extinct c. 1400 A.D. when its major food sources, the moa, were hunted to extinction by Maori living on the island and much of its dense-forest habitat was cleared. In some Māori legends, Pouakai kill humans, which scientists believe could have been possible, given the massive size and strength of the bird.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>This painting was part of Minson's <strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/parnell-gallery-exhibition\">2012 solo exhibition at Parnell Gallery</a></strong>.

Sofia being an Aucklander sees this view nearly every day and finds herself enchanted by the ancient volcanic island of Rangitoto lying dormant in Auckland's busy Hauraki Gulf. It alludes to another time and place, without yachts, ferries, speed boats and people. The contradiction of old and new inspired the artist to depict the familiar seascape in a dreamlike and primordial way. There is no hint of human habitation and the native birds and plants reign. A tui shares the viewers' gaze toward the horizon and two soaring albatross. Tiny red karaka berries dangle from an unusual fern plant, which also sprouts off into yellow kowhai flowers and a large red kaka beak flower.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75  prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality.

Rangi is depicted in this work as the grey sky above and Papa is signified in the river stones below. \r\n  \r\n  The central dark band describes the confined realm between Rangi and Papa in which their divine children were born. The white koru symbolizes the strongest son - Tanemahuta. \r\n  \r\n  He, along with many of his brothers yearned for more air, space and light in which to live.

The cigarette with its long ash and Lord of the Rings type tower stands tall in a deserted flat landscape. The flakes of ash and the base of the cigarette house finely detailed pieces of Gothic architecture. \r\n  \r\n  Is this what we are building for ourselves?\r\n  \r\n  Sofia has always had an interest in architecture as well as in fantasy/science fiction movies and books. The message of this artwork is debatable and the question \"is this what we are building for oursleves?\" could take you on a long journey of ideas. \r\n  \r\n  Regarding the cigarette, it has to be said that Sofia has herself enjoyed the occasional smoke although she knows of the potential fatal consequences. She also fondly remembers making 'long ashes' with her friends when they first experimented with smoking. There is no intentional moral or ethical judgment being passed by the artist on the smoking habit. Particularly with this work, hearing other people's reactions to the painting has been a very interesting part of the process for Sofia.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Limited Edition Print</strong></a></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality called hahnemuhle photo rag 308gsm.

Minson’s voice is not static but has been continually developing over the last eight years of her career as a full-time artist. &nbsp;The purpose of this work is to investigate a new, sharp, raw energy, which can potentially inform her contemporary Maori portrait series in the future. &nbsp;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince 19th century New Zealand artists such as Lindauer and Goldie, there has been a surprising lack in the tradition of Maori oil portraiture. While Minson is inspired by their works, she says her <strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/contemporary-maori-portrait-series\" target=\"_blank\">contemporary Maori portraits</a></strong> “are far from Goldie’s recordings of a vanishing race” and are intended to fill an important niche for her generation. &nbsp;As a Maori artist of mixed heritage (Ngati Porou, Swedish and Irish) she is interested in showcasing contemporary Maori as a vibrant and evolving people.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>This painting is part of Minson's <strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/parnell-gallery-exhibition\">4-18 September 2012 exhibition of new works at Parnell Gallery</a></strong>.

On the experience Sofia says: &quot;I had an incredible, quite surreal day painting outside in a huge, disused quarry, which had a beautiful lake abundant with water lilies. It was so energising that with pre-prepared background colours I broke my own record by painting three works in one day.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&quot;In-between worlds&quot; is an oil study of the surface of the lake and its water lilies. We see only a reflection in this painting. Just as in life, we find ourselves in an in-between space that hides hidden worlds below and only hints at what is above. </p>\r\n<p>Minson describes the painting process: &quot;Bees buzzed around my head and the sun tried to beat down on me as I took cover under the trees with my paints and canvases. The lake brought up notions of reflection, surface and hidden-depths and the Waitakaruru Arboretum and Sculpture Park began to take on a new meaning. For me, driving 2 hours from Auckland to be there, the park was acting like a gateway or a catalyst for getting back to nature, offering a space of inspiration and connection in my fast-paced, digital lifestyle and reminding me of our dual spiritual and physical nature. The park was designed by human minds but it is essentially an in-between space, a space somewhere between man-made and natural, between the physical and spiritual. I used a more textured &quot;painterly' technique with generous quantities of oil paint on each brush stroke, which made this piece fast and spontaneous.&quot;</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newzealandartwork.com/limited-edition-prints\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Edition Print</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Limited edition of 75 signed prints available on matte paper of museum archival quality called hahnemuhle photo rag 308gsm.
