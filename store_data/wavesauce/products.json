Five bands... ten songs...that preserve a moment in time, the summer of 2012, when instrumental surf music rode the crest of a wave in Portland, OR. Musicians are forming surf bands, several venues are giving these bands a stage and an audience is growing. Duff's Garage, the club that always gave instro surf a home, is ground zero. There's an excitement about the bands and the music. Many different directions are being explored by these bands, proving that a subgenre thought by many to be one-dimensional is anything but. \r\n\r\nThe Surf Weasels, WaveSauce, Susan SurfTone, The Outer Space Heaters, and Shade 13 offer you a sample of what's going on here on the northern end of the west coast. We hope you enjoy it and that you come to a few shows. Tell your friends \"there's a party going on here in Portland that you should know about\"... come and join us.\r\n\r\nYou can also download songs at CD Baby: http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/pdxagogo","options":[{"id":50033349,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128950392/-/wspdxagogoCover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128950392/-/wspdxagogoCover.jpg","width":253,"height":249}],"artists":[{"id":256860,"name":"WaveSauce","permalink":"wavesauce","url":"/artist/wavesauce"},{"id":256863,"name":"Various Artists","permalink":"various-artists","url":"/artist/various-artists"}],"categories":[{"id":6841392,"name":"Albums","permalink":"albums","url":"/category/albums"}]}]
