No, I won't stand on a street corner with an A-board and flyers yelling at people for you, we can do better than that!\r\n\r\nI take the raw ingredients of your business, ethos and aspirations and distill that down in to a magical elixir that has clarity and strength.\r\n\r\nI'll tailor a package to the help that you need, get in touch to let me know about your project. I especially love working with independent start-ups but will consider all projects. If I don't feel we're a good fit, I'll tell you rather than work half-heartedly.\r\n\r\nI'll start by curating the details (ingredients) that you give to me, distill them down and create something with clarity and strength. I can work my magic on:\r\n- identifying ways to improve and grow\r\n- defining who you are and what you do\r\n- providing you with a visual narrative that can include: logos & taglines, business cards and letterheads (and any other stationery you may like), packaging, blog headers, social media and networking graphics (profile/header/cover images etc), e-shop banners, print collateral.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The £75 is a retainer (credited against your order) that gets you pencilled in to my diary. Know you want to pool your inner genius with mine and distill some magic and want to be sure that I can fit you in? Book that slot now!

I will create a stationery package that is personal to you and curates your times together, your personalities and the whole feel of your event.\r\n\r\nVarious packages available. I'm working on a set price plan but in the meantime get in touch to let me know about your celebration to see if we are a good fit. Alternatively, if you are on a budget you could get on over to The Print Room for existing stationery, all our cards are left blank so that they can be used for any occasion. \r\n\r\nThe price below is a retainer (credited against your order) that gets you pencilled in to my diary.
