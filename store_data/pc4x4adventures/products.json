The excitement in their eyes, even when we're setting up the Chrissy lights on the roof, is just awesome. \r\n\r\nThe MR4X4 shop always fires right into gear around Christmas too, and it gives me great joy to know that people value our magazines, DVDs and books enough to want to give them to loved ones at Christmas. \r\n\r\nAnd in a breakthrough for us this year, our brand new Season 6 DVD Boxed Set will be available for Christmas. And if you pick up this product before XMAS, you'll be the very first to see the entire season of the show, because at least three of the episodes won't have aired yet! Plus, our Season 6 boxed set has a whole host of extra footage. The Gunbarrel Highway episode alone has around 20 minutes of extra stories, that we just couldn't fit into the TV cut. Other episodes also feature some great extra stories, and, every episode also features a wonderful slideshow, shot by our professional stills photographers. \r\n\r\nWe've bolted this great new product to our magazine for a one week special. If you purchase this Season 6 DVD boxed set for $59.95, for just $10 extra we'll throw in a one year subscription to Pat Callinan's 4X4 Adventures magazine. It's a cracker of a deal, and will hopefully make your Christmas something special. \r\n\r\nFrom my family, and the MR4X4 crew, I hope you have a wonderful Christmas and that Santa makes all of your 4X4 touring dreams come true. \r\n\r\nKeep the shiny side up!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nPat\r\n\r\nThis deal comes with EXPRESS Postage of $14.95 but due to Christmas Postage delays we cannot guarantee delivery for December 25th.\r\nOffer closes December 24th.","options":[{"id":50685966,"name":"Default","price":69.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":14.95,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":40.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129561714/-/season6_sub.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129561714/-/season6_sub.jpg","width":1729,"height":1213},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129448785/-/Season_6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129448785/-/Season_6.jpg","width":1542,"height":2215}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2345893,"name":"Subscription Offers","permalink":"subscription-offers","url":"/category/subscription-offers"},{"id":2098890,"name":"Season DVD Boxed sets","permalink":"season-dvd-boxed-sets","url":"/category/season-dvd-boxed-sets"},{"id":3939462,"name":"Featured Products","permalink":"featured-products","url":"/category/featured-products"}]},{"id":15337536,"name":"THE $20 HEMA 4WD ADVENTURES SUBSCRIPTION OFFER","permalink":"20-hema-4wd-adventures-subscription-deal-only-for-48-hours","position":2,"price":67.8,"default_price":67.8,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/20-hema-4wd-adventures-subscription-deal-only-for-48-hours","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-12-04T23:30:22.000Z","description":"THE $20 HEMA 4WD ADVENTURES SUBSCRIPTION OFFER.\r\n\r\nWhen you purchase a one-year subscription to Pat Callinan’s 4X4 Adventures for $47.80, Australia’s highest quality 4X4 magazine, you will receive the Hema 4WD Adventures book for only $20.
