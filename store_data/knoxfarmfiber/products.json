Who doesn't?\r\n\r\nHere is a skein of 100% wool yarn spun from one of my friend Howard's Border Leicester sheep. I have spun it differently from my other yarn so that rather than swirling colors, there is a heathery - tweedy - look to the colors.\r\n\r\nAnd what colors: denim blue, ruby red tapering to rose, a touch of leaf green and grey that will go perfectly with denim.\r\n\r\nDyed only with Greener Shades environmental dye.\r\n\r\nThe yarn is thinner than my usual--more of a worsted weight-- and probably should be knit with a size 7 or size 8 needle.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 skeins of 80 yards, each priced at $16.\r\n\r\nThis yarn should wet-felt with no problems.\r\n\r\nThanks from all of us at KnoxFarmFiber.\r\n","options":[{"id":5036131,"name":"Skein 1","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/12966701/-/denim.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/12966701/-/denim.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":1406491,"name":"Handspun Wool Yarn--Norma","permalink":"handspun-wool-yarn-norma","position":2,"price":30.0,"default_price":30.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/handspun-wool-yarn-norma","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-01-30T06:17:31.000Z","description":"Jelly-bean-green swirls with grape in this new yarn from our sheep Norma.\r\n\r\nThese are Spring colors but not pale or subtle--they are bold and can stand up to anybody's weather watch!\r\n\r\nThe yarn is 100% wool that is handspun, hand dyed, single ply, bulky and full of energy.\r\nYou'll be able to knit a cowl or scarf, some fingerless gloves or mitts that will liven your wardrobe and keep you warm at the same time.\r\n\r\nI would use at least a size 10 needle for knitting, but even larger may work better.
