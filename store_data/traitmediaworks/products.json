Here's what Mr. Blake Edwards of Vertonen/CIP sez:\r\nI first heard Lunde’s work in perhaps 1991; I was a DJ at KUCR at the University of California, doing a program that danced between punk and experimental music. I had heard of Hands To, and when I saw the Hands To / Eric Lunde split in the new bin, I gave it a whirl. As others have rightfully said before, when Lunde’s voice comes in--\"your unguarded breath\" it was a moment of commanding, spine tingling confusion. His work reminds me of Z'EV's uns project in how he permutates language and utilizes his \"reduplicative strategies\" to simultaneously bury and uncover audio. This disc is, for these ears, \"classic\" Lunde; tape cassette manipulation, modulation, and endless reduplications and permutations. If you like Lunde, this will be a welcome chapter in his ongoing audio explorations. If you aren't familiar with Lunde, I'd say imagine audio that has spices of Chop Shop, EVP, and John Duncan mixed into a batter of barren lands and be prepared to go on a rather unusual, and unequivocally individual, journey.\r\nThis is just the CD.

Woods (\"A Piece of Monologue\"), Bryce Beverlin ll (\"Cascando\"),  and Eric Lunde (\"That Time\").\r\nwhat does Vital Weekly say?\r\nOf course you should read the complete entry on Wikipedia on Samuel Beckett, but I quote the beginning: “Samuel Barclay Beckett (13 April 1906 – 22 December 1989) was an Irish avant-garde writer, dramatist and poet, writing in English and French. Beckett’s work offers a bleak outlook on human culture and both formally and philosophically became increasingly minimalist in his later career.” I must admit I never read much of his work, but here’s three artists who probably read lots of Beckett. Its the for me unknown Bryce Beverlin II, the well-known Eric Lunde and Peter J. Woods, whose LP was reviewed here two week ago. Each has a long piece inspired by the dramas written by Beckett. In Wood’s piece things start with talking for quite some time, and after a while injected by loud bursts of noise, which towards the end get longer and longer. The text is not always clear to hear. Lunde used three cassette players for his piece, which has Lunde stamped all over it. Largely, or more accurate, all spoken word in Lunde’s clear voice, but with treatments made with his cassettes, eroding the speech effectively. Occasional silence separates the various texts. Extremely loud is the keyword for the final piece, by Bryce Beverlin II, who also speaks his text in the middle of a noise racket of distortion and feedback, also with occasional silence. Its the least convincing piece in my opinion, but it takes minimalism probably to another level. Quite an interesting release, which prompts the listener to listen, but probably also to read more, which is always good, I think.

This would be their/his story told through 3 different Erics. Vital Weekly says:\r\n\"Its perhaps also not a book to read back to back. Its a novel about about an obscure industrial band being filmed for a documentary. But the singer is dead and the band re-enacted by others, and then becomes popular than the original. Maybe its about the fact that noise music is now more popular than it was when Lunde started, in the early 80s. The book tells the story in a rather abstract way, cut along with drawings from the story board and thoughts about what noise is. In some ways its probably a not very accurate autobiography, but no doubt it carries a lot of personal memories from Lunde from the old days. A funny read, especially if that 'old' noise scene is part of your own experience. To listen to the 'soundtrack' (not my parentheses) at the same time is not easy, as it contains a lot of spoken word pieces (from the book?), and bits of audio. The whole package, book and CD, however is unmistakably 'noisy': a bombardment of text and sound, both in print and on the CD, creating a beautiful and disturbed image.

Even with the atmopheric and dark moment, sound is extremely decayed and coarse sound of tape loops, manipulation and electronics which transforms it to difficult industrial-noise. Years after the original release, personnel behind it has been officially declassified.
