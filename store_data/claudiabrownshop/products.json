In 2004, she released her hand-sewn applique pillow, which is now owned by ChloÃ« Sevigny--photos were featured in <i>House and Garden</i> in 2006.  The demand for the Morrissey pillow was high, but production too labor intensive. This silkscreened version is the simpler, more affordable cousin of the original.\r\n\r\nClaudia made this pillow as an homage to her favorite musician.  She says: \"He lived in my head and my room through my entire adolescence...no one captures the banality of ordinary life more poetically than Morrissey.\"  \r\n\r\nNatural canvas zippered case, 16 x 16 inches. (40.64 x 40.64 cm) Silkscreened with matte black ink. Poly fill insert.  100% Made in the USA.\r\n\r\nPre-order now.
