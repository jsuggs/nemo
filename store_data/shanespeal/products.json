But it's not a \"scenario.\" This is the real deal. Speal was living in the middle of a Pennsylvania trailer park. He plays a cigar box guitar. And he recorded this album on a simple 4-track cassette recorder. Stealing the Fire features stark homemade recordings of Speal performing the works of Timothy Renner on a primitive cigar box guitar. It was a simple premise in the beginning. Speal just wanted to know what Renner's dark folk music would sound like if were soaked in Delta blues. Speal covers Renner's work from Stone Breath, Spectral Light & Moonshine Firefly Jamboree & solo recordings. \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":50198202,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":8.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129079956/-/stf1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129079956/-/stf1.jpg","width":300,"height":258}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":338039,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":13201773,"name":"HANDMADE NECKLACE BY SHANE SPEAL - \"MICKEY 3\"","permalink":"handmade-necklace-by-shane-speal-mickey-3","position":25,"price":9.0,"default_price":9.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/handmade-necklace-by-shane-speal-mickey-3","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-27T16:25:32.000Z","description":"Handmade beer cap necklace by Shane Speal.

Musicians and hobbyists are finding new creative freedom by making their own musical instruments out of unconventional materials. In a modern revival of a great American tradition, sliders, pickers, strummers and makers are coming together in what they call the cigar box guitar revolution. An Obsession with Cigar Box Guitars celebrates the modern craft of their irresistibly alluring instruments.\r\n\r\nProfessional photographer and woodworking enthusiast David Sutton first chronicled the modern revival of the cigar box guitar in his best-selling book, Cigar Box Guitars. Now he’s back to share his obsession with these handmade treasures in an amazing photo gallery that profiles 120 inspiring examples of homemade musical greatness. In a testament to human creativity, these guitars range from simple, cardboard diddley bow-type instruments to wooden box electric six-string models that are more impressive than anything you can buy in a store.
