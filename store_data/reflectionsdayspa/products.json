I have had this happen during times of stress all my life. Nothing has actually stopped the blisters from running their course usually 7-10 days. When applied at the first sign of redness and awareness that it's back, it will hold back the swelling 80% and the blisters do not run their course but are stopped immediately and in three days are basically gone. Usually there is another 7 or more days of redness after the blisters are gone. Now there are no signs of it being there after 4 days total! This is short of a miracle! After a lifelong occurrence of this what a blessing to find something that is victorious over this disgusting virus.

It is a foundation, sunscreen and concealer in one product. Formulated with the purest blend of earth minerals Synergie’s loose minerals offer flawless coverage, broad spectrum sun protection and is a true extension of your skin care routine. Your skin will appear luminous with superior lasting cover. The anti-inflammatory properties of zinc oxide makes our loose minerals perfect for acne and irritated skin.\r\nSuitable for all skin types and tones, Synergie minerals provides either a silky sheer veil of cover with a single layer, or a more opaque ‘photo-shoot’ look with several layers. The Kabuki brush ensures even coverage.  A quick spray with Hydrosprtiz and the minerals are set for the day.\r\n\r\nApplication Technique: \r\nAlways apply loose minerals in thin layers.  One light layer will provide an even, fresh look.  Two layers is usually perfect for lasting, all day coverage.  Ensure your Synergie moisturiser has fully absorbed before applying Synergie Minerals Second Skin Crush.\r\n\t1.  Place your minerals on a clean tissue.  Open the jar and tap minerals through the sifter into the empty lid.  Two or three taps should release sufficient minerals for one layer of foundation.\r\n\t2.  Firmly push the kabuki brush into the minerals and rotate the brush a few times to evenly distribute the minerals on the brush.\r\n\t3.  Now turn the brush up (flat base facing down) and tap the base firmly on the bathroom bench 3 times.  This allows the minerals to penetrate the brush so they are not sitting on the top.\r\n\t4.  Polish the minerals into the skin with the kabuki brush, using small, firm, circular buffing motions.   Work minerals into the skin quickly and evenly, without spending too long on one area of the face.  Don’t forget the neck and décolletage!","options":[{"id":23685041,"name":"1.

It should also be balanced to work in synergy with the acid mantle of the skin.\r\nIt is not necessary to incorporate active ingredients or AHAs in cleansers. Creamy ‘tissue-off’ cleansers are not recommended as they leave a residue on the skin surface which may prevent penetration of your active skin care ingredients (such as Vitamin B, C and A).\r\nA cleanser is only in contact with the skin for less than a minute. It is therefore unnecessary to use a cleanser for a particular skin type as they should all perform the same function on all skins.\r\nSynergie rinse-off foaming cleanser is ideal for all skin types. It contains only pure ingredients and is 100% free of sodium laureth sulphate, parabens, artificial fragrance and artificial colours. The invigorating Neroli fragrance is derived from the highest quality pure essential oils and will not irritate sensitive skin.\r\nSynergie Skin Gentle Cleanser is also ideal for removing eye make-up and non waterproof mascara. Furthermore, it is a gel concentrate so it will last twice as long as conventional cleansers.\r\nUse in the morning and at night prior to using your active ingredients. Use only a pea sized amount.","options":[{"id":23790835,"name":"Default","price":69.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73884081/-/GentleCleanse_23.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73884081/-/GentleCleanse_23.jpg","width":90,"height":350}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3813945,"name":"Synergie Skin","permalink":"synergie-skin","url":"/category/synergie-skin"}]},{"id":7528055,"name":"Moisturiser Hydrolock 30g","permalink":"moisturiser-hydrolock-30g","position":76,"price":59.0,"default_price":59.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/moisturiser-hydrolock-30g","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-12T14:49:21.000Z","description":"Human skin is subjected to a multitude of environmental stressors such as UV light, wind, humidity and pollution.

Unlike traditional natural sun protectors, Uberzinc body feels like a luxurious, non-greasy and deeply hydrating hand and body lotion.\r\n \r\nKey ingredients and benefits:\r\n- 21% natural zinc oxide to protect your skin from damaging UVA/B rays. Zinc oxide is a powerful anti inflammatory as well as a UV protector.\r\n- Vitamin D3 to help replenish reduced Vitamin D3 levels that may be depleted from avoiding sun exposure. Synergies’ liquid Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is readily absorbed into the skin and is more bioavailable than powdered forms. According to a recently published medical study, Vitamin D3 helped with skin conditions because due to its anti-inflammatory properties. In the study, vitamin D3 was given to patients with psoriasis. Within 1 month, the condition disappeared. It was then given to patients with lichen planus lesions. Vitamin D3 relieved skin itching and regressed the lesions by half. The researchers then gave Vitamin D3 to those with photodermatitis. The lesions from the disorder disappeared within a month.\r\n- Natural Green tea extract neutralises free radical UV damage. Green tea extract is a skin anti-inflammatory and exhibits an inhibitory action on collagenase (an enzyme that breaks down collagen). Topical application of green tea helps to promote the health and quantity of collagen, thereby maintaining a firm and elastic skin. A recent clinical study has shown that the skin had measurably more elastic tissue content after continuous application of a green tea extract. Green tea extract appears to exert a sun protective effect by quenching free radicals and reducing inflammation induced by UV light. This is why Synergie has added pure green tea to Uberzinc. It is best to combine green tea extract with zinc oxide-based sunscreens because zinc oxide is chemically inert and should not react with green tea extract.\r\n-Australian Lemon Myrtle pure essential oil adds an invigorating twist. Apart from being a wonderful mood lifter, it is one of the most antiseptic, antiviral and antifungal of the Australian essential oils (more powerful than tea tree oil)\r\nApplication:Apply to hands and body prior to UV exposure. Reapply if perspiring excessively or wiping the body. Reapplication at two hourly intervals is advisable in extreme heat or humidity. Zinc oxide provides physical UV protection. Do not rub into the skin excessively. Not recommended as a facial UV moisturiser and UV protector.\r\n","options":[{"id":23790741,"name":"Default","price":49.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73883561/-/UberBody_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73883561/-/UberBody_3.jpg","width":300,"height":123}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3813945,"name":"Synergie Skin","permalink":"synergie-skin","url":"/category/synergie-skin"}]},{"id":7528011,"name":"Natural Brush Cleaner","permalink":"natural-brush-cleaner","position":78,"price":34.0,"default_price":34.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/natural-brush-cleaner","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-12T14:41:04.000Z","description":"100% natural ingredients in a quick dry formula.\r\nSpray into a tissue then pat the brush gentle to remove makeup.\r\n100ml","options":[{"id":23790701,"name":"Default","price":34.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73883401/-/Natural-brush-cleaner.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73883401/-/Natural-brush-cleaner.jpg","width":200,"height":200}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3796319,"name":"Synergie Minerals","permalink":"synergie-minerals","url":"/category/synergie-minerals"}]},{"id":7527995,"name":"B-Juvenate Body Moisturising Treatment","permalink":"b-juvenate-body-moisturising-treatment","position":79,"price":69.0,"default_price":69.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/b-juvenate-body-moisturising-treatment","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-12T14:38:13.000Z","description":"Synergie Skin™ B-Juvenate contains 8% pure Niacinamide in a natural nourishing moisturiser.
