In his contribution to our One Picture Book series, Arnold “curates” a group of photographs his father made of him growing up; in each of the photographs, Arnold is either fishing or showing off his catch. Knowing who the subject of these photographs is, his relationship to the one who made these photographs, and how his passions for photography and fishing would later play out, make “Fishing with My Dad” resonate on many levels.\r\n\r\nWatch a video of the book online <a href=\"http://youtu.be/5bF8FFdP4VQ\">HERE</a>","options":[{"id":15074095,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/45102701/-/108221b.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/45102701/-/108221b.jpeg","width":779,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/45102797/-/CoreyFishing011.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/45102797/-/CoreyFishing011.jpg","width":551,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/45102821/-/CoreyFishing024.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/45102821/-/CoreyFishing024.jpg","width":544,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1687191,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":3890820,"name":"Fish-Work: The Bering Sea (signed copy)","permalink":"fish-work-the-bering-sea-signed-copy-pre-order-ships-approx-sept-2011","position":2,"price":65.0,"default_price":65.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fish-work-the-bering-sea-signed-copy-pre-order-ships-approx-sept-2011","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-06-09T05:58:26.000Z","description":"Chosen as one of the best photo books of the year by PDN and American PHOTO magazines. \r\n\r\nFish-Work: The Bering Sea\r\nPhotographs by Corey Arnold\r\nISBN: 978-1-59005-306-5\r\nHardcover, 15 x 12 inches, 80 pages, 47 four-color plates\r\nPublished by Nazraeli Press 2011\r\n\r\nThe photographs in “Fish-Work: The Bering Sea” capture moments from Arnold’s grueling retreats as a crew member aboard a fishing boat to the Bering Sea. With scenes of boat life so vivid that some shots can induce fear or seasickness, the artist’s perspective also reveals the tender soulfulness of a fisherman’s extended life at sea. His skillful compositions depict the simultaneous bravery, toil, humor and gumption that “fish-work” demands. Yet the series also illuminates the aesthetic sublimity that can only be experienced, ultimately, by those willing to risk their lives where the sea breaks its back. Having survived several seasons afloat these icy and unforgiving waters, we are lucky that Arnold has taken time to document his artistic impressions of this rare lifestyle and extended us a vicarious glimpse. \r\n\r\nA graduate of the Academy of Art in San Francisco, Corey Arnold lives and works in Portland, and now runs a commercial salmon fishing boat in Bristol Bay, Alaska.  His work has been exhibited worldwide.  Recent publications featuring Arnold's work include the Juxtapoz Photo Book, Esquire, The Sunday Telegraph, Rolling Stone, Outside, The Paris Review, and PDN's 30.\r\n\r\n“Fish-Work: The Bering Sea” is published by Nazraeli Press in conjunction with Charles A. Hartman Fine Art. It is printed in an oversized format in a 1st edition, second printing of 1,000 casebound copies.\t\r\n\r\nNOW FREE SHIPPING in the United States\r\nAllow 1-2 weeks. \r\nInternational shipped via U.S. Postal Service First Class Mail\r\nAllow 2-3 weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nWatch a video of the book online <a href=\"http://youtu.be/YGVF53LGLIM\">HERE</a>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"press\"><a href=\"http://blog.coreyfishes.com/2011/01/24/fish-work-the-bering-sea-book-now-shipping/\">More Pictures of the book - Click Here</a>","options":[{"id":12963356,"name":"Default","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":28.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37932338/-/_MG_6724.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37932338/-/_MG_6724.jpg","width":600,"height":400},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37932354/-/_MG_6642.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37932354/-/_MG_6642.jpg","width":600,"height":400},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37932402/-/_MG_6700.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37932402/-/_MG_6700.jpg","width":600,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1687191,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]}]
