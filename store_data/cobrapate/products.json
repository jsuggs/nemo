Once shipped, orders will arrive within 2-3 business days. Due to the perishable nature of our products, we cannot ship internationally, or to PO Boxes, APO, or FPO addresses. Cobra Pâté is not responsible for delayed or returned orders due to incorrect or undeliverable addresses. \r\n\r\nWe take great care in packaging our products, however we realize our products are fragile. Unfortunately we can't guarantee what happens to the packages once they leave our hands, however if a package is greatly damaged, please contact us.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Product info</b>\r\nWe don't use any preservatives in our pâtés, so all products should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sun. It would be best to consume the pâtés within 7 days - if you can stop yourself after the first bite. They can be stored in a freezer to extend shelf-life, if you're one who believes in delaying satisfaction.\r\n\r\nOur products are made in a facility that processes foods that contain tree nuts, seeds, and chocolate. While some pâtés may not contain all of these products, trace amounts of them may be found in our products.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Privacy Policy</b>\r\nWe do not share customer information with any other parties.
