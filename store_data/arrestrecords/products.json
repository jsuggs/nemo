2007, Gordon Riker & Kelly Wallace both tragically passed away in bike accidents in Boston, MA. Shortly after, friends of their's started a non-profit organization titled H.E.L.L. (Helping Everyone Live Longer). H.E.L.L. is a DIY group that primarily operates in Boston's punk and hardcore scene that both Gordon and Kelly were heavily involved in. H.E.L.L.'s main goal is to give out free helmets from donations while raising bike safety awareness.\r\nThis compilation features songs and artwork from Gordon and Kelly's friends, family, and favorite bands, as well as a few others who have lost someone close to them. Contributions are not just primarily from the Greater Boston area, but also Florida, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New York, Vermont, Pennsylvania, and Quebec. All proceeds from this compilation will go directly to helping keep H.E.L.L. alive.\r\nSide A \r\n-------- \r\n01. 108 - Into Her Arms \r\n02. Attica! Attica! - You, The Music, and Me \r\n03.
