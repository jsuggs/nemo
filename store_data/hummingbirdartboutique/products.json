I use as many recycled/upcycled materials as possible when making my art and often re-use magazine ads, calendars, postcards, junk mail pieces, menus, greeting cards and anything else that inspires me.\r\n\r\nThis bright and beautiful tile wall plaque is 100% UNIQUE. The same piece can never be duplicated, so buy these with the knowledge that you are purchasing a truly one-of-a-kind piece. This tile measures approximately 6x8 inches. Tiny scrap paper pieces are applied to the top of each tile with a transparent gloss medium to allow the color and texture of each piece to shine through. A high gloss sealer is then applied in multiple coats to ensure longevity, quality, and durability of these mini works of art. The backside has a soda pop tab/top used for hanging purposes that is affixed with super strong epoxy. \r\n\r\nThis wall plaque offers a unique and eye catching way to display a small sized work of art, while also inspiring others with the uplifting visual message it contains. Each piece is lovingly created and attention to detail is always apparent. I can also do custom ceramic coasters or wall plaques with any inspirational word or message you prefer, including a general choice of preferred use of colors. I can also make custom order from your personal photographs. \r\n\r\nTile size is 6\"x8\".\r\n\r\nPlease allow approximately one week for delivery.\r\n\r\n*Tiles can be wiped clean with a damp cloth but are NOT safe for dishwasher use. They should never be used as trivets.","options":[{"id":10965913,"name":"Default","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31250603/-/LoveButterflyTile.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31250603/-/LoveButterflyTile.jpg","width":763,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":3194923,"name":"4 Ceramic Coaster Set-Musings with Birds","permalink":"4-ceramic-coaster-set-musings-with-birds","position":2,"price":22.0,"default_price":22.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/4-ceramic-coaster-set-musings-with-birds","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-01-27T19:42:45.000Z","description":"This bird themed coaster set features four vibrant original images from my personally created art collection.
