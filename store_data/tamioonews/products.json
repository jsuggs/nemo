The handmade copies I made sold surprisingly well at a local shop, so I decided to have more copies printed in Shanghai.\r\n\r\nVolume 1 - India\r\n\r\nThe first in the series chronicles my first backpacking experience in chaotic India.\r\n\r\nVolume 2 - Asia\r\n\r\nSneaking into Tibet, pretending to be Chinese, bribing hostels not to rat me out, and dodging the police along the way, I made it to Mount Kailash and ancient kingdom of Guge.\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\nWhat is the \"Tamio Nikki\" series:\r\n\r\nI, Tamio,  traveled the world with a tiny backpack and a tiny journal.
