An omnivorous musicologist and junk culture enthusiast, Drucker began Painted Faces in 2009, inspired by the long history of DIY home recording pioneers. He attributes the ever-evolving Painted Faces \"sound\" to an near-endless list of influences: experimental composers and improvisers, second-rate pop stars, freaky outsiders, B horror movies and other films, art both \"high\" and \"low,\" mind-altering substances, psychedelia, sound, boredom, isolation, junk food, conversations, environments, dreams, revolutions, time travel, low-level philosophy, memories, insanity, humor, science fiction, nature, surrealism, literature, observations, things, people in general, and smoking lots of pot. <i>Alone In My Head: A Painted Faces Primer</i> was compiled from nine albums self-released over the past five years.\r\n\r\nCD released 26 July 2013.\r\n\r\n1.

It was the only time the band ever played in West Lafayette, home of the Purdue Boilermakers. It was the first of four times we shared a bill with our friends Dow Jones & The Industrials (and one of only a couple house parties we ever played). It was the only time one of our shows was recorded on anything but a cassette deck, in this case the Zounds Studio four-track machine the Industrials used for their recordings. And it was the only time we ever played \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing.\"\r\n\r\nAs with every time we played with DJI, the bands alternated sets, two apiece. If our second set that night was also recorded, it's long ago been lost or taped over. The surviving 45-minute performance is reproduced here in its entirety, boring stretches and blemishes intact. The PA cuts out in the middle of our third song (not an especially rare occurrence back then), and ample proof is provided of the group's very limited command of guitar tuning. Five lesser-known and heretofore unreleased Gizmo numbers turn up: \"Great Expectations,\" \"Moonies,\" \"Mommy's In The Kitchen With A Sales Pitch,\" the world premiere of \"Rockin' For Tacos, and a pretty dreary tune called \"Stutter Gunner\" (I wouldn't have minded had it stayed unknown).\r\n\r\nAll in all, it's a pretty accurate record of what a typical Gizmos show was like. It was probably either our first or second gig after opening for the Ramones, so we were feeling our oats: confident, relatively tight, and happy to be playing with our friends and outside Bloomington.\r\n\r\n—Dale Lawrence\r\n\r\nCD released 25 July 2013.\r\n\r\n1.

Signature guitar fills abound in this epic track.\r\n\r\nGut-string guitars in a Baroque riff underpin the down-and-out tale of two people wondering \"What'll We Do 'Til Then.\" Ominous drums suggest that things may not turn out like the singer hopes.\r\n\r\nIt's dance party time, so get \"Educated.\" Tim lays out the facts, and even double tracks his own personal Ronettes to punctuate the fact that he's been to school. A very funky school.\r\n\r\n\"Can't Stay Young\" is the great lost Kinks riff, with the voice of experience giving tips to the listener on how to stay hip.\r\n\r\n\"Soybeans, Cotton And Corn.\" No, it's not the Farm Report, just a list of things it took to get out of the fields and onto the stage. Luckily, he's picking guitars these days.\r\n\r\nA swampy version of \"If I Could\" shows the versatility of a great song--you can cut it lots of ways and it will still work.\r\n\r\n--Tom Spaulding \r\n\r\nCD released 16 July 2009.\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nTim Carroll, a product of rural Indiana, released his eighth record, <i>All Kinds Of Pain,</i> in July 2009. As rhythm guitarist in the late-70s Bloomington, Indiana punk band, The Gizmos (Gulcher), Tim displayed his bare-bones rock ethic, then polished it in the 80s with The Blue Chieftains, his New York City bar band (Diesel Only Records).\r\n\r\nA Nashville transplant since 1993, Tim has had songs recorded by John Prine, Asleep At The Wheel, BR-549, Robbie Fulks, Kasey Chambers, Elizabeth Cook, Bare Jr., Sunny Sweeney, Sonny Burgess and many others.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, he made the cover of <i>Billboard</i> magazine in an article about Nashville's burgeoning alt-country music scene. In 1996, Tim was nominated for a Nashville Music Award in the category of \"Best Unsigned Artist.\" In 1997, he signed a deal with Sire Records and began working with producer Andy Paley.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, Carroll had two of his Sire recordings on major motion picture soundtracks. <i>Election</i> featured the song \"Find A Way To Win,\" and <i>Drop Dead Gorgeous</i> includes a song co-written with the late Duane Jarvis, \"A Girl That's Hip.\"\r\n\r\nSince 2000, Tim has appeared on The Grand Ole Opry literally hundreds of times as sideman to his wife, Americana chanteuse and Sirius Radio host Elizabeth Cook. He's toured in Japan, Great Britain, France, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Poland, and South Korea.\r\n\r\nPRESS\r\n\r\n\"Tim Carroll is a fiery stage presence, a tremendous Chuck Berry-loving guitar player and a songwriter who blends intelligence, humor and aggression into something wholly idiosyncratic and tremendously entertaining.\" --Peter Cooper, <i>The Tennessean</i> (Nashville)\r\n \r\n\"Carroll's witty realism brings a large dose of humor to a genre that too often takes itself too seriously.

The Cigarettes fused high-school geek visions of dada and beat literature with their love of pre-punk icons like Eno and Beefheart, advanced by Midwestern art-punks like MX-80, Pere Ubu, and Tin Huey. Their songs were tight, angular, ironic, and filled with obtuse lyrics. In 1981, they released an EP on Gulcher, and contributed a cut to the <i>Red Snerts</i> compilation LP. This CD collects those five tracks, two outtakes from the EP sessions, and 15 songs recorded live at the Bluebird in Bloomington. The Bluebird material shows the Dancing Cigarettes were just as fiery and capable of sonic chicanery live as in a studio setting.\r\n\r\nCD released 6 September 2002.\r\n\r\nDANCING CIGARETTES EP\r\n\r\n1.

At the core of the Korps were Gizmos mainman Ken Highland and brothers Solomon and Jay Gruberger, who were the living-room trio of O. Rex for the previous four years. In 1976, drummer/multi-instrumentalist Ken Kaiser tightened up their sub-garage approach. Then along came Kim Kane and Martha Hull from the D.C.-area Slickee Boys. The recordings became free-for-all punk-rock \"super sessions\" with various other Slickee Boys members, DsCcenesters, rock writers, etc. joining in. The results were 22 (!) tracks of crazed post-teen punk with deep garage roots and lots of room for fun. The album stands as one of the most spontaneous and least trendy things to come out of the early Amerikan punk scene. This Gulcher CD features the original LP in its entirety, plus eight studio outtakes and four live tracks. A 16-page booklet with several unpublished photos details the history of the Afrika Korps.\r\n\r\nCD released 8 November 2001.\r\n\r\n1. Jailbait Jane\r\n2. Fox Lane\r\n3. Too Cool To Fool\r\n4.

After they disbanded in 1982, he spent several years fronting New York City's neo-honkytonk bar-rockers, the Blue Chieftains. Throughout his subsequent Nashville solo career, Tim has clung at least as tightly to his punk roots as his country ones, and nowhere is that truer than on his ninth album (and second for Gulcher), <i>Look Out!</i>\r\n\r\nHandling all guitar (and bass) chores himself, Carroll creates a glowing burr of sound, a red-hot rock'n'roll ember, fueled in no small part by the great trash-can drumming of Rick Schell and Marco Giovino. Tim Atwood fills things out nicely with smoky organ and backroom piano.\r\n\r\nIt's a sound at once casual and spot-on, the perfect complement to Carroll's ever-evolving songwriting. His breadth and variety has never been more on display: from the tuneful pop punk of \"When I Have You\" to the fast shuffle of \"One More Step\" to the in-your-face hard funk of \"Talk to God\", from the lounge stylings of \"Really Do It Right\" to the sledgehammer riff of \"That's When I Love You\" to the deadpan spoken blues of the title track. \r\n\r\nIf there's a hidden theme to <i>Look Out!</i> it might be Put Up or Shut Up. \"The time has come to make the move,\" Tim sings on the opening track. \"A lot to gain, so much to lose.\" Six songs later, the irresistibly trashy \"No More Talkin'\" equates stepping on stage with stepping up to the plate. \"I wanna sing you a song/I wanna make you cry/I wanna watch you dance . . . No more talkin'.\"\r\n\r\nAnother highlight of the album is \"That's Rock & Roll,\" Tim's paean to the lifestyle he's called home for over 30 years now. \"I drove a thousand miles for a hundred dollars,\" he sings--and he knows what he's talking about, having toured the world many times, playing in Japan, France, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Poland, South Korea, and the UK. He's had songs featured in films <i>(Election, Drop Dead Gorgeous)</i> and recorded by the likes of John Prine, BR-549, Robbie Fulks, Bare Jr, Sonny Burgess, the Wrights, and Asleep At The Wheel. He performs regularly on the Grand Ole Opry, as lead guitarist for his wife, Americana sweetheart and Sirius/XM Radio host Elizabeth Cook (who supplies harmonies on <i>Look Out!).</i>\r\n\r\nThis new album may be Tim Carroll's best yet. It's certainly a worthy introduction to one of the most distinctive voices in American music today.\r\n\r\n--Dale Lawrence\r\n(Gizmos, Vulgar Boatmen)\r\n\r\nCD released 23 February 2012.\r\n\r\n1.

When Dale Lawrence and Billy Nightshade took over the reins in 1978, the band emerged as a working unit that took its cues from the raw energy of the first wave of British punk (the Jam, Sex Pistols, and especially the Vibrators). Adding a classic pop sensibility, their songs had a keen ear for melody, with lyrics that were concise and funny, equal parts youthful alienation (\"Pay,\" \"Tell Me Why\"), Midwestern pride (\"Rock & Roll Don't Come From New York,\" \"The Midwest Can Be Allright\"), and reflection upon rock itself (\"Progressive Rock,\" \"Reggae Song\"). Included are highlights from <i>Hoosier Hysteria,</i> their 1980 split album with Dow Jones & The Industrials, and many never-released favorites culled from live tapes. Remastered for CD by fellow Hoosier punk Paul Mahern (Zero Boys), this disc comes with a 16-page booklet featuring rare flyers, several unpublished photos, and liner notes by Dale Lawrence.\r\n\r\nCD released 26 November 2004.\r\n\r\n1.

Real teenagers from the middle of Amerika, the eight misfits who made up this group of fanzine writers, rock cultists, and heavy-metal dudes conjured their own peculiar magic out of the just-barely pre-Ramones rock underground. Led by Ken Highland and based in the sleepy college town of Bloomington, Indiana, the group included Eddie Flowers (Crawlspace), Rich Coffee, and Ted Niemiec among its ranks. They recorded three EPs in early '76 and '77, including classics like \"Muff Divin',\" \"Mean Screen,\" \"That's Cool (I Respect You More),\" \"Human Garbage Disposal,\" \"Kiss of the Rat,\" \"We're Gonna Rumble\" and nine more, plus a never-released Johnny Cougar cover! This CD collects the three EPs and eleven outtakes, with a 16-page booklet of mostly unpublished photos, Richard Meltzer's original liner notes for the first EP, and extensive liner notes by Eddie Flowers. Here it is, music fans: punktitude and stoopidity before it got self-conscious, self-important, and turned into \"punk-rock.\"\r\n\r\nCD released 1 May 2000.\r\n\r\nTHE GIZMOS EP\r\n\r\n1.

Rex \r\nMY HEAD'S IN '73! \r\n(Gulcher 433)\r\n\r\nBefore the Afrika Korps, even before the Gizmos, Krazee Ken Highland was a teenage fanzine writer in Upstate NY. In 1973, he joined brothers Solomon and Jay Gruberger in Brooklyn to form the living-room band O. Rex. They never played a show, but recorded LOTS of material, mostly covers of their fave bands (Alice, Grand Funk, Mountain, Sabbath, etc.). Then in 1976, following Ken's debut with the Gizmos, they released the 7\" maxi-single \"My Head's In '73\" b/w \"Califawnia Gurls\"/\"Suzi.\" For this double CD, Gulcher dug up the tapes for that impossible-to-find piece of vinyl, and 40 other primitive gems--mostly originals from the twisted young minds of Solomon Gruberger and Ken Highland. Punk before punk, lo-fi before lo-fi, bored 70s outsiders doing their best to ROCK! Often crude lyrically as well as musically, crammed with horndog anthems and messed-up teen fantasies, O. Rex sounds like the missing link between the early Velvet Underground and 60s garage bands wailin' on \"Beaver Patrol\" and dirty-word versions of \"Louie Louie,\" all the while striving to play like the Allman Bros and Cream (they never got close!).

Following in the footsteps of bands like Guided By Voices, Strapping Fieldhands, and Dinosaur (perhaps before they were Jr.), Vile mixes up Dylan/Bruce/Neil-style heartland rock, loser folk, punk, a little power pop...somehow vibin' up the spacey distortion of 70s FM radio--from a guy who was born in 1980! All that is expressed wonderfully on the opening track \"Freeway,\" which turned into a college/XMU radio fave upon release. But there's more: whisper-vocal secrets, synth gurgles, free drone space, the sound of a church-organ beatbox propping up a drunken teenager. Vile, man.\r\n\r\nCD released 6 February 2008.\r\n\r\n1.

Under the influence of Weezer, the Beatles, Brian Wilson, Elliott Smith, and Guided By Voices, this mystery man did a few local shows and some homemade tapes prior to <i>Tweaker In The Park,</i> his debut full-length. Led off by \"The Town Crazies,\" an eMusic <i>Daily Download</i> pick, the disc is a constant listen--spooky internal-gropes of depressed joy, fragile half-smiles and haze-compressed plunk, the likes of which stretch back at least as far as Syd Barrett, and stagger along a contemporary route label-mates Kurt Vile and Handglops have shared. So many ways to hear. And yes, this young Hoosier has one of the silliest names to ever grace such groovy sounds. Pardon him for breathing. And dig.\r\n\r\nCD released 7 June 2011.\r\n\r\n1.
