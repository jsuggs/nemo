The album concept and artwork is the first installment in an ongoing collaboration between architect Al Shissias and Jon LaDeau.\r\n\r\nIt features:\r\nJL on guitar and vocals\r\nTaylor Floreth on drums\r\nJames Preston on bass and vocals \r\n\r\nSpecial guests include:\r\nJustin Kimmel on guitar and vocals\r\nColin Brown on piano, organ, and clavinet\r\nJeff Malinowski on guitar and vocals\r\nPeter Barr on steel drums\r\nPaul Lefevbre on pedal steel guitar  \r\n\r\nThis is an electric album with plenty of attitude.  It starts off in Noodlehead's wild years as a hard partying, pool shooting, motorcycle riding dude.  Over the course of ten songs, the sound mellows slightly, ending on the beach in Coney Island with the sound of steel drums and acoustic guitars.  \r\n\r\nThere is a lot of singing and guitar playing on this record.  It was a lot of fun to make and I hope you have as much fun sharing it with your friends as I did recording it with mine.\r\n\r\nJL\r\n\r\n\r\nALL ORDERS WILL SHIP WITHIN 24 HOURS AND INCLUDE A FREE DOWNLOAD.","options":[{"id":32689204,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102599236/-/Frontpicture_Noodlehead.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102599236/-/Frontpicture_Noodlehead.jpg","width":1000,"height":891}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3089305,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":5883761,"name":"Jon LaDeau LP (Digital Copy)","permalink":"jon-ladeau","position":2,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/jon-ladeau","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-04-08T03:24:13.000Z","description":"The Physical copies of the May 2012 LP are SOLD OUT!
