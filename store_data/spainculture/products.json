The bag has a durable, modern and simple shoulder strap for comfortable and easy transport.\r\n\r\nAs always, even though we use fabrics from all over the world, peSeta designs and produces all our handcrafted products locally in Madrid, Spain.\r\n\r\n<h2>About peSeta</h2>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.peseta.org/\">peSeta</a> has been making beautiful things since the beginning of the century.

In 2005, Jaime Sevilla Moreno joined her without thinking twice. Both were born in 1978.\r\n\r\nIn peSeta, they mix their business and artistic interests into something durable and self-fulfilling.\r\n\r\npeSeta is a local brand with worldwide aspirations.
