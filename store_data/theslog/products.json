It will provide assistance to those who are pursuing work within the scope of The Arts (Dance, Theatrical, Media, Music and Visual). THE SLOG will do this by providing a practical and easy to use communication tool between those who are looking to perform and festivals, venues and collectives in need of performers.\r\n\r\nWhen we launch the website, users will be able to interact with each other in order to organise and implement their performances. Theyâ€™ll also be able to expand their contacts and connections by tracking the different types of services provided in accordance to their speciality within different states and regions throughout Australia.\r\n\r\nTHE SLOG was founded mid 2011 by Jacq Rolfe and started out as a Facebook page, but quickly expanded to other online platforms such as YouTube, Twitter and Reverb Nation.  The SLOG began as a way to promote bands from right across Australia and recently begun collecting a portfolio of venues, festivals, and those providing services to people who were performing music to offer a wider range of services to the amazing talent in our pool of artists.  Since then THE SLOG has adapted and expanded to include areas within the creative arts as well as those who facilitate opportunities to perform.\r\n\r\nThese calendars are available via most starring artists/festivals/venues in person, but we have set up these babies online for wider distribution.  Each calendar sold will raise funds towards the site being built, as well as give money to those featured who have been kind enough to support us. \r\n\r\nwww.SlogMusic.com\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SLOG CALENDAR 2012!!!\r\n\r\nSTARRING:\r\n\r\nAbbie Cardwell\r\nThe Basement\r\nBeth'n'Ben\r\nBrisbane Hotel\r\nBrothers Grim & The Blue Murders\r\nCash Savage & The Last Drinks\r\nEaten By Dogs\r\nEscape Syndrome\r\nFun Machine\r\nGrinspoon\r\nJulia and the Deep Sea Sirens\r\nThe Last Prom\r\nLittle John\r\nThe Magic Rob Universe\r\nMarshalls Commonwealth\r\nMelody Moon\r\nMikelangelo\r\nMoJo JuJu\r\nThe Phoenix Bar\r\nTammy Paks\r\nRafe Morris \r\nSaint Clare\r\nSummer Rhythms Festival\r\nUltra Dimensions II\r\n\r\n\r\nALSO FEATURING:\r\n \r\nBlack Level Embassy\r\nBMA Magazine\r\nCardboard Charlie\r\nCorinbank\r\nDanny Walsh Banned\r\nDave Naylor\r\nDead\r\nElisa Bryant Photographic Solutions \r\nEnd Vision Photography\r\nThe Feldons\r\nGraveyard Train\r\nHelen McLean\r\nImpact Comics \r\nIsobel Taylor-Rogers\r\nIWANTJA\r\nJackson Firebird\r\nJoel Morrison\r\nLittle Pictures\r\nMain Street Studios\r\nMartin Cilia\r\nMartin Ollman\r\nOld Bar Unicorns\r\nOverheard Productions\r\nThe Panics\r\nPete Akhurst\r\nPrecious Jules\r\nPush To Fire\r\nPyrene\r\nSaint Jude\r\nSnowdroppers\r\nSvelt\r\nZomburbia ","options":[{"id":15584721,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":8.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46749569/-/P1010217_OrtonStyle_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46749569/-/P1010217_OrtonStyle_1.jpg","width":873,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2585405,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"},{"id":2585409,"name":"Calendars","permalink":"calendars","url":"/category/calendars"}]}]
