Kosuth's highlights the relation between language, picture and referent where as my realist painting takes this a step further by alluding to the very codependence of a priori is-ness (un-transcendent yet intangible) and concrete objecthood.\r\nRepresentational simulation of reality thrice removed is still able to convey the concept of a chair without a real chair actually being present. The painting of a picture of a picture of a chair is still identified as a chair because of the relationship between symbol and is-ness.\r\n\r\nThis print is 20\" x 30\" with a 1\" border around the image for framing.\r\nThe artwork is printed on Fine Art Velvet paper which is 100% cotton and acid free. Canon archival large format ink jet printers are used to print directly onto the Fine Art Velvet paper. Fine art velvet prints are less resistant to scratching and damage than traditional photographic prints and should be handled and displayed with care.\r\n\r\nThe work comes signed and number in an edition of 15. That means that only 15 of these will ever be printed. \r\n\r\nThe original work was purchased by the Savannah College of Art and Design and is on display in the La Maison Basse in Lacoste, France.","options":[{"id":50150226,"name":"Default","price":180.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129323328/-/One_and_Six_Chairs.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129323328/-/One_and_Six_Chairs.jpg","width":1000,"height":1601}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":9511418,"name":"The Other Nothing - Fine Art Print","permalink":"the-other-nothing-fine-art-print","position":2,"price":125.0,"default_price":125.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-other-nothing-fine-art-print","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-16T01:47:05.000Z","description":"The Other Nothing, an original Charcoal Drawing by Adam Gabriel Winnie, is now available as a fine art print.

I was thinking about \"The Nothing\" from The Never Ending Story when I titled this particular work. Having grown up in the 1980's this movie had an incredible power over my imagination. In the movie, The Nothing is an all encompassing blackness which \"erases\" everything into non-being. Where as my Other Nothing exists prior to being, the emptiness preceding is-ness. The negative space which represents this Other Nothing is just as important as the figure it's self. It is the figure which is reacting to this emptiness of existence, in effect its gesture is that of an existential flinch.\r\n\r\nPaper Information: Printed on an archival large format inkjet printer on 100% cotton and acid free paper, the fine art velvet prints come out with a similar look and feel as a watercolor paper. \r\n\r\nThe delicate surface of the velvet print is less resistant to scratches than other kinds of prints.

It is the source of all true art and science.\" The innate curiosity imbued in each of us has led us many times to peek through the crack in the fence to discover what is hidden. Through religion, science or art, meaning plays a central role in understanding. Although, the resulting pursuit is not without peril, the ominous boulder suspended above the artist embodies this. The disparate notions of a work of art's meaning between the author and the audience is characterized by the backwards turned canvas which only the artist could see if he turned around. The doorway to understanding through the realization of meaning is not to be discovered but instead, created. \r\n\r\nPaper Information: Printed on an archival large format inkjet printer on 100% cotton and acid free paper, the fine art velvet prints come out with a similar look and feel as a watercolor paper. \r\n\r\nThe delicate surface of the velvet print is less resistant to scratches than other kinds of prints.

One the surface a young Jane Doe sunbaths in front of a dilapidated store front. The forgotten store, is the former Bryant's Grocery and meat market in Money, Mississippi where In 1955, Emmett Till, a 14-year old boy from Chicago, was visiting relatives near Money, Mississippi. Anxious to show new friends that he knew how to talk to white women, Till said, \"Bye, baby,\" to Carolyn Bryant as he left this store. Three days later, Bryant's husband, Roy, and his half-brother, J.W. Milam, kidnapped, tortured, and killed Till. Milam and Bryant were found not guilty by an all-male, all-white jury but later sold their murder confession to Look magazine. \r\n\r\nPaper Information: Printed on an archival large format inkjet printer on 100% cotton and acid free paper, the fine art velvet prints come out with a similar look and feel as a watercolor paper. \r\n\r\nThe delicate surface of the velvet print is less resistant to scratches than other kinds of prints.
