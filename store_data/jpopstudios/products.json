The Southern Ocean Fertilization Experiment is one of the largest man-made phytoplankton blooms. Lots of Iron was dumped into the sea and it created food for algae, which bloomed, died and sank into the sea. The fallen algae sequestered carbon and supposedly stays in the deep with the carbon from the atmosphere. But, the amount of carbon that the bloom may capture, added to the amount of carbon it took to spread the iron in the first place = about 8 acres of replanted forests. \r\nTo me it seems more worthwhile to replant our forests instead of messing with the fragile ocean ecosystem. Who knows what will happen to all the creatures in the Southern waters where the experiment is taking place. If you look carefully in the piece, the background is filled with Krill, which may seem tiny, but are very important in the ocean food chain. I stuck them in to signify the interconnectedness of large and small. How will our oceans change if large plankton blooms become a common carbon capturing tool?...All we know for sure is that the ecosystem is complex and often undocumented. \r\n\r\ncolor-reduction woodcut image size 32 x 24\"","options":[{"id":19075171,"name":"Iron Fertilization","price":1200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19075173,"name":"6 month payment plan","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58526427/-/Iron-fertme-sm.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58526427/-/Iron-fertme-sm.jpg","width":576,"height":669},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58526403/-/Iron_Fertilization_sm_copy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58526403/-/Iron_Fertilization_sm_copy.jpg","width":432,"height":570}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2913997,"name":"Original woodcuts","permalink":"original-woodcuts","url":"/category/original-woodcuts"}]},{"id":5960383,"name":"Feasting on Friendly Floatees--Payment Plan!","permalink":"feasting-on-friendly-floatees","position":89,"price":500.0,"default_price":500.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/feasting-on-friendly-floatees","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-18T01:08:51.000Z","description":"YUMMY!

If the ice disappears, their safety is in danger. All animals that depend on sea ice find themselves in a bit of a \"predicament.\"\r\n\r\nOn a brighter note, one of my favorite tidbits of knowledge about walrus is they are nicknamed \"tooth walkers\" because when they \"haul out\" onto ice or land they use their teeth!

Narwhals live in the Arctic and depend on dense sea ice for survival. Orcas are the Narwhals biggest predator, but, they cannot forge easily into the thick frozen seas. And, if the northwest passage becomes a viable trade route, ships will be trekking into the seas where these shy mammals live. Also, Narwhals largest food source is halibut. They live about 4,000 feet below the surface, if the fish move, the Narwhals will have to find a different dinner. Scientists don't know the impact of warming temperatures, but, these whales could be the first effected due to their icy quarters. 5x5\"\r\n\r\nNo framing needed, attaches right to the wall using a keyhole slot.
