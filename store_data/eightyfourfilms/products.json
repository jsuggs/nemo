Millions of people have seen the video of Dwyer's death on the Internet but very little is known about the circumstances leading to his death.\r\n\r\n\"Honest Man\" chronicles Dwyer's meteoric rise to political power and examines the bribery scandal that pushed him to his breaking point. The film features exclusive new interviews with Dwyer's family, friends, and colleagues, including a candid, heartfelt interview with Dwyer's widow - her last before her death in 2009 - and a rare, revealing interview with William Smith, the man whose testimony convicted Dwyer. This story has remained untold for over two decades. This portrait of a man swept up in the corrupt and cutthroat political world raises important questions about Dwyer's presumed guilt.\r\n\r\nThe director's cut of the film features an extra 20 minutes of uncensored interviews and exclusive DVD content that cannot be found anywhere else.\r\n\r\nBonus features include:\r\n\r\n* The Dwyer Archives - A never before seen collection of political ads and speeches.\r\n\r\n* Newly discovered footage of the final press conference. Exclusive clips of Dwyer's final speech, which has never been released.\r\n\r\n* Commentary track from Dwyer's children, Rob and Dyan Dwyer. Additional commentary track with Director James Dirschberger and Producer/Editor Matt Levie\r\n\r\n* DVD-Rom featuring unreleased documents\r\n\r\nRunning time: 80 Mins. | Format: Widescreen | Not Rated","options":[{"id":10077204,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":2.75,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29326037/-/dvd_front_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29326037/-/dvd_front_cover.jpg","width":713,"height":928},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29326053/-/dvdcase_back.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29326053/-/dvdcase_back.jpg","width":713,"height":928}],"artists":[{"id":61646,"name":"James Dirschberger","permalink":"james-dirschberger","url":"/artist/james-dirschberger"},{"id":109261,"name":"Honest Man","permalink":"honest-man","url":"/artist/honest-man"}],"categories":[{"id":1564487,"name":"DVD","permalink":"dvd","url":"/category/dvd"}]},{"id":3180241,"name":"DVD + Book","permalink":"dvd-+-book","position":2,"price":14.99,"default_price":14.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dvd-+-book","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-01-24T20:31:43.000Z","description":"This package includes a DVD of \"Honest Man\" plus a copy of Lorraine Yuhasz's book \"The Dwyer Case\"!
