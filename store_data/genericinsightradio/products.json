Mastered by Bill Henderson, former guitarist of THURSDAY (and currently of THE PROCEDURE, BETWEEN THE WARS, and X ONE WAY X). The first of hopefully more compilations to come in a joint effort with Eternal Hope Records, based out of Washington, D.C. \r\n\r\nGIR Volume One has received awesome reviews from sites and webzines such as PUNKNEWS.ORG, SCENEPOINTBLANK and GEEKBURGER. The critics love it. You will too. \r\n\r\nAlso, if this is more of an incentive, this comp features the ONLY ever released song by OnGuard, the now-defunct solo project of JASON SHEVCHUK (ahem... vocalist of Kid Dynamite/None More Black/LaGrecia). \r\n\r\nPlus, it's only 5 bucks. Get into it! \r\n\r\n* = notes demo version or previously unreleased track\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n1. Up For Nothing - \"Only Time Will Tell\"\r\n2.
