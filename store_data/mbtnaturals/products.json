Originally discovered in Greenland in 1811, sodalite became more popular after being found in Ontario, Canada in 1891.

Sometimes folks have difficulty telling the difference between sodalite and lapis lazuli. The main distinction between sodalite and lapis is that lapis lazuli has gold flecks and sodalite does not. The gold coloring on the lapis is a result of pyrite growing with lapis.\r\nSodalite is one of the best stones for easing anger, overcoming adversity, clearing mental confusion and coming to logical conclusions. Sodalite promotes rational thinking, fellowship, purpose, companionship, self esteem, self trust, trust in others and an overall well being. This blue beauty inspires truth, idealism and objectivity and lets us release those old negative tapes that keep playing in our head.\r\nSodalite is a meditative stone that opens our spiritual awareness by combining our logic with our intuition.

Originally discovered in Greenland in 1811, sodalite became more popular after being found in Ontario, Canada in 1891. Sodalite got its name from its high content of sodium.\r\nSodalite is most commonly royal blue with veins or patches of white calcite, however it can also be gray, green, pink or yellow. Sometimes folks have difficulty telling the difference between sodalite and lapis lazuli. The main distinction between sodalite and lapis is that lapis lazuli has gold flecks and sodalite does not. The gold coloring on the lapis is a result of pyrite growing with lapis.\r\nSodalite is one of the best stones for easing anger, overcoming adversity, clearing mental confusion and coming to logical conclusions. Sodalite promotes rational thinking, fellowship, purpose, companionship, self esteem, self trust, trust in others and an overall well being. This blue beauty inspires truth, idealism and objectivity and lets us release those old negative tapes that keep playing in our head.\r\nSodalite is a meditative stone that opens our spiritual awareness by combining our logic with our intuition. It enhances intuition and helps heal bruised emotions. Sodalite encourages restful sleep, spirituality, deep meditative thinking and direction. Good for calcium deficiency, digestion and glandular system.\r\nThis is a great stone for easing our fears, phobias and guilt and anything else which may hinder our healthy growth. Sodalite encourages good self esteem, self acceptance and self trust.\r\nSodalite also has some pretty significant physical properties. Sodalite has a cleansing effect on the lymphatic system, combats calcium deficiencies and regulates the metabolism . It is also beneficial for the vocal cords, larynx, hoarseness, throat, digestive issues, blood pressure and high fevers.","options":[{"id":38714316,"name":"Default","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120469722/-/2013-07-06_13.39.19.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120469722/-/2013-07-06_13.39.19.jpg","width":750,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":216483,"name":"Chris Gray","permalink":"chris-gray","url":"/artist/chris-gray"}],"categories":[]}]
