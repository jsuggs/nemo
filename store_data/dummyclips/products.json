They are longer than dummy clips are can attach toys, cups, taggies, snack cups and more by using either the lead free smooth edged clip or the press stud end.\r\nThey come in many colours and designs so take a look here for my ribbon designs:\r\nhttp://s353.photobucket.com/albums/r375/alisia1981/Ribbons-%20all%20available%20colours/?start=all\r\nThe clip end has smooth teeth for grip without damaging or ripping anything.\r\nMany customers have commented on how life is so much easier when out and about as no toys are left behind and snack can't be thrown away. \r\nNo 2 and 5 are now sold.

The other end connects to their clothes or the pram with a lead free metal clip. It has plastic teeth on the inside of the clip so it won't tear or damage clothing but it will grip and take hold. The smooth edges ensure it won't catch on anything.\r\nFor use with a round or smooth dummy just attach a Mam clip with the press stud end. MAM clips are sold in the accessories category.\r\n\r\n$1.20 postage for up to 2 clips.\r\n\r\nPlease see here for my ribbon selection. http://s353.photobucket.com/albums/r375/alisia1981/Ribbons-%20all%20available%20colours/?start=all","options":[{"id":3665171,"name":"Boys colours","price":8.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.2,"amount_with_others":1.1,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26455679/-/black_spot_ribbon.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26455679/-/black_spot_ribbon.jpg","width":1000,"height":601}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":300261,"name":"Ribbon Clips","permalink":"ribbon-clips","url":"/category/ribbon-clips"}]},{"id":2392891,"name":"HABA Clips","permalink":"haba-clips","position":4,"price":5.5,"default_price":5.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/haba-clips","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-04-17T14:21:33.000Z","description":"These clips are used instead of a single clip and cover.
