We have therefore chosen TOTAL TRANSPARENCY as one of the basic attributes of our trade process. We invite industry professionals to visit us and verify our practices to their satisfaction. This approach has built CONFIDENCE and especially TRUST.\r\n\r\nWe, the farmers of Cameroon Boyo™ Coffee remain the owners of our coffee as it travels to market. We grow coffee to afford us the means to cover the costs of feeding, housing, health care and education of our children – these are basic rights that ensure our human dignity. The price we ask for our coffee also ensures that our collaborating partners are adequately and equitably compensated. The More Than Fair™ certification is your assurance that we are living up to these ideals without penalizing the consumers of our coffee. (see www.morethanfair.org)\r\nDirect Trade\r\nSmall Farmer Grown™\r\nSmall Farmer Owned™\r\nwe do not have large “plantations”; close to 100% of our coffee is produced in small holder family farms by family members.\r\n we are the owners of the Cameroon Boyo™ Coffee, even after it has left our hands. Every export bag is stamped with our seal to testify to that\r\nCollaborative Trade\r\nCameroon Boyo™ Coffee does not undergo the multiple buying and selling transactions that typically move coffee along the supply chain. Instead, individuals and entities collaborate, each fulfilling the specific function (milling, transportation, warehousing) necessary to move the coffee to the final point of sale, while ensuring that the producing farmers retain ownership interests in it.\r\nOrganic and Holistic\r\nCameroon Boyo™ Coffee is grown in family farms, alongside other important family food crops. Our farmers practice traditional farming techniques developed over many generations. Even though in the region where our villages are located, use of chemical fertilizers and sprays is very rare (for a variety of reasons including cost, degradation of the taste of food, adverse effects on health), only farmers who strictly practice natural and organic farming are contributing to our batches of Cameroon Boyo™ Coffee. We believe that our “open doors” attitude and our commitment to be trustworthy partners to those who depend on us are what will ensure a strong and lasting supply chain. We will not jeopardize this privilege.\r\nAuthenticity\r\nWe have worked hard make the Cameroon Boyo™ Coffee brand special and unique.\r\nCameroon Boyo™ Coffee \r\nCameroon Boyo™ Coffee\r\nTo ensure that our customers are receiving coffee grown and owned by our farmers, we have coded our batches of coffee in order to be able to trace back to the farmers who contributed to each batch, and all market partners (roasters, coffee shops and retail outlets) are required to identify the Cameroon Boyo™ Coffee brand on their packages.\r\nToday, much effort is being made to address the question of poverty, especially in coffee producing regions around the world. One such approach is the so called “fair trade” certification process. One important question remains: “why, after all these years, does poverty still persist even in areas where fair trade is practiced?”\r\n\r\nWe are making a noticeable difference\r\nSince Cameroon BOYO™ Coffee is owned by the producing farmers, sales proceeds directly reward them. Furthermore, to get the best market price, farmers understand that they have to deliver the best quality coffee. Consumers are not penalized with high “arbitrary” prices because of certification seals.\r\nThis collaborative approach to trade is More Than Fair\r\nit is EARNED; farmers work hard, deliver top quality and so earn more\r\nit is JUST, rewarding farmers enough to cater for their basic human needs before sharing of market gains with collaborators\r\nit is FAIR TO ALL, farmers and collaborators share all market risks; consumers do not pay arbitarily high prices\r\nit is EQUITABLE, rewarding collaborators in proportion to their contribution to the supply of coffee.\r\nCameroon BOYO™ Coffee: Small Farmer Grown™ Small Farmer Owned™","options":[{"id":49144218,"name":"Cameroon Boyo AA 6oz Medium Roast","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49144563,"name":"Cameroon Boyo Peaberry 6oz Medium Roast","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49572387,"name":"Cameroon Boyo AA 6oz Dark Roast","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49572390,"name":"Cameroon Boyo Peaberry 6oz Dark Roast","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128302530/-/BOYO.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128302530/-/BOYO.png","width":147,"height":73},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128302647/-/morethanfair-300x145.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128302647/-/morethanfair-300x145.jpg","width":300,"height":145}],"artists":[{"id":67614,"name":"Barista On DutY","permalink":"barista-on-duty","url":"/artist/barista-on-duty"}],"categories":[{"id":2009748,"name":"Handcrafted Coffee","permalink":"handcrafted-coffee","url":"/category/handcrafted-coffee"}]},{"id":13789566,"name":"Sea Glass Coffee Scoop made with Recycled Bottle \"Tumbled Island Glass\"","permalink":"coffee-scoop","position":2,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/coffee-scoop","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-25T21:12:23.000Z","description":"Overview\r\nHandmade item\r\nMaterials: stainless steel, dishwasher safe, sea glass, seaglass, beach glass, scoop, coffee scoop, utensil, server, silverware, coffee, serving piece, recycled glass, tumbled island glass\r\nMade to order.

All coffees are organic, whether certified or non certified. We believe in protecting our products, as well as those who consume them. Our coffees are extremely rare since we purchase very small lots of coffee from our groups of suppliers. We then artfully roast them to perfection. Our niche of custom roasting for clients is becoming popular among those seeking a new level in coffee tasting experience! Our coffee stock rotates often. Because we purchase small batches, you are guaranteed a new experience with every new purchase. Nano roasting & purchasing is an art within itself. By roasting small quantities, we can control the roasting processes more effectively. Also our purchasing small quantities guarantees diversity in the beans we roast because every purchased batch comes from a different lot or farm!

Peach, melon, cocoa, fir, a hint of grapefruity citrus in aroma and cup. Rich, balanced acidity; lightly syrupy mouth feel. Sweetly tart, citrusy finish.\r\n\r\nWho should drink it: Non-gardening Sumatra drinkers.
