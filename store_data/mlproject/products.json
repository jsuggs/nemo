Robert Rauschenberg's groundbreaking costume design for Merce Cunningham's dance company is represented through their decades-long collaboration. The issue is designed as a panorama that weaves their signature dances into a dramatic retrospective. Working with photographer Joachim Ladefoged, the company performs for the camera under the direction of Merce Cunningham. Printed on translucent, fabric-like paper in vivid colors, the issue captures Cunningham's radical choreography and Rauschenberg s equally avant-garde costumes, both of which remain landmarks in the history of art. The issue's design is presented in french-folded pages, allowing the choreography to move in and out from the spine in a continuous line.
