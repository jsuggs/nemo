I have had an unusually difficult winter with splits in both thumbs and my right hand pointer finger. As a seamstress, you can imagine how painful it is to work. I went to the dermatologist who said to use liquid Band-aid in the cracks, Neosporin and gloves at night, and another type of hand cream often during the day. I was having only moderate success, the splits would heal for a day or two, but when I banged my thumb on something or would sew for several hours ...the split would come back. It was more than a quarter of an inch long on my right thumb and I feared it would keep going. Occasionally, it would bleed if I hit it just right. In just two days of using your hand cream product, my splits have healed and new skin is growing in and over the splits. The hand cream is truly amazing and it feels wonderful when applied. I keep the container by my bed, but I need to order more to have in my kitchen and purse!!\"\r\n\r\n\"Really feels good and my hands feel so much better in the mornings. Most times I can't even tell I have used lotion all night but this feels good. I have terrible eczema and my hands crack open and nothing heals them except steroid cream. I use lotion at night to try to prevent the breaks in my skin. So far I am impressed with how this works. Thank you for the super fast shipping. \" --R.P Mount Ulla, NC\r\n\r\n\"I love the texture of this!! It's like a mousse and isn't too oily, perfect for me! Absorbs really quickly too.

Thank you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me first state that I am a lip balm junkie, so I was excited to try a new exotic flavor like lavender mint. I got my new tube of lip balm right before my annual ski trip to Colorado, where dry, parched, peeling lips are the norm for the week. I first tried it on the plane and instantly fell in love with the scent and way it melted into my lips. Over the coming week, I kept it in my ski jacket and for the first time my lips survived the Rockies in wonderfully soft state. Iâ€™ve since said goodbye to Burtâ€™s Bees, Soft-lips, and the like and pledged my full allegiance to a true Maine company with a stand out product and great value.\" --A.M. Bethel, ME\r\n\r\n\"The chai spice lip balm should be packaged as a stress-reliever lip balm. Just putting it on conjures the image of a cozy cafe and a heavenly cup of chai - wonderful! Plus, ALL the lip balms (I've tried 3 of Eden's varieties) moisturize beautifully without clumping on dry lips - smooth, leaving a healthy shine.\" ---L.V.

Contains the skin soothing properties of aloe vera & shea butter. Infused with healing & anti-inflammatory calendula flowers.\r\n\r\nThis listing is for a *generous* 1oz travel jar of our wildly popular hand cream. It is suitable for daily use on dry, damaged skin. Keeps hands soft and smooth during our long, cold winters but not too heavy to use all year round!\r\n\r\nFragrance Free.\r\n\r\n<b>Recent Reviews:</b>\r\n\r\n\"I have to tell you how great the shea butter hand cream is. I have had an unusually difficult winter with splits in both thumbs and my right hand pointer finger. As a seamstress, you can imagine how painful it is to work. I went to the dermatologist who said to use liquid Band-aid in the cracks, Neosporin and gloves at night, and another type of hand cream often during the day. I was having only moderate success, the splits would heal for a day or two, but when I banged my thumb on something or would sew for several hours ...the split would come back. It was more than a quarter of an inch long on my right thumb and I feared it would keep going. Occasionally, it would bleed if I hit it just right. In just two days of using your hand cream product, my splits have healed and new skin is growing in and over the splits. The hand cream is truly amazing and it feels wonderful when applied. I keep the container by my bed, but I need to order more to have in my kitchen and purse!!\"\r\n\r\n\"Really feels good and my hands feel so much better in the mornings. Most times I can't even tell I have used lotion all night but this feels good. I have terrible eczema and my hands crack open and nothing heals them except steroid cream. I use lotion at night to try to prevent the breaks in my skin. So far I am impressed with how this works. Thank you for the super fast shipping. \" --R.P Mount Ulla, NC\r\n\r\n\"I love the texture of this!! It's like a mousse and isn't too oily, perfect for me! Absorbs really quickly too.

The lotion is not overscented or cloying at all, which is difficult, especially with strong scents like patchouli and lavender. The Shave Soap - AMAZING!
