A real charming affair featuring two men, a wife, a pregnant partner and the Duff family plughole. So why would it be the one dose of Usurper bumf which various avant-hands got burned by and was deemed too hot to hump or handle? Maybe it'll do right by you, seeing as you're such a family-oriented advertisement for wholesome hetero-nuptials, but... i dunno, Dylan... maybe it's cursed?\" - Ali Robertson.\r\n\r\n\"Each usurper recording makes me think of a great day I’ve had with my friend Ali. The great day got better this day when it also included Louise (the love of my life), Collette (the love of Ali’s life) and my unborn son Linus (the lover of life). The recording features my favourite usurper moment to this point. It was recorded in my kitchen. Louise was doing her upholstery next door, and she was hammering on a chair. As she hammered the sink started to glug. Ali had been wandering with the microphone and got it right near the plughole. Louise and the plug jammed blindly together, not knowing the other was singing the same song. It was just one of those moments, you know, Jaques Tati’s paint pot in the sea. I told Ali recently that this was my favourite usurper moment. He looked at me and said “your favourite usurper moment has neither of us playing on it!”\" - Malcy Duff.\r\n\r\nFive track cdr album released by our pals at Chocolate Monk. \r\nDisc arrives packaged in a three-panelled sleeve featuring Duff doodles and a photograph.","options":[{"id":38355636,"name":"Default","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/119348022/-/R-4674783-1371869819-1798.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/119348022/-/R-4674783-1371869819-1798.jpeg","width":600,"height":598}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":11614788,"name":"Usurper - 'IIIIIIIIIIIII' cassette.","permalink":"usurper-iiiiiiiiiiiii-cassette","position":4,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/usurper-iiiiiiiiiiiii-cassette","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-06T09:45:38.000Z","description":"A professionally dubbed cassette with amateurly hand-stamped labels in a limited edition of 50 numbered copies.\r\nThere's a baby hitting things on side B.","options":[{"id":36658968,"name":"Default","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114352242/-/IMG_2158.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114352242/-/IMG_2158.JPG","width":1000,"height":903}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":10978902,"name":"Malcy Duff, Dylan Nyoukis, Ali Robertson, Norman Shaw - 'Acetate Rrobots #1' cdr & acetates.","permalink":"malcy-duff-dylan-nyoukis-ali-robertson-norman-shaw-acetate-rrobots-1-cdr-acetates","position":5,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/malcy-duff-dylan-nyoukis-ali-robertson-norman-shaw-acetate-rrobots-1-cdr-acetates","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-06T12:21:36.000Z","description":"\"The value of not listening to those around you is quite underrated.

Then each armed with a set of the four acetate scores proceeded to recite, changing and rearranging the layers of the scores at will. It was a braw gig, but the recording was lost. Baws. So sometime later it was decided to try and record something in a similar spirit using the original acetates. Each bozo recorded a reading separately (with no prior discussion to time length) then these recordings were laid atop one another, and this is the result. Hand numbered edition of 100 and each includes reproductions of the scores, so you can burble along if you like.\" - Dylan Nyoukis.","options":[{"id":34529004,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/107978109/-/1703742_orig.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/107978109/-/1703742_orig.jpg","width":466,"height":604}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
