The sterling silver cross holds a 5mm green aventurine stone. Joining the cross I have added a cornaline bead wrapped in sterling silver, a sterling silver charm with the word “paz” stamped on it (paz means peace), a sterling silver spring and a green leather cord adorned with sterling beads. The pendant, including the textured silver link, is 7 cm / 2 ¾” and hangs from a 16” caramel leather cord. Closure is a sterling silver and copper clasp. The whole piece was blackened for an aged time look. A protective varnish was given to seal the piece.\r\nThe green aventurine is a stone that can be placed on any part of the body, being especially effective on the solar plexus and dissolves negative energies and obstacles.The cornaline is a stone that helps connect us and open our Sacral Chakra, which governs sexuality, emotions, passion and creativity.
