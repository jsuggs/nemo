Below are things to think about when we collaborate on your unique piece of art.  \r\n \r\nPrices include:  only artwork.  You will either provide me with the written contract and I do the artwork around it or I can create one leaving space for the contract in any shape. \r\n\r\nMotif\r\nList symbols that you want in your ketubah. Some commonly used symbols are:  ceremonial objects, clasped hands, animals (doves, sea horses, swans), trees and flowers,  patterns, celtic knots, henna style, lace, etc. Anything (within reason) can be a motif for a ketuba.\r\n\r\nColor\r\nWhat are your favorite colors? Least favorite? You might think in terms of temperature: cool colors (purples, blues, greens) or warm colors, (oranges, yellows, reds). Consider value--a light, pastel ketubah, or a darker, shaded kattubah. Do you like bright colors or do you want a more subtle effect in your marriage contract? You might want to pick out paint chips of colors you like.\r\n\r\nOrientation\r\nDo you want a horizontal, vertical, or circular ketubah? Or an irregular shape?  I can order any shape on archival paper or it can be painted on canvas. \r\n\r\nTimeliness\r\n I do rush orders at a 20% surcharge if all the necessary information is given to me less than 30 days before the wedding.","options":[{"id":29155133,"name":"8 inch mandala","price":250.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29155136,"name":"10 inch mandala","price":300.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":29155139,"name":"12 inch mandala","price":400.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":29155142,"name":"Larger Sizes ","price":500.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":50.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96984079/-/KETUBAHSSS_copy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96984079/-/KETUBAHSSS_copy.jpg","width":1000,"height":748},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/92119322/-/photo-106.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/92119322/-/photo-106.jpg","width":982,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/92118950/-/4506_1164050344150_1314601884_430323_4671886_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/92118950/-/4506_1164050344150_1314601884_430323_4671886_n.jpg","width":378,"height":353},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/92119016/-/ketubah2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/92119016/-/ketubah2.jpg","width":709,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98029435/-/28821_1492387032362_1314601884_1288465_107909_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98029435/-/28821_1492387032362_1314601884_1288465_107909_n.jpg","width":565,"height":719}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4569089,"name":"Custom Mandalas","permalink":"custom-mandalas","url":"/category/custom-mandalas"}]},{"id":9376073,"name":"HAMSA WOMEN&#x27;S T-SHIRT [TAN AND BROWN] ","permalink":"hamsa-women-s-t-shirt-tan-and-brown","position":73,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/hamsa-women-s-t-shirt-tan-and-brown","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-08T00:42:37.000Z","description":"Alternative Intelligence x Elisa Rose Mountain\r\n\r\nThe front features a Hamsa design.
