Beside this is San Francisco’s Golden Gate bridge.\r\n\r\nThe same top right side corner represents the influences of Bob Dylan, Elvis, The Beach Boys, and the U.S.A. at the time of “Flower Power “ and the Vietnam War. It includes a marijuana leaf. \r\n\r\nThe ribbon thrown by the “ Fool On The Hill “ cuts through Ringo’s collar, goes through the window, and becomes Harrison’s collar. \r\n\r\nThe silver beetle under Lennon’s collar represents a name the band used for a brief time before settling on “ The Beatles. “ \r\n\r\nThe word “ Transcend “, above Harrison , refers to his Indian and Hare Krishna influences. The four large luminous blue stars simply represent the “ fab four. “ One is overlapped by a hand holding a gun, this refers to both Lennon’s song “ Happiness Is A Warm Gun “ and the gun that killed him.  It points to the walrus holding a white dove. “Give Peace A Chance” \r\n\r\nA list of all the 52 song titles is included with the print. \r\n\r\nThe Clues:\r\n\r\nAcross The Universe\r\nLet It Be\r\nAll You Need Is Love\r\nLucy In The Sky With Diamonds\r\nBack In The U.S.S.R\r\nMaxwell’s Silver Hammer\r\nBecause\r\nMichelle\r\nBeing For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite\r\nNorwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\r\nBirthday\r\nNowhere Man\r\nBlackbird\r\nOctopus’s Garden\r\nCan’t Buy Me Love\r\nOne After 909\r\nCarry That Weight\r\nPaperback Writer\r\nDrive My Car\r\nPenny Lane\r\n# 9 Dream \r\nRain\r\nEleanor Rigby\r\nRevolution\r\nFixing A Hole\r\nRocky Raccoon\r\nGive peace a chance\r\nRun For Your Life\r\nGood Day Sunshine\r\nSgt.
