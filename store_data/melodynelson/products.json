Sequins measure about 1/4\" in diameter and sit flat on the skin.  They're sturdy enough to stand up to years of everyday wear.  Brass sequins have gold-filled posts and backs, and silver-tone sequins have sterling silver posts and backs. All are attached to an antique cigarette trading card from the 1930s-40s, featuring the visage of a glamorous movie star.\r\n\r\nPlease bear in mind that these earrings are made from antique sequins so there are some inevitable signs of age, which, only add to their charm and character (see second photo). \r\n\r\nHandmade in New York City by Erica Weiner.\r\n\r\n(Photos courtesy of Erica Weiner)\r\n","options":[{"id":25590816,"name":"Gold","price":35.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25590837,"name":"Silver","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/79765617/-/Earrings_Sequin_Silver_L_1024x1024.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/79765617/-/Earrings_Sequin_Silver_L_1024x1024.jpg","width":460,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/79765257/-/sequinsmain_large.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/79765257/-/sequinsmain_large.jpeg","width":460,"height":480}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1876571,"name":"Jewellery","permalink":"jewellery","url":"/category/jewellery"},{"id":5062201,"name":"Vintage","permalink":"vintage","url":"/category/vintage"}]},{"id":7992252,"name":"Erica Weiner SALE Earrings: 'To Catch A Thief' & 'Santa Fe'","permalink":"erica-weiner-to-catch-a-thief-earrings","position":39,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/erica-weiner-to-catch-a-thief-earrings","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-11-14T12:41:08.000Z","description":"TO CATCH A THIEF:These 3.8cm lengths of brass-based rhinestone have been oxidized to look vintage.

The slimcut hipster pants are designed for style and comfort and are flattering on many body shapes.\r\n\r\nThe pants are cut a little longer (because it looks good) and the longer length tank covers the hips and protects from chill.  The tank is discretely embroidered with the DAISY DARK \"kitty\" logo, and is made from a deliciously comfortable sheer black 100% cotton jersey.\r\n\r\nThe pants are designed and made in Melbourne from a soft lightweight 100% cotton.  The floral cuff is 100% Japanese cotton.  The tank is from American Apparel - made in Los Angeles, sweatshop labor free.\r\n\r\nDAISY DARKS - perfect for sleep and lounging in, but also perfect out and about.\r\n\r\n3 different cuffs available: \r\n\r\n'Minkoff' (pics 1 & 2) a floral cuff of vintage pinks, yellows, oranges, green on a black background.
