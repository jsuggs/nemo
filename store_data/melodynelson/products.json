Sequins measure about 1/4\" in diameter and sit flat on the skin.  They're sturdy enough to stand up to years of everyday wear.  Brass sequins have gold-filled posts and backs, and silver-tone sequins have sterling silver posts and backs. All are attached to an antique cigarette trading card from the 1930s-40s, featuring the visage of a glamorous movie star.\r\n\r\nPlease bear in mind that these earrings are made from antique sequins so there are some inevitable signs of age, which, only add to their charm and character (see second photo). \r\n\r\nHandmade in New York City by Erica Weiner.\r\n\r\n(Photos courtesy of Erica Weiner)\r\n","options":[{"id":25590816,"name":"Gold","price":35.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25590837,"name":"Silver","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/79765617/-/Earrings_Sequin_Silver_L_1024x1024.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/79765617/-/Earrings_Sequin_Silver_L_1024x1024.jpg","width":460,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/79765257/-/sequinsmain_large.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/79765257/-/sequinsmain_large.jpeg","width":460,"height":480}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1876571,"name":"Jewellery","permalink":"jewellery","url":"/category/jewellery"},{"id":5062201,"name":"Vintage","permalink":"vintage","url":"/category/vintage"}]},{"id":7992252,"name":"Erica Weiner SALE Earrings: 'To Catch A Thief' & 'Santa Fe'","permalink":"erica-weiner-to-catch-a-thief-earrings","position":39,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/erica-weiner-to-catch-a-thief-earrings","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-11-14T12:41:08.000Z","description":"TO CATCH A THIEF:These 3.8cm lengths of brass-based rhinestone have been oxidized to look vintage.
