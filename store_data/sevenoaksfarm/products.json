Our dryer balls are made by hand by me right here on the farm using wet felting and needle felting techniques. The core is from Seven Oaks Farm alpaca with the outside layer being made of American sheep's wool. Our dryer balls come in 2 sizes, large and small and can be ordered unscented or you can choose from 10 essential oils scents. Both the large and small dryer balls come in set of 3, which we recommend to achieve maximum drying efficiency.\r\n\r\nDryer balls allow you to reduce your drying time by about 25-30%  when 3 small balls are used, the savings is even greater with the large set. The ball absorbs the moisture from your clothes in the dryer and releases it more quickly so your load is dry more quickly. Reduced drying time translates into money saved on your electric bill .\r\nThe dryer balls also help reduce static electricity and soften your clothes while they tumble in your dryer with a load of clothes. The dryer balls  beat against your clothing as they tumble, this tumbling action helps reduce static cling and reduce wrinkles plus your clothes will feel soft. This \"softness\" you feel in your laundry is one of the wonderful properties of natural wool. The softness will allow you to never have to buy fabric softener again, you can say goodbye to your dryer sheets, that will translate into huge saving for you. If you would like to scent your laundry you buy the set of dryer balls that come with a vile of 0.5 ounces essential oil and just add a drop or two to each ball. The scent last for several loads and you can buy more than one scent if you wish.\r\nAnother great benefit of using all natural dryer balls is to avoid some of the nasty chemicals  and allergens that many fabric softners contain. Dryer balls allow you to save money, save time and truly have a clean load of laundry that will have no added chemicals to worry about. \r\n\r\nDirections for use: Put your set of dryer balls into the dryer with your load of wet clothes. Dry the load on your usual setting. When the load is dry leave the dryer balls in the dryer, they will be dry and ready for the next load. It is that simple, just leave the balls in the dryer and they are always ready to use, you never need to remove them.\r\n\r\nDo they last? Yes, for many, many years. They are durable and will remain felted after many years of use. They can be easily repaired by you as well, if needed. Just put the ball into the toe of a sock and run the ball thru the wash and dry  cycles of your machine. That mends about anything and is easy to do.\r\n\r\nHow much essential oil do I use?  We use all natural essential oils that come in a 0.5 ounce resealable bottle in 10 fragrances we think you'll like. These oils can be strong, a little goes a long way, so start off with just a drop on each ball and add more to increase the aroma as you would like.\r\n\r\nWill the color on the dryer ball come off on my clothes?  The balls are originally made by washing them in hot water thru 2 wash cycles. This process stops any bleeding of color etc. and we use good quality wools so it should not be a problem. We have sets of white dryer balls that have no dyes or bleach in them at all, they are colored by Mother Nature. Some folks like to have a white set for lite colored loads and then a set of colored balls for darker clothes.\r\n\r\nWhy do you offer weighted dryer balls? We use the dryer balls in our own laundry for 5 boys and I have found that doing some of the heavier loads like jeans, towels etc,  it was helpful to increase the amount of tumbling the ball was doing in the dryer. I designed a weighted ball by adding river rock that is felted and then wrapped in alpaca wool and then finished like a regualr ball with wet felting and needle felting. These heavier balls were able to really move around well with the heavier fabrics and reduce wrinkles in really heavy loads. The weighted balls almost double the weight of each ball.\r\n\r\nHow many do I need? To get real effects of the reduced drying time you can noise, I recommend a set of 3 to start with. The more you put in a load the quicker the load will dry. I washed a load containing 7 regular bath towels and 5 pair of adult size jeans. The time for drying WITHOUT the dryer balls was a full 60 minutes. Washing the same load again the drying time with a set of LARGE dryer balls was 42 minutes. That is a significant savings of time and money!\r\n\r\nOther uses? Yes, you will find that your dryer balls will \"escape\" the dryer once in a while to be used as juggling balls or games of catch. So yes these make great toys since the light weight balls don't knock over items and are a bit safer to play with. Both size of balls are the perfect size for little hand and many are purchased as gifts for children of all ages. The fun doesn't stop there! Cats love these balls especial when they are scented with Catnip! A small sets are perfect for your feline friends and you can divide them up and give to all your cat loving friends too. The dryer balls area  great way to sent your clothing  drawers or entire home as well, they can be set out in a bowl or dish and scent an entire room with no fear of fires from candle flames. \r\n\r\n(When you are ready to purchase please list your essential oil choice in the note section at check out.)\r\n\r\nEssential Oils \r\n\r\nLavender  This essential oil has a fresh, floral herbaceous scent. True lavender scent.\r\n\r\nSweet Orange   This essential oil has a sweet, citrus smell much like the orange peels it is derived from, only more intense and concentrated, very pleasing to most.\r\n\r\nLemon (5 Fold) Strong essential oil that smells like fresh cut lemons, very fresh and pleasing to most.\r\n\r\nSweet Basil  This variety has a sweet vaguely anise-like, mint, smoky scent, very pleasing, clean, will remind you of your garden.\r\n\r\nTexas Cedarwood This oil has a sweet, balsamic wood scent, some masculine spicy notes as well.\r\n\r\nCotton Blossom This oil is a very clean, fresh laundry scent, lightly sweet, refreshing.\r\n\r\nWarmed Vanilla Sugar This oil is just what you expect, notes of vanilla and the aroma of sweet baked goodies drifting.\r\n\r\nBulgarian Rose This oil is a true rose scent, sweet, just like the freshly cut English roses in the bask yard.\r\n\r\nCucumber Melon   This oil is a mix of sweet melon put together with the clean crispness of cucumber. \r\n\r\nCatnip  This essential oil is truly loved by cats. We inject the core of the dryer balls to be used by our feline friends because it is such a strong oil. We do not send a vile with this set.

Our dryer balls are made by hand by me right here on the farm using wet felting and needle felting techniques. The core is from Seven Oaks Farm alpaca with the outside layer being made of American sheep's wool. Our dryer balls come in 2 sizes, large and small and can be ordered unscented or you can choose from 10 essential oils scents. Both the large and small dryer balls come in set of 3, which we recommend to achieve maximum drying efficiency.\r\n\r\nDryer balls allow you to reduce your drying time by about 25-30%  when 3 small balls are used, the savings is even greater with the large set. The ball absorbs the moisture from your clothes in the dryer and releases it more quickly so your load is dry more quickly. Reduced drying time translates into money saved on your electric bill .\r\nThe dryer balls also help reduce static electricity and soften your clothes while they tumble in your dryer with a load of clothes. The dryer balls  beat against your clothing as they tumble, this tumbling action helps reduce static cling and reduce wrinkles plus your clothes will feel soft. This \"softness\" you feel in your laundry is one of the wonderful properties of natural wool. The softness will allow you to never have to buy fabric softener again, you can say goodbye to your dryer sheets, that will translate into huge saving for you. If you would like to scent your laundry you buy the set of dryer balls that come with a vile of 0.5 ounces essential oil and just add a drop or two to each ball. The scent last for several loads and you can buy more than one scent if you wish.\r\nAnother great benefit of using all natural dryer balls is to avoid some of the nasty chemicals  and allergens that many fabric softners contain. Dryer balls allow you to save money, save time and truly have a clean load of laundry that will have no added chemicals to worry about. \r\n\r\nDirections for use: Put your set of dryer balls into the dryer with your load of wet clothes. Dry the load on your usual setting. When the load is dry leave the dryer balls in the dryer, they will be dry and ready for the next load. It is that simple, just leave the balls in the dryer and they are always ready to use, you never need to remove them.\r\n\r\nDo they last? Yes, for many, many years. They are durable and will remain felted after many years of use. They can be easily repaired by you as well, if needed. Just put the ball into the toe of a sock and run the ball thru the wash and dry  cycles of your machine. That mends about anything and is easy to do.\r\n\r\nHow much essential oil do I use?  We use all natural essential oils come in 0.5 ounce resealable bottles in 10 fragrances we think you'll like. These oils can be strong, a little goes a long way, so start off with just a drop on each ball and add more to increase the aroma as you would like.\r\n\r\nWill the color on the dryer ball come off on my clothes?  The balls are originally made by washing them in hot water thru 2 wash cycles. This process stops any bleeding of color etc. and we use good quality wools so it should not be a problem. We have sets of white dryer balls that have no dyes or bleach in them at all, they are colored by Mother Nature. Some folks like to have a white set for lite colored loads and then a set of colored balls for darker clothes.\r\n\r\nWhy do you offer weighted dryer balls? We use the dryer balls in our own laundry for 5 boys and I have found that doing some of the heavier loads like jeans, towels etc,  it was helpful to increase the amount of tumbling the ball was doing in the dryer. I designed a weighted ball by adding river rock that is felted and then wrapped in alpaca wool and then finished like a regualr ball with wet felting and needle felting. These heavier balls were able to really move around well with the heavier fabrics and reduce wrinkles in really heavy loads. The weighted balls almost double the weight of each ball.\r\n\r\nHow many do I need? To get real effects of the reduced drying time you can noise, I recommend a set of 3 to start with. The more you put in a load the quicker the load will dry. I washed a load containing 7 regular bath towels and 5 pair of adult size jeans. The time for drying WITHOUT the dryer balls was a full 60 minutes. Washing the same load again the drying time with a set of LARGE dryer balls was 42 minutes. That is a significant savings of time and money!\r\n\r\nOther uses? Yes, you will find that your dryer balls will \"escape\" the dryer once in a while to be used as juggling balls or games of catch. So yes these make great toys since the light weight balls don't knock over items and are a bit safer to play with. Both size of balls are the perfect size for little hand and many are purchased as gifts for children of all ages. The fun doesn't stop there! Cats love these balls especial when they are scented with Catnip! A small sets are perfect for your feline friends and you can divide them up and give to all your cat loving friends too. The dryer balls area  great way to sent your clothing  drawers or entire home as well, they can be set out in a bowl or dish and scent an entire room with no fear of fires from candle flames. \r\n\r\n(When you are ready to purchase please list your essential oil choice in the note section at check out.)\r\n\r\nEssential Oils \r\n\r\nLavender  This essential oil has a fresh, floral herbaceous scent. True lavender scent.\r\n\r\nSweet Orange   This essential oil has a sweet, citrus smell much like the orange peels it is derived from, only more intense and concentrated, very pleasing to most.\r\n\r\nLemon (5 Fold) Strong essential oil that smells like fresh cut lemons, very fresh and pleasing to most.\r\n\r\nSweet Basil  This variety has a sweet vaguely anise-like, mint, smoky scent, very pleasing, clean, will remind you of your garden.\r\n\r\nTexas Cedarwood This oil has a sweet, balsamic wood scent, some masculine spicy notes as well.\r\n\r\nCotton Blossom This oil is a very clean, fresh laundry scent, lightly sweet, refreshing.\r\n\r\nWarmed Vanilla Sugar This oil is just what you expect, notes of vanilla and the aroma of sweet baked goodies drifting.\r\n\r\nBulgarian Rose This oil is a true rose scent, sweet, just like the freshly cut English roses in the bask yard.\r\n\r\nCucumber Melon   This oil is a mix of sweet melon put together with the clean crispness of cucumber. \r\n\r\nCatnip  This essential oil is truly loved by cats. We inject the core of the dryer balls to be used by our feline friends because it is such a strong oil. We do not send a vile with this set. The scent will last for months!\r\n\r\nWhy the little red heart?

The time for drying WITHOUT the dryer balls was a full 60 minutes. Washing the same load again the drying time with a set of LARGE dryer balls was 42 minutes. That is a significant savings of time and money!\r\n\r\nOther uses? Yes, you will find that your dryer balls will \"escape\" the dryer once in a while to be used as juggling balls or games of catch. So yes these make great toys since the light weight balls don't knock over items and are a bit safer to play with. Both size of balls are the perfect size for little hand and many are purchased as gifts for children of all ages. The fun doesn't stop there! Cats love these balls especial when they are scented with Catnip! A small sets are perfect for your feline friends and you can divide them up and give to all your cat loving friends too. The dryer balls area  great way to sent your clothing  drawers or entire home as well, they can be set out in a bowl or dish and scent an entire room with no fear of fires from candle flames. \r\n\r\n(When you are ready to purchase please list your essential oil choice in the note section at check out.)\r\n\r\nEssential Oils \r\n\r\nLavender  This essential oil has a fresh, floral herbaceous scent. True lavender scent.\r\n\r\nSweet Orange   This essential oil has a sweet, citrus smell much like the orange peels it is derived from, only more intense and concentrated, very pleasing to most.\r\n\r\nLemon (5 Fold) Strong essential oil that smells like fresh cut lemons, very fresh and pleasing to most.\r\n\r\nSweet Basil  This variety has a sweet vaguely anise-like, mint, smoky scent, very pleasing, clean, will remind you of your garden.\r\n\r\nTexas Cedarwood This oil has a sweet, balsamic wood scent, some masculine spicy notes as well.\r\n\r\nCotton Blossom This oil is a very clean, fresh laundry scent, lightly sweet, refreshing.\r\n\r\nWarmed Vanilla Sugar This oil is just what you expect, notes of vanilla and the aroma of sweet baked goodies drifting.\r\n\r\nBulgarian Rose This oil is a true rose scent, sweet, just like the freshly cut English roses in the bask yard.\r\n\r\nCucumber Melon   This oil is a mix of sweet melon put together with the clean crispness of cucumber. \r\n\r\nCatnip  This essential oil is truly loved by cats. We inject the core of the dryer balls to be used by our feline friends because it is such a strong oil. We do not send a vile with this set. The scent will last for months!\r\n\r\nWhy the little red heart? It is a mark to show our commitment to providing quality service to our customers, our commitment to quality products and our commitment to giving back when we can.","options":[{"id":46498401,"name":"Natural Unscented","price":14.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46498404,"name":"Marbled Unscented","price":14.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46498407,"name":"Solid Blue Unscented","price":14.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46498410,"name":"Solid Green Unscented","price":14.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46498413,"name":"Grab Bag Mix Unscented","price":14.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46501602,"name":"Weighted Assorted Set Unscented","price":14.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47440851,"name":"Custom Color","price":14.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.95,"amount_with_others":5.95,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126368661/-/DSCN2026.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126368661/-/DSCN2026.JPG","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126368577/-/DSCN2011.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126368577/-/DSCN2011.JPG","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126368604/-/DSCN2022.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126368604/-/DSCN2022.JPG","width":1558,"height":1080},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126368616/-/DSCN2024.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126368616/-/DSCN2024.JPG","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126368631/-/DSCN2025.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126368631/-/DSCN2025.JPG","width":1920,"height":1080}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5597391,"name":"Made in the USA","permalink":"made-in-the-usa","url":"/category/made-in-the-usa"},{"id":3653411,"name":"Seven Oaks Farm Products","permalink":"seven-oaks-farm-products","url":"/category/seven-oaks-farm-products"},{"id":4759251,"name":"Hand Made Items","permalink":"hand-made-items","url":"/category/hand-made-items"},{"id":3710767,"name":"Gifts","permalink":"gifts","url":"/category/gifts"},{"id":3647647,"name":"Children's Items","permalink":"children-s-items","url":"/category/children-s-items"},{"id":3705377,"name":"Featured Item","permalink":"featured-item","url":"/category/featured-item"},{"id":3647847,"name":"New Items","permalink":"new-items","url":"/category/new-items"},{"id":3887508,"name":"Sale Items","permalink":"sale-items","url":"/category/sale-items"}]},{"id":14644005,"name":" Natural White Mohair Yarn Sport Weight 3 Ply","permalink":"natural-white-100-mohair-yarn-sport-weight-3-ply","position":8,"price":8.5,"default_price":8.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/natural-white-100-mohair-yarn-sport-weight-3-ply","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-05T21:00:12.000Z","description":"This is a beautiful, high luster, and exceptionally soft skein of yarn, 100 yards of 3 ply sport weight, made 100% from our own angora we raise on our farm at Seven Oaks Farm.

For example the blue corn\r\nharvested in September will produce a slightly different shade than the blue corn harvested in October. However, the shade family will be the same.  Misti’s Peruvian partner Calicampo is a dye studio that extracts the natural dyes and immediately hand paints our wonderful Alpaca yarns. The end result is one of the most organic and environmentally responsible yarns available in the market. We have developed proprietary techniques of extracting the dyes and hand painting our yarns that results in a wonderful color palette and a hand paint effect that is truly unique.\r\nSome of the most exciting features of Misti’s Best of Nature Worsted Alpaca collection are:\r\n\r\n● All dyes are extracted from vegetable and natural sources\r\n● Mordants used are also from natural sources and/or used in the lowest\r\nconcentration possible well in accordance with International Organic standards\r\n● The 100% Baby Alpaca yarn is the most organically produced natural fiber in the\r\nworld\r\n● All colors developed have passed color lightness tests conducted by independent\r\ntesting companies\r\n● The yarns are also hand painted in our partner dye studio, giving them the unique\r\nhand paint appearance\r\n\r\n100 gram twisted hank, 4 ply worsted weight, 218 yards (200 meters),  Suggested needle size: range of 4 1/2 to 5 stitches per inch on U.S. size #8/7/6 needle\r\n\r\nWe have new items arriving daily, if you don't see what you are looking for please ask.","options":[{"id":24659538,"name":"Napa # 03","price":19.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":24659535,"name":"Gold Coast #01","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26088849,"name":"Colorado #04","price":19.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76745856/-/BW03_Napa.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76745856/-/BW03_Napa.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76745832/-/BW01_Gold_Coast.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76745832/-/BW01_Gold_Coast.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76745880/-/BW04_Colorado.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76745880/-/BW04_Colorado.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3705377,"name":"Featured Item","permalink":"featured-item","url":"/category/featured-item"},{"id":3647847,"name":"New Items","permalink":"new-items","url":"/category/new-items"},{"id":3647645,"name":"Yarn and Roving","permalink":"yarn-and-roving","url":"/category/yarn-and-roving"}]},{"id":7813515,"name":" Misti Alpaca All Natural Dyed Yarn Chunky Weight","permalink":"chunky-misti-alpaca-all-natural-dyed-yarn","position":14,"price":19.99,"default_price":19.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/chunky-misti-alpaca-all-natural-dyed-yarn","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-03T18:05:43.000Z","description":"Misti Alpaca, Best of Nature is exquisitely soft and heavenly to knit.
