Fans of racing bikes will enjoy Greg LeMond’s Gitane, Guiseppe Saronni’s Colnago, and a 1930s Caminargent with aluminum frame.\r\n\r\nCyclotouring bikes include machines from Alex Singer, René Herse and Jo Routens, as well as the incredible Faure; made by a French jeweler. Counterpoints are provided by a Hirondelle Retro-Directe, a Labor with its single-leg fork, and a tandem that set the hour record in the 1930s. In addition to some photos that have been featured in books from Bicycle Quarterly Press, the calendar shows many previously unpublished detail photographs. \r\n\r\n<b>Free UK delivery</b>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"none\" data-via=\"Fingerprintdist\">Tweet</a><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>","options":[{"id":44528379,"name":"Default","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125069091/-/bq_calendar_2014.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125069091/-/bq_calendar_2014.jpg","width":650,"height":652},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125069094/-/bq_calendar_2014_back.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125069094/-/bq_calendar_2014_back.jpg","width":650,"height":650},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125069085/-/books_calendar_2014_det_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125069085/-/books_calendar_2014_det_1.jpg","width":650,"height":716},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125069088/-/books_calendar_2014_det_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125069088/-/books_calendar_2014_det_2.jpg","width":650,"height":716}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2355423,"name":"Bicycle Quarterly","permalink":"bicycle-quarterly","url":"/category/bicycle-quarterly"},{"id":412031,"name":"Accessories & Zines","permalink":"accessories-zines","url":"/category/accessories-zines"}]},{"id":15465222,"name":"Bicycle Quarterly Vol.12 No.2 (Winter 13)","permalink":"bicycle-quarterly-vol-12-no-2-winter-13","position":2,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bicycle-quarterly-vol-12-no-2-winter-13","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-10T17:29:42.000Z","description":"<b>Bicycle Quarterly Vol.12 No.2 (Winter 13)</b>\r\n\r\n<i>The Winter 2013 Bicycle Quarterly is about pushing beyond what you usually do.

Within these pages you’ll find poetry by Georgia’s J.P. Wares and Oregon’s Susan Denning and Genevieve Hudson, along with artwork by the talented Heather Dunn and the ever-raucous Mike Compton. Maureen Foley’s adventures of Smidge and Space roll toward an enlightening conclusion. Two friends climb a steep ascent and search secrets about themselves in Robert Grunau’s touching story.\r\n\r\nBut wait, there’s more! Mel Wells wonders why she’s on a bike in Belgium taking the gospel door to door. Valerie Steen bike commutes in Alaska—where it’s fifty below zero. Brett Albert Poulin demonstrates how to make a DIY frame bag. Their French correspondent Florent Carriere covers an alleycat race in Lyon. PhD candidate Jared McBride thinks deeply on why and how we transport ourselves. Katie Boehnlien rides through four amazing seasons. And to top the issue off, Bike Commuter Betty offers advice on dealing with scofflaws, and Stan Engelbrecht and Nic Grobler give you a photographic interview of bike commuters in South Africa.\r\n\r\nIn all, this issue is a testament to the fact that a cyclist is shaped and constantly remade by the sheer physicality and exhilaration of the bike ride itself. Bicycling, as you well know, profoundly affects the way one sees the world.\r\n\r\n<b>128 pages, perfect bound</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Free UK delivery</b>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\"

(Leporello) by Ugo Gattoni</b>\r\n\r\n<i>A Leporello is a folded single sheet, folded zig-zag fashion, often referred to as accordion pleat.</i>\r\n\r\nInspired by the 2012 London Olympic Games, Ugo Gattoni intricately drew a gigantic cycle race through the streets of England's capital. Gattoni depicts the street race to end all street races with an astonishingly detailed illustration that totals over twelve feet in length.\r\n\r\nAs the reader's eyes travel alongside \"Bicycle\"'s speeding cyclists, it soon becomes clear that this is no ordinary contest. Joining the elite athletes is a whole bunch of people including cycle couriers, commuters, bankers, delivery boys, mums with kids, youths on stolen mountain bikes, fashionistas, and hipsters riding their fixed gear bikes.\r\n\r\nFeaturing an embossed wrap-around jacket, Bicycle has been expertly manufactured in the European Union to the highest standards. Beautifully printed, this specially designed, extra-large concertina title can be read as a book or displayed as an Olympic-sized work of art. In a brilliant alternative take on the biggest sporting event of 2012, Gattoni combines homage with humor in this two-wheeled free-for-all. \r\n\r\nBicycle unfolds to nearly 2 metres in length, with intricate drawings on both sides, it forms, overall, a continuous scene of almost 4 metres.\r\n\r\n<b>Price includes UK delivery</b>\r\n\r\n<iframe

The piece 'Breakaway Stages' takes in Don Quixote by Bike, Godiva Awakes from the cutural Olympiad and other theatre groups using bicycles to explore the world around them as their stage. David Serrano's photo story turns the camera on the spectators of a touring stage and shows the theatre thats behind these big events.We hear from bee-keeping bikers, catch up with two very different bike projects in Toulon and New York and feature an amusing ode to something very familiar to everyday cyclist - the 'potbelly'.\r\n\r\nAlso, Boneshaker’s reached issue 10 - they’ve come a long way since the wide-eyed first forays of issue 1. To have reached their tenth issue with all there positivity and pure-heartedness intact really does feel like a significant point; and a bit like a birthday. So slip a couple of beers into your pannier alongside issue 10, roll out to your favourite spot and join in celebrating.\r\n\r\nThe publication has 64 pages, is perfect bound, advert free and printed on FSC approved uncoated Challenger Offset.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"none\" data-via=\"Fingerprintdist\">Tweet</a><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>","options":[{"id":23235607,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72051117/-/BS10_cover01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72051117/-/BS10_cover01.jpg","width":348,"height":469},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72051125/-/BS10_spread02.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72051125/-/BS10_spread02.jpg","width":700,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72051133/-/BS10_spread03.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72051133/-/BS10_spread03.jpg","width":700,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72051165/-/BS10_spread05.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72051165/-/BS10_spread05.jpg","width":700,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72051149/-/BS10_spread04.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72051149/-/BS10_spread04.jpg","width":700,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1638995,"name":"Boneshaker Magazine","permalink":"boneshaker-magazine","url":"/category/boneshaker-magazine"}]},{"id":7085673,"name":"Aged Pewter Bottle Hook Keyring by Corter Leather SOLD OUT","permalink":"aged-pewter-bottle-hook-by-corter-leather","position":49,"price":29.0,"default_price":29.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/aged-pewter-bottle-hook-by-corter-leather","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-28T19:59:21.000Z","description":"<b>Aged Pewter Bottle Hook by Corter Leather</b>\r\n\r\nThe Bottlehook is very simple, it's a beautiful key hook for your belt loop that also opens bottles, and includes a natural hand-stamped leather tab for your info in case it's left somewhere.\r\n\r\n-Cast in California\r\n-Plated steel for strength then plated for looks.

(multi tool, spare tube, tyre levers etc). Small YANCO & TRACKO tag to top of tool roll.\r\n\r\nWhen opened these measure 26cm by 24cm, and if you're not taking a bag they can be folded down really small and hung on the saddle rails (see the last photo).\r\n\r\nHandmade in the United States by Yanco.\r\n\r\n<b>This from Tracko:</b> <i>Let's talk packing. The tube always goes in the middle pocket and depending on how big it is it may need to be in a plastic bag to slide in easily. The Ramblin' Roll works with all road tubes and most cyclocross tubes. The CO2 cartridge, valve and small multi-tool in the left pocket. The far right is reserved for emergency money, rolling papers and tyre lever. Fold flap down, fold right and fold left side in. Like any tool roll, the Ramblin' Roll works best with it is compressed as tight as possible. I also like to keep all edges lined up, giving the Ramblin Roll a very tight and compact look. We likes things tight and tidy around here. When installing the Ramblin' Roll to the bike you wanna position the webbing on top, tuck in between your saddle's rails and place webbing over both rail, then wrap it around the Ramblin' Roll, insert into binding buckle, tighten down and tuck webbing into webbing-loop.</i>\r\n\r\n<b>Limited Quantity Available</b>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"none\" data-via=\"Fingerprintdist\">Tweet</a><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>","options":[{"id":11985478,"name":"Default","price":29.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63163965/-/Ramblin-Roll-YandT.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63163965/-/Ramblin-Roll-YandT.gif","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/34786246/-/Ramblin-Roll-2.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/34786246/-/Ramblin-Roll-2.gif","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63163973/-/Ramblin-Roll-YandT-Tag.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63163973/-/Ramblin-Roll-YandT-Tag.gif","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63163953/-/RamblinRollon_saddle.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63163953/-/RamblinRollon_saddle.jpg","width":792,"height":489}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":412031,"name":"Accessories & Zines","permalink":"accessories-zines","url":"/category/accessories-zines"},{"id":349981,"name":"Yanco Barpads & Accessories","permalink":"yanco-barpads-accessories","url":"/category/yanco-barpads-accessories"}]},{"id":6401775,"name":"Boneshaker Magazine Issue 9","permalink":"boneshaker-magazine-issue-9","position":64,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/boneshaker-magazine-issue-9","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-08T21:57:30.000Z","description":"<Boneshaker Magazine Issue 9</b>\r\n\r\nFrom diggin' mud to diggin' bike porn, issue 9 pulls together some pretty varied articles.

Many of the projects have a real 'go ahead and do-it-yourself' feel and Boneshaker hope the magazine inspires you to do the same.\r\n\r\nThe publication has 64 pages, is perfect bound, advert free and printed on FSC approved uncoated Challenger Offset.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"none\" data-via=\"Fingerprintdist\">Tweet</a><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>","options":[{"id":20390415,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/62870223/-/BS9_Cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/62870223/-/BS9_Cover.jpg","width":372,"height":487},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/62870239/-/BS9_spread_01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/62870239/-/BS9_spread_01.jpg","width":700,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/62870261/-/BS9_spread_02.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/62870261/-/BS9_spread_02.jpg","width":700,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/62870285/-/BS9_spread_03.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/62870285/-/BS9_spread_03.jpg","width":700,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/62870295/-/BS9_spread_06.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/62870295/-/BS9_spread_06.jpg","width":700,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1638995,"name":"Boneshaker Magazine","permalink":"boneshaker-magazine","url":"/category/boneshaker-magazine"}]},{"id":4907349,"name":"Conversations on the Coast Book","permalink":"conversations-on-the-coast-book","position":65,"price":16.5,"default_price":16.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/conversations-on-the-coast-book","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-22T22:22:58.000Z","description":"<b>Conversations on the Coast</b>\r\n\r\n<i>Stories from Nick Hand's Slow Coast Project (Nick is a regular contributor to Boneshaker magazine)</i>\r\n\r\nConversations on the Coast presents a selection of 20 stories and photography from the Slowcoast project.\r\n\r\nNick Hand set off on his bicycle from Bristol in the summer of 2009 to cycle over 6000 miles around the coast of the British Isles.

Rides: The Best BMX Bikes of All Time</b>\r\n\r\n<i>by Intercity, Gavin Lucas & Stuart Robinson</i>\r\n\r\nRad Rides is the most in-depth exploration of the world of BMX bikes through their riders and the culture that surrounds them. The introduction explains and contextualizes the birth of BMX culture and where it is now, while the main body features bikes ranging from those that are well-worn through years of riding to beautiful, sculptural works of art – gleaming, built-but-never-ridden keepsakes.\r\n\r\nThe featured bikes are organized decade by decade and are BMXs drawn from the best collections in the world. There are also in-depth details of specifications and interviews with some of the collectors, many of whom have had their bikes exclusively shot for the book. This is the indispensable companion for anyone who loves the BMX.\r\n\r\n<b>Contents:</b> Introduction, 1970s The birth of BMX, 1980s, 1990s, 2000–present.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the four main sections there are also the following features on BMX culture - BMX collectors, The multiple disciplines of BMX, Ephemera and a Contributors’ glossary.\r\n\r\nCard Cover\r\n400 Colour illustrations\r\n160 pages\r\n\r\n<b>Free UK Delivery</b>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"none\" data-via=\"Fingerprintdist\">Tweet</a><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>","options":[{"id":19436303,"name":"Default","price":22.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":6.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59763087/-/Rad-Rides-The-Best-BMX-Bikes-of-All-Time-Book.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59763087/-/Rad-Rides-The-Best-BMX-Bikes-of-All-Time-Book.jpg","width":600,"height":739},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59762959/-/P88_52-53.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59762959/-/P88_52-53.jpg","width":555,"height":343},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59762969/-/P88_60-61.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59762969/-/P88_60-61.jpg","width":555,"height":343},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59762985/-/PP20-37_20-21.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59762985/-/PP20-37_20-21.jpg","width":555,"height":343},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59762999/-/PP20-37_24-25.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59762999/-/PP20-37_24-25.jpg","width":555,"height":343}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":85179,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":6038575,"name":"A.R.T.

Enlightened Cyclist: Commuter Angst, Dangerous Drivers, and Other Obstacles on the Path to Two-Wheeled Transcendence</b>\r\n\r\n<i>by Eben Weiss</i>\r\n\r\nThe joys of commuting by bike attract scores of new converts every year. But as fresh-faced cyclists fill the roads, they also encounter their share of frustrations—careless drivers, wide-flung car doors, zoned-out pedestrians, and aggressive fellow cyclists, to name a few.\r\n\r\nIn this follow-up to the best-selling Bike Snob, BikeSnobNYC takes on the trials and triumphs of bike commuting with snark, humor, and enthusiasm, asking the question: If we become better commuters, will that make us better people? From the deadly sins of biking to tactics for dealing with cars, pedestrians, and other cyclists, this primer on bike travel is a must-read for cyclists new and seasoned alike.\r\n\r\nHardcover, 5 x 7

Magazine Issues 6 and 7 Bundle</b>\r\n\r\n<i> While stocks last, get two back issues with a 20% discount. </i>\r\n\r\n<b>Issue 6</b>\r\nArticles include the first in a series by Andrew Tobert on the dark art of bicycle maintenance, Trial and Error: a great insight into early memories of learning to ride a bike and some bicycle bling from Sudan. The contributions come from further and further afield and articles such as 'Cycling + Religion' and 'My Balls' keep the articles a little different from the norm.... in true Boneshaker style.\r\n\r\n<b>Issue 7</b>\r\nArticles in issue #7 include an expansive piece on Bike Polo: we hear about the history of the sport, insights by an tournament organiser, a rider, a newcomer to the sport and also some tips on mallet-making. Freestyle bike dancing from Gambia is on the menu, along with a great piece about anarcho-cyclist-poet Dennis Gould, another brilliant short story by Jet McDonald and a touching tale about the kindness of nomads in Tore Groenne's touring piece. Add it all together and it makes for a real diverse mix of human stories.... just how we like it.\r\n\r\nThe publications have 60 pages, are perfect bound, advert free, printed on FSC approved

In the tradition of BMX and skate movies, Empire follows New York’s best fixed gear riders and a few special out-of-town guests in and out of traffic all over New York City. Inspired by MASH and Lucas Brunelle, Empire is the first full-length fixed gear  film shot entirely in New York City. Featured riders include Tom Lamarche, WONKA, Dwaine, Yatika Starr Fields, Dagga, John Prolly, Kai Perez and surprise guests.\r\n\r\nThe DVD contains the nearly hour long feature, which screened to sold out audiences around the world for Bicycle Film Festival. It also includes a friends section with many surprises, all the internet trailers and over an hour of never-before-seen footage.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful package was designed by Jonah Birns, the man behind the look of the Red Hook Crit. The cover features Empire rider Dwain, and the interior is a stunning shot of a working messenger down Sixth Avenue taken by Christian Thormann.\r\n\r\n<b>The poster is the main image from the DVD cover featuring Empire rider Dwain. This stunning photograph, taken by Christian Thormann, was transformed into the Empire DVD cover by Jonah Birns as a beautiful photo-illustration evoking a classic Marvel comic book cover.

Schneider</i>\r\n\r\nNicholas Allander, 31—carless and careerless—is trying to get his life on track while holding his head high. He’s trying to pay off his debt, impress his girlfriend, keep his job, cast off his introversion, and accept the world’s imperfections without abandoning his heart. Unsure of what moves to make, though, he considers growing his beard, taking up alcoholism, abandoning scrounging, and owning an automobile—before too much slips by. All the while he clings to his bicycle, a simple machine whose purpose and workings he grasps.\r\n\r\nNick’s struggle to position his aesthetic within the world is the story of a perfectionist who is far from perfect, who is considerate but clumsy, and may be invisible. Like Nick, A Simple Machine, Like the Lever is short, toned, observant, generous, purposeful, and brimming with bicycle wisdom.\r\n\r\n<b>Card cover, 184 pages</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Free UK delivery</b>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/40479972?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"226\" height=\"95\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"none\" data-via=\"Fingerprintdist\">Tweet</a><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\r\n","options":[{"id":15801019,"name":"Default","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47855605/-/ASMLTLcover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47855605/-/ASMLTLcover.jpg","width":719,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1933414,"name":"The Boneshaker Almanac","permalink":"the-boneshaker-almanac","url":"/category/the-boneshaker-almanac"},{"id":85179,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":4845175,"name":"Boneshaker Magazine Issue 7","permalink":"boneshaker-magazine-issue-7","position":99,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/boneshaker-magazine-issue-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-14T16:13:34.000Z","description":"<b> Boneshaker Issue 7</b>\r\n\r\nArticles in issue #7 include an expansive piece on Bike Polo: we hear about the history of the sport, insights by an tournament organiser, a rider, a newcomer to the sport and also some tips on mallet-making.

It is book that celebrates 65 years of bicycle design by Condor and the things that are still to come. \r\n\r\nEmbossed Card Cover\r\n150 pages\r\nSize: 240mm x 170mm \r\n\r\n<b>Price includes UK delivery</b>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"none\" data-via=\"Fingerprintdist\">Tweet</a><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/30339288?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"226\" height=\"170\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen></iframe>","options":[{"id":14878937,"name":"Default","price":17.5,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/44500399/-/Cover1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/44500399/-/Cover1.jpg","width":556,"height":742},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/44500383/-/BikeHistoryPage.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/44500383/-/BikeHistoryPage.jpg","width":955,"height":689},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/44500415/-/HeavyMetal_Factory.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/44500415/-/HeavyMetal_Factory.jpg","width":1000,"height":756},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/44500391/-/Condor_People.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/44500391/-/Condor_People.jpg","width":993,"height":712},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/44500431/-/Retro_Jerseys.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/44500431/-/Retro_Jerseys.jpg","width":1000,"height":756}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":85179,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":4795409,"name":"The Boneshaker Almanac Volume 7","permalink":"the-boneshaker-almanac-volume-7","position":101,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-boneshaker-almanac-volume-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-07T21:37:28.000Z","description":"<b>The Boneshaker Almanac Volume 7\r\n(BA43-200)</b>\r\n\r\n<i>Modeled loosely after the United States War Department’s 1941 Soldier’s Basic Field Manual, Boneshaker: A Bicycling Almanac fashions itself to be the practical bicyclist’s literary periodical-style handbook.</i>\r\n\r\nThe almanac is a collective ode to the ride itself, that fundamentally lonesome experience one has in the saddle, and the results of repeating that ride over and over in different directions on different days with different destinations in each instance.\r\n\r\nWith interviews of respected members of the bicycling community, as well as profiles of bike-related grassroots organizations and individuals, not to mention essays, graphs, lists, letters, charts, maps, poems, schedules, manifestos, drawings, art, and stories, the Boneshaker Almanac attempts to shine light on utilitarian bicycling.\r\n\r\nIn the latest installment you will be reunited with Smidge & Space who are riding their bicycles as far west as they can go in Maureen Foley’s excellent graphic memoir excerpt. You will find superb and inspiring profiles of several families across the U.S. who are using bicycles as their primary mode of transportation. You will also not want to miss London-based writer and photographer Julian Birch explaining the pitfalls of the phenomenon known as Bicycle Retail Therapy.\r\n\r\nTo boot, Jonny Waldman’s enlightening travelogue will have you doubled over laughing, while Marc-Andre Chimonas’ interview with Renold Yip of Fort Collins’ own Yipsan Bicycles will have you yearning for an artisan frame this fall. Complete will poetry, a film-by-film review of the 10th annual Bicycle Film Festival, another full moon ride schedule, and a handy chart for riding in pairs, issue BA 43-200 will make excellent reading as you break from riding through all those fallen leaves.\r\n\r\n<b>We are the only stockist outside of the United States of this publication</b>\r\n\r\n<b>128 pages, perfect bound</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Free UK delivery</b>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"none\" data-via=\"Fingerprintdist\">Tweet</a><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>","options":[{"id":15665201,"name":"BA43-200","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47855765/-/BA43-200Cover.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47855765/-/BA43-200Cover.gif","width":629,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47201007/-/BA43-200-Spread-2.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47201007/-/BA43-200-Spread-2.gif","width":612,"height":486},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47201023/-/BA43-200-Spread-3.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47201023/-/BA43-200-Spread-3.gif","width":612,"height":486},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47201039/-/BA43-200-Spread-4.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47201039/-/BA43-200-Spread-4.gif","width":612,"height":486},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47200991/-/BA43-200-Spread-1.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47200991/-/BA43-200-Spread-1.gif","width":612,"height":486}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1933414,"name":"The Boneshaker Almanac","permalink":"the-boneshaker-almanac","url":"/category/the-boneshaker-almanac"}]},{"id":4933047,"name":"Boneshaker Magazine Issues 3 and 4 Bundle","permalink":"boneshaker-magazine-issues-3-and-4-bundle","position":102,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/boneshaker-magazine-issues-3-and-4-bundle","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-25T17:28:23.000Z","description":"<b>Boneshaker Magazine Issues 3 and 4 Bundle</b>\r\n\r\n<i> While stocks last, get the two earliest available back issues with a 20% discount. </i>\r\n\r\n<b>Issue 3</b>\r\nArticles include ‘My Beautiful Bike’ by Minotaur Shock, an 8-page profile on the artisans of Portland, Oregon and more Slowcoast antics from Nick Hand.

DVD</b>\r\n\r\n<i>Directed by David Rowe</i>\r\n\r\nFor fixed-gear cyclists, Los Angeles is a city that has it all. From the neon glow of Hollywood to the sun-drenched boardwalk of Venice Beach, fixed-gear has evolved into a vibrant street culture that is uniquely L.A. From director David Rowe (Fast Friday) comes a new documentary feature that explores a side of L.A. few outsiders have seen.\r\n\r\nFrom races through rush-hour traffic to midnight loft parties, To Live & Ride in L.A. is a fast paced-trip through the busy streets and back-alleys of one of the world's largest cities. To Live & Ride In L.A. features talented local riders tearing up the streets with first-time visitor Keo Curry (Fast Friday & Macaframa).\r\n\r\nBike to hidden spots off the map, race a midnight alley-cat, keep pace with the riders from Wolfpack, and hang with the local crews, graffiti artists and other L.A. personalities.\r\n\r\n<b>The DVD has 40 minutes of exclusive extras</b> including

Film about the Birth of Mountain Bikes</i>\r\n\r\nLong before the mountain bike entered our global consciousness, the cycling enthusiasts of Northern California's Marin County rode modified pre-WWII bicycles down the slopes of Mount Tamalpais. They developed their bikes through rigorous field-testing, often risking life and limb to do so.\r\n\r\nIt was from these humble beginnings that a multi-billion dollar industry, a form of recreation for the masses, and an Olympic event, were born. These hefty steeds were affectionately known as Klunkerz.\r\n\r\nKlunkerz is a fast-moving documentary that traces the global rise of mountain biking from it's Marin County roots, a gonzo sport long favored by fearless iconoclasts. An outgrowth of the Bay Area's late-'60s early-'70s hippy counterculture, mountain biking got its start right in MVFF's backyard. Pot-smoking adrenaline junkies from Mill Valley, Larkspur and surrounding towns took their pre-World War II bicycles known as klunkerz due to their fat tires, to the top of Mt. Tamalpais, then hurled themselves down dirt paths, risking life and limb in search of a killer high.\r\n\r\nArchival footage, rare photos and interviews with klunkerz trailblazers merge in this terrific film that races downhill toward mountain-bike bliss.\r\n\r\nStarring: Joe Breeze, Gary Fisher, Alan Bonds, Charlie Kelly, Tom Ritchey, Russ Mahon, Bob Burrowes, Wende Cragg, Charlie Cunningham, Otis Guy, Jaquie Phelan, Steve Potts, John Finley Scott, Robert Stewart, Fred Wolf.

The film weaves the story of three characters’ experiences with immense mountain beauty and small-town culture as they attempt to pedal from Banff, Canada to a small, dusty crossing on the Mexican border.\r\n\r\nMike, a 40-year old family man who uses this challenge to chart a new course in life; Matthew, a leader in extreme endurance racing who’s competing for his 5th time; and Mary, the ﬁrst female rider to race this route, will set out to accomplish what very few have been able to. Over the course of a few weeks they’ll attempt to climb over 200,000 vertical feet over the Rocky Mountains. That’s the equivalent of ascending Mount Everest from sea level seven times.\r\n\r\nThey’ll experience mental breakdowns, treacherous snow, hellacious blisters, and total fatigue. Above all, they’ll race with no support – at times in total isolation.\r\n\r\nExtras:\r\nMatthew Lee's Divide Racing Bike, Extended Interviews, Deleted Scenes, Racers' Daily Audio Call In's, Filmmaker Audio Commentary.\r\n\r\n<b>Free UK Shipping</b>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"none\" data-via=\"Fingerprintdist\">Tweet</a><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\r\n<br>\r\n<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/9654326?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"226\" height=\"127\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":9891703,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27391604/-/Ride-the-Divide-Cover_web.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27391604/-/Ride-the-Divide-Cover_web.gif","width":729,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27608667/-/press-RTD-mary-NM-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27608667/-/press-RTD-mary-NM-2.jpg","width":1000,"height":905},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27608651/-/press-RTD-matt-CO.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27608651/-/press-RTD-matt-CO.jpg","width":1000,"height":664},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27608683/-/press-mike-snow.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27608683/-/press-mike-snow.jpg","width":1000,"height":563},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27608675/-/press-matt_in_rain_clouds-cc.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27608675/-/press-matt_in_rain_clouds-cc.jpg","width":1000,"height":563}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":80705,"name":"DVDs","permalink":"dvds","url":"/category/dvds"}]},{"id":2829579,"name":"The Cyclocross Meeting DVD SOLD OUT","permalink":"the-cyclocross-meeting-dvd","position":142,"price":24.0,"default_price":24.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-cyclocross-meeting-dvd","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-10-29T20:37:19.000Z","description":"<b>The Cyclocross Meeting DVD</b>\r\n\r\n<i>A film about American & Japanese cyclocross</i>\r\n\r\nThe new film from Brian Vernor (Pure Sweet Hell, Where Are You Go) about the exploding US cyclocross scene, and the emerging Japanese cyclocross scene.\r\n\r\nThe Cyclocross Meeting follows Barry Wicks and Adam Mcgrath to top US races in New Jersey and Oregon, and then to Japan, where they compete with seven time Japanese National Champion Keiichi Tsujiura, and the up and coming talent Yu Takenouchi.\r\n\r\nIn the film, we also catch a visit to 35 year veteran master frame builder Shigeru Nakagawa. \r\n\r\n<b>Free UK Shipping</b>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"none\" data-via=\"Fingerprintdist\">Tweet</a><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n<object width=\"226\" height=\"152\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/a11XktXlX6s?fs=1&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;rel=0\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/a11XktXlX6s?fs=1&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;rel=0\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"226\" height=\"152\"></embed></object>","options":[{"id":9891626,"name":"Default","price":24.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27391360/-/Cyclocross_Meeting_Cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27391360/-/Cyclocross_Meeting_Cover.jpg","width":432,"height":576}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":80705,"name":"DVDs","permalink":"dvds","url":"/category/dvds"}]},{"id":2843921,"name":"The Nine Ball Diaries DVD","permalink":"the-nine-ball-diaries-dvd","position":143,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-nine-ball-diaries-dvd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-11-05T20:14:24.000Z","description":"<b>The Nine Ball Diaries</b>\r\n\r\n<i>A Documentary</i>\r\n\r\nRide along with road racing's golden boy, Tim Johnson, as he wraps up his day job and makes the transition to compete in his true love: Cyclocross.

Through their manipulation of steel, aluminum and titanium, the builders of Bespoke produce racing bicycles that speed champion athletes to victory, mountain and cyclocross bicycles built to negotiate vertiginous terrain, urban bicycles that stylishly convey commuters, and randonneur bicycles elegantly stripped down for epic journeys.\r\n\r\nCandid portraits including builder’s inspirations, working methods and bicycles, lavishly photographed in great detail, highlight this exhibition at New York’s Museum of Arts and Design.

Klanten and S. Ehmann</b>\r\n\r\nVelo is a striking visual journey into the multifaceted world of cycling and the diverse tribes that inhabit it. These range from hardcore 2-wheel globetrotters, downtown messengers on fixed-gear bikes without brakes, laid back pedallers on old-fashioned Dutch bicycles, fashionable cyclists on vintage racing bikes, and dedicated fans of high-tech racing machines and e-bikes. The book also gives insider views into the production halls of renowned Italian and French brands as well as the workshops of a new generation of passionate frame builders in the US.\r\n\r\nVelo presents the design and visual aesthetic of today’s cycling culture. The book features examples of T-shirts, caps, bags, flyers, and special equipment such as the spoke cards that bike messengers use in their alleycat races. It also explores the impact the cycling movement is making on contemporary art.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Velo documents the relevance of bicycles in both rural and urban areas. It introduces innovative urban planning concepts such as the new bike lanes that are currently emerging in Manhattan and Copenhagen. \r\n\r\n<b>240 pages, full colour, soft cover \r\nFree UK mainland shipping</b>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"none\" data-via=\"Fingerprintdist\">Tweet</a><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>","options":[{"id":9598794,"name":"Default","price":32.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26378859/-/velo_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26378859/-/velo_cover.jpg","width":500,"height":622},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26378847/-/velo_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26378847/-/velo_3.jpg","width":565,"height":350},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26378875/-/velo_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26378875/-/velo_2.jpg","width":565,"height":350},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26378879/-/velo_4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26378879/-/velo_4.jpg","width":565,"height":350},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26378899/-/velo_6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26378899/-/velo_6.jpg","width":565,"height":350}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":85179,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":2728483,"name":"Urban Velo Magazine #21 September 2010","permalink":"urban-velo-magazine-21-september-2010","position":156,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/urban-velo-magazine-21-september-2010","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-09-01T16:57:43.000Z","description":"<b>Urban Velo Magazine #21 September 2010</b>\r\n\r\n<i>Bicycle Culture on the Skids</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Urban Velo is a bi-monthly magazine that is a reflection of the cycling culture in current day cities.</i>\r\n\r\nContents Include:\r\n\r\nDo It By Bike In Denver, Fixed Freestyle Evolution, Countywide, I Love Riding in the City, From Cradle to Pave: Planning Your Bicycle Network, Gallery: Torneo de Bici Polo Tapatío, Residue, NYFC, Brake Lever Compatibility, Quick Release History, Maximize Solvent Use, No Exit.\r\n\r\n<b>94 colour pages</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Free UK delivery</b>","options":[{"id":9587617,"name":"Default","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26338825/-/Urban_Velo_21_Cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26338825/-/Urban_Velo_21_Cover.jpg","width":495,"height":594},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/32892796/-/UV_Iss_21_p44-45.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/32892796/-/UV_Iss_21_p44-45.jpg","width":1000,"height":611},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/32892804/-/UV_Iss_21_p50-51.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/32892804/-/UV_Iss_21_p50-51.jpg","width":1000,"height":611},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/32892812/-/UV_Iss_21_p68-69.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/32892812/-/UV_Iss_21_p68-69.jpg","width":1000,"height":611}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":283138,"name":"Urban Velo Magazine","permalink":"urban-velo-magazine","url":"/category/urban-velo-magazine"}]},{"id":2600244,"name":"Bike Snob: Systematically & Mercilessly Realigning the World of Cycling","permalink":"bike-snob-systematically-mercilessly-realigning-the-world-of-cycling-book","position":157,"price":14.0,"default_price":14.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bike-snob-systematically-mercilessly-realigning-the-world-of-cycling-book","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-06-03T20:59:58.000Z","description":"<b>Bike Snob: Systematically & Mercilessly Realigning the World of Cycling Book</b>\r\n\r\n<i>by Eben Weiss</i>\r\n\r\nCycling is exploding in a good way.

Revival DVD</b>\r\n\r\nThe Revival brings together 17 of the worlds best fixed gear riders to show the many different styles of riding that exist within the sport. In 2009 the sport felt very undefined with branches of the sport shooting off in all directions. They wanted to capture all of this whether it was the bmx-influenced tricks on the East coast or the more traditional track bike tech tricks from the West.\r\n\r\nThey also wanted to show that speed is still a defining side of the sport and they captured some of the fastest riders on the planet rocketing down the mountain sides of Vancouver BC.  The Revival was an attempt that successfully helps define the sport and its entire make up while breathing some new life into the community.\r\n\r\nThe most progressive fixed gear riding ever documented from both coasts of North America.  Riders from Seattle, Vancouver, Toronto and New York City have unearthed the potential of these modern day machines.  Hill bombs in excess of 80 km/h and tricks that have never been captured before on film tell the story of what this movement is all about.

This video depicts the BMX lifestyle. It is the culmination of all the trips and sessions, all of the triumphs and failures. BMX is, and always will be, about having fun and hanging out with your buddies. It is more than a hobby, and its something that will always be there for us. The places we see and the people we meet along the way become life long friends and it’s all because of a bicycle.\r\n\r\nRefresh brings you the local street riders of Seattle and Bellingham. Filmed in HD by Brian Chace, who also brought you Here and Now, and Fresh Fish.

In Pedal, Sutherland documents bike messengers competing in the 2005 Cycle Messenger World Championships in New York City. Going straight to the center of this urban subculture, Sutherland serves up compelling portraits of the competitors from dozens of countries, in motion and at ease, checking out each other's bags, lingering over modifications to bikes and bodies. Between events like sprints, distance racing, and skid contests, Sutherland shows us the riders' elegant physicality, complex individuality, and unique community that crosses boundaries of race, gender, age, and class.\r\n\r\nAnd he doesn't shy away from the blood and bruises that come part and parcel with the messenger's life. Sutherland delves deep into the world of the messengers--a world usually seen from the outside--and returns with a dynamic document that evokes the unbridled anarchy and energy of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying DVD is a fast-paced documentary film about surviving in the streets of New York City as a bicycle messenger. It features messengers from all walks of life as they battle traffic in a race to make their next delivery on time. Directed by Sutherland and produced by Ana Lombardo, Pedal the documentary lets viewers live the spectacle of the delivery itself.\r\n\r\n<b>112 Pages</b>\r\n\r\n<b>97 full colour photographs</b>\r\n\r\n<b>DVD approx 56 minutes.</b>","options":[{"id":520848,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/4921331/-/Pedal.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/4921331/-/Pedal.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37314884/-/Pedal-Book22.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37314884/-/Pedal-Book22.gif","width":814,"height":576},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37314892/-/Pedal-Book18.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37314892/-/Pedal-Book18.gif","width":814,"height":576},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37314900/-/Pedal-Book32.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37314900/-/Pedal-Book32.gif","width":814,"height":576},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/507893/-/pedal_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/507893/-/pedal_1.jpg","width":340,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":85179,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":80705,"name":"DVDs","permalink":"dvds","url":"/category/dvds"}]},{"id":316826,"name":"Bootleg Sessions v.3 Fixed Gear DVD","permalink":"bootleg-sessions-v-3-fixed-gear-dvd","position":177,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bootleg-sessions-v-3-fixed-gear-dvd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-06-07T23:35:13.000Z","description":"Just because you've gotten to where you're going doesn't mean you have to get off your bike.

Their craftsmanship was not limited to the frame, but included hand-made derailleurs, brakes, stems, racks and other components. The entire bicycle was carefully designed and crafted as a unit, combining function and beauty. Famous makers like René Herse, Alex Singer, Jo Routens and others spent countless hours on each bicycle in their search for perfection.\r\n\r\nWith lavish photography, The Golden Age of Handbuilt Bicycles charts the development of these machines from the early 1900s through the present day. The 50 classic bicycles in this book display amazing craftsmanship, elegance and function. Each brought innovations that continue to be used today. Additional historic photos show the bikes in competition and with their original owners. Insightful descriptions set the scene for each bicycle and explain its details. Here you find machines with a level of craftsmanship that never has been surpassed.\r\n\r\n<b>Hardback</b>\r\n<b>168 pages</b>\r\n<b>200 Black & White illustrations</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Free delivery to the UK mainland</b>","options":[{"id":2348541,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/5291801/-/Handbuilt_Bicycles.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/5291801/-/Handbuilt_Bicycles.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/5291841/-/Handbuilt_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/5291841/-/Handbuilt_2.jpg","width":356,"height":449},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/5291881/-/Handbuilt_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/5291881/-/Handbuilt_3.jpg","width":362,"height":449},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/5291921/-/Handbuilt_4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/5291921/-/Handbuilt_4.jpg","width":357,"height":449},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/5291961/-/Handbuilt_5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/5291961/-/Handbuilt_5.jpg","width":472,"height":378}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":85179,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":335999,"name":"Death Pedal!
