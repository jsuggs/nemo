Most Fez that you see are red...standard Turkish Fez color. Like Shriners in the Christmas Parade. They do great work by the way. I said something about a Fez being funny once and a guy almost picked a fight with me. Don't make fun of Shriners for god's sake. Anyway, this Fez is white felt with little perforations on top for breathability. It has a cool red tassle and a very colorful jewel logo on the front that says SHAARU 37 at the top and SAN DIEGO CA across the bottom. And, if you are so bold, it looks great to wear on those special Fez occasions.

Those folks do good work!\r\n\r\nNow on to the description. These three vintage skateboards are all original from the 1970s. This board was reproduced at some point more recently, but none of these are repros. And that's really almost beside the point anyway, because the more important thing about these boards is that they are autographed by a TON of HUGE stars including Tony Hawk, Miley Cyrus, Shaun White, Travis Pastrana and MANY more. See the full list below...or as full as I can get it. I personally had all these stars sign this board, so I can personally guarantee that they are as real as it gets. I will carefully pack them and ship to you and you can display them however the heck you want. \r\n\r\nHere's the list of autographs (there may be more that I've missed):\r\n\r\nSkateboard legend Tony Hawk\r\nOlympic Gold Medalist Shaun White\r\nActress, musician, teen idol Miley Cyrus\r\nX Games star and NASCAR driver Travis Pastrana\r\nTennis legend Andrea Jaeger\r\nSan Diego Chargers punter Mike Scifres\r\nComedian Todd Glass\r\nJosh Todd of Buckcherry\r\nJackass Star Bam Margera\r\nComedian Tom Green\r\nActor, TV reality star, BMXer Mike \"Rooftop\" Escamilla\r\nActor, Director John Favreau\r\nHall of Fame basketball legend Bill Walton\r\n\r\nSkateboard legends and stars:\r\nLance Mountain (Bones Brigade)\r\nSteve Caballero (Bones Brigade)\r\nChristian Hosoi\r\nChris Miller\r\nMatt Hensley\r\nDanny Way\r\nBucky Lasek\r\nPierre Luc Gagnon\r\nMike Vallely\r\nColin McKay\r\nStevie Williams\r\nJake Brown\r\nAdrian Demain\r\nCookiehead Jenkins\r\nLester Kasai\r\nMiki Vuckovich (photograher and writer)\r\nAlan Lorifice\r\nWilly Santos\r\nOwen Nieder\r\nRay Barbee\r\nMike Crum\r\nChad Reed\r\nZack Warden\r\nChad Knight\r\nMathias Ringstrom\r\nJesse Fritsch\r\nAndy Macdonald\r\nLincoln Ueda\r\nNeal Hendrix\r\nSandro Dias\r\nRune Glifberg\r\nLyn-Z Adams Hawkins Pastrana (first woman to do a 540 and married to Travis Pastrana)\r\nJean Postec\r\nBuster Halterman\r\nDave Andrecht\r\nEddie Elguera\r\nPaul Schmitt (the professor!)\r\nJust added!

They range in size: 3.5\"x3.5\", 3.5\"x5.5\" and 5.5\"x6.5\".\r\n\r\nThese are all vintage...not reproductions. I actually used them in the packaging design for a CD of old traditional music. The largest and most faded of the group became known as my fictional band, The Small Pox Mountain Boys. They appear to be a group of musicians that may have been quarantined back in the days of small pox or even tuberculosis. There is a sheriff standing guard over them as they pose with their instruments. The other two shots were also used in the package design and these three shots together would make a really cool group of photos framed on your wall or wherever you personally hang your photos. I just assume it's walls, but you never know.\r\n\r\nYou get all three photos for the same low, low price!

Why not award them for being so awesome? \r\n\r\nIt's gold like most trophys and it's on a marble and wood base. It stands approximately 7.5\" tall and it commands a presence. The only thing worth mentioning that is not awesome is that there was once an engraved plate on the front of the trophy which is now missing and you can slightly see where that engraving was adhered to the wood. I think it's fine how it is, but you could always go down to your local trophy shop or UPS Store (seriously) and order a new engraved plaque for your loved one.

First the technical details: it's 14\" x 22\" and it's hand painted on thick poster board from back in the day. The corners are kind of bent up and it's not in perfect condition by any stretch of the imagination. But, the important areas...the artwork...is all in really great condition. This is one of those rare items that is so cool, you just have to overlook the bent-up corners and rough edges. \r\n\r\nNow for the cool story part. This poster comes from an era when regional promoters would have carnivals and daredevil acts and human oddities and, yes, High Diving Aqua Mules. Jonny Rivers was just such a promoter and would travel around the region to what you might call booking tradeshows to promote his act to smaller towns that would book county fairs and holiday events. They would all meet at a local hotel and the promoters would put up posters on an easel in the lobby. You can see on this poster where it says \"ROOM\" at the top with blank paper under it. Jonny would write the hotel room number he was in and people would know to go to that room to learn all about the acts that he represented. The High Diving Aqua Mules were miniature mules that would be forced to jump off a 30 foot high platform into a \"pool\" of water six feet deep. I've seen old black and white footage of just such an act and a Google search shows that they were still doing this act even in recent times. \r\n\r\nThis poster is obviously rare and one-of-a-kind. You'll never find another one, that's for sure. Get it before it's gone forever.","options":[{"id":19861659,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":12.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61147255/-/aquamules.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61147255/-/aquamules.jpg","width":636,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3239785,"name":"Vintage Stuff","permalink":"vintage-stuff","url":"/category/vintage-stuff"}]}]
