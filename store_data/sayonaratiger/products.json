Proof\n\n\tFor fans of Copeland, Lovedrug, The Format\n\n\tSayonara Tiger writes impossibly memorable hooks, and they don&#8217;t just save them all for choruses, as each song on the EP is laden with hard-to-forget melodies. For such a young group (most members are early-twentysomethings), the songwriting is remarkably mature. While melody reigns supreme, the band avoids some of the cookie-cutterness of Pop by throwing in plenty of songwriting shifts, building the songs like adventurous architects who understand that, while the structure has to be sturdy, it doesn&#8217;t mean there&#8217;s no room for a few unexpected flourishes. Stand-out track &#8220;Heart Attack&#8221; is a near perfect Pop song, unspooling with chiming piano, imaginative drum parts, warm, winding guitars and layered, ear-tugging vocals. Elsewhere, &#8220;Bacharach Bites Back&#8221; is a grand, driving slab of soaring AltPop, laced with wiggly, Moog-y synth runs, while &#8220;Nice Meeting You&#8221; is an impressively dynamic mini-epic (in four minutes, the song shifts moods more often than someone trying to quit smoking) that recalls an updated version of Sunny Day Real Estate.\n\n","options":[{"id":57096,"name":"Default","price":6.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/22446/-/300.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/22446/-/300.png","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":19513,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":11708,"name":"Beige 5\" X 2\" Sticker","permalink":"beige-5-x-2-sticker","position":2,"price":1.0,"default_price":1.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/beige-5-x-2-sticker","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2007-01-29T22:56:03.000Z","description":"5&#8221;x2&#8221; Beige &#8220;SAYONARA <span class=\"caps\">TIGER</span>&#8221; Sticker is the perfect accessorie for any Sayonara Tiger fan.
