That's why this piece is aptly named 'Bird of Hope' as Alleva manifests the gift of hope within the printed image. \r\n\r\nThis piece has emerged out of the 'Bird & Stone' zine, by 'Alleva printmaker' that made it's way to the Museum of Contemporary Arts', 6th Annual Zine Fair, in 2013.\r\n\r\nPaper size is larger then A3 but image size is approx. 25 cm diameter.\r\nEach print is beautifully signed in lead pencil with the edition number, titled 'Bird of Hope' dated and signed by Katie Alleva. The print will be posted in a wide post tube with tracking number and insurance.\r\n\r\nProfessionally framed in white of beech total - $274\r\n\r\nTactile.\r\n\r\nBlack & White. \r\n\r\nBird, with a message of hope.\r\n\r\nwww.allevaprintmaker.com\r\n\r\nYou can find us on facebook as 'Alleva printmaker.'","options":[{"id":31646029,"name":"Default","price":124.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.95,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.9,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":9,"name":"China","code":"CN"}},{"amount_alone":11.9,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":17.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122856423/-/magpir-large.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122856423/-/magpir-large.jpg","width":850,"height":850},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122856399/-/magpie-detail.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122856399/-/magpie-detail.jpg","width":850,"height":565},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122856441/-/magpie-print01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122856441/-/magpie-print01.jpg","width":850,"height":565}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5562249,"name":"LIMITED EDITION PRINTS","permalink":"limited-edition-prints","url":"/category/limited-edition-prints"}]}]
