The two middle points consist of an multi-floral pin, and a large single flower pin. All vintage elements included on this piece are Coro vintage jewelry.\r\n\r\nThese vintage elements no longer function for their prior use, therefore they can no longer be used as earrings or pins but instead have been redefined and transformed into this stunning statement necklace that can be worn with practically anything.\r\n\r\nThis necklace can be dressed down for everyday wear or be dressed up elegantly enough to be \"something old\" you wear for your wedding day! This piece really is a hidden treasure and it will easily turn into one of your favorite items in your jewelry box!

This necklace would catch anyone's eye! \r\n\r\nThis necklace is made of a set of vintage clip-on earrings and a pin that contain little sky blue enamel flowers! Additional elements include a pin that takes the shape of a leaf with sky blue, grass green and foggy white rhinestones and clip-on earrings adorning the framing of your neck that share similar colors and style to the leaf pin.\r\n\r\nThese vintage elements no longer function for their prior use, therefore they can no longer be used as earrings or pins but instead have been redefined and transformed into this stunning statement necklace that can be worn with practically anything.\r\n\r\nAll my re-purposed vintage jewelry is made with vintage components dating back as far as 60 years! So they have stories, personalities, and character of their own. These are not things you will find at a store, they are special and unique. \r\n\r\nThis necklace can be dressed down for everyday wear or be dressed up elegantly enough to be \"something old\" you wear for your wedding day! This piece really is a hidden treasure and it will easily turn into one of your favorite items in your jewelry box!\r\n\r\nDue to the weight of the item, shipping will be more expensive on vintage re-purposed pieces.

The necklace is comprised of vintage components as well as floral cabochons. The cabochons are both red and are different sizes. To the left (in picture) of the main focal flower is a rhinestone vintage crown pin (a David crown pin) (research it - it's amazing!), displaying various colors. These crown pins are hard to find in the vintage or flea market world today and are a real gem! To the right (in picture) of the main focal flower is a vintage bug pin that resembles a bee, he is gold in color and has luminescent rhinestones throughout his wings. At the top of each side of the necklace is a matching pair of vintage clip on earrings in red, they also contain luminescent multicolored rhinestones as well that compliment the crown. The backing of all of these vintage elements has been removed to provide a more fluent and formatted look to the necklace, this allows the necklace to lay even on your chest and show off each piece evenly.\r\n\r\nThank you for looking! This is part of my spring collection for 2013 and I am very excited about it!\r\n\r\nCheck out my link for other websites and contact info :)","options":[{"id":31212565,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99557215/-/photo_1-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99557215/-/photo_1-1.jpg","width":1000,"height":966}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4842244,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]}]
