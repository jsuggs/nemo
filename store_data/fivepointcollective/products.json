The city was growing so rapidly that the stumps of trees cut down to make way for roads were left behind until manpower could be spared to remove them. In some areas the stumps remained for so long that locals whitewashed them to make them more visible. They also used them to cross the street without sinking into the mud. Captain John C. Ainsworth commented that there were \"more stumps than trees\" in Portland in the early 1850s.\r\n\r\n*SHIPPING DETAILS* \r\nPlease allow 5-7 business days for shipment.
