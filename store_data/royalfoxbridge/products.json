Book marking the labels existence, &#8216;Squadron&#8217; was the first ever compilation released by the Merck crew, with &#8216;Squadron 2&#8217; appearing as one of its last ever catalogue numbers &#8211; here re-released after the well limited vinyl edition a few weeks back. Giving <span class=\"caps\">IDM</span> its dignity back, &#8216;Squadron 2&#8217; is packed with sunlight melodies, filigree electronics and hip-hop guts, as the Merck troops see their General off with dignity and pride. Opening with a five-long flush from Royal Foxbridge, the mood is grand and solipsistic (minus any whiff of unnecessary melancholy) as tracks such as &#8216;Regler Les Problemes Du Monde Pt. 1&#8217; and &#8216;Dan Living Pan&#8217; overflow onto the hob with a fizz of electronic hip-hop that is straight-laced and all the better for it. Hooking up with Xejax for a couple of juxtaposed gems, the next conscript up to the front line is Omnibus with the crackling bounce of &#8216;Flooded Memory&#8217; &#8211; where a just out of sight Hammond keeps the delicate melodies, creamy atmospherics and tooled up beats nicely in check. Elsewhere, Sumo Lounge offers up the mealy piano shuffle &#8216;Second Time Around&#8217;, Deceptikon launches a batch of hard-boiled hip-hop beats, whilst Winnie The Shit caps it all off with a eulogistic flash of sunshine mentalism.
