You can read it as a book or project the artwork onto a wall with a flashlight.\r\n\r\nIncludes a suite of 5 lasercut pages created by Virginia Flynn.\r\n\r\nI was drawn to the Hansel & Gretel fairytale because there are so many ‘official’ versions of the story. The original fairytale was so bleak that the Brothers Grimm felt the need to lighten it up. Over the years they changed it seven times. It was originally a story created by the depths of famine where parents were forced to kill their children... not exactly a lighthearted romp through the woods! We all know different versions of the story. I wanted the book to include the main touchpoints but be flexible enough so the reader could adapt it for any audience.\r\n\r\nVirginia started with this idea and then created the wonderful papercuts that defined the story. We reduced the scale of her large format papercuts so they fit in a compact book. The lasercut artwork can be viewed as a book or projected to create a great shadow show on any wall. Each panel of art has a small amount of accompanying text to highlight the action. The text is not weighted with any one of the many versions so you’re free to tell your own story.\r\n\r\nThe book is extended with a website that includes different scripts, sound effects, and links to other Hansel & Gretel resources. It is a site where you can download mp3’s of sound effects to add to your shadow theatre show: birdsongs for the forest section, creepy wind sounds, and other sound effects. \r\n\r\nThe books is bound by hand in Portland, Oregon. It comes in an acid free paper portfolio with a wooden base. Little walnut page holders in the shape of a witch’s cottage to keep the spreads open for show are included. \r\n\r\nPhotography by www.bruceforsterphotography.com","options":[{"id":31627258,"name":"Default","price":85.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.8,"amount_with_others":5.8,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":23.95,"amount_with_others":23.95}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99278593/-/hanselgretel_002.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99278593/-/hanselgretel_002.jpg","width":1000,"height":855},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99278680/-/hanselgretel_001.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99278680/-/hanselgretel_001.jpg","width":1000,"height":664},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99278659/-/hanselgretel_004.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99278659/-/hanselgretel_004.jpg","width":1000,"height":664},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99278617/-/hanselgretel_003.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99278617/-/hanselgretel_003.jpg","width":1000,"height":366}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1695673,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":1764737,"name":"Toy Kit","permalink":"toy-kit","url":"/category/toy-kit"},{"id":1856869,"name":"Art","permalink":"art","url":"/category/art"}]},{"id":9599529,"name":"Chroma Hat Pattern","permalink":"chroma-hat-pattern","position":5,"price":7.5,"default_price":7.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/chroma-hat-pattern","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-23T02:12:25.000Z","description":"This project is a great stash buster. the ring of triple paneled squares around the sides were inspired by striped Tibetan aprons.

The pattern comes with ideas about color mixes and the advantages of employing complimentary colors, how to work with multiple colorways and how to accentuate design details using different color values.\r\n\r\nI consider this Jazzknitting because of the way the colors are concentrated in the little panels encircling the crown and also because of the hat’s corrugated structure. It has a stranded false bind-off and a true 3-colorway ribbed bind-off to add to the colors that change throughout the hat.\r\n\r\nThis hat is both casual and dressy, colorful and fun.\r\n\r\nPattern is 10 full color pages, filled with photos of technical details.\r\n\r\nThis pattern is an electronic downloadable pdf.

THE KIT WILL NOT BE MADE AGAIN.\r\nIt will become a downloadable book but without the yarn kit.\r\n\r\nThis kit includes patterns, inspiration, yarns and beads for 8 butterflies that cover a wide range of techniques. All of these designs have evolved by intentionally pooling hand-painted yarn while creating butterfly and moth shapes. As you knit these 8 butterflies, you will learn techniques to make your own designs for butterflies and larger projects. These patterns can also be used multiple times to produce the same shapes, but the color patterning will look completely different with different yarns.\r\n\r\nThe yarns provided in this kit are from fabulous hand-paint artists so you'll get to sample their work as you make the butterflies.\r\n\r\nButterfly making is great fun as you knit simultaneous symmetry on both ends of a double pointed needle. Asymmetry (knitting only one wing), pseudo symmetry (where the eye cleverly fills in the differences) and two ways of knitting true symmetry are covered, as are multiple ways of making bodies, legs and antennae. Some knitting skills are required and new techniques are clearly explained. Plus I am always available at our Jazzknitting group on Ravelry if you have questions. Please join us there and share pictures of your creations. I can't wait to see what you come up with!\r\n\r\nKit price $75 includes hand-dyed yarn strands that match mine, beads and invisible thread for all 8 \"Kitflies\" ($6 a butterfly!).

The Sette was a club of book collectors and eccentric personalities in London. It was founded by the famed book dealer Bernard Quaritch in 1878. He collected members for his club much like he did rare editons: each had an expertise in some unusual specialty.\r\n\r\nWilliam Manning was a club member who gave an after dinner talk on his recollections of the great magician Robert-Houdin. When Manning was a young boy he met the great magician and befriended Robert-Houdin's sons. His 'recollections' about Robert-Houdin were later published as a small book. Reading it today, over a hundred years after the speech was originally given, one is still struck by how forward thinking Robert-Houdin was and how down to earth. He developed many famous magic acts that are still performed today. Originally trained as a clockmaker, Robert-Houdin built all his own automata and magic props. He experimented with electricity and even wired his house with clocks and alarms in the 1860s which must have seemed very magical indeed. Manning captures the spirit of his admired friend. His words make the magician seem very contemporary and even more remarkable.\r\n\r\nManning's talk on Robert-Houdin prompted another member, Conrad William Cooke, to undertake a brief survey on the history of automata down through the ages. That talk resulted in the second wonderful book included here.\r\n\r\nTwo Odd Volumes on Magic & Automata collects these two books into a single volume. Carefully reproduced from the original copies this book is a delight to read. It has been featured on Dug North's <a href=\"http://blog.dugnorth.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Automata blog</a> as well as garnering great reviews in Magic magazines.\r\n\r\nTwo books collected in one edition. 224 pages; 5-1/2 x 7 inches; paper cover. 38 illustrations\r\n\r\n$20 plus shipping.
