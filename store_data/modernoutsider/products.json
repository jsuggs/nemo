Together this quartet of school-friends create shimmering guitar music that weaves the dry, lyrical candour of The Divine Comedy’s Neil Hannon through songs rich in melody yet underpinned with a brooding psychedelia that owes as much to the influence of Washington quintet The Walkmen as to their home city’s crooning Godfather Richard Hawley.\r\n\r\nDebut single ‘Hearts Are Breaking’ is the band’s first official release and is available to stream now via the band’s Soundcloud channel, <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/high-hazels/hearts-are-breaking\"target=\"_new\">here</a>.\r\n","options":[{"id":46324701,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.25,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":10.0},{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126241470/-/heartsarebreaking_large.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126241470/-/heartsarebreaking_large.jpg","width":370,"height":370}],"artists":[{"id":242229,"name":"High Hazels","permalink":"high-hazels","url":"/artist/high-hazels"}],"categories":[{"id":2219199,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"},{"id":6804096,"name":"SALE","permalink":"sale","url":"/category/sale"}]},{"id":13314984,"name":"Mirror Travel - Mexico Vinyl LP + Download","permalink":"mirror-travel-mexico-vinyl-lp-download","position":4,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mirror-travel-mexico-vinyl-lp-download","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-02T15:53:38.000Z","description":"Mirror Travel's Mexico clear vinyl LP + download. \r\n\r\nFor the past four years, Follow That Bird was one of the most buzzed about bands from their hometown of Austin, Texas. And considering how many bands are packed into that one city, that ain't faint praise. They were picked by Matador Records to be the lead single on the 2010 Austin-only compilation Casual Victim Pile, and snapped up enough accolades to have Bill Callahan have them support him on tour and ...And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead ask them to be the opening act on their full tour of the Western US last summer.\r\n\r\nAfter that...everything went a little awry. The band's label folded, taking with it the money promised them to record their debut full-length. But instead of seeing that as a major roadblock, the trio saw it as the perfect chance to forge their own path. With it came a new band name - Mirror Travel - and a chance to further strengthen their belief in the power of the music they were creating together. Or as Tiffanie Lanmon put it, \"We had to walk into the desert and do things our way.\"\r\n\r\nThe desert Lanmon (drums) is referring to is the one that surrounds Marfa, Texas, where the she, Paul Brinkley (bass/vocals) and Lauren Green (guitar/vocals) decamped for two weeks to record with Gory Smelley (YACHT, Eleanor Friedberger, Grouper) at Marfa Recording Studio. It was just the isolating experience the band needed to bring their album Mexico into the world.\r\n\r\nThe results? One of the most warmly engaging records you're likely to hear this year. With Smelley's help, Mirror Travel were able to more fully embrace the dreamy garage pop sound that got them to where they are today.\r\n\r\nOpener \"Sands\" may give the impression of a band lost in a shoegazer wilderness, but let the punchy Nuggets-style bassline and reverb-slathered drive of the next track \"I Want You To Know\" shove aside all those preconceptions. The rest of Mexico flows by with the same steady gaze and attack, with occasional upticks and dips in tempo and temperature.\r\n\r\nLooked at as a complete package, Mexico is a document of a trio who, as their name change would suggest, are taking themselves more seriously and looking at the road ahead with much more purpose and intent. Like the long drives between tour stops and the seemingly endless desert that helped inspire these songs, you're meant to drink this album in slowly, steadily, and with your eye fixed on the horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>Mexico</i>\r\n01.

The two grew to four including Joey Cook and, most recently, Curt Kiser, and humble song-writing turned prolific. The next three years saw the release of three full-length albums, <I>Everything Is Alive, Everybody Come Outside</i> and <i>One Of Us</i> - with the band receiving critical acclaim from the likes of KEXP, WOXY, Spin and more. And 2012 has promised us another, <i>Heaven</i>.\r\n\r\nWith a new label home in Austin-based, Modern Outsider, <I>Heaven</i>, lives up to it's lofty name and is Pomegranates at their very best and most diverse. Unlike past albums, <I>Heaven</i> grabs you just as soon as the first note drops and it doesn't let go. \"Pass Away\" is pop perfection and shows us what we're dealing with. While most bands don't have one decent vocalist to speak of, Pomegranates have two. And they're not decent. They're amazing.\r\n\r\nIn past recordings Karns was the forceful vox, Cook the quirky tenor. While the balance between the two still remains, both vocalists have progressed far beyond these pigeon holes. On \"Sisters\", Cook sings with such clarity and restraint he transcends far beyond the trappings of indie rock and leaves no listener questioning his gender. Equally on \"Dreams\", Karns is unrecognizable from past performances as he drifts into dreamy falsetto. All the while Jacob Merritt’s propulsive drumming leads the way and is matched only by Curt Kiser's shimmering guitar tones.\r\n\r\nOn <I>Heaven</i> Pomegranates showcase their musical diversity and uncompromising vision. From Pink Floyd swirls on the rollicking \"Letters\", to the stripped-down piano stylings on beat-driven, \"Surfing the Human Heart\", the album reads like the best of roller coasters. A unique blend of stirring and surprising psychedelic dream rock that's as tender as it is ass-kicking: Pomegranates own this. Sweet, thoughtful, innocent, direct, wild - <I>Heaven</i> has clearly come to earth. What could be more deserving of your listen?\r\n\r\nPomegranates are Jacob Merritt, Isaac Karns, Joey Cook and Curt Kiser. They've shared the stage with Peter Bjorn and John, Menomena, Spoon, Wye Oak, French Kicks, Headlights, Islands, Ra Ra Riot, Phantogram, Jimmy Eat World, Blitzen Trapper, Ted Leo, Figurines, Aloha, The Besnard Lakes, Young the Giant and more. \r\n\r\n<B>Pomegranates - <I>Heaven</i></b>\r\n\r\n01. \"Heaven\"\r\n02. \"Pass Away\"\r\n03. \"Sisters\"\r\n04. \"Ezekiel\"\r\n05. \"Something Everybody Wants\"\r\n06. \"Letters\"\r\n07. \"Dream\"\r\n08. \"Night Run\"\r\n09. \"Lost Lives\"\r\n10. \"Surfing The Human Heart\"\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.modernoutsider.com/pomegranates\"target=\"_new\">Pomegranates</a>\r\n\r\nMODOUT008","options":[{"id":18907691,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/57956677/-/pomegranates_heaven_hires.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/57956677/-/pomegranates_heaven_hires.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":115213,"name":"Pomegranates","permalink":"pomegranates","url":"/artist/pomegranates"}],"categories":[{"id":2218907,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":6804096,"name":"SALE","permalink":"sale","url":"/category/sale"}]},{"id":5315657,"name":"Bad Veins - The Mess We've Made CD ","permalink":"bad-veins-the-mess-we-ve-made-cd-pre-order","position":14,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bad-veins-the-mess-we-ve-made-cd-pre-order","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-01-24T05:09:02.000Z","description":"CD version of <I>The Mess We've Made</i> by Bad Veins. \r\n\r\n<I>The Mess We've Made</i> was recorded over a three month period at Audiogrotto, a church turned recording studio, in Newport, Kentucky and is the follow up to their breakout self-titled debut album that was released on Dangerbird Records in 2009. \r\n\r\nBad Veins – Benjamin Davis (vocals, keyboard, guitar, etc,) and Sebastien Schultz (drums) – formed in 2006 and quickly gained widespread buzz even before they released an album due to their legendary live shows.  The duo takes the stage in pseudo-army uniforms with Seb thrashing with the enthusiasm of 2 punk drummers on his kit and Ben crooning stilly on his mic.  They are joined on stage by a vintage megaphone, a reel-to-reel tape player nicknamed Irene (often counted as the third band member), and a telephone where another mic should be. \r\n\r\nTheir incredible live shows led them to NYC for the CMJ Festival in 2007 where Bad Veins were considered one of the breakout bands for that year.  It was that same year they started crisscrossing the US, relentlessly performing and building a cult following among fans and critics alike.  In 2008 Bad Veins won the first ever “Target Music Maker Award” at the Tribeca Film Festival and soon after they earned themselves spots touring with a variety of noteworthy artists including Frightened Rabbit, We Were Promised Jetpacks, Maps & Atlases, Two Door Cinema Club, and more.\r\n\r\nIn addition, their self-titled debut album released in 2009 won numerous accolades.  Dan Harris of ABC Amplified picked the album as #7 in the “Best Albums of 2009” and wrote that Bad Veins were “criminally under-appreciated.”  USA Today’s Pop Candy called the album’s closing track “Go Home” one of the Top 20 Songs of 2009.  Also, the lead single “Gold and Warm” was the music for a video segment on Good Morning America called “Your Three Words” and the song is going to be featured in the blockbuster film Chronicle – via 20th Century Fox – and in the official soundtrack. \r\n\r\n\r\n<B>Bad Veins - <I>The Mess We've Made</i></b>\r\n01. \"Don't Run\"\r\n02. \"Nursery Rhyme\"\r\n03. \"If Then\"\r\n04. \"Chasing\"\r\n05. \"Child\"\r\n06. \"Doubt\"\r\n07. \"I Turn Around\"\r\n08. \"Dancing On TV\"\r\n09. \"Kindness\"\r\n10. \"Not Like You\"\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.modernoutsider.com/badveins\"target=\"_new\">Bad Veins</a>\r\n\r\nMODOUT007","options":[{"id":17199253,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/52192587/-/cover-small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/52192587/-/cover-small.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[{"id":102469,"name":"Bad Veins","permalink":"bad-veins","url":"/artist/bad-veins"}],"categories":[{"id":2218907,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":6804096,"name":"SALE","permalink":"sale","url":"/category/sale"}]},{"id":5803323,"name":"Soft Swells - Soft Swells CD + 7\" + Shirt Bundle","permalink":"soft-swells-soft-swells-cd-7-shirt-bundle","position":15,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/soft-swells-soft-swells-cd-7-shirt-bundle","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-03-28T22:20:16.000Z","description":"Digipack CD and 7\" single versions of <I>Soft Swells</i> and \"Every Little Thing/Lifeboats\" with a Soft Swells American Apparel T-Shirt.\r\n\r\nSharp and sensible, new musical duo Soft Swells nails the canny pop sensibility of today’s indie landscape on their forthcoming self-titled ‘Soft Swells’ LP making full use of an arsenal of sounds, including stuttering and snapping drums, handclaps, a ringing xylophone, and subtle electronics.

Welsh, who gained much acclaim with his own Brooklyn outift Phonograph, asked Williams if he needed a guitarist, and both gents knew it was a sure fit.

Really, what you can and can't - and how that affects your life.”  Soft Swells’ self-titled debut was recorded in the tiny town of Lewes, England, by longtime friend and producer Dave Lynch (Ed Harcourt, Clearlake, Liam Finn) at Bat Box Studios. “Matt and I spent a little over a week recording 13 songs as quick as we could before our return flights home. I think we nearly drove Dave mad during this process as we could have really used a solid month for a record this size. Dave had also just had his first baby boy - Monty Moog  - and probably only had 5 hours of sleep the entire week. He is a true saint,” says Williams.\r\n\r\nThe band released a hot 7” late summer 2011 which featured new tracks \"Every Little Thing\" and “Lifeboats” which gained airplay at KCRW and KROQ and started a Soft Swells buzz on the West Coast.

Recalling a time when the band and kids in the crowd weren't afraid to sweat, the album marries the heavier and more distorted side of indie rock with visceral passion and pop hooks, further proving why Rolling Stone named the female-driven trio one of the nation's best unsigned bands before Modern Outsider quickly snatched them up earlier this year.\r\n\r\n<B><I>Phantoms</b></i>\r\n01. \"Rubicon\"\r\n02. \"Burst\"\r\n03. \"Captive\"\r\n04. \"The Push\"\r\n05. \"Destroyer\"\r\n06. \"Run Wild\"\r\n07. \"Pretend Again\"\r\n08. \"Hurricane II\"\r\n09. \"Dancing Blind\"\r\n10. \"The Task\"\r\n\r\n \"Distortion-heavy jams (and the whole marriage thing) invite comparisons to Sonic Youth, but Ume do more headbanging and wailing.” <I>Rolling Stone</i>\r\n\r\n\"How could I have not known about Ume?

Recalling a time when the band and kids in the crowd weren't afraid to sweat, the album marries the heavier and more distorted side of indie rock with visceral passion and pop hooks, further proving why Rolling Stone named the female-driven trio one of the nation's best unsigned bands before Modern Outsider quickly snatched them up earlier this year.\r\n\r\n<B><I>Phantoms</b></i>\r\n01. \"Rubicon\"\r\n02. \"Burst\"\r\n03. \"Captive\"\r\n04. \"The Push\"\r\n05. \"Destroyer\"\r\n06. \"Run Wild\"\r\n07. \"Pretend Again\"\r\n08. \"Hurricane II\"\r\n09. \"Dancing Blind\"\r\n10. \"The Task\"\r\n\r\n \"Distortion-heavy jams (and the whole marriage thing) invite comparisons to Sonic Youth, but Ume do more headbanging and wailing.” <I>Rolling Stone</i>\r\n\r\n\"How could I have not known about Ume?
