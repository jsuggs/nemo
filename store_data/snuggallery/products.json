Exploring the Autumn countryside in all its stunning colour.\r\n\r\nThe Photowalk will begin at Snug Gallery on Market St, Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire (HX7 6AA) at 10:30am and finish with a debrief/reflection session at the Stubbing Wharf Pub at approximately 2:00pm possibly over a pint of fine Ale if you are so inclined. Along the way, Ed will lead you to some of the most spectacular vantage points in the area and offer advice and tuition in a number of areas of image capture, from exposure to composition, covering both colour & black & white.\r\n\r\nPlease bring your camera (dslr preferred but not essential), a decent pair of walking boots and as it's November please dress accordingly for all weather. Please note there will be a number of steep paths and uneven terrain to be negotiated during the walk.\r\n\r\nStrictly limited numbers - so book early to avoid disappointment! Ed looks forward to welcoming you along!\r\n\r\nWorkshop Ability Requirement: Medium.\r\n\r\nIf you need any further information, please don't hesitate to send us an email.","options":[{"id":42036468,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125712171/-/Workshop_round_logo_02.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125712171/-/Workshop_round_logo_02.jpg","width":1181,"height":1181},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124022940/-/Summer_Colour.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124022940/-/Summer_Colour.jpg","width":945,"height":945},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125791548/-/HB_Autumn_Woods_01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125791548/-/HB_Autumn_Woods_01.jpg","width":1181,"height":1181},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124023132/-/OverHB_b_w_01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124023132/-/OverHB_b_w_01.jpg","width":1181,"height":1181}],"artists":[{"id":74474,"name":"Edward Chadwick","permalink":"edward-chadwick","url":"/artist/edward-chadwick"}],"categories":[{"id":1631458,"name":"Photography","permalink":"photography","url":"/category/photography"},{"id":6070023,"name":"Workshops","permalink":"workshops","url":"/category/workshops"}]}]
