However, I find that the traditional style painting is a lot more fun and allows for more interesting paintings at times. This painting was inspired by Luna. I love the way the moon looks and I want to make many, many more paintings of the moon in the future.\r\n\r\n*SHIPS FREE*","options":[{"id":26192283,"name":"Default","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81796953/-/Grapsing_Luna_cropped_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81796953/-/Grapsing_Luna_cropped_.jpg","width":995,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":8084565,"name":"\"Raven n Luna\"-Acrylic Painting, 24x36'' canvas","permalink":"the-raven-acrylic-painting-24x36-canvas","position":2,"price":300.0,"default_price":300.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-raven-acrylic-painting-24x36-canvas","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-19T22:49:02.000Z","description":"This is a 36x24inch painting, which has been painted on a primed canvas.

One of my favorite John Lennon songs. On top of that, I also wanted to play with the colors for a change, instead of taking things seriously I decided to have a little fun. I hear that sometimes its important to let the colors control the painting, rather then the painting controlling the colors, if that makes any sense. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe letters in the top right corner are barely visible, but they read \"G.A.P.C\" which means gives peace a chance.
