Great Anvil quality fit-style tees, they come available in many sizes and one solid color for those of you who want to be on-board with our crew! \r\n\r\nInformation - Process & Shipment.\r\n\r\nEach shirt is made to order, so when you purchase a size, we most likely will not have a different size to exchange with you. We are terribly sorry for this but it is how we felt doing business would fit both parties needs. The shirts are collected in small batch orders of 10 or less and are therefor purchased within a 7 day period. After which it takes at most two weeks for the shirts to arrive, for the purchases made in the United States the turn around is 3-4 weeks for an order to arrive. It will be 4-5 weeks time for an international order. We are working our hardest at changing our supplier and getting enough startup funds to build the brand further. Every purchase helps us meet that goal to help provide a better brand for you to purchase from.

We have a small lot of 4 wooden typesetter trays. These were used for metal type lay typically for newspapers. For those of you not familiar, in the old days newspapers had to lay our little pieces of wood or metal type (letters) that would make up sentences, articles and ultimately the paper. This set up would be put into a printing press, inked and then pressed onto paper where multiple copies could be produced with ease. Each of these type were stored in an organized way into the separate compartments as you can see here. These trays would go into a set of drawers. Most of these are damaged or destroyed over time due to excess use or fire, there are quite a bit around the world still found luckily, however the location of the trays are always different and difficult to certify. These were all found inside an old printing business in McMinnville, Oregon.

Believed to be in complete and original condition, there are few spots of concern; the straps that attach the bottom of the frame to the bottom of the shoulder straps are restrung using a military-style flat cord, we know for sure this was not used originally and was a make-shift fix. This can be fixed to better meet your expectations for travel and authenticity. The USFS has been around for quite sometime, since 1905 to be exact. So this is one of the first items built for the group to ensure heavy carry while remaining (to them) quite comfortable. All of the original cotton stringing in the back is still there, with some pieces slightly frayed. The pack has minor aesthetic issues however the USFS symbol is still completely intact with a beautiful fade. This pack has a large inside pocket, and two smaller pockets also on the inside. Brass plates are on the end of each piece of the frame and well, it just does not get better than that. Definitely one of our rare American-made items. Something to pick up quick!\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":40154235,"name":"Default","price":338.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":50.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125819481/-/0112292c4a091b2331437538bbbdaa47592fb70448.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125819481/-/0112292c4a091b2331437538bbbdaa47592fb70448.jpg","width":1536,"height":2304},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121920963/-/2013-07-07T22-12-41_53.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121920963/-/2013-07-07T22-12-41_53.jpg","width":1728,"height":2592},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121921401/-/2013-07-07T22-12-41_58.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121921401/-/2013-07-07T22-12-41_58.jpg","width":1728,"height":2592},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121922511/-/IMG_0650.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121922511/-/IMG_0650.JPG","width":3168,"height":4752}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6933972,"name":"FOUND","permalink":"found","url":"/category/found"},{"id":6709926,"name":"TRAVEL SUPPLY","permalink":"travel-supply","url":"/category/travel-supply"},{"id":6709992,"name":"MILITARIA","permalink":"militaria","url":"/category/militaria"}]},{"id":11969910,"name":"Atelier de l'Armee Handmade weekender denim tote","permalink":"907","position":76,"price":199.0,"default_price":199.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/907","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-23T21:42:19.000Z","description":"Another grand piece made in the Netherlands by Atelier de l'Armee, this large weekender tote features 5 shades of Japanese selvage denims, all are deadstock, making this a one of a kind bag.
