If you had to break it down, there are shades of Southern Rock, 60s blues rock a la Cream with hooks and riffs that remind me of Slo Burn, blending elements of classic rock and modern rock seamlessly.  Oh yeah, and these San Diego, CA natives are offering this and their other albums for free. As usual, this garners a ton of respect around these parts...\r\n\r\nThe first track “Lose My Mind” is a Hendrixian wah-wah laden jam, accented by some notably busy classic rock drum patterns. “Slave Dance” features some pretty towering riffs interspersed with ethereal verses, making for a perfect psycho-stomp followup for the opener. It even begins to sound a bit like Stone Temple Pilots at a point but the indulgence in lead guitar yanks the record back into the mind-bending musical realm. The standout track is probably “Today is Technicolor (One Step Closer)”; it features Heavy Glow‘s usually dreamy verses contrasted with a chorus you’ll find yourself humming throughout the day.\r\n\r\nOne of the highlights is the vocal performance of vocalist and guitarist Jared Mullens. Being a three piece, the band seems to put Jared firmly in the songwriting driver’s seat, which would partially explain the emphasis vocal hooks. The backing organ and slow stomp of “Purgatory Blues” provide for a swampy, down South feel, accented by some slightly distorted vocals. “Collide” is a straightforward bluesy stoner rock track which sounds something like Slo Burn until its overtaken by a catchy guitar hook. “Smithereen” serves as a slight breather with it’s intricate acoustic guitarwork and somewhat nasal vocals. The album closer “Diggin’ A Ditch” is a grimy 7 minute rocker which shows off the dynamic rhythm section of Joe Brooks and Dan Kurtz. The abstract would be that it’s catchy, driving hard rock music that still holds firmly on to it’s 60s and 70s roots. The biggest strength is that all of Heavy Glow’s influences are difficult to pick out precisely because they combine them so smoothly and disarm the critical portions of the brain by parading infectious choruses in front of the listener.\r\n\r\n8/10\"\r\n\r\n--Shreddernet.com Oct. 25, 2011 \r\n\r\n\r\nTracks:\r\n\r\n1.
