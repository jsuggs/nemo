These tracks combine the raw passion of hardcore with heavy groove driven guitars for a sound unique to them. Think of them as Every Time I Die mixed with Clutch, Down, Coalesce, and Botch. \r\nNext Tigon brings their mix of 90's screamo, hardcore, metal, and punk. Think Botch, At The Drive-In, Engineer, and The Minor Times. These songs are heavy, technical , chaotic, and powerful all at once. \r\nForeign Theaters finishes off this split with four songs that instantly bring to mind old Touch and Go Records(Jesus Lizard, Shellac, or Therapy?) or late 90's discord played heavier. These driving mid tempo tracks just pound away from beginning to end with no let up. Think Young Widows, Melvins, and a tinge of Kylesa.\r\n\r\nThis record is a split release with Mayfly Records, Meletov Records, and The Ghost is Clear Records. \r\nFirst pressing is 500 \r\n500 recycled black vinyl \r\nall Mayfly Records come with a free digital download.","options":[{"id":10301279,"name":"Recycled Black","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/28946675/-/CHNN...jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/28946675/-/CHNN...jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":307518,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":385622,"name":"Mons Wolff / Canyons split 7\" 2009","permalink":"mons-wolff-canyons-split-7-2009","position":4,"price":4.75,"default_price":4.75,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mons-wolff-canyons-split-7-2009","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-09-02T07:35:01.000Z","description":"Mayfly Records second release, with artwork by Juan Gabe of Comadre.  This 7\" is beautiful.  Both Canyons hailing from Marshall, MO and Mons Wolff from Vegas share a love for metal influenced hardcore. This does not mean cheesy breakdowns with clean vocals, this means respect for such bands as Coalesce, Integrity, and Bleeding Kansas. Where these bands differ is Canyons plays a more groove driven style like Mastadon or Down. On the other hand Mons Wolff plays a more chaotic style in vein of Converge or Breather Resist.
