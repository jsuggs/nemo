I was painting the original at Cave Gallery last year.  At the end of the night I packed up my car, but failed to pack up the painting.  I drove home leaving it in the street.  When I discovered what I had done, I drove back out to the gallery, but the painting was long gone.  I thought it was lost forever.\r\n\r\nEight months later, I was tagged in a photo on Facebook.  It was the painting!  It turned out that a woman had found it lying in the street.  She brought it home and hung it above her fireplace.  Eventually someone came to her house that recognized the work and let her know I was the artist (I had not signed it yet).\r\n\r\nWhen I contacted her about it, she said she was glad that she found me becuase she was moving to Austin and she was unable to take the painting with her.  I rescued it from her, finished it, and brought it to Cave Gallery where it was originally slated to show more than a year ago.

I painted him live in Hollywood a couple years ago.  The original is sold.\r\n\r\nThe feathers keep him rooted in nature.  The boomboxes open the path to music and technology.  The right hand with two fingers up represents him and the viewer, the two that exist within each others gaze.  And the ice cream is his treat becuase it is a food that forces you to enjoy the moment.  And it's tasty.\r\n\r\nDifferent paintings put off different vibes, and I feel like this one has always been friendly.
