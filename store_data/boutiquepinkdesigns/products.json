I used a bamboo ring as the tie - the numerous ways to wear it are almost overwhelming! It is crocheted from a soft acrylic yarn in a vivid grass green. The open-weave design makes this wrap perfect for warm weather when all you need is a light wrap to protect against the AC chill or the cool evening breezes. I added kicky multicolor ladder yarn as fringe - making this piece even more vibrant! This wrap will look just as fantastic with a tee, jeans and boots as with a sexy black dress and heels. Fun and flirty, this piece will keep you going through the summer and into the winter months.

Please allow approximately 1 week to complete and ship after purchase.\r\n\r\nFun, flirty and feminine, this lariat is a must have for your wardrobe. Perfect over pretty much any outfit: a tee and jeans, a jacket, a sweater, even a sweet party dress. Wrap it around and wear it as a necklace or cowl. Loop one end and draw the other ends through to wear as a choker. Leave it long and loose or even wear around your waist as a funky belt. Experiment with different looks and find your favorite.\r\n\r\nThe lariat is crocheted from a bulky wool/acrylic blend yarn in gorgeous green. Each rose is created from soft acrylic yarn in rose pink and cream. They are securely attached to the lariat. For extra flair, I added textured slubby yarn in varigated shades of green as fringe. They have been left to hang loose and vine-like from the lariat. What a great accessory to jazz up any outfit. Fun to wear and even more fun to give as a gift to someone special. \r\n\r\nContent: Lariat is acrylic and wool blend, roses are acrylic, fringe is a blend of acrylic, wool and polyamide.\r\nMeasurements: 82 inches long and the roses measure about 3 inches across.

I used almost 2 yards of fabric to create this bag and tearing the strips was very time consuming but a great stress reliever. :D The strips have been left to fray which only adds to the wonderful texture of this bag. For the lining I used a complimentary fabric also in red. The handles are brass metal rings and for extra appeal, I attached a fabric yo-yo pin with a fabric covered button center. This bag is great for those shopping trips to the mall or the farmer's market. It is sturdy and durable and ever so charming!
