Despite the high demand for his work in Europe and constant world travel, Seen continued to hit the New York subway trains right up until 1989, long after many had admitted defeat to the MTA. He was also featured prominently in the PBS 1983 documentary Style Wars.\r\n\r\nIn the late 80's, Seen turned his talent to tattoo art and opening TATTOO SEEN, which quickly became one of the most successful studios in New York.

To tell them apart, note the ridges -  the Fats have wider ridges than the Skinnies and the centre of the dot is larger.\r\n<b>Rusto Fat Cap:</b> Slightly wider than the NY Fat Cap. Grey Dot Cap: The first in the series of colored-dot caps which range from ultra-thin to ultra-wide; one of the skinniest caps available. Produces a thin, soft and light line, perhaps making it better suited for drippy brands - good for accents.\r\n<b>Black Dot Cap:</b> The same as Grey Dots, but just a little bit wider. \r\n<b>Pink Dot Fat Cap:</b> The fattest cap available! Create lines 15-20 cm in diameter - good for filling in large areas (or making giant paintings).\r\n<b>Orange Dot Fat Cap:</b> Wider than NY and Rusto Fats and about the same as Silver Super Fats. Compared with Silver Super Fats, the line is a little softer and lighter. \r\n<b>Skinny Pro #1 Cap:</b> Produces a thin to medium line - used for outlining and detailed work. \r\n<b>Silver Super Fat Cap:</b> This is one of the most versatile caps out there; it produces a wide line, wider than any of the caps mentioned above, with a sharp edge. \r\n<b>Astro Fat Cap:</b> This super fat high pressure cap is great for filling in a large area quickly. \r\n<b>Transversal Cap #1:</b> Produces a very soft, thin line; these caps have a special insert that creates a \"linear\" spray instead of the circular spray that the other caps have so the spray will be wide in one direction, narrow in the other - great for signing your name or just creating special effects. \r\n<b>Needle Cap:</b> Produces an ultra-ultra-thin line, not even a centimetre in width, but very heavy - however, it leaves some splatter marks - love 'em or hate 'em!

How you display them is entirely up to you but we're not overly convinced by the Sales Manager's suggestion of growing cress in them... but, as the old adage goes - art is in the eye of the beholder!!! Needless to say, we're giving them pride of place in the studio (next to a rather subtle “TRY ON AT YOUR PERIL!” sign).\r\n\r\n<h5 class=\"generic\">The Artist</h5>\r\n\r\nHaving exhibited in numerous highly acclaimed galleries such as the Crafts Council “New Faces” Showcase, in London’s prestigious V&A, and winning both Artsmix and Prince’s Trust grants serve testament to Jon Lawrence’s work. Concerned by the loss of humanity and childhood memories within society, he endeavours to preserve elements as 3D objects; robust, tactile and purposefully imperfect, he strives to challenge traditional ideas, habits and assumptions. Using traditional techniques of slip casting and silversmithing, Jon is able to express objects with integrity and character.
