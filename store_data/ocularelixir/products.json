The original was a detailed painting on wood board depicting a frog holding his favorite robot and announcing \"Robot\", you see, because \"Robot\" sounds like \"Ribbit\".\r\n\r\nThe print is 6 inches square and was produced as a limited edition of 70. Each print is signed and numbered and comes with two free stickers.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2101475072/jennifer-lewis-illustration-limited-edition-frog-r ","options":[{"id":49977204,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128910726/-/Frogrobot.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128910726/-/Frogrobot.jpg","width":1500,"height":1125}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6836025,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]}]
