This project grew out of my growing passion for hand-lettering and sign-painting, as well as a love for documenting the creative process from beginning to end. More details on the project's inception <a href=\"http://rouleauc.blogspot.ca/2013/02/12-in-13-for-14.html\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nFor the main titles, I hand-lettered a dozen header options each month with a Pentel brush pen, and then posted them on my blog for public voting. After curating the selects, I rendered the final titles in Illustrator and incorporated them into the layouts.\r\n\r\nTo complete the calendar, I hand-lettered a supplementary set of numerals and capitals for the week titles. These were also refined in Illustrator, compiled in FontLab, and then typeset into the final calendar layouts. A full post on the process <a href=\"http://rouleauc.blogspot.ca/2013/02/12-in-13-for-14.html\">here</a>. \r\n\r\nThese 6\" x 6\" calendars, limited edition of 20, are screen printed by hand in Toronto with water-based inks on 245gsm pure white 100% cotton archival paper. They are hand-trimmed and include a personalized, hand-lettered, numbered & editioned cover sheet. The calendar is bound with an elegant chrome bulldog clip, perfect for mounting in your home or office.\r\n\r\nCurrently only shipping within Canada through the shop. A $10.00 flat rate will be applied (for the cost of regular parcel shipping and a flat mailer). Toronto friends: contact me about hand-delivery to save on shipping.\r\n\r\nClick on the photo to enlarge.
