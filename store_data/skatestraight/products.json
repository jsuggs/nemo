Professional Skateboarder Doug Brown stumbled into fame, or it stumbled into him. But he wasn't always shredding for money and handing out autographs. Raised in a family with a sick mother, weary father, and responsible brother left him only one role to play--the black sheep. Under the shadow of his mother's cancer and his family's disapproval, Doug found an escape: skateboarding. Love for the arts and the thrill of skateboarding kept Doug occupied for years, but he never once thought his black sheep antics would bring him fame, money, and the approval he longed for. In this intimate autobiography, Doug Brown dares to share his life, the trials and successes, in order to inspire within his readers the courage to do what you love, no matter what. This is Doug Brown: Beyond the Board.
