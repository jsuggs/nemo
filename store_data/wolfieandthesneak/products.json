The soft sheen of the paper enhances the sandy colors and textures of the image while providing an archival finish to your print. \r\n\r\nEach print is signed, dated, and numbered. Only 10 of this size will ever be printed. An 8 1/2 x 11\" version in an edition of 20 is available through independent retailers that carry our work. \r\n\r\n* * *\r\n<b>About our shop:</b>\r\nWolfie and the Sneak has a new shop format. We now offer 1 print at a time in very limited editions. The paper, the size and the time of availability will vary, but the goal is to have a new design every 2 months. Even if an edition doesn't sell out, it is pulled from the shop and will then be available only at craft shows.\r\n\r\nWhy the new approach? It's a way to keep family and work in balance, maintain interest in content, stay outside that retail rush, and feel passionate about our products. \r\n\r\n* * *\r\n<b>Shipping:</b> \r\nUS Customers: Your print ships wrapped in clear plastic inside a sturdy cardboard tube via USPS Priority Mail ($10)\r\nInternational Customers: Your print ships wrapped in clear plastic inside a sturdy cardboard tube via First Class mail ($20)","options":[{"id":38971587,"name":"17 x 22\" giant poster","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121091886/-/okeefe.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121091886/-/okeefe.jpg","width":720,"height":932},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121091574/-/ribba.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121091574/-/ribba.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4880002,"name":"One at a time","permalink":"one-at-a-time","url":"/category/one-at-a-time"}]}]
