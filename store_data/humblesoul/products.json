Five in number, they play what can perhaps be best described as acoustic chamber pop, everything coming decorously draped with the rather mournful accompaniment of cello and violin. Beyond that, though, it’s De Malplaquet’s warm, hazy voice coupled with the songs’ ruminative aspect that impress most, from tales of drunks and bonnie barmaids to such beautifully tender moments as Boat Song and The Knife Thrower’s Hand. A handsome, original start.\"<br>\r\nQ<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breathtaking...

It's almost a home recording experiment that grew into an orchestra, gathering in some of Manchester's finest musicians, one by one, to create the work with a craftsman's care. Then, with equal attention to detail, to recreate the music and take it on tour: a labour of love which continued for several years. Then at some point this \"red giant\" exploded into a \"white dwarf\": Paddy, it seems, decided that he would play all the instruments at once. 'Madness!' I hear you say: except that this is what appears to be happening as he sits at the drum kit, plays bass with his feet and wields dozens of homemade instruments into some strange kinetic sculpture. Now a duo, Tony's song-writing has come to the fore, nicely balanced by the DIY approach to the instrumentation that keeps it more akin to outsider music than traditional song forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<hr>\r\n<b>CD Tracklisting:</b><br>\r\n1.
