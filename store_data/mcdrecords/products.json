This is a fact you will eventually come to understand if you listen to his original material. Chippy Hanna is a country boy.\r\n\r\nNow coming into his own musically after years of touring the world as drummer for punk stalwarts U.S. Bombs and One Man Army, Chip is returning to the roots that he never quite left, this time packin’ a flattop Martin acoustic guitar, instead of a drum kit. While born in Baton Rouge, Chippy grew up in the rural community of Pride, Louisiana.\r\n\r\nIn the woods…In a house trailer…\r\n\r\nA house trailer that was brand-spankin’ new when he was six years old, but had seen better days by the time he left Louisiana at age 22. Chippy’s mother, Martha Hanna, would sing at country music jamborees and on the country radio station WYNK, when the station would broadcast local country music shows… Mrs. Hanna even shared the bill with Loretta Lynn once… Quite a big deal for a small child… Chip Hanna remembers every bit of it… Chip Hanna remembers his roots…\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Americana music, Chip Hanna IS the Real Deal. Equally at ease in any genre from bluegrass to honky tonk to rockabilly to psychobilly to Orange County, California street punk, as soon as he opens his mouth to sing, the listener discovers immediately:\r\n\r\nChip Hanna is The Real Deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":9683086,"name":"Outlaws 7\"","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26686532/-/chip-hanna-outlaws-300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26686532/-/chip-hanna-outlaws-300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":331477,"name":"7\"s","permalink":"7s","url":"/category/7s"}]},{"id":2675980,"name":"The Hollowpoints \"Old Haunts on the Horizon\" Color LP ","permalink":"the-hollowpoints-old-haunts-on-the-horizon-color-lp","position":6,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-hollowpoints-old-haunts-on-the-horizon-color-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-07-29T05:30:22.000Z","description":"Its Finally Here!!!!!! The new Hollowpoints! on LP! Red side Blue side Colored Vinyl!!!!! Plus super limited to 250 copies!!!!\r\n Thanx to Sailor's Grave for letting us do the wax!!!!!\r\nRead what www.thepunksite.com has to say!\r\nThrow in one part Dillinger Four, another part Riverboat Gamblers, and a load of politically charged texts on society’s ills, and you get Seattle punk group The Hollowpoints.  Formed back in 2001, the quartet has largely existed under the radar, surfacing every three to five years for a new bout of fresh material.  In fact, their solphomore effort and Sailor’s Grave Records debut, Old Haunts On The Horizon, follows a lengthy five years after 2005’s The Black Spot.  And while I can’t profess familiarity of the band up until this point, Old Haunts On The Horizon has me wishing I had much sooner.\r\n\r\nThe Hollowpoints boast all the essentials of a modern classic, with a down to earth sound best described as a sloppy, poppy – occasionally rocky – brand of punk rock.  Vocalist “Matty” McKinney – with his soft but throaty delivery – could easily stand in for Dillinger Four’s Patrick Costello.  But his steady rhythmic sense also begs comparisons with Riverboat Gamblers’ flowing vocal melodies.  And with comparisons like that, you can be rest assured that Old Haunts is chalk full with catchy hooks and genuine grit.  When placed against a backdrop of recurrent gang vocals, big choruses, and a beat that just never gives up, the tunes are easy to take in, fun to sing along with, and intelligible to contemplate.  \r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, from a lyrical standpoint The Hollowpoints know how to act serious without compromising their fun factor.  For instance, tracks like “God Save Anna Nicole” at first sound innocent and uplifting, opening with a trivial “Hollywood newsflash,” only to end with brow raisers like “we bleed red white and blue, another dead American,” and rounding the track out with a judgment about Republicans distracting ill informed citizens from “real problems.”  Other times, like in “Service Is Our Business” or “Dharma,” they’re relaying their ideology with references to Iraq and a slanted media.  And if that all sounds very heavy, not to worry, even political activists know that we all need a break from bleak realities sometimes – and that’s where some basic drinking songs like “Gonzo” jump in to cool the nerves.\r\n\r\nOld Haunts On The Horizon is an incredibly solid listen from start to finish.  While you won’t find any surprises here, when it comes to The Hollowpoints, that’s a good thing.  They’re a good old-fashioned punk rock band armed with big hooks and an activist’s agenda.  An easy recommendation for fans of hook-heavy political punk.\r\n","options":[{"id":9434846,"name":"Color LP Blue side Red side","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31358469/-/40997_1500510407069_1663448458_1135821_7333930_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31358469/-/40997_1500510407069_1663448458_1135821_7333930_n.jpg","width":720,"height":540},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25798497/-/hollowpoints-vinyl-cover-web.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25798497/-/hollowpoints-vinyl-cover-web.png","width":288,"height":288}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":331476,"name":"LP's","permalink":"lps","url":"/category/lps"}]},{"id":2559623,"name":"BOATS! \"Totally Jawsome\" LP on Gold Wax","permalink":"boats-totally-jawsome-lp-on-gold-wax","position":7,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/boats-totally-jawsome-lp-on-gold-wax","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-05-04T23:04:33.000Z","description":"this ships the next day so order away!!!! it's on GOLD WAX! so technically i have already sold 1 million of them. track all together  \\\r\nwhich i will be listing soon! look below to see tracks!!!!

Instead of sending out the usual comp S.O.S., and calling out for people to submit songs, we joined forces with Nate from May Cause Dizziness Records, and D.J. Johnny Volume, and personally selected some of our favorite bands. The end result is a mixture of street, hardcore, pop, garage, lo-fi and post-punk rock music that portrays a great sample of the awesome diverse tastes of punk rock that Arizona has to offer in 2010.

The Impossible Ones play fast, snotty punk rock and the band's singer, Neil Impossible, has got a very charismatic voice. I think of \"Maximum Rock'N'Roll\" by NOFX at times 'cuz The Impossible Ones has that same playful feeling. The catchy \"Unlucky Me\" is my favorite on the album. I'm glad I gave this one a serious chance 'cause it's a really good album. /Christer Davidsson, MUTINYZINE.COM \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":3231791,"name":"Vinyl","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":3480941,"name":"Cd","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/8474671/-/69793.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/8474671/-/69793.jpg","width":200,"height":200},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/8474751/-/io_disc.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/8474751/-/io_disc.png","width":125,"height":125}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":331475,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":331476,"name":"LP's","permalink":"lps","url":"/category/lps"}]},{"id":920971,"name":"Shanghai Wires \"Upsetter Democracy\" LP White Wax","permalink":"shanghai-wires-upsetter-democracy","position":13,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/shanghai-wires-upsetter-democracy","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-12-11T08:10:05.000Z","description":"White Wax limited to 450 copies! 50 pink Sold Out!!!!\r\nShanghai Wires formed in 2007 and feature ex and current members of London punk bands Low Score City, Disco Lepers, Blacklist Brigade, Capitol Targets, Black Beach Union, The Jabbs and The Botox Rats. \r\n\r\nShanghai Wires is made up of: Vinny-Jack Rodrigues on vocals, D.G.1882 and Kano Starr on guitars, Chrissy Strokes on drums and Johnny Jabb on bass. \r\n\r\nVinny-Jack and Johnny also co-founded and co-run raw London punk label / zine / mailorder No Front Teeth (www.nofrontteeth/net) that has been running since 2001. \r\n\r\nSummer 2007 sees the release of their debut full-length ‘Upsetter Democracy’ through May Cause Dizziness Records (www.mcdrecords.com). The record features 11 cuts that take direct influence from the classic English 1977 style and further inspiration from the American take on this traditional English sound with the result being a kind of English Beach Punk sound (not fucking Blackpool beach). \r\n\r\n‘Upsetter Democracy’ is a paranoid and apprehensive commentary of social scepticism and distrust and was written and recorded in London between Summer 2007 and Spring 2008. \r\n\r\nFans of The Stitches, listen up! Did you spend the mid- to late-‘90s as I did, scarfing up every 7” release from Witmer/Lohrman and company like it was gold? And, have you been in Stitches withdrawal ever since they went inactive, at least on vinyl? Then Shanghai Wires may well be the band for you. They may be from England, but they have clearly soaked up the vintage Southern California punk rock vinyl so much that it courses through their veins as much as any of their native country’s fine bands do. If I have any criticisms about this at all, it would be that I wish the mix had a little more bottom end to it. Other than that, I’ve played this many times through and it more than holds its own.\r\n\r\n\r\n ","options":[{"id":3480751,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":6.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/8475071/-/my_shanghai.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/8475071/-/my_shanghai.jpg","width":200,"height":200}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":331476,"name":"LP's","permalink":"lps","url":"/category/lps"}]},{"id":921061,"name":"The Prostitutes \"Kill Them Before They Eat\" CD","permalink":"the-prostitutes-kill-them-before-they-eat","position":14,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-prostitutes-kill-them-before-they-eat","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-12-11T08:16:15.000Z","description":"The Prostitutes are back with their second (third if you count the unreleased \"3 Minute Heroes\" from 2002) full length album. They are older, raunchier, and angrier at the world. The CD version of this album contains 6 bonus tracks from an E.P. that really sounds like a separate entity from both LPs. It's less thick with sludge than the new LP and yet more experimental than the old one. \"Kill Them\" takes the snotty; rage filled classic sound of The Prostitutes and infuses the post-punk experimentation of Wire and Suicide into it making for an interesting sound. The album is still hard hitting on a conscious level but carries with it an air of subversion. The songs make several mentions of being \"fucked up\" and it really makes you feel it. The music and lyrics unite to make you feel as if you're coming down, dirt under your fingernails, stomach clogged with nausea, pounding headache and you realize this hangover is better than the high.

This all-inclusive genre gives the band the space and flexibility to showcase their individual talents and styles in a way that incorporates unimaginable influences seamlessly. Omni punk knows no limits. The Stiffs have songs running the gamut of lyrical content, from boozing it up to taking a stand against a lost nation's \"weapons of mass delusion\". all of which brings their most vivid memories, stories, and emotions to life in a passionate crescendo of four men proud to wear their hearts on their sleeves. Like their fans, the Lucky Stiffs always attempt to take an unselfish look at their music and challenge themselves to step into unexplored paths. In many ways this is a key to their ability to maintain constant excitement and enthusiasm for their place within a genre of music too often hell-bent on repition and limitation. In addition to kicking off San Francisco's 2002 installment of the legendary Holidays in the Sun Festival, some of the bands to share a stage with the Stiffs include, the Dickies, the Swingin' Utters, One Man Army, Manic Hispanic, the Bodies and loads more. Brandishing their music and excitement for life upon everyone they meet and have the opportunity to play to, just wait for the Lucky Stiffs to venture into your local joint.

Founded by Jason DeVore and Keith Walker, the two friends came together with a vision of playing music that spoke from the heart, got the blood boiling and kept good times rolling. Both had the love for Irish/Folk Celtic music, and with Walker being a native of Dublin, Ireland and DeVore's passion for Irish Pub music as well, there seemed to be only one thing to do...start writing tunes about just that. Starting out with nothing more than a couple acoustic guitars and an 8 pack of Murphy's, DeVore and Walker began to jam. Writing songs of good times, bad times, struggles and triumph's, irish history and Pub crawls, the two instantly became fired up with the ease in which the songs were coming. They then decided to recruit members to form a full group. Bringing in childhood friend Jason \"Saddy\" Combs on bass, and old friend Brad Park on drums, the four began to jam. Shortly thereafter they recruited yet another old time friend, one Greg McLarty, to play the electric guitar for what today has brought the 5 of them to date to be...THE BOLLOX.

Although this self titled album is in the same Johnny Clash vein as 2006's Musical Heritage, the rock n roll is emphasized more than ever with the help of The Sore Thumbs' Miles Peck's screaming guitar licks. In between the rock, Greenwood is still able to show his acoustic prowess with songs like Arbuckle (about his dog), where it's just Cliff and his guitar. All in all, Cliff Greenwood & the Monsters is a mixture of rockabilly, punk, outlaw country, spaghetti western, folk, rock n roll, and just plain good ol' times.\r\nMUTINY MAGAZINE:  \"Acoustic rock'a'billy punk with a touch of country from California. Cliff Greenwood's new record is cool. I really like Cliff's voice and along with acoustic guitar. The fact that this is an acoustic project does not mean that there's no energy. All the tunes have a really punky approach to them and the songs are pretty fast. Miles from the Sore Thumbs are playing the lead guitar and this record which is really cool.
