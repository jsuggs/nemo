Perfect for Wedding table center pieces or decoration.\r\n\r\nThe Knowles facility, located in Chester, West Virginia, was described as a \"model plant of the highest order.\" Edwin Knowles determined that his firm would manufacture only the finest semi-vitreous ware. One year later, product from the plant was lauded by the Crockery and Glass Journal as the highest grade ware: \"weight is light, its finish the finest, its shapes graceful, its decorations artistic, and its body and quality most durable.\" Knowles' reputation for creating quality product became known throughout the industry. Demand for Knowles product grew. It wasn't long thereafter that plant No. 2 was erected, just two miles south of plant No. 1 along the Ohio River in Chester, West Virginia in Newell, West Virginia. The company ceased operations in late 1962 citing a lack of foreseeable profits. This was largely blamed on tariffs which were said to encourage the importation of foreign dinnerware at prices so low that E. M.

It is true to say that red is the colour most often encountered, but the garnet also exists in various shades of green, a tender to intense yellow, a fiery orange and some fine earth-coloured nuances. The only colour it cannot offer is blue. Garnets are much sought-after and much worked gemstones - the more so because today it is not only the classical gemstone colours red and green which are so highly esteemed, but also the fine hues in between. Furthermore, the world of the garnets is also rich in rarities such as star garnets and stones whose colour changes depending on whether they are seen in daylight or artificial light.\r\n\r\n\r\n103505201004\r\n\r\nThis is shipped to you in a padded envelope.","options":[{"id":9894985,"name":"Default","price":13.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27401184/-/il_570xN.169637956_1_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27401184/-/il_570xN.169637956_1_.jpg","width":570,"height":477}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1679754,"name":"Jewelry","permalink":"jewelry","url":"/category/jewelry"}]}]
