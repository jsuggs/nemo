Abandoned are the full-band arrangements of his previous album, 2011′s Noise of Welcome, for a minimalist approach that illuminates his strengths as a solo performer. Blending the echoed open-tuned guitar patterns of artists like John Martyn and Bert Jansch with the desolate American lyricism of lone riders like Simon Joyner and Elliott Smith, Cale continues to stand out as a songwriter of uncommon power.\r\n\r\nThe title Blue Rider refers to the passing of yesterday’s vanguard, a group of painters that were known for their wild jagged color, but it also brings up the blues. Cale claims, “It’s sort of like my ’blues’ record, I’m using the same tuning that Skip James used, or what Fahey called ‘The Sphinx’ tuning.” And, with song titles such as “Hold Fast” and “Unfeeling” the reference is both musical and lyrical. The image of the bluesman or troubadour is an iconic one in the American psyche, and Cale plays with this image in a unique fashion upholding the idea that above all: the solo artist lives as a servant to song.\r\n\r\nBlue Rider was written and recorded between tours of the U.S. and Europe in 2011-2012. Life on the road informs the albums eight songs which convey both the solitude of touring, and the excitement of the unknown. Lyrically the songs stray from a traditional verse-chorus-verse scheme, and instead are broken down into musical sections wherein flashes of images are placed, suggesting a sense of movement in both narrative and structure. “Hangman Letters”, with it’s breathless phrasing tells of a storm coming with the lyric “Shadows walk across a jagged sky / Lightning strikes this heart I hold / My blood is boiling now / For I am the only sound.”\r\n\r\nMusically Cale incorporates a highly syncopated rhythm in his playing incorporating the melodic Piedmont picking technique of Pre-War country blues players like Mississippi John Hurt and Blind Willie McTell with the two-step rhythm of Buck Owens and Merle Haggard. “Wayward Son” and “Hold Fast” are great examples of this complex style.\r\n\r\nThe songs were recorded by Matt Boynton (Kurt Vile, MGMT, Bat for Lashes) and are fleshed out with electric textures and analog synthesizers which lend a cosmic effect to the performances.

He did so quite indifferently and without any thought or wish of finding anything in particular. However a pattern clearly revealed itself. Regardless if the notes were song lyrcis, comments on articles or books or just drunken scribbles they all pointed towards one theme. The hopeless feeling of being part of a society where egoism, cynicism and hurry are but a few negatively clinging words concluding what modern life is all about.\r\n\r\nWithout knowing exactly where he was aiming he called his friend photographer Simon Rydén and convinced him to go on a photo shoot with him. They were off within an hour. Once on sight it all happened very quickly. On the idustrial site Ringön outside of Göteborg Björn build a hut and started living there. It was a very real roleplay; Björn and Simon did not talk to eachother in hours. The dramaturgy was somehow predestined and just waiting to be acted out.\r\n\r\nComing home Björn realized what it was he wanted to do and started recording the album straight away. He decided to only use one instrument, an old nylon string guitar bought on a fleemarket for 12 euros. And trying to make the most of the little he had given himself was his way of turing everything around in a time where people seem to spend most of their time making as little as they can of the abundance at hand.\r\n\r\nWhat came out on the other end was a stripped down album where the song is centered. And although restricted in production and recording technology (the album is recorded in Björns livingroom with only a simple sm58 microphone) it is rich in detail.\r\n\r\nTo accompany the vinyl release of this album we have asked swedish artist Jonatan Knut to produce the artwork. An artist working with deconstructing perspectives and putting single parts together into a new, unknown and beautiful entity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":30515318,"name":"Default","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100239703/-/tfod-cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100239703/-/tfod-cover.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95819699/-/promo_cd_FINAL-page-001.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95819699/-/promo_cd_FINAL-page-001.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":79745,"name":"Björn Kleinhenz","permalink":"bjorn-kleinhenz","url":"/artist/bjorn-kleinhenz"}],"categories":[{"id":2411545,"name":"10\" / 12\"-Vinyl","permalink":"10-12-vinyl","url":"/category/10-12-vinyl"},{"id":5551152,"name":"JELLYFANT","permalink":"jellyfant","url":"/category/jellyfant"}]},{"id":7539141,"name":"UNITED BIBLE STUDIES - I AM PROVIDENCE - LP (+ DL)","permalink":"united-bible-studies-i-am-providence-lp","position":9,"price":14.0,"default_price":14.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/united-bible-studies-i-am-providence-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-13T21:03:49.000Z","description":"Vinyl * JellyFant jayf 12 * LP\r\n\r\n<b>I Am Providence / Chtonic Spiral / Tributaries Of The Styx Under Providence / Swan Point Petrichor / Grave Trudge / I Am Providence</b>\r\n\r\nRecorded in one day in Providence, Rhode Island on their 2008 US tour, <b>I Am Providence</b> is utterly unique even in the discography of <b>United Bible Studies</b>.

Featuring the vocals and guitar of Zachary Cale and backed by long time friends Kris Benedict, Ryan Johnson and Phil Glauberzon See-Saw falls into what Gram Parsons called “cosmic American music”. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, it lies somewhere between the country-tinged soul of Big Star and the punk spirit of The Wipers.  It was recorded and produced by the band in their basement on an 8 track reel-to-reel machine.  The end result is an enigmatic album that is both familiar and foreign; one that wears the suit of American rock & roll, but broadcasts anthems from another universe.\r\n\r\nFans of Zachary Cale take note, this record is often cited as the missing link between the solo albums Walking Papers and Noise of Welcome.","options":[{"id":35548638,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111076917/-/AHE-01See-Saw-290x290.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111076917/-/AHE-01See-Saw-290x290.jpg","width":290,"height":290}],"artists":[{"id":174146,"name":"Zachary Cale","permalink":"zachary-cale","url":"/artist/zachary-cale"}],"categories":[{"id":2411545,"name":"10\" / 12\"-Vinyl","permalink":"10-12-vinyl","url":"/category/10-12-vinyl"},{"id":5027938,"name":"ALL HANDS ELECTRIC","permalink":"all-hands-electric","url":"/category/all-hands-electric"}]},{"id":13208307,"name":"JALE -

Since the release of their debut album they've crafted a number of new songs that they've swiftly introduced into their live set.\r\n\r\nWith this 7\" single they tighten their sound with two smashing tracks. The A side, \"As if the Choice were Mine\", mixes the three part harmony jangle of The Byrds with a Feelies like angularity. The song is irresistibly melodic with the voices of Jonathan Byerley, Josh Carrafa, and new bassist, Michael Flis, singing in unison on each verse.\r\n\r\nOn the flip is the clever and cool \"Transit Trials\", a steady rockin' number that expands on the \"Kinksian\" sound of their debut LP while hinting at new directions both rhythmically and sonically.","options":[{"id":35548023,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.6,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":3.7,"amount_with_others":0.3}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111074553/-/plates7.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111074553/-/plates7.jpg","width":290,"height":290}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2463417,"name":"7\"-Vinyl","permalink":"7-vinyl","url":"/category/7-vinyl"},{"id":5027938,"name":"ALL HANDS ELECTRIC","permalink":"all-hands-electric","url":"/category/all-hands-electric"}]},{"id":11228781,"name":"PLATES OF CAKE - S/T - LP (+ DL)","permalink":"plates-of-cake-s-t-lp-dl","position":75,"price":13.0,"default_price":13.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/plates-of-cake-s-t-lp-dl","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-18T08:12:14.000Z","description":"LP - All Hands Electric - AHE 11  - 2010\r\n\r\n<b>Living Winter / Emil the Soldier / Private Yacht / Kirchner / The Shining Path / A Band of Partisans / Old Debts / Leper Hill / This Way Not Some Other Way / Big Purse</b>\r\n\r\n<object height=\"18\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F6961788&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=tiny\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed wmode=\"transparent\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"18\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F6961788&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=tiny\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe self-titled album by <b>Plates of Cake</b> plays like a two-sided LP should. It’s like spinning one of those mid 60′s folk rock records where you’re hit with one blast after another for a perfect half hour. The Byrd’s Fifth Dimension, The Turtles’ Wooden Head and Love’s first record all come to mind. From the moment the first chords are struck in “Living Winter” until the closing chant in “Big Purse” you’ll find no filler, just memorable songs that shed light on the dark daydreams clouding an otherwise sun-baked world. It’s a thrilling ride full of peaks and valleys, elegant wordplay, reverb drenched guitars, and snappy rhythms all played by the quartet of Jonathan Byerley, Joshua Carrafa, Gann Matthews and William Yale.\r\n\r\nRecorded in a rented church in Nutley, New Jersey by drummer William Yale on 8 track reel-to-reel and 4 track-cassette, Plates of Cake has a sound that is homegrown and rich with reverberating tones. The band sounds at home in it’s adopted surroundings, and the way it was tracked brings a lively feel to the performances. With his sandpaper-sharp baritone, principle songwriter, Jonathan Byerley, acts as narrator to the album’s 9 songs, with occasional vocal harmonies bursting through the clouds compliments of bassist Gann Matthews and guitarist Joshua Carrafa. Byerley’s gruff vocal stylings recall balladeers like Lloyd Cole and Warren Zevon, which suits his expert penmanship perfectly. While the band seems to float six inches off the ground, it’s Byerley’s voice and lyrics that bring them back to earth with his old world themes of life during wartime, work and love, bohemia and oddball short stories. He is a gifted songwriter that plays with the idea of darkness rather than living in it, with lyrics as imaginative as tall tales that poke fun at, as well as reflect contemporary depressions. Take this cutting line from side B standout ‘A Band of Partisans’, “Now I live here with a kind assassin, a sleeping wife and her dagger collection. Life is pretty quiet when you’re living out of reach with nothing to return to except your memories.”\r\n\r\nStylistically the band doesn’t lean to heavily on any particular sound. The songwriting is so strong that the references one may pick up are garnered through love and respect rather than blatant copying; the candle-lit lyricism of Leonard Cohen on “This Way Not Some Other Way”, the twin guitar workouts of The Feelies on “Old Debts”, and even the heights of Village Green era Kinks on “Private Yacht”. Throughout it all though, if there were one ghost looking over the proceedings it would be that of Alexander “Skip” Spence. Imagine if Spence was the only songwriter/vocalist in Moby Grape and you get a little closer to what Plates of Cake are all about. They strike a balance between the tight and the bent, playing their songs casually and confidently, with no extra note or verse tacked on. With only the essential ingredients brought to the table Plates of Cake have made a startling debut.\r\n","options":[{"id":35327859,"name":"Default","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.6,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":3.7,"amount_with_others":0.3}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110459385/-/platesweb-290x290.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110459385/-/platesweb-290x290.jpg","width":290,"height":290}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2411545,"name":"10\" / 12\"-Vinyl","permalink":"10-12-vinyl","url":"/category/10-12-vinyl"},{"id":5027938,"name":"ALL HANDS ELECTRIC","permalink":"all-hands-electric","url":"/category/all-hands-electric"}]},{"id":13240698,"name":"RIFF + THE MAD HATTER'S GARDEN BAND MACHINE -

On the album Tigerphobia he is joined by a host of Portland's finest musicians.\r\n\r\nIt's a beautiful album, on which every tune is spectacularly good; the songwriting is potent, emotional, poetic, and engaging, with catchy melodies and inventive arrangements.\r\nYou'll find yourself sharing it with friends like a joyful secret, or singing it out loud in the car, or putting a song on a mixtape for someone to whom you need to say something important but can't quite put it into words.\r\nSheehy has done the work of processing all the difficult emotions, and the acoustic-based songs on Tigerphobia are the wholly pleasurable result.\r\n\r\nLimited vinyl edition of 522 numbered copies.","options":[{"id":41563665,"name":"Default","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122926893/-/mattsheeny.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122926893/-/mattsheeny.jpg","width":250,"height":250}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2411545,"name":"10\" / 12\"-Vinyl","permalink":"10-12-vinyl","url":"/category/10-12-vinyl"},{"id":6691431,"name":"HOLIDAYSALE","permalink":"holidaysale","url":"/category/holidaysale"}]},{"id":10959909,"name":"SHIP OF ARA - SIGN OF THE TIMES / VOLVOPENTA - GREATEST DAY - 7\"","permalink":"ship-of-ara-volvopente-sign-of-the-times-greatest-day-7","position":82,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ship-of-ara-volvopente-sign-of-the-times-greatest-day-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-05T09:24:39.000Z","description":"7\" - Genosse Vinyl - 2011\r\n\r\n<b>Ship Of Ara: Sign Of The Times / Volvopenta: Greatest Day</b>\r\n\r\nTwo local Ruhr region bands cover Prince and Take That","options":[{"id":34462776,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.6,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":3.7,"amount_with_others":0.3}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/107786481/-/shipofvolvo.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/107786481/-/shipofvolvo.jpg","width":283,"height":283},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/107786505/-/shipofvolvo2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/107786505/-/shipofvolvo2.jpg","width":283,"height":283}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2463417,"name":"7\"-Vinyl","permalink":"7-vinyl","url":"/category/7-vinyl"},{"id":6691431,"name":"HOLIDAYSALE","permalink":"holidaysale","url":"/category/holidaysale"}]},{"id":12946098,"name":"FREDERIK SVENSSON - 6 FRAN 7 TILL 7 - 7\"","permalink":"frederik-svensson-6-fran-7-till-7-7","position":83,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/frederik-svensson-6-fran-7-till-7-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-13T21:02:19.000Z","description":"7\"-EP * Vanishing Vanity Music * 1998\r\n\r\n<b>Ur Hymn, 1 / Hotel Blues / Självpafyllande Cafeteria // De Stenade De Stenade / Du Vill Veta / Kungen I Ragunda</b>\r\n\r\nSwedish singer/songwriter and minimal artist who also run the Vanishing Vanity Music label - lim. and num. 200 copies","options":[{"id":41285175,"name":"Default","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.6,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":3.7,"amount_with_others":0.3}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122731011/-/frederik.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122731011/-/frederik.jpg","width":1460,"height":1442}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2463417,"name":"7\"-Vinyl","permalink":"7-vinyl","url":"/category/7-vinyl"},{"id":6691431,"name":"HOLIDAYSALE","permalink":"holidaysale","url":"/category/holidaysale"}]},{"id":13007460,"name":"FREDERIK SVENSSON - LUBOR LINGO EP - 7\"","permalink":"frederik-svennon-lubor-lingo-ep-7","position":84,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/frederik-svennon-lubor-lingo-ep-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-16T18:55:12.000Z","description":"7\"-EP * Vanishing Vanity Music * 1999\r\n\r\n<b>Farbror Feffes Fulfunk / Snabb Skiss, för 5 gitarrer / Gnilges / Trolla Bort Trollet!

A trio of magnitude, Uriah Theriault weaves open-tuned guitar passages with John Studer's circular and feather light drum style, while in the center stands Bill Augustus like a master of a ceremony who leads the band, with his elegant phrasing and rich vibrato through poetic songs of hope and hardship.\r\n\r\nFrom the opening lines of the world weary \"All for My Love\", to the closing hymn \"Mother of God\" Woodsy Pride delivers an accomplished set, narrating stories of their own time.
