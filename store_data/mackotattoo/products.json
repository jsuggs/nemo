The Bishop Rotary tattoo machine utilizes a “double sized Needle Clip” eliminating the old standard rubber band to create the down force on the needle. The clip holds the needle in place and eliminates any lateral motion in the needle. This allows the artist to pick away at those ultra fine details!\r\n\r\nBishop Rotary is an American company Located in Orange county California owned by, Franco Vescovi who created the company and tattoo machine in 2009. Franco has been tattooing for 20 years and has been using rotary tattoo machines for over 14 years, making his first direct drive rotary machine 18 years ago with his older brother. He founded the company based on what he felt some traditional tattoo machines lack, and that was consistency, efficiency and power.","options":[{"id":46296561,"name":"Default","price":390.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90637094/-/tattoo-machine-bishop-rotary-franco-vescovi-black2-464x299.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90637094/-/tattoo-machine-bishop-rotary-franco-vescovi-black2-464x299.jpg","width":464,"height":299}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4529402,"name":"Tattoo machine","permalink":"tattoo-machine","url":"/category/tattoo-machine"}]},{"id":7561037,"name":"Macko's Fine Prints","permalink":"lowlife-poster","position":2,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lowlife-poster","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-10-16T04:34:33.000Z","description":"size 47x33 cm fine printing on 300gr paper with signature. \r\n\r\nSeven prints: \r\nI - Dirty Money\r\nII - Lowlife\r\nIII - Money Rulez\r\nIV - Jesus\r\nV - California\r\nVI - Catrina\r\nVII - Sinner\r\n\r\neach print 15€ || full set 85€","options":[{"id":29614508,"name":"I - Dirty Money","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29614511,"name":"II - Lowlife","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/93069134/-/collage_big_cartel.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/93069134/-/collage_big_cartel.jpg","width":760,"height":431}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":333739,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":9212441,"name":"Boulevard","permalink":"boulevard","position":3,"price":350.0,"default_price":350.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/boulevard","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-01-30T01:37:36.000Z","description":"Original signature ballpoint drawing on A4 size paper.
