We are no longer taking Christmas orders.\r\n\r\nThis hand-forged damascus fillet knife is designed to be the finest trout or sunfish fillet knife available. The 5-3/4 inch, approx. 386-layer damascus blade is composed of four types of steel: 52100, 5160, 15N20, and 203E. The average carbon content of this steel is approximately 0.75%. The blade is differentially tempered so that the body is spring tempered for flexibility, while the edge retains a high degree of hardness for edge retention. The combination of flexibility and edge retention is fairly unique for a fillet knife, as it is exceptionally difficult to temper such a long, thin blade this way. The blade also features an extremely sharp, Scandinavian inspired, single bevel, flat ground edge.\r\n\r\nThe handle wood pictured is Pacific yew reclaimed from an industrial paper roll chock block. The handle is attached with the highest quality West Systems epoxy before being hand-riveted with solid brass rivets. The handle has been finished with food safe butcher's block oil. You can choose a different type of wood to customize your knife- this link has examples of what is available: http://www.redforgeworks.com/customization. Please let us know if you'd like a different type of wood when you email us at redforgeworks@gmail.com.

The stones are manufactured in the U.S.A. by Boride Engineered Abrasives, and we believe them to be the finest sharpening stones on the market. These stones have been carefully selected from several hundred different polishing stone options for the right amount of sharpening action at every stage, so that you can quickly sharpen even the hardest knife steels. \r\n\r\nAs a basic set, we recommend purchasing the 150 grit coarse silicon carbide stone, the fine 320 grit stone, and the extra fine 600 grit stone. We also have intermediate grits (220 and 400) available, and although you can get by without them, they will speed up the sharpening process and reduce wear on the rest of your stones. The 900 and 1200 grit stones are excellent as razor hones (1200 grit is approx. equivalent to a Japanese #8000 stone), or if you enjoy making your knives ultra-sharp. The finest grit stones also are great to use in place of a traditional \"sharpening\" steel because they recenter the edge while taking off a small amount material, allowing you to maintain a perfectly sharp knife without having to go through the entire sharpening process.\r\n\r\nAll stones are 1/4\"x1\"x6\", but other sizes are available.

This is a unique cleaver because it is forged from D2 tool steel, a highly wear resistant and tough steel, which contains 1.6% carbon. D2 isn't commonly used as a material for cleavers because it is difficult to work and expensive; however, I believe it produces a superior tool (especially when forged) that will hold its edge many times longer than any other commercially available cleaver.

The knife weighs just under 8 oz. and is balanced slightly forward of center, allowing for deft handling and precise cleaving. The curve of the blade enables a smooth rolling chop action with one or two hands. \r\n\r\nThe damascus steel blade is hand-forged in Timmonsville, South Carolina, by Reed Moore, using traditional methods combined with modern tool steels. The cleaver blade is 4.25\" and contains approximately 416 layers of four types of steel: 52100, 5160, 15N20, and 203E. The average carbon content of this steel is approximately 0.75%, making it a tough, high carbon composite steel. The blade is differentially tempered so that the edge retains a high degree of hardness, while the backside of the blade is softer to absorb shock. The combination of a hard edge and soft back creates a tougher, more durable knife that should last a lifetime. \r\n\r\nThe handle wood is Pacific yew reclaimed from an industrial paper roll chock block. The handle is attached with high quality West Systems marine-grade epoxy, before being hand riveted with solid brass rivets. The handle has been finished with food safe butcher's block oil.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to order a knife, please contact us and we will put you on a waiting list and get back to you with an estimated time of delivery.","options":[{"id":32915803,"name":"Default","price":400.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":24.95,"amount_with_others":12.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103269556/-/DSC_0079_95.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103269556/-/DSC_0079_95.JPG","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103269760/-/DSC_0066_94.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103269760/-/DSC_0066_94.JPG","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103273108/-/DSC_0081_92.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103273108/-/DSC_0081_92.JPG","width":1000,"height":667}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4816594,"name":"Kitchen Cutlery","permalink":"kitchen-cutlery","url":"/category/kitchen-cutlery"}]}]
