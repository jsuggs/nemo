We decided to create a twist on the traditional Chai of cardamom, cinnamon, anise, black pepper & ginger and added astragalus, burdock and dandelion. As you saw in our Autumn Share, Astragalus is an effective herb to integrate into your daily life in your soups, stews, rice and now your chai. Astragalus provides a nice steady support for your immune system. Burdock & Dandelion provide a little bitter flavor which makes it not only satisfying for you coffee lovers, but also helps jumpstart the digestive system as discussed above. In addition they both also provide support to your liver function.You can use 1 tsp to 1tbsp to a big cup of Chai according to taste. If you want a spicier brew add a few slices of freshly cut ginger. Now go put on a good record, or sit on the porch and maybe pull out a pen and paper and write a letter.

Nettles, Oat Tops, Oatstraw, Lemon Balm , Red Clover Blossoms, Mint and Violet Leaves combine to offer a delicious green tasting tea with citrus overtones. When we picture this tea it is like standing in a field bursting with new growth after a long winter. The oats are swaying bent over with their heavy tops, the honeybees are stirring up the red clover and the violets demurely display themselves along the edges. A magical place. This tea is not only packed with minerals and nutrients of the new growth of spring plants, but it also nourishes your nervous system with the oats and lemon balm. As we talked about earlier in our Spring Notes, it’s quite easy to feel agitated during this season so we formulated this tea to keep you strong and healthy without the edge. If you want to get the maximum benefits of this tea and have it be truly medicinal it is best to do an infusion of over four hours. We like to add a small handful to a teapot and then cover with boiling water and let it steep overnight. In the morning you can strain it and reheat, enjoying 2 or 3 cups throughout the day. On the other hand you can also just it infuse it like normal for about 10 minutes and still enjoy a satisfying cup of tea.","options":[{"id":33829932,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125023911/-/IMG_2342.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125023911/-/IMG_2342.JPG","width":4752,"height":3168},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125023920/-/IMG_2384.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125023920/-/IMG_2384.JPG","width":4752,"height":3168}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3769055,"name":"Seasonal Remedy","permalink":"seasonal-remedy","url":"/category/seasonal-remedy"}]},{"id":12276675,"name":"Blossom Tea","permalink":"blossom-tea","position":10,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/blossom-tea","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-09T23:46:38.000Z","description":" Summer brings forth an explosion of blossoms, and we decided to put some of our favorites into a tea blend.

Traditionally Hawthorne has been revered for its capacity to strengthen and fortify the heart and the circulatory system of our bodies. It’s a tonic herb that is especially useful if there is a history of high blood pressure, heart disease or sluggish circulation that runs in your family. Schizandra berry is an adaptogenic herb that is well suited as a companion herb to Hawthorne. Adaptogenic herbs can also be taken for lengths of time to fortify your health and in essence work toward reversing any pathological state your body might be in regardless of the direction. For example, it can bring about heightened mental clarity and energy if you are fatigued, but it can also calm down your nervous system if you are suffering from anxiety. In Traditional Chinese Medicine this berry represents the five flavors: sour, bitter, sweet, acrid & salty.  We’ve also added a small amount of Motherwort extract to this mix. Motherwort is sometimes referred to as ‘Lion Hearted’ and addresses both physical and emotional issues of the heart. We made the Borage Flower Essence in this elixir on a sunny day and the bees were busily tending it, but let us make off with a handful of flowers to make some medicine. Borage will bring you courage to allow your soul to be buoyant, and will work to help you improve your outlook on your life. That pure blue color of the petals is transcendent! We also included Bleeding Heart flower essence to help you invite love into your heart, fully and without the inhibitions perhaps caused by previous experiences. This elixir addresses the heart on a physical, spiritual and emotional plane. Enjoy.\r\n4oz bottle.","options":[{"id":38930853,"name":"Default","price":18.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125023635/-/IMG_2297.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125023635/-/IMG_2297.JPG","width":4752,"height":3168},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125023707/-/IMG_3764.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125023707/-/IMG_3764.JPG","width":1868,"height":1868}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3769055,"name":"Seasonal Remedy","permalink":"seasonal-remedy","url":"/category/seasonal-remedy"}]},{"id":7420599,"name":"Fire Cider ","permalink":"fire-cider","position":19,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fire-cider","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-02T06:46:42.000Z","description":"A fiery immune and circulatory system support!

Right now as I’m writing this I’m picturing waking up early while on a camping trip and walking down to the lake. The water is still, the birds are already busy and a few fish are jumping. The air smells sweet and cool and there is a feeling of all the potential the day has. This is what this extract can bring you – calmness of the spirit, insight into the potential of your experiences and a sense of the natural pace of life. Pedicularis is a beautiful native plant that is a skeletal muscle relaxant taken in larger direct doses. We are blending it into this extract to serve as an aid in releasing muscle tension in your body that has been built up by stress. Let Pedicularis help move those shoulders down a few inches! CA Poppy in all of its cheery bright orange is a powerful nervine and is amazing at calming any anxiety you may be having.  Elie harvested these Oat Tops while on a beautiful farm in Northern California while they were in their milky stage, meaning that when the tops are pressed together a milk like substance can be seen. When tinctured fresh in this stage it is powerful medicine for adrenal and nervous system exhaustion.  This medicine is food for your nervous system. And lastly we added Apple Blossom Flower Essence carrying over a little Spring medicine into the Summer Share. Simply standing under an apple tree in bloom can lift your heart, and we are using this essence with the intention of aiding you in welcoming new dreams and aspirations into your life. Summer is about pure potential and this essence will help you clarify where your adventures might lead you.

Hikes to secret river spots. Picking wild berries until your fingers are stained. Sigh. Summer. Our Summer CSH Share will focus on these pure feelings of the season. Some remedies will cool down your system, others will calm weathered skin; we'll focus on promoting circulation, while at the same time including some remedies to help you wind down to the pace of summer.  Some of the following remedies may change a bit, but for now here are the beauties in our Summer Share 2013: \r\n\r\n** Blossom Tea: Linden Flowers, Rose Petals, Chamomile, Lemon Balm and hibiscus. This is a perfect blend for a sun infused tea that will help cool you down and bring calm into your heart. A beautiful and amazing smelling blend. \r\n\r\n**Basil & Citrus Sugar Scrub: Keep your skin looking and feeling great with this rejuvenating blend. Good circulation is an important part of skin care and by using this scrub in a circular motion towards the heart it helps not only with your circulation, but also with lymphatic flow. A great and invigorating way to wake up in the morning. \r\n\r\n**Pedicularis & California Poppy Extract: These two herbs will help you unwind and settle into the warm nights and long days of summer. Flower Essence blends will also be included to help ensure ultimate relaxation. This extract will make you feel like you just had the most perfect summer day.\r\n\r\n**Rose, Calendula & Huckleberry Leaf Facial Toner. A reparative and gently astringent formula to balance and tone the skin. Pure lavender flower hydrosol is added for aromatherapeutic benefits and overall skin radiance. This toner is especially refreshing when kept in the refrigerator and soothing after a day in the sun. \r\n\r\n**Douglas Fir Tip Infused Salt: The majestic beauty of Douglas Fir surrounds us here in the Pacific Northwest and its tips have a unique citrus flavor packed with Vitamin C. This salt is meant for pure enjoyment. Great on freshly picked heirloom tomatoes, as a finishing salt for grilled veggies or even on your watermelon slices. So good. \r\n\r\n**Schizandra & Hawthorne Berry Elixir: Berries, honey and brandy are a favorite combination around here. Especially when they are as nutritive as this combination. Schizandra berry has all 5 flavors represented in its taste and in Traditional Chinese Medicine is seen as an ultimate tonic. Hawthorne Berry has a long standing tradition of being used as a heart tonic, both physically and emotionally. Some Flower Essences will appear in this elixir as well. Right now we're thinking a borage flower essence made under the full moon for a little courage.\r\n\r\n**Desert Soap: Ylang Ylang and Desert Sage transport you to the cooling air of the desert at night. Cold processed and moisturizing this soap has blue cornmeal to exfoliate and red clay to help detoxify and nourish the skin. \r\n\r\n**All Purpose Salve with Comfrey & Calendula: for all kinds of summer scrapes, cuts, bug bites and rashes. \r\n\r\n**Limited edition letterpress prints of the summer zodiac constellations by Fortress Letterpress. Individual 5x7 stunning prints. \r\n\r\nIf you are a local Portland resident and can commit to either coming to the Share pick up or having a friend pick your share up for you, please enter the code LOCAL to avoid shipping costs! ** This code applies to CSH Shares only and not individual products unless you want them added to your share, thanks! **\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: In purchasing this CSH share you do so understanding that the information provided in this share is for informational purposes only and is not intended as a substitute for advice from your physician or other health care professional.
