Just thread the clip through one of D-shaped hardware pieces one side at a time. Lined with cotton, it has two elastic-supported and one zippered pocket on the inside. Bag closes with a zipper, so all your precious cargo will stay put. Makes a great work/day/weekend/evening bag. Compliments guaranteed.\r\n\r\n\r\n** All leather is re-claimed, re-purposed or surplus stock, very little waste is produced while making the bags, and most scraps are turned into small accessories, such as coin purses or decorative details.

The soles are made from recycled tires and the straps are from a belt factory in Paris. Great for dressing up or down, I especially love the silver, which is silver in certain light and gold in others - so it's easy to match!  Truly an eco chic dream!\r\n\r\nsizes run a bit small, if you're in between, go up a size. For instance I'm a 9 and the 39/40 is perfect. \r\n\r\nDe la Rue Mission Statement:\r\n\r\n'FROM the road' is who we are. and exactly where we are coming from! Born out of the desire to create a feminine and extremely sassy eco-conscience sandal, our soles are literally hand-cut out of old tires. This guarantees that each pair, although not perfectly refined, is unique and truly an\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nAs opposed to vulcanisation, that is used in the current production of many environmentally driven shoes, at de la Rue we have made a very conscience decision to avoid this route due to the secondary polluting involved in this\r\nprocess. We feel that it does not make much sense to re-pollute in order to revamp original materials, especially since each one-of-a-kind sole contributes to the final charm of the sandal.\r\n\r\nWe are, of course, both a 100% people and animal friendly company. We do not believe in the need to harm animals in the name of vanity, nor in the profit from sweatshops or unethical working conditions of those who are bringing our dreams to life. Our sandals are handcrafted in Portugal, with all of our products sourced from top suppliers in Paris all the way down to Florence.\r\n\r\nOur packaging and communication approach is also relatively minimalist: from the recycled paper that we use to the \"lack of\" plastic bags and excess wrapping. We are very conscientious in avoiding wasteful products that do nothing for our feet or the way that we strut out!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":7074931,"name":"Silver/gold S (37-38)","price":120.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7075041,"name":"Silver/gold M (39-40)","price":120.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7075061,"name":"Silver/gold L (41-42)","price":120.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8333831,"name":"Violet Stripe S (37-38)","price":120.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8333841,"name":"Violet Stripe M (39-40)","price":120.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8333851,"name":"Violet Stripe L (41-42)","price":120.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":22.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/18601801/-/de_la_rue_Silver-01.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/18601801/-/de_la_rue_Silver-01.JPG","width":800,"height":532},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/18601881/-/de_la_rue_Logo.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/18601881/-/de_la_rue_Logo.JPG","width":800,"height":532},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/18601961/-/de_la_rue_Silver-04.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/18601961/-/de_la_rue_Silver-04.JPG","width":800,"height":532},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/22311091/-/de_la_rue_Violet-01.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/22311091/-/de_la_rue_Violet-01.JPG","width":800,"height":532},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/22311251/-/de_la_rue_Violet-02.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/22311251/-/de_la_rue_Violet-02.JPG","width":800,"height":401}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1085701,"name":"Accessories (shoes, hats, bags, home decor)","permalink":"accessories-shoes-hats-bags-home-decor","url":"/category/accessories-shoes-hats-bags-home-decor"}]}]
