Read all about it:\r\n\r\nThere is one product and only one product that goes into the making of Cat-Man-Doo Bonito flakes.  That product is called Katsuowonus pelamis, known to us here in the U.S. as Bonito.  Bonito is a bony fish that hails from the Tuna family.  It is fished wild approximately 300 miles off the East coast of Japan in the salt waters of the western Pacific Ocean, also known as the Sea of Japan.  The seawater is characterized by the elevated concentration of dissolved oxygen that results in high biological productivity.  Therefore, fishing is the dominant economic activity in the region.  Bonito is used extensively in Japanese cuisine for making a savory broth while cats and dogs love the flakes just the way they are, right out of the container!\r\n\r\nOnce caught, the fish is processed both by hand and by machine in a temperature controlled factory.  It is dried then cut into very thin slices. The drying process alone takes 20 to 30 days.  There are no additives or preservatives added to the fish at any point before, during or after the processing.  Absolutely nothing has been introduced into the fish to compromise its purity.  This is an important quality to be aware of when purchasing a healthy treat for your pet.  There are many different brands of bonito available on the market, however, there are a few things that make Cat-Man-Doo Bonito flakes popular with pet owners.\r\n\r\nFirst, Cat-Man-Doo Bonito flakes are among the highest quality flakes on the market and they are derived from a single protein source making them a healthy choice when rewarding your pet.  Cat-Man-Doo flakes are larger, moister, and have a fresher aroma and appearance than other Bonito flakes.  Because Cat-Man-Doo Bonito is high in protein and low in calories with a minimal fat content, it is the perfect choice for our more “robust” pets.  It also contains Taurine which is an essential dietary requirement for feline health.  Taurine protects your cat from serious eye maladies.  The natural fish oils that are found in Bonito will keep your cat or dog’s fur shiny and beautiful.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Cat-Man-Doo uses a patented MAP (Modified Atmosphere Packaging) process.  This technology extracts the oxygen from our containers and immediately seals them tightly, similar to the manner in which potato chips are packaged.  The MAP machine was developed and patented exclusively for Cat-Man-Doo Inc.  This “stay-fresh” packaging minimizes the drying, shrinkage, and breakdown of the flakes and allows the Bonito to stay as fresh as the day it was packaged.  With Bonito, freshness equals flavor and flavor equals quality and this is what drives cats and dogs wild for Cat-Man-Doo Bonito.  Thanks to this packaging process, nutritional value is maintained and the benefits are passed down to your pets by way of retention of the natural fish oils which provide urinary tract health, reduced hair balls, and a silky coat.\r\n\r\nJust prior to packaging, Cat-Man-Doo Bonito flakes are sifted through a ¼” by ¼” stainless steel screen.  This removes a majority of the fines, dust, and small pieces that pets sometimes leave behind making it a better financial choice for customers since nothing goes to waste.  Finally, the flakes are packaged in a clear, reusable, recyclable container so that customers can see what they are buying.  Store your Bonito in a cool, dry place.  There is no need to refrigerate, but direct sunlight will shorten the shelf life of this product.\r\n\r\nAs with all product we sell, a portion of the purchase price will be donated to animal rescue charities.","options":[{"id":27887096,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.25,"amount_with_others":3.25,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.25,"amount_with_others":2.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":11.75,"amount_with_others":5.25},{"amount_alone":4.25,"amount_with_others":2.25,"country":{"id":185,"name":"Puerto Rico","code":"PR"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96739282/-/half_oz_flakes.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96739282/-/half_oz_flakes.JPG","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87389534/-/bonito.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87389534/-/bonito.jpg","width":590,"height":355},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/88661822/-/Bonito.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/88661822/-/Bonito.jpg","width":1000,"height":667}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4377428,"name":"Treats","permalink":"treats","url":"/category/treats"}]},{"id":8887379,"name":"Cat-Man-Doo Bonito Flakes 1 Ounce Tub","permalink":"coming-soon-new-cat-man-doo-bonito-flakes-1-ounce-tub","position":149,"price":9.0,"default_price":9.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/coming-soon-new-cat-man-doo-bonito-flakes-1-ounce-tub","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-11T02:59:04.000Z","description":"This is Oskar's (very healthy) snack of choice!
