They are made by layering colored glass over a core cane of glass, and repeating it layer by layer.  Finally polishing them to revel the deep royal blue, white, and maroon.  \r\n\r\nMost of the newer beads are produced in India and China but are still made in Venice in extremely limited quantities.
