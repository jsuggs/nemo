It uses a Split-flap display to show both hours and minutes. The clock won the prestigious Compasso d'Oro prize for design and has been shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and is in the permanent collection of the Science Museum (London). It was made by Solari di Udine, the company credited with the invention of split-flap public transport timetables.\r\n\r\nEach metal card was silk screened with white numbers in Helvetica font.  The clock is fully functional and the time can be adjusted by turning the knob on the side to either the hour setting or the minute setting.  A previous owner attempted to clean the inside of the domed clear case and caused damage to the case near the top on one side. This is shown in the last image. The damage is minor and only cosmetic; it has caused no issues with the function of the clock.
