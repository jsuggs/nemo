beautiful one of a kind earrings are made from hand rolled recycled paper beads made by women in Uganda who receive fair trade wages, literacy, and entrepreneurial training. each bead is unique because it is handmade, but I've chosen two of similar size and color. the beads are strung on fair trade genuine silver plated head pins with a secure natural loop at the top. the earring hooks are .925 sterling silver fair trade from Israel. they will not bother sensitive ears. \r\n\r\nthis unique pair features beautiful layers of earth red & divine gold accented by bronze metallic seed beads.
