We hand printed 85 of these bad daddies signed and numbered – we will sell 50 of them on the site, and the other 35 are going into our pyro time capsule that we are planting on new years so future civilization and species can see that fantasy sports can be fun. This homage to the greatest Bear ever is a 4 color ink print on craft paper. The poster is 19\"x 25\".\r\n\r\nPlease get your own piece of Pyro® nostalgia for $35.00.","options":[{"id":7948301,"name":"Tan","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/21195891/-/Pyro_Payton_Lrg.jpg.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/21195891/-/Pyro_Payton_Lrg.jpg.jpeg","width":760,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1341491,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]}]
