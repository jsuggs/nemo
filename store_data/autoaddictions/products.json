This system can be adjusted the ride height more sophisticatedly with IC programs which is not the same as other normal air suspension to adjust the ride height by air pressure. This system will measure, record the ride height desired accurately and depend on your setup to adjust the ride height while driving, which will not change the ride height lead to tire wear unusually, bottom out, or chassis attrition resulting from the different weights, temperatures, or any other unpredictable factors. It is a reliable digital ride height control system. Due to the easy installation, the height sensor kit just needs to bolt on the vehicle, the linkage kit should be attached on the lower control arms and then install the wire kit to complete the installation.\r\n \r\n● This is a complete kit with the most excellent dampening setting to match up properties of pneumatic springs in order to increase the vehicle’s stability, unlike other brands come with non adjustable shock absorbers which cause the vehicle to be bouncy and unstable during cornering. Besides, modifying upper mounts, cutting car body or welding the OEM shock to the vehicle are not required when installing our products.\r\n \r\n●  Not only is this system allowed to change air pressure, but you can also adjust the maximum and minimum ride height freely to match up a body kit to get the desired ride height, which is one of our products features that other brands do not have.\r\n \r\n●  This product includes a full set of shock absorbers.

AccuAir's proprietary Advanced Burst-Control-TechnologyTM allows you to choose between three different modes of adjustment; Precise / Moderate / Full Speed. The burst speeds for each of these modes are user-tunable to achieve improved precision from even the largest valves on the market. Although the SwitchSpeedTM does not offer preset heights like the e-LevelTM controller; it can easily be upgraded to the e-LevelTM system down the road.\r\n\r\nHand held or mountable, the SwitchSpeedTM Controller is available in black-anodized or nickel-plated aluminum and gives full manual control over each air spring individually as well as front and rear air spring control in “pairs”. Saving and accessing your three preset speeds is only a touch away and a yellow glowing ring around each button clearly indicates the current valve speed. The “All-Down” button fully deflates the vehicle for parking at your currently selected speed. Every button on the SwitchSpeedTM Controller offers a “crisp” tactile feel and is backlit with crystal white LED’s for clear daytime and nighttime operation. A 20-ft mini-USB cable provides communication to the ECU and plugs into the controller in either the bottom or the rear. The SwitchSpeedTM Controller comes with a built-in compressor control feature that is enabled once the optional tank pressure sensor is plugged in.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n•Maual control of each individual air spring along with front/rear paired adjustments\r\n•3 User programmable adjustment speeds: Precise/Moderate/Full\r\n•Advanced burst-control technology. Precise control over any valve\r\n•Optional air compressor/air tank pressure management upgrade gives three optional tank pressures (150/175/200psi) for more reliable air compressor management. It also monitors vehicle voltage and automatically turns the compressors off at 10.5 volts to prevent a dead battery.\r\n•\"All-Down\" function can be programmed as a momentary \"pancake\" or as a timer based all down function.\r\n•100% weather tolerant for under vehicle mounting.\r\n•Plug-n-Play wiring harnesses for ease of installation.\r\n•Each system is 100% factory tested.\r\n\r\nIncludes:\r\n•SwitchSpeedTM Electronic Control Unit (ECU) with plug and play harnesses and Built-in Fuses.\r\n•SwitchSpeedTM Interface w/ 20 ft USB Cable\r\n•Stainless Steel Mounting Hardware\r\n•Installation & Operation Manuals\r\n","options":[{"id":29165852,"name":"Default","price":325.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91614626/-/valve_5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91614626/-/valve_5.jpg","width":218,"height":200}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3768969,"name":"Accu Air","permalink":"accu-air","url":"/category/accu-air"},{"id":4853836,"name":"Switch Boxes","permalink":"switch-boxes","url":"/category/switch-boxes"}]},{"id":9034286,"name":"Airlift Performance Struts ( EURO )","permalink":"airlift-performance-struts","position":15,"price":768.36,"default_price":768.36,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/airlift-performance-struts","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-20T04:40:50.000Z","description":"---------------------------------AUDI-----------------------------------\r\n1A.

DONT SEE THE MODEL YOUR LOOKING FOR EMAIL US *****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKsport Kontrol Pro Fully Adjustable Coilover Kits provide the ultimate in suspension technology for your street or track car. 36 levels of damping adjustment allow you to fine tune the ride to your handling and comfort needs. The damping adjusts compression and rebound simultaneously for ease of adjustment. Pillow ball top mounts in the front and rear on some applications allow you to maintain vehicle manufacturer suspension geometry design. The pillow ball top mounts also allow you a more direct feel for solid driver response. Where available, camber can be adjusted via the Pillow-ball Top Mounts, which means no additional “Camber Kits” are needed.\r\n \r\nMost applications utilize an adjustable lower mount, which means you adjust height without losing suspension travel like some other coilover designs do. With the mounts and most pieces of the coilover being designed for 6061 billet aluminum the kit is lightweight, durable, and rust resistant. The steel shock body is electroplated with zinc to resist rust and the elements. The valving of each set is matched to the springs installed for unmatched ride quality and reliability.\r\n \r\nThe Ksport system uses a Monotube design in which the oil and gas are separated within the cylinder. When compared to twin tube designs the Monotube dissipates heat better, allows finer damping adjustments, and requires more expensive design process. Aeration and cavitation are a lot less common in a Monotube design, which results in a better ride.\r\n \r\nThe Ksport Kontrol Pro Coilover kit has been designed with professional road racing in mind offering extremely high value and performance.\r\n","options":[{"id":26142495,"name":"Integra 90-93 CAC010-KP","price":780.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26142498,"name":"Integra
