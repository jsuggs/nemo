It is embellished with black sequins to form a leafy/floral print also with the leaf pattern stitched with silvery thread. It is a vintage item that I thrifted myself and has never been worn after purchase. It kind of reminds me of an Ice Skater's top, hence the title \"Midnight Ice,\" for it being of a dark navy-black color. It is very form fitting and sets on the body just right. Cropped into a V-Shape form at the bottom, hits just past the belly button.\r\n\r\nBrand: Papell Boutique \"Evening\"\r\nSize: PS ( I'd say it's petite, small)\r\nMaterial : 100% Silk , Lining 100% Polyester\r\n*Never been worn after purchase\r\n","options":[{"id":20213877,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/62309919/-/seq.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/62309919/-/seq.jpg","width":465,"height":468}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3292677,"name":"Blouses","permalink":"blouses","url":"/category/blouses"}]},{"id":6344493,"name":"Home Bound Dress","permalink":"home-bound-dress","position":2,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/home-bound-dress","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-02T07:06:07.000Z","description":"This dress gives off a western/earthy vibe. It has a pattern of little blue feathers and a cool background to match. It features \"bat-wing,\" sleeves and have extra fabric attached to the waist to tie in the back to adjust to ones liking. Also a slight V-Neck neckline with scallop trim lace detailing surrounding the neck area as seen in the picture. As for color, it is a burnt orange color, a rich orange or more of a sienna. It is a size S and hits above the knee for the person of my height (5'1). It is a dress pre-owned(me being the owner), and only worn once. In great condition and will be great with a pair of brown knee-high boots or even some cute wedges for the summer.\r\n\r\nBrand : Everly\r\nSize: Small (fits loosely)\r\n*Hits above the knee on myself being 5'1\"\r\n**Worn once, like-new","options":[{"id":20212981,"name":"Default","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/62307063/-/CIMG0006-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/62307063/-/CIMG0006-1.jpg","width":414,"height":615}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3292675,"name":"Dresses","permalink":"dresses","url":"/category/dresses"}]}]
