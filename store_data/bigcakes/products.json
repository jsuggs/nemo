PRODUCTION FROM SOME OF THE FINEST UK PRODUCERS INCLUDING NUTTY P, THE ELEMENTZ & IRON RYAN MOVEMAKERS. READ THE BBC MUSIC REVIEW BELOW: \r\n\r\nBBC Review\r\n\"Authentic, honest, witty, and compelling. \"\r\n\r\nJames Young 2007-10-05\r\n\r\nWith this debut full-length release Deptford’s Big Cakes (AKA Mister Kipling) has created an absorbing and essential album. Here is a storyteller at the top of the game, building pictures with words in such a compelling manner that each track seems to finish too early, and he spits slow so you don’t miss a word of his flow. Behind the desk an A-list of exciting UK producers give him the platform he deserves.\r\n\r\nBeggaring belief, there really is not a weak track so it's hard to pick highlights. The banging bass and drums of \"London\" get it all off to a thumping start. Compared to the slick picture just dished up by Kano, Cakes’ London - ‘Coz we’re living in the jungle, or should I say Babylon-don, nobody stays humble, everybody screams, nobody mumbles, mind how you talk before you get rumbled' – feels like it comes from a man who still lives on its streets and still loves the place. Slurping and chomping \"Food Skit\" is that scarce thing; a skit that is genuinely funny. It segues right into the minimal beats and heavy synth rhythms of \"Never Had Time\", whose less-is-more attitude gives puts his rhymes in the right place – up front.\r\n\r\nHe has said that the album is easy listening and up there for the easiest of listens are the back-to-back tracks produced by DJ Tacktick. Cakes rolls his flow over gentle piano loops in \"Tips (Limelight)\", a cautionary tale on the perils of golddiggers. It's classic hip hop with a south London accent. Following on, \"Crush You\" contains the Arsenal fan delighter 'You’re dodgy like Ashley Cole'. It’s not all mellow though. There is some riotous, righteous ire from the same dimension as NWA. Closer \"I’m A King\"is a no-holds-barred assault on just about anyone who has crossed his path.\r\n\r\nThe album is everything British hip-hop should be: Authentic, honest, witty, and compelling. It’s a contender for British Hip-Hop Album of the year so far.\r\n\r\nCreative Commons Licence ","options":[{"id":9471947,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25928484/-/big1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25928484/-/big1.jpg","width":140,"height":140}],"artists":[{"id":45010,"name":"Big Cakes","permalink":"big-cakes","url":"/artist/big-cakes"}],"categories":[{"id":1597579,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
