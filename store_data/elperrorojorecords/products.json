Indulging the listener in a bizarre listen, cock rock on lap tops... what's that all about!\r\n \r\nA 3 piece hooded live spectacle from men old enough to be dating nieces. Audiences across the land from rooms with 3 people in to 300 left concerts in a state of shock, awe or ecstasy.\r\n\r\nMirroring every rock cliche they purposely took 8 years to release their second album.  A strategic decision to out mode Guns & Roses 'difficult' come back record.\r\n\r\nThe myths. Chalice decrees being delivered to them by members of Saxon on the moors above Barnsley, Sebastian being donated Phil Collins penis in a final life saving operation... the band have never 'played the game'.\r\n\r\n'Heavy Mental' is the end of Fast Lady. The band with help from friends, influences and heroes. \r\n\r\nThe album has taken over a year to collate with help and input from the best of best: Shitmat, Cock ESP, Animal, The Nearly, Solypsis, DJ Sarah Wilson and many many more.\r\n\r\nArtists worldwide from the usual suspects. ex- V/Vm Test records, Wrong Music  and Digital Vomit have all contributed.\r\n\r\nAn album that we promise you will have never heard the like of before.\r\n\r\nNor will you ever hear again.\r\n\r\nFast Lady (1999 - 2012)\r\n\r\nAvailable to order now:\r\n\r\nLimited edition CD in custom packaging \r\n\r\nAll pre-orders will receive the digital album pre-release with an exclusive remix by Twenty Three of 'Blue Jean'\r\n\r\nOfficial release date 30th April 2012.\r\n\r\n01 GUNS WOMEN N BIKES (SHARP TOOLS REMIX)\r\n02 WILD EYED WOMAN (THE NEARLY REMIX)\r\n03 MASK OF VERLAINE  (ANIMAL MACGREGOR’S CAVERN TAVERN REMIX)\r\n04 RECIPE OF SIN (BLUE AMBEROL REMIX)\r\n05 BROKEN BISCUITS (SHITMAT’S DR.
