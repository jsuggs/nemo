There is simply no one else like him. Singer/Songwriter? By definition. And Picasso was a painter. But as one reviewer said, “Olney stands out like a jalapeño in a bowl of vanilla pudding.” Americana artist? Sure. He draws from the many deep roots of American music, but what he grows from those roots is unmistakably unique.\r\n\r\nOver the course of four decades and 25 critically acclaimed albums, Olney’s unforgettable songs and powerful performances have attracted a devoted following the world over. Such luminaries as Emmylou Harris, Del McCoury and Linda Ronstadt have recorded his songs, and Townes Van Zandt famously listed him among his four favorites — along with Dylan, Mozart and Lightnin’ Hopkins.\r\n\r\nIn performance, Olney is a revelation. The shows are seamless and riveting, never more so than in the company of chameleonic multi-instrumentalist Sergio Webb. Since 2007, Webb has added his sonic sorcery to Olney’s songs, enriching and embellishing them with a near-brotherly empathy.\r\n\r\nSpecial Guest: Signature Sounds recording artist,  Zoe Muth \r\n\r\nJoin us Friday Jan. 24th\r\nSons of Hermann Hall\r\n3414 Elm St. \r\nDallas TX 75226\r\n\r\nDoors  7pm\r\nShow   8pm\r\n\r\nAdvance tickets $17\r\nDay of Show $20\r\n\r\nAll Advance Tickets will be available at the door, night of show.\r\n","options":[{"id":47728860,"name":"Default","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129012732/-/DOswDallasTXtour2014.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129012732/-/DOswDallasTXtour2014.jpg","width":1983,"height":3008},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127285203/-/David_Olney_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127285203/-/David_Olney_1.jpg","width":300,"height":450},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129012954/-/Zoe_Muth_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129012954/-/Zoe_Muth_2.jpg","width":2912,"height":2479}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
