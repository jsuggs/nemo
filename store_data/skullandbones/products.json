Though it is in a similar sonic realm to fellow historical crossover acts such as Propaghandi, Municipal Waste and Darkest Hour, ‘Masonic Youth’ indeed does present a robust identity of its own. With a dual vocal attack that sees drummer Jay trade off razor-edged screams with guitarist Chris’ husky melodies, the 11 tracks are filled with an honest and intense urgency, yet don’t suffocate a sense of fun in the process. \r\nIdentity Theft is well and truly back, and ‘Masonic Youth’ is a milestone poised to turn the head’s of a whole new generation of hardcore and metal fans across the world.\r\n","options":[{"id":1590812,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3215959/-/CDCOVERweb.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3215959/-/CDCOVERweb.jpg","width":340,"height":340}],"artists":[{"id":9053,"name":"IDENTITY THEFT","permalink":"identity-theft","url":"/artist/identity-theft"}],"categories":[{"id":51767,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":297929,"name":"SAB025 - CROSS THE LIPS OF GRACE \"The Epilogue Of Suffering\" CD-Album","permalink":"sab025-cross-the-lips-of-grace-the-epilogue-of-suffering-cd-album","position":7,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sab025-cross-the-lips-of-grace-the-epilogue-of-suffering-cd-album","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-05-13T06:44:23.000Z","description":"TRACKLISTING: -\r\n\r\n1.

Sure enough, the opportunities soon came knocking, and the group went on to support international deathcore giants All Shall Perish and Whitechapel, as well as Australian groups Parkway Drive, The Red Shore and I Killed The Prom Queen.  \r\nThe agonizing wait for a full release is nearly over, as the devastating debut album is finally compete and ready to shock, maim and exhilarate; guttural vocals hit below the belt, while shredding guitars blow minds and huge breakdowns wipe the floor with the competition across these thirteen overwhelming displays of heaviness. With the group’s huge online following foreshadowing a reputation on the very cusp of breaking out into international recognition, get ready for some seriously heavy tunes and plenty of live mayhem to follow when The Epilogue of Suffering explodes on April 11. \r\n","options":[{"id":1240317,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3216419/-/SAB025.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3216419/-/SAB025.jpg","width":340,"height":340}],"artists":[{"id":6449,"name":"CROSS THE LIPS OF GRACE","permalink":"cross-the-lips-of-grace","url":"/artist/cross-the-lips-of-grace"}],"categories":[{"id":51767,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":297924,"name":"SAB024 - HIROSHIMA WILL BURN \"To The Weight Of All Things\" CD-Album","permalink":"sab024-hiroshima-will-burn-to-the-weight-of-all-things-cd-album","position":8,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sab024-hiroshima-will-burn-to-the-weight-of-all-things-cd-album","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-05-13T06:40:26.000Z","description":"TRACKLISTING: -\r\n\r\n1.\tMethodical Disfigurement\r\n2.\tIn Voluptate Mors\r\n3.\tEnigmatic Consumption\r\n4.\tLaberinto\r\n5.\tMartyrium\r\n6.\tDefilement\r\n7.\tAd Pondus Omnium\r\n8.\tThe Black Death\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHY: -\r\n\r\nSince forming in 2006 when all the members were aged only 15-18 years, the brutal powerhouse that is HIROSHIMA WILL BURN finally has a debut album that will show the world why they are deserved of the frenetic hype that follows them. ‘To The Weight Of All Things’ is undoubtedly among the most technically advanced death metal albums to have ever come from the shadowy reaches of the Australian underground metal scene, and showcases a band that has so much more than just a firm handle on their instrumental and song-writing skills. \r\nTaking influence from death metal visionaries such as Origin, The Faceless, Behemoth and Necrophagist, the album is a harrowing journey from start to finish. Intensely guttural and frantic vocals complement mind-blowing riffage, while the main course of gnarly shredding and hyperactive drumming is served with a side of bombastic grooves. Not content to leave it at being simply brutal though, these boys even bring out jazz-influenced progressive jams along the course of the album that really need to be heard to be believed. \r\nHaving already shared the stage with international acts such as Caliban, Bring Me The Horizon, Between The Buried And Me, For The Fallen Dreams and The Ghost Inside, as well as being invited to play at 2007’s prestigious Taste Of Chaos festival, it can be said without a doubt that HIROSHIMA WILL BURN is only getting started. 2009 is the year that their young shoulders carry ‘The Weight Of All Things’.\r\n","options":[{"id":1240280,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3216443/-/SAB024.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3216443/-/SAB024.jpg","width":340,"height":340}],"artists":[{"id":6448,"name":"HIROSHIMA WILL BURN","permalink":"hiroshima-will-burn","url":"/artist/hiroshima-will-burn"}],"categories":[{"id":51767,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":258113,"name":"SAB023 - ANIME FIRE \"On The Wings Of Hope\" CD-EP","permalink":"sab023-anime-fire-on-the-wings-of-hope-cd-ep","position":9,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sab023-anime-fire-on-the-wings-of-hope-cd-ep","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-03-17T19:38:39.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":1096430,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3216471/-/SAB023.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3216471/-/SAB023.jpg","width":340,"height":340}],"artists":[{"id":6450,"name":"ANIME FIRE","permalink":"anime-fire","url":"/artist/anime-fire"}],"categories":[{"id":51767,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":213495,"name":"SAB022 - VALUES HERE \"Greet The Sun\" CD-Album","permalink":"values-here-debut-cd-pre-order","position":10,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/values-here-debut-cd-pre-order","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-01-08T17:48:01.000Z","description":"Debut album","options":[{"id":933591,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3216475/-/SAB022.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3216475/-/SAB022.jpg","width":340,"height":340}],"artists":[{"id":6455,"name":"VALUES HERE","permalink":"values-here","url":"/artist/values-here"}],"categories":[{"id":51767,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":174772,"name":"SAB021 - WISH FOR WINGS - \"Afterlife\" CD-Album - VERY LIMITED COPIES!","permalink":"wish-for-wings-afterlife-album","position":11,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wish-for-wings-afterlife-album","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-10-29T11:32:07.000Z","description":"TRACKLISTING: -\r\n\r\n1.\tIntroduction\r\n2.\tMister Evening\r\n3.\tWolves\r\n4.\tDeepening Darkened World\r\n5.\tHang ‘Em High\r\n6.\tAfterlife \r\n7.\tBest Three Out Of Five\r\n8.\tBurnt Back To Life\r\n9.\tBelow Zero\r\n10.\tDeath Before Disco\r\n11.\tDay By Day\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHY: -\r\n\r\nSince their inception in the then burgeoning North Coast Hardcore Scene, WISH FOR WINGS have become a reputable force not just in their home state of Queensland, but across Australia after exposing hungry crowds to their savage blend of metal and hardcore antics. Gaining popularity off their frenetic and devasting live show, WISH FOR WINGS gained admiration from peers and fans alike when they dropped the punishing debut EP ‘From the Past to the Grave’ through Washed Up Records in 2005, which then allowed them to accomplish numerous successful national tours and play with the cream of the Australian crop like Parkway Drive, I Killed The Prom Queen and Day Of Contempt. Their loyal fan base has also garnered them major support slots for international acts like MADBALL, RAISED FIST, HATEBREED, EVERGREEN TERRACE and more.\r\n\r\nNow, in 2008, WISH FOR WINGS are ready to step things up again with a new, more focused line-up and their debut full length album, ‘Afterlife’. Featuring thick and heavy guitar riffage, a tight and furious rythym section and a vigorous vocal attack, ‘Afterlife’ sees WISH FOR WINGS doing what they do best; playing hard and fast with plenty of mosh. The album also sees the band taking on an even larger and more dynamic approach by incorporating melodic elements, epic chrouses and loads of sing-a-longs to make sure that their music stands out in this life and the next. ‘Afterlife’ is out November 12th on Skull And Bones Records through STOMP Distribution.\r\n","options":[{"id":795388,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3216487/-/SAB021.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3216487/-/SAB021.jpg","width":340,"height":340}],"artists":[{"id":6463,"name":"WISH FOR WINGS","permalink":"wish-for-wings","url":"/artist/wish-for-wings"}],"categories":[{"id":51767,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":396243,"name":"SAB019 - BENNESON THEORY \"Heavy Burdens Make Light Of This\" CD-EP","permalink":"sab019-benneson-theory-heavy-burdens-make-light-of-this-cd-ep","position":12,"price":2.5,"default_price":2.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sab019-benneson-theory-heavy-burdens-make-light-of-this-cd-ep","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-09-14T06:09:08.000Z","description":"TRACKLISTING: -\r\n\r\n1.\tI Trust Me\r\n2.\tSecurity Wipes\r\n3.\tHigh Times Are Bad Times\r\n4.\t5 Minutes\r\n5.\tDiscordance\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHY: -\r\n\r\nIt is said that sin is whatever obscures the soul. What can weigh down the lives of some; can lift the plight of others. Coming from a small town, the boys from Queensland’s BENNESON THEORY have had to deal with their fare share of skepticism. But instead of playing the lesser hand and bowing down in defeat, they have crafted their own blend of musical fury to enrich the soul rather than destroy it.\r\n\r\nNow a proud and productive melodic hardcore band, BENNESON THEORY play a crushing and emotive mix of Screamo, hardcore and metal and have been likened to a combination of Evergreen Terrace, Alexisonfire and Misery Signals. Showing a steadfast penchant for maturity, these young lads have quickly become a popular touring band, visiting an array of locations along the East Coast multiple times. They have shared the stage with many popular local and international acts such as The Rivalry, Cry Murder, Her Nightmare, Faker, He Is Legend (USA) and The Amity Affliction.\r\n\r\nHaving just finished a national tour with label-mates A Secret Death and The Abandonment, BENNESON THEORY are now ready to release their crowning achievement, the debut EP titled “Heavy Burdens Make Light Of This” through Skull and Bones Records this August. Featuring soaring vocals, puncturing drum work and a wall of furious guitars, this will be a must have for any local music buff or fan of the hardcore genre.\r\n","options":[{"id":1591022,"name":"Default","price":2.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3216527/-/SAB019.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3216527/-/SAB019.jpg","width":340,"height":340}],"artists":[{"id":6462,"name":"BENNESON THEORY","permalink":"benneson-theory","url":"/artist/benneson-theory"}],"categories":[{"id":51767,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":396249,"name":"SAB018 - ROBOTOSAURUS \"Manhater\" CD-Album","permalink":"sab018-robotosaurus-manhater-cd-album","position":13,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sab018-robotosaurus-manhater-cd-album","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-09-14T06:14:18.000Z","description":"TRACKLISTING: - \r\n\r\n1.\tMuddy Water Is Muddy Water\r\n2.\tParty Sick\r\n3.\tTrack Marks\r\n4.\tSleep\r\n5.\tBlack Hate Devils\r\n6.\tNever Alone In Hell\r\n7.\tGolden Bars\r\n8.\tVision\r\n9.\tBlack Eyes\r\n10.\tDesperate Love\r\n11.\tDouble-Edged Sword\r\n12.\tInternal Bleeding\r\n13.\tMankind\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHY: -\r\n\r\nProgression is described as an onward or forward movement. ROBOTOSAURUS have taken action and pushed through the barriers of heavy music to create the next extreme in sonic defilement. With a line-up composed of veterans from the ranks of Love Like... Electrocution, The Rivalry, Meat Wallet, Equal Minded, The Jonestown Syndicate, Donkey Kong, The New Mutiny and This City Dynamite!, it has been clear since the beginning that this was a band destined for greatness. \r\n\r\nIn May 2007 they released their debut EP, “Sayra Bahk Volume 1: Last Refuge Of The Exiled Man”, only to satisfy the appetites of their rapidly expanding fan base with the release of “Sayra Bahk Volume 2: Trifornais” in July that same year. With both pressings selling out within six months of their release, ROBOTOSAURUS wasted no time in cultivating what would become “Manhater”, their dark, crushing, and frantic debut album. Cramming 13 songs into just 25.5 chaotic minutes, the release is the band's most focused and mature sounding effort to date, with their skilful manipulation of brutal sounds bringing to mind the likes of Converge, Discordance Axis, The Dillinger Escape Plan and Daughters. \r\n\r\nThis July will see the band hit the road to celebrate the release of the album with US cinema grinders GRAF ORLOCK joining them for the trek, and that's just the beginning of what's to come. August 3rd will see the official release of “Manhater” through Skull and Bones Records and mark the day when music just got a whole lot more complicated.  \r\n","options":[{"id":1591029,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3216611/-/SAB018.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3216611/-/SAB018.jpg","width":340,"height":340}],"artists":[{"id":6461,"name":"ROBOTOSAURUS","permalink":"robotosaurus","url":"/artist/robotosaurus"}],"categories":[{"id":51767,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":396252,"name":"SAB017 - A SECRET DEATH \"Self-titled\" CD-Album","permalink":"sab017-a-secret-death-self-titled-cd-album","position":14,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sab017-a-secret-death-self-titled-cd-album","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-09-14T06:16:12.000Z","description":"TRACKLISTING: -\r\n\r\n1.

Not a truer word could ever be spoken about the world of music. From their humble beginnings as an up and coming Queensland band, ASECRETDEATH have always been inspired to write timeless and eclectic music. Priding themselves on harnessing and crafting songs with emotion, the group has blended dark, expansive and metallic elements to develop their own definitive and unique soundscape.\r\n\r\nHailing from the unsuspecting sunny grounds of The Gold Coast, ASECRETDEATH wowed fans critics alike when their second EP, “Fear Is The Driving Force”, was unleashed to a wealth of salivating fans in 2005. On the back of their frenetic and skillful live show, the group then gained notoriety through national tours and multiple international supports, including THE DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN, CONVERGE, EVERY TIME I DIE, UNEARTH, DARKEST HOUR, NORMA JEAN and STORY OF THE YEAR.\r\n\r\nNow, after an arduous recording process spanning across two years and two continents, the wait is finally over and ASECRETDEATH will be releasing their debut self-titled album on August 23rd through Skull and Bones Records. With another national tour following soon and plans to lead the charge internationally across America, Japan and New Zealand, ASECRETDEATH have taken their sound to new heights. Sure to be a cacophony of melodic, introspective and technical fury, this is one album that you won’t want too miss.\r\n","options":[{"id":1591042,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3216623/-/SAB017.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3216623/-/SAB017.jpg","width":340,"height":340}],"artists":[{"id":6453,"name":"A SECRET DEATH","permalink":"a-secret-death","url":"/artist/a-secret-death"}],"categories":[{"id":51767,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":396254,"name":"SAB016 - GALLOWS FOR GRACE \"A Process For The Destruction OF Tomorrow\" CD-EP","permalink":"sab016-gallows-for-grace-a-process-for-the-destruction-of-tomorrow-cd-ep","position":15,"price":2.5,"default_price":2.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sab016-gallows-for-grace-a-process-for-the-destruction-of-tomorrow-cd-ep","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-09-14T06:18:16.000Z","description":"TRACKLISTING: -\r\n\r\n1.\tRites\r\n2.\tWorld Eater\r\n3.\tThe Process\r\n4.\tPurest Atrophy\r\n5.\tPrimordial Orbit\r\n6.\tRevealing The Helical Nether\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHY: -\r\n\r\nIt’s rare to find a band that is as crushing sonically as they are aware of socio-economic influences, yet such a band can be found in form of Gallows For Grace. This tight, mechanical death metal five-piece was conceived in Perth, an area that has become notorious for producing original acts that can push the boundaries of heavy music well and truly to their limits. Since their formation in 2006, the band has toured through Western Australia, Victoria and shared the stage with many reputable national international acts like Job For A Cowboy, Psycroptic, Darkest Hour, The Red Shore and Obituary.\r\n\r\nGallows For Grace have completed the final stages of recording and with the production being handled by Geoff Eaton at DEPTH Studios, the release will undoubtedly bring something new and innovative, whilst pushing the band in a new direction.  Combining elements of Technical, Brutal and Melodic Death with the thunderous sounds of slam and grind, Gallows For Grace's debut EP, entitled A Process for the Destruction of Tomorrow will showcase the band's varied influences whilst maintaining an overall form. \r\n\r\nLyrically, A Process for the Destruction of Tomorrow will deal with an apocalyptic theme, warning the human race of the dire consequences of its desire for war and the effects of mankind's insatiable appetite on the world's resources. The lyrics will depict the death of the earth, and tell us the story of mankind's extinction and the rebirth of our planet. The signs are no longer ignorable, with a sound as melodic and devastating as Gallows For Grace, we will only have two choices, acknowledge the day of judgment or die…\r\n","options":[{"id":1591048,"name":"Default","price":2.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3216651/-/SAB016.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3216651/-/SAB016.jpg","width":340,"height":340}],"artists":[{"id":6452,"name":"GALLOWS FOR GRACE","permalink":"gallows-for-grace","url":"/artist/gallows-for-grace"}],"categories":[{"id":51767,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":396255,"name":"SAB015 - THY ART IS MURDER \"Infinite Death\" CD-EP","permalink":"sab015-thy-art-is-murder-infinite-death-cd-ep","position":16,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sab015-thy-art-is-murder-infinite-death-cd-ep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-09-14T06:20:13.000Z","description":"TRACKLISTING: -\r\n\r\n1.\tI’ll Show You God\r\n2.\tWhore To A Chainsaw\r\n3.\tParasitic Autopsy\r\n4.\tBreeding Bacteria\r\n5.\tInfinite Death\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHY: -\r\n\r\nCombining the best elements of contemporary death metal, pulverizing-mosh and gore-riddled lyrics delivered with furious intensity, emerging metal upstarts Thy Art Is Murder have always prided themselves on personifying brutality. Forged in the depths of Western Sydney in 2006, the young group immediately became infamous for their extreme live performance and commanding stage presence. \r\n\r\nTheir impressive line-up consists of Sean Delander and Gary Markowski on guitar, whose front line assault of breakdowns and sweeping fills are enforced by the rapid blasts and intensity of drummer Lee Stanton. Josh King providing the devastating low end and vocalist Brendan Van Ryn stalks the stage with heartless screeches and unforgiving bellows that haunt this technical cacophony. Together their concoction of mechanical fury and tortured screams, complete the sickening sound that is Thy Art Is Murder. Using their sudden and undeniable internet success through their Myspace profile, Thy Art Is Murder showed that people definitely liked what they heard from this young five-piece deathcore outfit. Soon after they gained a spot on the QLD “Slaughter of the Stage” tour and hit the road as a support act. However by the end of trip, they were in headlining position due to the crowds overwhelming response from their ruthless live show.\r\n\r\nIn early 2007, after writing new material for a release and unleashing brutal live shows across Sydney, Thy Art Is Murder stepped into the studio to record five destructive tracks for an upcoming EP. Not long after stepping out of the studio, the group garnered the attention of independent label “Skull and Bones” and the future of this promising metal act is yet to be written. As the Australian metal scene grows stronger and more notorious with each passing second, it is inevitable that the crushing force of Thy Art Is Murder, will be seeing massive things on the horizon.\r\n","options":[{"id":1591051,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3216667/-/SAB015.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3216667/-/SAB015.jpg","width":340,"height":340}],"artists":[{"id":6451,"name":"THY ART IS MURDER","permalink":"thy-art-is-murder","url":"/artist/thy-art-is-murder"}],"categories":[{"id":51767,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":396258,"name":"SAB014 - BLOODSPORT \"Imprisonment\" CD-Album","permalink":"sab014-bloodsport-imprisonment-cd-album","position":17,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sab014-bloodsport-imprisonment-cd-album","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-09-14T06:22:16.000Z","description":"TRACKLISTING: -\r\n\r\n1.\tDevoted To This\r\n2.\tRemove The Poison\r\n3.\tImprisonment\r\n4.\tFace Your Enemies\r\n5.\tRise Or Fall\r\n6.\tFollowing Demons\r\n7.\tGet Out My Face\r\n8.\tCondemned\r\n9.\tBetrayer\r\n10.\tTo The Death\r\n11.\tBlood Sweat Loyalty\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHY: -\r\n\r\nThe members of Adelaide’s BLOODSPORT have hardcore running through their veins. That’s no surprise given the loyal, prolific, and inspirational environment generated by the many classic Australian hardcore bands that spawned the scene in which they grew up. The band blew audiences away at their first show in December of 2005, where they opened for the likes of 50 LIONS, STRONGHOLD, and WISH FOR WINGS, and have since not relented on the live front. \r\n\r\nWith their debut album “Imprisonment”, the band have swiftly and aggressively taken hold of the reigns left behind by greats such as DAY OF CONTEMPT and SHOTPOINTBLANK. Skillfully combining their native influences with the sounds of international hardcore/metal amalgamations such as CATARACT and HATEBREED, the four-piece recorded their 11 track debut across two of their hometown’s most renowned studios, with an earth-shattering drum sound laid down at Sound House Studios, before finishing the juggernaut off at Slaughterhouse with engineer Kyle Bloksgard (THE RIVALRY). Delivered with an honest rage and an admirable moral integrity and awareness, “Imprisonment” contains all the perfectly delivered ingredients to drive the band to the top of the pile. \r\n\r\nWith tours interstate alongside THE DAYLIGHT CURSE, THROUGH CLOSED EYES, and more under their belts, the band recently made a successful trek to New Zealand before brutalizing their hometown in support of US hardcore giants MADBALL and DEATH BEFORE DISHONOR. BLOODSPORT are ready to storm the nation.

With the group continuously building their name through more tours and supports, perhaps most notably including UNEARTH, DARKEST HOUR, and their national trek last June with NORMA JEAN and EVERY TIME I DIE, the demand to own this landmark piece of Australian heavy music history has become stronger than ever. Featuring not only new artwork and liner notes, the re-released version of “Fear Is the Driving Force” also boasts four bonus tracks, including the two songs from the band’s 2005 split with Brisbane group FROM THESE WOUNDS, and two previously unreleased songs from the band’s early days, polished and recorded fresh for 2008. \r\n\r\nHaving since rotated members, made the move to a five piece, and refined their sound to even more introspective and technical levels, ASECRETDEATH are gearing up to drop their long-awaited, and as of yet untitled debut album this May on Skull And Bones Records. This re-release provides a perfect starting point for the band’s new fans, and is an essential piece in any complete collection. \r\n","options":[{"id":1591065,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3216699/-/SAB013.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3216699/-/SAB013.jpg","width":340,"height":340}],"artists":[{"id":6453,"name":"A SECRET DEATH","permalink":"a-secret-death","url":"/artist/a-secret-death"}],"categories":[{"id":51767,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":396263,"name":"SAB012 - LOYAL TO THE GRAVE \"Still Climbin' Still Believin'\" CD-Album","permalink":"sab012-loyal-to-the-grave-still-climbin-still-believin-cd-album","position":19,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sab012-loyal-to-the-grave-still-climbin-still-believin-cd-album","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-09-14T06:27:11.000Z","description":"TRACKLISTING: -\r\n\r\n1.\tStagnation\r\n2.\tSuffer Going Through Life\r\n3.\tNext Mark\r\n4.\tStill Climbin' Still Believin'\r\n5.\tForecast\r\n6.\tBurn Everything\r\n7.\tFootprint\r\n8.\t168 Set Terror(Urban Legend Mix)\r\n9.\tEmpty Sky, Close Your Eyes \r\n\r\nEXCLUSIVE BONUS LIVE TRACKS\r\n\r\n10.\tStagnation\r\n11.\tForthright\r\n12.\tEndless Maze\r\n13.\tForecast\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHY: -\r\n\r\nOriginally formed as a side project to Japanese hardcore legends STATECRAFT, LOYAL TO THE GRAVE quickly became the main focal point for all members involved. Through their crunching, no-bullshit tunes and confronting lyrics, Tokyo’s LOYAL TO THE GRAVE has solidified their name as a staple in the Japanese hardcore scene. This hard work has been duly noted through support slots with TERROR, HATEBREED, CONVERGE, and HEAVEN SHALL BURN. \r\n\r\nTheir album “Most Wanted 168th Infantry” was distributed locally in 2005 to a widely positive response. Skull And Bones Records is now proud to release the powerhouse’s next opus of fiery, walloping hardcore anthems, “Still Climbin’, Still Believin’”, which was originally released in early 2007. With the perfect mix of fast and tight thrash, pummeling riffage, and mosh parts straight out of the NYHC scene, this release proves to the world that the Japanese can be just as, if not more so, tough, brutal, and catchy as the rest of the worldwide hardcore movement. The Australian version of the album also features brand new artwork and four exclusive live tracks recorded last year not available anywhere else!\r\n\r\nWith “Still Climbin’, Still Believin’” receiving rave reviews across the globe, as well as a split 7” with THE ACACIA STRAIN, and a three-way split EP with WINDS OF PLAGUE and xARMED FOR BATTLEx under their belts, it’s time for LOYAL TO THE GRAVE to take over the world.

The 4-piece delivers a new interpretation of melodic hardcore, when fused with modern metal and break beat electronica to create something all to their own. This is an act that is not afraid to push the boundaries both in the studio and with their live show.\r\n\r\nTheir debut EP was recorded with Shaun O'Callaghan @ Studio Couch (The John Butler Trio, Eskimo Joe, etc) and mastered by Steve Smart @ Studio 301, and features artwork from acclaimed designers SWITZERLAND (Every Time I Die, Parkway Drive, Poison The Well) \r\n\r\nIn the short time since the bands creation, ANIME FIRE have already shared the stage with a number of International and National acts in Perth including at the 2006 TASTE OF CHAOS Festival alongside the likes of: TAKING BACK SUNDAY, SENSES FAIL, THURSDAY, SAOSIN, ANTI-FLAG, UNDEROATH and PARKWAY DRIVE, plus additional tour supports for international acts DARKEST HOUR (USA) SILVERSTEIN (USA), ALL SHALL PERISH (USA), THE UNSEEN (USA), SET YOUR GOALS (USA), FROM AUTUMN TO ASHES (USA) and THE BLED (USA), as well as established Australian acts such as I KILLED THE PROM QUEEN, THE AMITY AFFLICTION, MINDSNARE, MILES AWAY and PSYCROPTIC. Following their successful late 2007 tour, the band will be tour Australia’s east coast in April for another extensive tour in support of the EP; these guys are definitely an act to watch out for.\r\n","options":[{"id":1591080,"name":"Default","price":2.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47696445/-/SAB009600x600.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47696445/-/SAB009600x600.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":6450,"name":"ANIME FIRE","permalink":"anime-fire","url":"/artist/anime-fire"}],"categories":[{"id":51767,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":2711132,"name":"SAB007 - THE AMITY AFFLICTION \"HIGH HOPES\" CD/DVD-EP","permalink":"sab007-the-amity-affliction-high-hopes-cd-dvd-ep","position":23,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sab007-the-amity-affliction-high-hopes-cd-dvd-ep","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-08-21T11:58:19.000Z","description":"LAST EVER COPIES WITH BONUS DVD!!!","options":[{"id":9536372,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26155854/-/SAB007.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26155854/-/SAB007.jpg","width":340,"height":340}],"artists":[{"id":6457,"name":"THE AMITY AFFLICTION","permalink":"the-amity-affliction","url":"/artist/the-amity-affliction"}],"categories":[{"id":51767,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":2711135,"name":"SAB007x - THE AMITY AFFLICTION \"HIGH HOPES\" CD-EP","permalink":"sab007x-the-amity-affliction-high-hopes-cd-ep","position":24,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sab007x-the-amity-affliction-high-hopes-cd-ep","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-08-21T12:02:30.000Z","description":"1.   \tI Heart Throbsy\r\n2.  \tRip Steggy\r\n3.  \tStraight Up\r\n4.  \tDong Wayne\r\n5.  \tCut It Out \r\n5.     secret...","options":[{"id":9536383,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26155866/-/SAB007.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26155866/-/SAB007.jpg","width":340,"height":340}],"artists":[{"id":6457,"name":"THE AMITY AFFLICTION","permalink":"the-amity-affliction","url":"/artist/the-amity-affliction"}],"categories":[{"id":51767,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
