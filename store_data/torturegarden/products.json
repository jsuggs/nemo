Cover art by Bill Hauser.\r\n\r\nReview:\r\nIf you're a fan of 80's thrash, you really can't go wrong with this band. They have a sound that's somewhere between Exodus and Anthrax. Their lyrics cover the gamut of thrash topics, with a definite nod to the humorous subjects covered by Stormtroopers of Death. You don't have to tell FKU that this has all been done before; they know this. FKU are having a great time playing these tunes. You should have a great time listening to them.\r\n\r\nThe first track has a nice thrash pace, with lots of Anthrax and SOD influence, especially in the mosh part. The singer has a little Zetro in his vocals until the end of the song when he lets the falsetto fly. The lyrics are especially funny as they contain a lot of song titles of classic thrash tunes strung together to make sentences that actually make sense. The second track is a Tankard cover. This song stays pretty faithful to the original, though the ripping solo in the middle has a strong Slayer feel with lots of whammy bar abuse.","options":[{"id":19021707,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58355477/-/R-1449287-1221061884_1_.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58355477/-/R-1449287-1221061884_1_.jpeg","width":540,"height":540}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2197639,"name":"7\" EP","permalink":"7-ep","url":"/category/7-ep"},{"id":2218413,"name":"Torture Garden releases","permalink":"torture-garden-releases","url":"/category/torture-garden-releases"}]}]
