By subscribing to our CSA or Community Supported Agriculture program, members help our farm buy seeds and supplies in preparation for the growing season.\r\n\r\n In return for their early investment, members receive a weekly bouquet or bucket of  our certified organic specialty cut flowers. Our farm is focused on growing using sustainable methods and we take pride in the freshness and quality of our flowers. Every arrangement is made on the farm, preservative-free, from stems picked on the same day as or a day before delivery. Members will notice a sharp contrast in quality and freshness of our blooms from the traditional commercial flowers and will contribute to support a locally owned, sustainably minded farm.\r\n\r\n The bouquet share consists of one lush romantic  hand-made bouquet presented to members in a choice of  two options:  hand-tied, wrapped in brown paper or styled in a returnable vase. Members choosing the wrapped option simply fill a vase at home with fresh water, snip the ends of the flower stems, and place the bouquet in the vase for a beautiful addition to their home or office. The vase option is aimed at members wanting a ready-to-enjoy format where the previous week’s empty vase is swapped for the new fresh organic bouquet. Ideal for business fronts or offices.\r\n \r\nFor more information, click the Organic flower CSA details link on the right side-bar. \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":29886795,"name":"full season, 16weeks","price":300.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/93915677/-/CIMG8188.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/93915677/-/CIMG8188.jpg","width":750,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4669069,"name":"Organic flowers CSA","permalink":"organic-flowers-csa","url":"/category/organic-flowers-csa"}]},{"id":9562483,"name":"Bouquet Subscription, half season ( 8 weeks)","permalink":"bouquet-subscription-half-season-8-weeks","position":2,"price":160.0,"default_price":160.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bouquet-subscription-half-season-8-weeks","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-20T05:48:13.000Z","description":" Bathtub Gardens’ Organic flower CSA is the perfect way  for individuals or businesses to enjoy the full diversity and unique selection we have to offer.
