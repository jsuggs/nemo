The triangles have keshi pearls. Keshi pearls, also called cornflake pearls sometimes, are unusual and hard to get. Keshi pearls are natural free shaped flat.

First I wanted to see if I could get dimension and a sense of volume in a non-soldered earring. Also I wanted an inexpensive earring that still had lots of style and was unique. And finally I love the long ear wires. Some question the length but I find its great for women with longer hair as it brings the earrings down and out of the hair so they show more. For us short haired women it gives us a chance to have that flippy movement at our ears as we “flip” our hair back. \r\n\r\nAs always I have patinaed them to give them a richness and to show the texture I put on the sterling.\r\n\r\nAll in all these earrings were very successful in reaching my goals and I really love them.
