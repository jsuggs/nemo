The music made by The Entrance Band can awaken either definition, and countless other dimensions as well.\r\n\r\nSince first collaborating together on the 2006 album <em>Prayer of Death</em>, guitarist/vocalist <strong>Guy Blakeslee</strong>, bassist <strong>Paz Lenchantin</strong> and drummer <strong>Derek James</strong> have breathed continued life into the sound of The Entrance Band. That energy has translated into a catalog of recorded expression and an unassailable reputation for offering one of the most intuitively-interconnected live performances on the planet.\r\n\r\nThese memorable melodies and their near-telekinetic musical kinship are found in full flower on <em><strong>Face the Sun</strong></em> – certainly the band’s most compelling collection of songs to date. Their first full-length in four years, it is an album built firmly upon notable transformations experienced by all three band members. Face the Sun is a rare and remarkable collection of songs that recognizes and honors both sides of the journey toward the light. \r\n\r\n<strong>Tracklisting:</strong>\r\n01.\tFine Flow\r\n02.\tMedicine\r\n03.\tSpider\r\n04.\tThe Crave\r\n05.\tNo Needs\r\n06.\tFire Eyes\r\n07.\tTemptation\r\n08.\tYear of the Dragon\r\n09.\tNight Cat\r\n\r\n<strong>There are several ways to pre-order.

Our Solar System live is an evolving collective. As long as they are ten planets, they play. Each musician represents a planet, including the asteroid belt and Pluto, and OSS dress in identical outfits adorned with planetary symbols to highlight the concept's power over the individual. This debut album was recorded live one hot summer afternoon in the amphitheater at Raven mountain in Vårberg, Sweden and one cold November night at a magical party in an old movie theater in Kärrtorp. For those who want to compare this work with other musical journeys, one can draw parallels to Alice Coltrane, Pärsson Sound, Sigur Rós, Can and early Pink Floyd. The planets involved so far also play in bands like Dungen, Life on Earth!, The Amazing, Promise And The Monster, Lisa o Piu, Me and My Kites, Siri Karlsson, AnnaMy, Vox Vulgaris and others.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F102951320\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":41509602,"name":"Default","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.55,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":16.75,"amount_with_others":4.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122887539/-/OSS_Front.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122887539/-/OSS_Front.jpg","width":1700,"height":1700},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122887731/-/photo-sleeveotherside.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122887731/-/photo-sleeveotherside.jpg","width":960,"height":960},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122887560/-/OSS_Press_photo.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122887560/-/OSS_Press_photo.jpg","width":3264,"height":2187}],"artists":[{"id":225975,"name":"Our Solar System","permalink":"our-solar-system","url":"/artist/our-solar-system"}],"categories":[{"id":4797592,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":12871194,"name":"The Velcro Lewis Group - Open The Sky LP","permalink":"the-velcro-lewis-group-open-the-sky","position":9,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-velcro-lewis-group-open-the-sky","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-09T15:00:16.000Z","description":"RELEASE DATE: 10/15/13\r\n\r\nAll vinyl records come with album download codes.\r\n\r\nFunk rock occultists, The Velcro Lewis Group bring the harmonies of Motown, the groove of Stax, the drugs of Hawkwind, and the drive of Bohannon to their own LSD-laced barbecue of sound. \r\n\r\nLed by blind frontman, Velcro Lewis--along with 5-octave range singing drummer Hawk Colman, soul-injected guitarist Travers Gauntt, groove-hammering bassist Halden Spoonwood, and sonic menace Lawrence Peters on electric washboard and bass vocals--The Velcro Lewis Group seamlessly create ass-kicking future-funk rock n' roll.
