It means the same as Prana, Ether or Chi – Universal Life Force. He built the first Orgone Accumulators in the 1930’s - big boxes for people to sit in and get showered by healthy energy. He also conducted very successful experiments with Orgone Cloudbusters, bringing rain to deserts. He was discredited by the FDA and put into prison for selling Orgones where he died some days before release....\r\n\r\nBased on his research, an American couple, Don and Carol Croft, invented the Orgone Generators in the 1990’s. The principle is simple, but effective: Organic material, in this case resin made from mineral oil, attracts positive and negative lifeforce. The embedded crystals balance the energies, and the inorganic material metal dispels the now harmonious life force.\r\n\r\nElectronic devices like Pc's, laptops, smartphones & cellphones emit low-frequency microwaves, which literally kills lifeforce, creating DOR (deadly Orgone) which is harmful lo living beings. Orgone devices transmute & revitalise DOR and thus create an healthy environment - thats's why Orgone devices are so good to have around.\r\n\r\nThese days Orgones are made and used by thousands of people all over the world, conscious of the energetic pollution in which we are living – and actively doing something against it. Be one of them.\r\n\r\nAll pendants are 100% handmade - and with that I really mean made by the two hands of one brother who created them from scratch. The shape of the handpandant is the result of many nights work to create a stunningly detailed similarity to a proper Handpan(Hang, Pantam, BEll, Halo, Orb ect). \r\n\r\nThe actual work process includes different materials: resin, gold leaf, metal shavings, various crystals, sandalwood shavings, a drop of Ganga water and a copper coil.\r\n\r\nJust a quick info on some of the materials used:\r\nThe resin is produced by a small family-owned business in Germany.\r\nThe metal shavings are supplied by a befriended metal worker.\r\nThe raw crystals used are cleansed, purified and crushed in a very conscious way to ensure their highest energetic purity and nuff Irie vibez.\r\nThe Ganga water was hand collected in Haridwar, India.\r\nThe sandalwood comes from a small rare piece of wood from south america.\r\nThe copper coil is hand rolled.\r\nThe rim gets fitted by hand, and the bails are handmade as well.\r\n\r\nTo further ensure a high grade of artistic perfection and energetic purity my bro Raphael meditates and practices spiritual rituals before beginning work. \r\n\r\nYou see, you really get something crafted with love :-)\r\n\r\nTo see some more of his work, please visit https://www.etsy.com/shop/OrgonizeYourLife\r\n","options":[{"id":50160120,"name":"Default","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129048234/-/IMG_8640.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129048234/-/IMG_8640.JPG","width":2167,"height":1655},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129048285/-/IMG_8635.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129048285/-/IMG_8635.JPG","width":2484,"height":1726},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129048312/-/F70D93AC-588C-11E3-BC86-EF4892826D5F.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129048312/-/F70D93AC-588C-11E3-BC86-EF4892826D5F.jpg","width":629,"height":428}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6856152,"name":"Jewelery","permalink":"jewelery","url":"/category/jewelery"}]},{"id":15431565,"name":"Lisn & Hand Pandant Discount set","permalink":"lisn-hand-pandant-discount-set","position":7,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lisn-hand-pandant-discount-set","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-09T08:02:19.000Z","description":"FREE WORLD WIDE POSTAGE\r\n\r\nA physical copy of the new album 'Lisn & a mini HandPandant \r\nsent anywhere world wide with free postage!\r\n","options":[{"id":50188212,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129070731/-/lisn_5.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129070731/-/lisn_5.JPG","width":2592,"height":1728}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6325218,"name":"Albums","permalink":"albums","url":"/category/albums"},{"id":6856152,"name":"Jewelery","permalink":"jewelery","url":"/category/jewelery"}]}]
