The bulb is a vintage reproduction 60 watt Edison bulb (included).  The wire is braided and fabric wrapped.  This lamp is available with a porcelain keyless socket or a antiqued brass socket that has a switch at the bulb.  Only order the porcelain keyless socket if your outlets are controlled by an external light switch.
