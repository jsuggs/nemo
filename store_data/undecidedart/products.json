Of particular interest are the chemical reactions, thoughts and moods that translate, perceive and decode the world outside of us.\r\n\r\nGiclee prints are printed at the highest resolution (1440 dpi at 8 passes), giving the final image unrivalled quality.","options":[{"id":46300965,"name":"'Love' Giclée archive print ( 254mm x 508mm )","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":45380313,"name":"'Love' Giclée archive print ( 406mm x 813mm )","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46300968,"name":"'Love' Giclée archive print ( 508mm x 1016mm )","price":58.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46300971,"name":"'Love' Giclée archive print ( 762mm x 1524mm )","price":123.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46300974,"name":"'Love' Giclée archive print ( 1016mm x 2032mm )","price":216.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125574309/-/GDNS_2013_(1_of_4)-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125574309/-/GDNS_2013_(1_of_4)-2.jpg","width":1014,"height":1500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6024642,"name":"Print","permalink":"print","url":"/category/print"}]},{"id":13185900,"name":"Undecided Summer Show 2013 Poster Giclee Print","permalink":"undecided-summer-show-poster-giclee-print","position":2,"price":75.0,"default_price":75.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/undecided-summer-show-poster-giclee-print","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-26T21:23:20.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":42111414,"name":"A1","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":42151008,"name":"A2","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":42151011,"name":"A3","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123344577/-/UAC_SUMMER_2013.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123344577/-/UAC_SUMMER_2013.jpg","width":1415,"height":2000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6024642,"name":"Print","permalink":"print","url":"/category/print"}]},{"id":13116426,"name":"Undecided #1","permalink":"undecided-1-artzine","position":3,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/undecided-1-artzine","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-22T20:01:30.000Z","description":"<h1><b>'Undecided'</b> is the debut publication from the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/19a6TC0\">Undecided Art Collective</a>, a close-knit group of artistic free thinkers mainly based in Ventnor on the Isle of Wight.</h1>\r\n</br>\r\n<p>Designed with high aesthetics in mind, <i>'Undecided'</i> builds a platform for which to showcase a myriad of emerging and working artists, photographers and makers locally and internationally. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>These Include:</p>\r\n<hr></hr>\r\nDixcey, Stuart Harris, Rachael Berry, Stevie Unknown, Julie Barnes, Cendrine Rovini, Julian Winslow, Holly Maslen, Lucie Francis, Leela and the Kat, John Armstrong, Steven Bone, Stephen Butterfield & Chemical Gdns.\r\n<hr></hr>\r\n</br>\r\n<p>* Every copy includes a postcard and badge (whilst stocks last) and we will ship internationally using only robust and environmentally-friendly packaging.\r\n\r\n* Postage & Packaging costs are nominal, £2 to UK and £5 everywhere else.\r\n \r\n*One print run only, limited to just 100 copies.</p>\r\n</br><i>\r\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/19a5uvn\">Please click here for preview photographs..</a></i>","options":[{"id":42540105,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123587385/-/uac-mag1-5_copy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123587385/-/uac-mag1-5_copy.jpg","width":700,"height":542}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6114231,"name":"Publication","permalink":"publication","url":"/category/publication"}]}]
