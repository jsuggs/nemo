I’m speaking not of a noisy street demonstration, a large gathering, or any of the typical ways in which our people have commemorated April 30, 1975, the day South Vietnam fell to the communists. In past years we have recalled that day with regret and sorrow, but this year, as the flier says, we can feel a sense of pride. True pride, one we all can share, for the deep feelings that all the Vietnamese refugees have held fast inside have been expressed fully through the medium of a serious art form, that of classical Western music, that is, the Vietnam 1975 Symphony by composer Le Van Khoa.&#8221;\r\n\r\n\t-Pham Phu Minh ( penname Pham Xuan Dai, editor of the monthly 21st Century)\r\n\r\n\tThis CD features the music of Vietnamese American composer, Le Van Khoa.
