Sometimes you end up in an entirely different direction from where you began. But it's in the journey where we find our greatest rewards. Ribbons fade but the journey lives within us.\r\n\r\nThis sterling silver spiral pendant is big and thick--1 1/8\" in diameter and 16 gauge silver (1.3 mm thick)--and has a soldered bail. And yet its weight is comforting. That's why I like to wear mine on a 22\" ball chain where it lies close to the heart. It's a good length to wear over a t-shirt and even long enough for a turtleneck or polo.\r\n\r\nAll components are sterling silver. Available with or without a Swarovski crystal attached.

Only the Moon and the planets Venus, Jupiter and Mars are brighter.\r\n\r\nCanis Major is easy to find November through March. Just locate Orion the Hunter, which dominates the winter sky, and imagine a straight line through his belt.
