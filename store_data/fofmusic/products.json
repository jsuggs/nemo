One of the unsung modern forefathers of gradient chug, the Rotterdam native has carved out a niche for engulfing body movers that organically unfold like subtle origami. \r\n\r\nWondering What We Are explores the ever expanding spectrum of the Ben La Desh aesthetic in a compact 4-track capsule. ‘Afrodesia’ soundtracks a high speed chase through tropical back roads with swirling synths and pulsing drops. ‘Your Love’ has a slinky half-tempo bounce that skates along an infectious horn loop and vocal refrain. ‘We Are’ finds La Desh in his signature groove wheelhouse - buttery builds and smoothed-out repetition. “Why Don’t You” may very well be his deepest moment yet, a driving baseline is lathered with clattering percussion and sultry female croons to devilishly sinister effect.

A bubbling Dublab alumn, Lil Suzie unleashed the lauded Green Flash EP on Running Back a year ago now, stamping a crisp signature on wax platters with addictive vocal snips and slow release pill-wave. The 12” popped up on numerous top lists and garnered spins from the likes of: Permanent Vacation, Runaway, Justin Miller, Sleazy Beats, Juno Records and Tim Sweeney of the renowned Beats In Space radio show. Like a praying mantis or Venus Flytrap, Kraft’s tracks lull listeners into a subtle comfort before snapping fast in attack – followed by a postcoital cigarette, of course. These are jams that you feel all around you; seeping deep into mental crevices, stretching out and making themselves at home.\r\n \r\nNow fresh off the heels of a Red Bull Music Academy admittance, a shimmering remix of Tomas Barfod’s “Came To Party” for FoF and the feel-good stunner “Jus U” from YA’s inaugural EP, Horoscope finds Suzanne easing off the samples and diving headfirst into synth, bass, harmony and percussion driven compositions. The title track jogs along with a solar powered pace guided by grooving guitar lines, eventually combusting supernova-like with homespun falsetto croons. “No Worries” ups the ante with infectious stabs and a driving baseline that graciously set the stage for one of SK’s restrained yet rewarding pay-offs. The b-side hits full stride with two explorations of repetition and space that both eclipse the 120 mark. “Ritmo” is an intergalactic workout tool complete with swirling delays and arpeggiated melodies, while “Feel” cranks up the punch and mood yet still remains ethereal with its cloud-covered flute line.\r\n \r\nRounding out Horoscope are the p-funk sunset comedown of “Crest”, the Professional Gold mix of “No Worries” by L.A.’s own Secret Circuit, and Future Times frontman Max D’s Raw Flute Swing of “Feel”.","options":[{"id":22433293,"name":"Default","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":16.5,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81237789/-/IMG_4386.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81237789/-/IMG_4386.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69547283/-/ya002_horoscope_jacket_digital_final_high.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69547283/-/ya002_horoscope_jacket_digital_final_high.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81237924/-/IMG_4390.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81237924/-/IMG_4390.JPG","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[{"id":137265,"name":"Suzanne Kraft","permalink":"suzanne-kraft","url":"/artist/suzanne-kraft"}],"categories":[{"id":1861605,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":6854353,"name":"Groundislava - Feel Me LP / CD","permalink":"groundislava-feel-me","position":12,"price":13.0,"default_price":13.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/groundislava-feel-me","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-01T23:02:35.000Z","description":"Emerging from the endless summers of Venice, CA to teaming up with Shlohmo, Jonwayne, D33J, RL Grime and more to form the Wedidit crew, Jasper Patterson aka Groundislava has transformed from bashful video gamer to full-fledged composer. The son of Michael Patterson (who directed A-Ha's standout music video \"Take On Me\" and Paula Abdul's \"Opposites Attract\"), Groundislava has roots that draw from 80s nostalgia, TV and pop culture that grow and transform into the 21st Century aesthetic of electronic music.\r\n\r\nRecently tapped for official remixes of Slugabed and Shlohmo as well as Kutmah's Brownswood compilation, Groundislava returns with the 'Feel Me' LP, the follow-up full-length to his self-titled 2011 debut. A mature step for the artist, 'Feel Me' showcases Groundislava's unique sensibilities for developing sweeping soundscapes, luscious backdrops and somber tracks in a distinct sound all his own.\r\n\r\nThe subdued groove and melancholic melodies of tracks like \"Suicide Mission\" featuring ghostly vocals from Baths and \"Bottle Service\" featuring Shlohmo balance the big room dynamics and technicolor soundscape of tracks like \"Olympia 2011\" and the bass heavy boom of \"Cool Party\". On others, like \"TV Dream\" featuring the enigmatic Clive Tanaka, Groundislava composes an ebullient ode to a friendship's inception, soaking it in summery vibes and phantom playfulness.\r\n\r\n'Feel Me' is available now on Friends of Friends. Cool to him.","options":[{"id":21743981,"name":"CD","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21743983,"name":"Vinyl","price":13.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81237825/-/IMG_4388.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81237825/-/IMG_4388.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67281741/-/GROUNDISLAVA_Feel_me_high.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67281741/-/GROUNDISLAVA_Feel_me_high.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81238029/-/IMG_4389.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81238029/-/IMG_4389.JPG","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[{"id":86217,"name":"Groundislava","permalink":"groundislava","url":"/artist/groundislava"}],"categories":[{"id":1861527,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":1861605,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":6373251,"name":"LOL Boys - Changes EP 12\"","permalink":"lol-boys-changes-ep","position":13,"price":13.0,"default_price":13.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lol-boys-changes-ep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-05T21:41:53.000Z","description":"1.

The first installment in their commitment to pressed wax platters culls a collection of spectrum exploring Body Music from cohorts both near and far. \r\n \r\nStarting off the festivities is the golden child, Suzanne Kraft, whose feel-good stunner ‘Jus U’ exemplifies why Running Back was oh so eager to add his talents to their ever-impressive roster. The sunsoaked strut that shimmers on this sampler track is just a teaser of things to come on Lil Suzie’s forthcoming 12” EP for YA later in the summer.\r\n \r\nNext up is The Dead Rose Music Company with a shimmering study in repetition that only adds to their laureled cloud of mystique.  A driving pulse and infectious vocal snippet assure that “Soothe My Mind” soars in both headphone and floor-tested settings.\r\n \r\nOn the flip, Urulu brings down the lights and cranks up the diva on a soul-studded banger that burrows its way into the deepest psyche caverns. “Missing You” balances grit with a glossed-out sheen personified by loopy lipstick signatures on rusted bathroom mirrors.\r\n \r\nRounding out the affair is a dank and dirty collab between up-and-comers Grown Folk and LOL Boys. “Ghost Path” exists deep in the acidic bowels of the night and guides its followers through uncharted terrains without a flashlight.

CHLLNGR**Digital Only  \r\n\r\nTomas Barfod is fascinated with the idyllic wasteland, unveiling 'Salton Sea', an LP on the Friends of Friends imprint that draws from the concept of urban decay. The producer and drummer of the popular Danish group WhoMadeWho, with a history of solo and collaborative releases for Get Physical, Turbo, Gomma, and Kompakt, Barfod's latest full-length balances contrasts. At times bright with delicate pop melodies, 'Salton Sea' boldly submerges into dark, morose rhythms, juxtaposing the graceful and desolate characteristics of the Californian lakebed the album shares its name with.\r\n\r\nOpener \"D.S.O.Y.\" wastes no time jumping out the gates with fervent energy and upbeat animation. After the LP's first single, \"Broken Glass\", \"Came To Party\" marks the height of the night, reaching a tipping point with big room dynamics. As the album continues its flow, the somber pop of \"Till We Die\" dwells in the late-night afterglow, while \"November Skies\" picks up the pieces to soar in an airy melody with vocals from Sweden's Nina Kinert. The frenetic, sinister Moroder disquietude of \"Nighthawke\", which features vocals from New York film Composer Lydia Ainsworth, and guttural pulse of \"Python\" provide tense codas to 'Salton Sea'.\r\n\r\nEither spatial and seductive or frightening and macabre, 'Salton Sea' engages multiple moods, jarring the listener and bringing them deeper into its shadowy pop. With remixes from Mark E, M.A.N.D.Y., Shlohmo, Salva, Kasper Bjørke, Suzanne Kraft and more, 'Salton Sea' looks to be one of the premiere electronic releases of 2012.\r\n\r\n<object height=\"220\" width=\"220\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F40264009&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=artwork&amp;color=ff7700\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"220\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F40264009&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=artwork&amp;color=ff7700\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"220\"></embed> </object> ","options":[{"id":19129357,"name":"Vinyl and CD","price":24.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":19129359,"name":"Vinyl - $20.00","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19129361,"name":"CD","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":12.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63374293/-/Tomas_Barfod_LP.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63374293/-/Tomas_Barfod_LP.jpg","width":965,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58700981/-/saltonsea_2400_rgb_low.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58700981/-/saltonsea_2400_rgb_low.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81238713/-/IMG_4382.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81238713/-/IMG_4382.JPG","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[{"id":105869,"name":"Tomas Barfod","permalink":"tomas-barfod","url":"/artist/tomas-barfod"}],"categories":[{"id":1861527,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":1861605,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":5457465,"name":"Tomas Barfod - Broken Glass 12\"","permalink":"pre-order-tomas-barfod-broken-glass-12","position":17,"price":13.0,"default_price":13.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pre-order-tomas-barfod-broken-glass-12","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-13T01:45:36.000Z","description":"Denmark's Tomas Barfod, the drummer for Whomadewho who's released material on Get Physical, Kompakt, Gomma, Turbo and more, reveals his first release on the Friends of Friends label.

A middle school technology teacher, record label owner, husband, and father of two, Gonzales doesn't buckle under the weight of multiple personae. Rather, EG draws inspiration from his multifaceted background, producing a diverse swath of sounds covering various states of introspection, of which low-end bass only tells a fraction of his story.\r\n\r\nGonzales' 2010 album and art book, 'Been Meaning To Tell You', channeled the tensions of being away from from his wife, Devyn, during winter's numbest and loneliest months, emerging as an opus for trust, love and dedication. Having remixed A Sunny Day In Glasgow, Regina, 'Natural Traits' is the latest EG creation, an LP that blends Gonzales' gift for melodic songwriting with his understanding of electronic craftsmanship.\r\n\r\nCarefully composed of vivid rhythms, emotive melodies and aerial harmonies, 'Natural Traits' blurs the lines between analogue and digital worlds. Free of samples, Gonzales juxtaposes live instrumentation with classic electronic tropes to produce tracks that float, flit, bump, and pulse with grace and subdued movement.\r\n\r\nTracks like \"Peaks & Valleys\", \"Beneath the Surface\", and \"In The End\" highlight EG's ambient side with swirls of trilling guitar chords, painting an analogue soundscape of 'natural' emotion and sincere serenity.\r\n\r\nOthers, like \"The Heroic Lives of Particles\" and \"The Scattered Thoughts of Raindrops\", bumble with digital angst and glitchy disquietude, venturing deep into the technological world and casting a shadow of electronic mystique. \r\n\r\n\"When Synchronicity Prevails\" represents perhaps the perfect balance of polarities, with luscious synth waves and delicate guitar lines materializing halfway through with a four-on-the-floor rhythm of tactile texture that round out its ethereal feel.\r\n\r\nLet go and lock into EG's colorful collection of romantic rhythms and grooves on 'Natural Traits'.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

With an effortless grasp on sound design, Laufer combines deceptively simple and emotive melodies, subtle bass drops and swinging slow motion drums. His early work has placed him at the forefront of a new wave of rising talent amongst West Coast producers...\r\n\r\nInspired by the desire to write songs and create a release of full-range instrumentation and vocals all his own, Laufer promptly began home-recording Bad Vibes, his proper full-length debut album for the Friends of Friends label. Some might say the songs on Bad Vibes represent the spawn of a new \"rhythm and blues\" - one that swings and sways under the backbone of Henry's own take on modern electronic music. Augmented with delicate slide guitar playing, homemade synth sounds and lilting, tuneful melodies, Shlohmo's latest output is one that will take you places - specifically the un-paralleled vibes swirling through this young man's head.","options":[{"id":15316469,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":7.0},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.25,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53867225/-/badvibes_cd.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53867225/-/badvibes_cd.jpg","width":1000,"height":769},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53867289/-/badvibes_cd_open.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53867289/-/badvibes_cd_open.jpg","width":1000,"height":659},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/45821023/-/ShlohmoBVCover_high.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/45821023/-/ShlohmoBVCover_high.jpg","width":725,"height":719}],"artists":[{"id":54164,"name":"Shlohmo","permalink":"shlohmo","url":"/artist/shlohmo"}],"categories":[{"id":1861527,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":4284409,"name":"Gun Selectah 7\"","permalink":"gun-selectah-7","position":22,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/gun-selectah-7","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-08-19T04:48:18.000Z","description":"Our very own Ernest Gonzales / Mexicans With Guns teams with Monterrey, Mexico's own Toy Selectah for this one off 7\" for Friends of Friends!!!

While deeply infatuated with the styles of house music and minimal techno (check “The Dig” or “Stealth River Mission”), on his debut self-titled LP, Groundislava takes old templates of 8 bit and chip-tune styles and turns them into worlds full of oozing, swirling melodies backed by driving drum beats, heavy bass drops and soaring vocal melodies in spots from vocalist Weary.\r\n\r\nAfter a well-received free EP giveaway in early ’11, Groundislava’s self-titled debut LP + 7″ is scheduled for release on 4/19 through the Friends of Friends Music label.

Beyond those who already know this, the rest of the electronic music world is catching wind of the 29 year old producer, DJ, promoter and label boss. Already heralded by the Numbers, Ernest Endeavors and LuckyMe crews in the UK, the Low End Theory residents in LA and his own Frite Nite label/crew in SF, Salva is primed as he preps the release of his debut album, Complex Housing for the Friends of Friends (FoF Music) label.\r\n\r\nGrowing up in Chicago in the 80's, Salva cites early inspiration in all sorts of of electronic and sampled-based music ranging from electro, juke, analog house, ghetto house, underground hip hop and bass productions. With a strong foot in all of these idioms, Salva creates a future-leaning style of electronic dance music that is all his own. Shimmering synthesizers collide with funky vintage drum programming, heavy bass drops and rapid arpeggios to create an album that remain both listenable and danceable.\r\n\r\nWith big boomers like \"Wake Ups\" and \"Blue\" bringing out the inner future-funk beat junky, the record switches gears and influences with the glistening sleeze/pop of Zackey Force Funk's guest appearance on \"40 Karats\" and a more housey/UK Funky approach on \"Keys Open Doors.\" Salva also pays homage to his Chicago-house roots covering Robert Owens' classic \"I'll Be Your Friend\" and bringing it into the 21st century, making this album a true dance music melting pot.\r\n\r\nSalva also invited some friends to the mix as remixes from B Bravo, MachineDrum, My Dry Wet Mess and Lando Kal all represent on the record. What makes this album unique is not only Salva's experimental yet melodic approach, but the diversity and taste he shows while doing it...","options":[{"id":17549395,"name":"Default","price":11.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.5,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53729789/-/ch.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53729789/-/ch.JPG","width":922,"height":864},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31263701/-/salva.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31263701/-/salva.jpg","width":452,"height":452},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53391409/-/ch_inner.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53391409/-/ch_inner.JPG","width":1000,"height":900}],"artists":[{"id":51831,"name":"Salva","permalink":"salva","url":"/artist/salva"}],"categories":[{"id":1861605,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":3222129,"name":"Shlohmo - Shlohmoshun Redux CD","permalink":"shlohmo-shlohmoshun-redux-cd","position":25,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/shlohmo-shlohmoshun-redux-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-02-02T03:17:29.000Z","description":"New and expanded CD version of Shlohmo’s top-selling ‘Shlomoshun Deluxe’ LP, adding a further seven tracks which were first released on June’s download-only ‘Camping’ EP. While working an internship at dublab.com, 19 year old LA native Shlohmo made a free online release of his original ‘Shlomoshun EP’.\r\n\r\nBeing part of the dublab community, it didn’t take long for the EP reach the ears of Friends Of Friends, who immediately approached him to combine new and old tracks with an assortment of remixes to create ‘Shlomoshun Deluxe’.\r\n\r\nFirst released digitally at the start of 2010, the eight original tracks and four remixes have generated huge interest among the low-end beat-heads and abstract boom-bap-strumentalists searching for their latest fix of post-modern deconstructivist thunk, with the young producer finding his sounds aligned with luminaries like FlyLo, Nosaj Thing, Ras G and Samiyam, and lauded for a diversity of sound from the overloaded synths usually sported by Starkey and Joker, to the 8bit melodies of Disrupt or Ikonika.\r\n\r\nWith an arsenal of unique sound textures and big bass beats, Shlohmo brings a keen ear to the music he makes, using mostly found sound, fragile old gear and a laptop, all created under super lo-fi conditions (“I’ve had my monitors since I was 14 - the tweeters are all pushed in and there's absolutely no audible low end, so I have to physically touch the woofer to feel the vibrations from the bass and master it that way.\") With beat and soundscape arrangements that leave the listener hypnotized, the songs breath life from the organic and electronic worlds colliding.\r\n\r\nFan favourites ‘Hot Boxing The Cockpit’ and ‘Antigravity’ place him right amongst the Brainfeeder-centred neu-bass elite, while a track like ‘7am’ oozes Dilla-esque swagger; all the while remaining effortlessly cinematic. Shlohmo stamps his cosmically heat-hazed originality right across this disc, with an instantly addictive syrupy psychedelic soul and distinctively delicate personality that’s impossible to ignore, while the high-grade selection of re-fixes punctuating the set makes this enlarged CD release even more essential, featuring Tokimonsta (Brainfeeder), Low limit (Lazer Sword), Fulgeance (One Handed Music), DevonWho (All City Dublin), Baths (Anticon), Shigeto (Ghostly International), and Asura (Non Projects).","options":[{"id":17694313,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":7.0},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53867921/-/shlohmoshun.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53867921/-/shlohmoshun.jpg","width":1000,"height":760},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53868185/-/shlohmsun_open.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53868185/-/shlohmsun_open.jpg","width":1000,"height":843},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31268905/-/shlohmoshun.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31268905/-/shlohmoshun.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":54164,"name":"Shlohmo","permalink":"shlohmo","url":"/artist/shlohmo"}],"categories":[{"id":1861527,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
