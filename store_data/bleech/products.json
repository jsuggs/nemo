The single precedes the release of the band’s debut album ‘Nude’, packed\r\nwith striking stand-alone tracks, which will not disappoint.\r\nBLEECH have produced an eclectic record that demonstrates their early distinctive punk origins and high energy\r\nteenage angst to their now heavier, more mature, ambitious rock arrangements. With its machine-gun rattle of wild\r\nlanguage and tales of sweet revenge, this long player certainly packs a punch. These tracks are as raw and close to\r\nthe bone as they come. From the vitriolic 'I Wanna Be Me', to ‘Worthing Song’s venomous overtones these tracks\r\ncarry bold statements, seething with a dark, disruptive magic. BLEECH’s softer side is also on show here with the\r\nwistful ‘Flowerhands’ and yearning ‘When I Get Old’, which adds contrast to the mix.\r\nLive, BLEECH are something else entirely. Evoking Clash’s anger, Nirvana’s intensity and Zep’s swagger, BLEECH\r\nsound like they were meant to happen. Vital, addictive, contemporary and thoroughly modern.\r\nBLEECH are: Jennifer O’Neill – Guitar/Lead Vocals / Katherine O’Neill – Bass/Vocals / Matt Bick – Drums/Vocals\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":14589113,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43581467/-/342610L.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43581467/-/342610L.jpg","width":250,"height":250}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2448919,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":7040665,"name":"The Hippie & Me EP","permalink":"the-hippie-me-ep","position":7,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-hippie-me-ep","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-23T14:49:41.000Z","description":"6 Track EP OUT 27th August!\r\n\r\nNew track ‘The Hippie & Me’ is the ultimate summer anthem, filled with haunting guitar riffs, pumping bass lines and catching lyrics that tell a tale of summer nostalgia.
