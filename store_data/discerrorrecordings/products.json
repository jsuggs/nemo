Driving dancefloor repetition that takes off into climactic peaks and elated highs. 'Forever' soothes the head, dreamy electronic experiments from a hopefull phuture. Pneumatic beats build, their pressure released 4 minutes in. New sounds for the neophiles.\r\n\r\nGoitia Deitz hail from Brooklyn, New York and are two DJs and producers that have been collaborating for the past year. Their recorded experiments in minimal electronics hint towards an extensive record collection and a mutual love of Krautrock, Kosmische and Italo. All tracks are produced on analog equipment, recorded live in one take with additional mixing by James Aparicio (These New Puritans, Liars, Spiritualized, Mute Records). Nothing is pre-planned or written.\r\n\r\nEach limited 7\" vinyl has two tracks (bonus track 'Pictures In Motion' only available digitally) and will be shipped in silver foil bags with printed card inserts designed by Goitia Deitz and Ciaran O'Shea. We are very excited that this is DiscError's 10th vinyl release and the both vinyl and digital releases are available to pre-order now from the links above.

Following a brilliant performance on the Experimental Circle Club stage at this year’s Offset Festival, single ‘Over and Above’ is a summer echo, the sound of serotonin rising; of legions of soaked T-shirted kids marching on the spot in a dancefloor half-dream: of the belief that everything might just be ok, at least until the end of the song.\r\n\r\n<b>LINKS</b>\r\n<i>www.myspace.com/deathindonutplains</i>\r\n\r\nPostage & Packaging £2 (UK) £3 (Other)\r\n£1 (Other) for Each Additional Order","options":[{"id":2182481,"name":"7\" vinyl picture sleeve","price":4.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3443423/-/deathinplainsweb.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3443423/-/deathinplainsweb.jpg","width":576,"height":576},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29686719/-/DIP_over.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29686719/-/DIP_over.jpg","width":624,"height":624}],"artists":[{"id":9489,"name":"DEATH IN PLAINs","permalink":"death-in-plains","url":"/artist/death-in-plains"}],"categories":[{"id":128151,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"},{"id":2463005,"name":"DEATH IN PLAINs","permalink":"death-in-plains","url":"/category/death-in-plains"}]},{"id":314397,"name":"ULTERIOR 'Sister Speed' (SOLD OUT) ","permalink":"ulterior-sister-speed-aporia-10-vinyl","position":7,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ulterior-sister-speed-aporia-10-vinyl","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-06-04T14:17:34.000Z","description":"<iframe name=\"fairplayer\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"18\" height=\"18\" src=\"http://official.fm/tracks/112908?fairplayer=mini&skin=124\"></iframe>A.
