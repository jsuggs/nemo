What a wonderfully thick moustache you have! Be careful when you dunk a biscuit it doesn't get smooshed in the depths of your bristles. \r\n2) Next along is aptly named \"The Gentleman\". Can you resist pretending to twiddle your moustaches? Great to have at the office or home when enjoying a cuppa and taking a moment to ponder the meaning of life.\r\n3) Last but by no means least is \"The General\". This is the Daddy of all moustaches. If only we could make it sway from side to side, as you wrinkle your nose, while you work out the next plan of attack. \r\n\r\nWhen ordering, please be sure to tell us if you are a left or right handed handle holder! We wouldn't want your neighbours missing out on a laugh because your moustache doesn't face outwards (If not otherwise stated you shall receive a right handed mug). Also available, orange or yellow paint for all you ginger and blonde people! \r\n\r\nSPECIAL FOR FATHER\"S DAY, get a short personal message hand painted on the reverse side of your mug, (eg. \"Happy Father's Day\" or \"love from your favourite child\") FOR ABSOLUTELY FREE!\r\nJust leave a note under your address on paypal or message us on facebook or to mail@peanutbutton.co.uk.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll mugs are hand-painted in a dishwasher safe 3D paint which gives your moustache a delightfully tactile feel.\r\n\r\nPlease bare in mind that these are hand-painted for you when you order so each will vary slightly from that pictured and take a few days to paint and dry.
