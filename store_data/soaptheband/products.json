Offering eleven dynamic songs, it is a truly inspired blend by one of today's most gifted bands. “Lather” is a unique album that values the unknown areas of improvisation as much as the construction of towering compositions. \r\n\r\nOn “Lather”, listeners are treated to lush, polyrhythmic tones that crackle with the brainy togetherness of jazz and the freewheeling attitude of rock. With hints of funk and fusion, Soap’s sound takes on a life of its own. Guitar solos are alternately ferocious and restrained, keyboards break the surface of the music and plunge back into its depths, and the drums and bass are as constant as the rise and fall of the sun. \r\n\r\nThe CD was recorded at Apocalypse Cow, in Montgomery, IL, and mixed and mastered by Bill McElroy at Slipped Disc in Ashland, VA","options":[{"id":917820,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1451271/-/soap_lather.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1451271/-/soap_lather.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":186912,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":208976,"name":"The Quick Of It","permalink":"the-quick-of-it","position":3,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-quick-of-it","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-12-29T10:06:05.000Z","description":"1. C'n'N\r\n2. We're Going Under\r\n3. Traffic\r\n\r\nFrom the backroads of Illinois, Soap has their heads bound together by the knotty hairs of rock, jazz, hip hop, and funk. An eclectic mix, they've purified the ears of 10,000 Lakes Festival, filtered the minds of the east coast, and cleansed souls by the hundreds in the midwest, and are psyched to play near you.\r\n\r\nSoap is an experimental rock fusion jam band. Soap is a cleansing agent made from the salts of vegetable or animal fats; Money offered as a bribe; Street names for gamma hydroxybutyrate; Soap is like a good feeling; and like a good feeling you can't help sharing it, pass it along.
