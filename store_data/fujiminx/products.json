And like both the album and their live shows, Fuji Minx successfully takes us on a gradual, exhausting journey through hell and back punctuated by sophisticated ideas that gives each of us insight to our own personal demons.\"\r\n-PICKSYSTICKS.com\r\n\r\n\"'But No No No' is a really great song that deserves to riding the airwaves! A cool band that has lots of potential for sure!\"\r\n-Kaj Roth, Melodic.net\r\n\r\n\"The credits are rolling on the movie soundtrack of my life. I like it! I picture this being played at my funeral.\"\r\n-Frank Kramer, Host of the \"Frosty, Heidi, & Frank\" Radio Show \r\n\r\n\"I LOVED it! I thought it was sexy, sultry.
