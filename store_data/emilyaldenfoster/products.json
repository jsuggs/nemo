I would, but I already have two cats with funny names. So instead of getting a kitten and naming him Mr. Mongoosnuffles, I wrote a song about wanting a kitten called \"The Mongoosnuffle Shuffle Rag.\" Then I choreographed a dance. Then I made the whole thing into a zine for you to enjoy. (And soon, a music video!)\r\n\r\nThe Mongoosnuffle Song & Dance Book includes the story of Mister Mongoosnuffles, lyrics for \"The Mongoosnuffle Shuffle Rag\" illustrated with paper cutouts, fake-book style sheet music for the song, and illustrated instructions on how to dance the Mongoosnuffle Shuffle.\r\n\r\nThis is a kid-friendly project, but the intended audience is silly people of all ages. \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://emilyaldenfoster.com/post/14153562082/the-mongoosnuffle-song-and-dance-book-is-now\"> here</a> for more images.
