Stretch pulled from an extensive catalog of personal and acquired resources of over 30 years to develop his signature fin. Gathering knowledge from NASA, sailing, windsurfing, biomimicry and collaborating with the likes of Curtis Hesselgrave and the world’s most influential surfers in waves that are rated “fun” to “scary” are things that most other shapers don’t attain when designing a signature fin. Access to aeronautical research into quantified airfoil data and an extensive background in composite manufacturing, fluid dynamics and just plain wanting to get rad in the ocean are attributes that only make one appreciate that Stretch’s custom fin design is something special.\r\n\r\nSurfboard and fin design is decidedly a “Black Art”. Successful surfboard and fin designs take innate talent, hard work and an eclectic blend of science, empirical development, black magic and direct team participation. Over Stretch’s decades as leading rider and shaper he has developed his signature method of design and development which is key to all of his creations. Stretch has a solid understanding of aeronautic and hydrodynamic design demonstrated by his use of modified NACA foils on his fins. NACA is THE fundamental and conventional source of data which is used to fundamentally inform Stretch’s fin designs. The Black magic Stretch has applied to modify fin foils , flex and outline shapes to meet the demands of high performance surfing, pushes the intellectual envelope while delivering the high performance “goods”.\r\n\r\nUnique to Stretch’s signature fin is a full tip in a relatively high aspect ratio design. The unique inside foil is meant to increase flow efficiency and drive by aiding in reducing drag. Both the front set and the rear quad pair feature a leading edge design modeled heavily off the NACA 64A series foil which translates into more efficient angle of attack and pressure system dynamics for better fluidity and release.\r\n\r\nAll of Stretch’s fin templates feature  the trailing edge with the iconic beak tip which allows water flow along the full span of the leading edge to release cleanly reducing the chance of turbulent flow and a tracky or skitterish feeling when pushed hard yet still retaining the sensation of a free and pivotal feel.\r\n\r\nStretch designed the cambered (inside foil) characteristics to taper to zero with respect to chord length along the fin span in order to allow the tip to retain a neutral foil allowing the water and energy to “load up and twist off” of the lively tip area allowing predictable projection and positive drive.\r\n \r\nStretch fins feature design elements like full tips, beaked leading and trailing edge intersections and singular inside foil cambers. \r\nThese elements have been developed and refined over decades through endless iteration testing by the world’s best surfers in every set of conditions imaginable. \r\nThe result is a set of fins which flawlessly integrate all the essential elements. Stretch fin’s flexural pattern and amplitude, weight, area, pressure distribution, range of angle of attack, materials and esthetics represent a supremely evolved, essential element of high performance surfing. \r\nFrom hairball, death defying tow-ins, to world class contests, to the local beach break,  you can be assured Stretch’s fins have “been there done that” AND proven their mettle.\r\n \r\nIf you are accelerating for an aerial or trying to land one, tube stalling, going vertical, or just plain old trying to out run a section, your fins must do it all and do it well. Your fins are where the rubber hits the road and Stretch’s design work on fins is a pivotal departure from convention. Stretch’s understanding and long experience has resulted in a set of fins for every application in surfing.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCalifornia State Sales Tax Not Included","options":[{"id":50251392,"name":"Default","price":119.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129121461/-/IMG_9808.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129121461/-/IMG_9808.jpg","width":3090,"height":2917},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129121464/-/IMG_9809.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129121464/-/IMG_9809.jpg","width":3630,"height":3063},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129121470/-/IMG_9811.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129121470/-/IMG_9811.jpg","width":5184,"height":3456},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129121473/-/IMG_9812.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129121473/-/IMG_9812.jpg","width":2475,"height":3390}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6010218,"name":"Fins","permalink":"fins","url":"/category/fins"}]},{"id":15307632,"name":"Buzz Template Fins - S3 - 5.125","permalink":"buzz-template-fins-s3-5-125","position":2,"price":119.0,"default_price":119.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/buzz-template-fins-s3-5-125","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-03T21:10:07.000Z","description":"Buzz Template Fins\r\n\r\na.k.a.- “buzz template”, “#3”, “stretch controllers”, “the big one”\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nAvailable in 2 sizes: \r\n4.875” \r\nand \r\n5.125” with the same rear quad pair available for each. \r\n\r\n5 different colors to choose from:\r\nSolid Red, Blue, Smoke Grey, White, Clear\r\n\r\n\r\nComes as quad set only. \r\n\r\nFeatures stretch’s custom foil and signature beak with substantial tip surface area.\r\n\r\nStretch’s Buzz template works on any of the Buzz models shaped for small to everyday wave conditions in boards that have relatively wide tail templates (15.25”+ tail width and 8” +/- tail block), deep concaves and for those who like to power heavily off their rear foot on higher aspect ratio boards.

The precision of the injection moulding process ensures the highest accuracy in geometry in each fin produced.\r\n\r\nFCSII Features:\r\n\r\nKeyless: Efficient keyless system for quick fin installation and release.\r\n\r\nFlush Leading Edge: Recessed leading edge with flush base connection improves water flow.\r\n\r\nBackward Compatible Grub screws can be inserted to accept your existing FCS fins.\r\n\r\nMechanism: Rotating Barrel Self lubricating, wear resistant barrel locks the fin into the plug.\r\n\r\nMechanism: Titanium Rod: Aerospace grade titanium rod applies lateral pressure to the fin tab.\r\n\r\nHoneycomb Construction: Lightweight composite frame encapsulated by high density foam reduces weight and maintains tail flex.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":44407308,"name":"Large","price":70.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49785465,"name":"Medium","price":70.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124976484/-/IMG_8832.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124976484/-/IMG_8832.jpg","width":3240,"height":4718},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124976487/-/IMG_8833.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124976487/-/IMG_8833.jpg","width":3894,"height":3236},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124976490/-/IMG_8834.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124976490/-/IMG_8834.jpg","width":4078,"height":3349}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6010218,"name":"Fins","permalink":"fins","url":"/category/fins"}]},{"id":13829652,"name":"FCS SF4 Stretch Tri Fin Set","permalink":"fcs-sf4-thruster-fin-set","position":65,"price":60.0,"default_price":60.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fcs-sf4-thruster-fin-set","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-27T19:06:44.000Z","description":"For quick acceleration and response in punchy, hollow waves.","options":[{"id":44406360,"name":"Default","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124975590/-/IMG_8829.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124975590/-/IMG_8829.jpg","width":3189,"height":4693},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124975593/-/IMG_8830.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124975593/-/IMG_8830.jpg","width":3403,"height":3222},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124975596/-/IMG_8831.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124975596/-/IMG_8831.jpg","width":3729,"height":3128}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6010218,"name":"Fins","permalink":"fins","url":"/category/fins"}]},{"id":13829625,"name":"FCS 2 Carver GF Tri Set -

Stretch pulled from an extensive catalog of personal and acquired resources of over 30 years to develop his signature fin. Gathering knowledge from NASA, sailing, windsurfing, biomimicry and collaborating with the likes of Curtis Hesselgrave and the world’s most influential surfers in waves that are rated “fun” to “scary” are things that most other shapers don’t attain when designing a signature fin. Access to aeronautical research into quantified airfoil data and an extensive background in composite manufacturing, fluid dynamics and just plain wanting to get rad in the ocean are attributes that only make one appreciate that Stretch’s custom fin design is something special.\r\n\r\nSurfboard and fin design is decidedly a “Black Art”. Successful surfboard and fin designs take innate talent, hard work and an eclectic blend of science, empirical development, black magic and direct team participation. Over Stretch’s decades as leading rider and shaper he has developed his signature method of design and development which is key to all of his creations. Stretch has a solid understanding of aeronautic and hydrodynamic design demonstrated by his use of modified NACA foils on his fins. NACA is THE fundamental and conventional source of data which is used to fundamentally inform Stretch’s fin designs. The Black magic Stretch has applied to modify fin foils , flex and outline shapes to meet the demands of high performance surfing, pushes the intellectual envelope while delivering the high performance “goods”.\r\n\r\nUnique to Stretch’s signature fin is a full tip in a relatively high aspect ratio design. The unique inside foil is meant to increase flow efficiency and drive by aiding in reducing drag. Both the front set and the rear quad pair feature a leading edge design modeled heavily off the NACA 64A series foil which translates into more efficient angle of attack and pressure system dynamics for better fluidity and release.\r\n\r\nAll of Stretch’s fin templates feature  the trailing edge with the iconic beak tip which allows water flow along the full span of the leading edge to release cleanly reducing the chance of turbulent flow and a tracky or skitterish feeling when pushed hard yet still retaining the sensation of a free and pivotal feel.\r\n\r\nStretch designed the cambered (inside foil) characteristics to taper to zero with respect to chord length along the fin span in order to allow the tip to retain a neutral foil allowing the water and energy to “load up and twist off” of the lively tip area allowing predictable projection and positive drive.\r\n \r\nStretch fins feature design elements like full tips, beaked leading and trailing edge intersections and singular inside foil cambers. \r\nThese elements have been developed and refined over decades through endless iteration testing by the world’s best surfers in every set of conditions imaginable. \r\nThe result is a set of fins which flawlessly integrate all the essential elements. Stretch fin’s flexural pattern and amplitude, weight, area, pressure distribution, range of angle of attack, materials and esthetics represent a supremely evolved, essential element of high performance surfing. \r\nFrom hairball, death defying tow-ins, to world class contests, to the local beach break,  you can be assured Stretch’s fins have “been there done that” AND proven their mettle.\r\n \r\nIf you are accelerating for an aerial or trying to land one, tube stalling, going vertical, or just plain old trying to out run a section, your fins must do it all and do it well. Your fins are where the rubber hits the road and Stretch’s design work on fins is a pivotal departure from convention. Stretch’s understanding and long experience has resulted in a set of fins for every application in surfing.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCalifornia State Sales Tax Not Included\r\n\r\n\r\nFree Domestic Shipping!","options":[{"id":41525463,"name":"Default","price":130.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122897721/-/future-3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122897721/-/future-3.jpg","width":2784,"height":3228},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122897712/-/future-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122897712/-/future-1.jpg","width":3888,"height":3043},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122897715/-/future-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122897715/-/future-2.jpg","width":4816,"height":3194}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6010218,"name":"Fins","permalink":"fins","url":"/category/fins"}]}]
