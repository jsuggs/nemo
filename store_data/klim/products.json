This newest version has implemented these improvements and the result is a helmet that is even more comfortable and better-fitting than the original F4.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntake and exhaust ports have been significantly enlarged allowing more air to enter and exit the helmet.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe EPS liner shape has been modified in three ways. The cranial shape at the top of the helmet has been altered to allow a better fit on a wider variety of head shapes and also helps keep the helmet positioned correctly. The three large air channels that run laterally through the helmet were already some of the deepest offered in any helmet, but we have made them deeper in this version, allowing even more air to pass over the head and out of the helmet. The plenum chamber (inside the EPS) has also had its channels deepened, allowing an overall greater bandwidth of air to pass through the EPS to the rider’s head.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe comfort liner has been completely redesigned to implement the latest technologies in moisture-wicking fabrics. Moisture-wicking foam has strategically-placed perforations allowing a much greater amount of air to pass through the liner while enhancing comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith an unprecedented 41 air-craving intakes, the F4 again establishes the newest standard in helmet ventilation technology. The helmet design is optimized to effectively channel air into the helmet where it is assisted by a network of air-channels in the the EPS liner to maximize airflow over the entire head. The result is a dramatically cooler and drier riding experience. The pocketable WINDSTOPPER® liner can be snapped onto the comfort liner in colder weather, which will still allow moisture to be moved away from the head while preventing air from directly contacting the head. Safety standards have been exceeded not only through the use of aerospace materials, but also in the design. The F4 exceeds Snell M2010 and U.S. DOT standards.","options":[{"id":9794773,"name":"gear'd","price":399.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":50.0,"amount_with_others":40.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27050389/-/f4geard.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27050389/-/f4geard.jpg","width":1000,"height":928}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1662829,"name":"helmets","permalink":"helmets","url":"/category/helmets"}]},{"id":2796599,"name":"klimate glove","permalink":"klimate-glove","position":5,"price":69.99,"default_price":69.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/klimate-glove","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-10-12T08:34:13.000Z","description":"• GORE-TEX® Waterproof/Breathable High Performance Liner\r\n• GUARANTEED TO KEEP YOU DRY®\r\n• 200 Gram Thinsulate™ Insulation\r\n• Micro-Injected Logo\r\n• Internally Reinforced Toughtek® Palm\r\n• 3M Scotchlite™ Reflective Piping\r\n• Abrasion Resistant Nylon Shell\r\n• Ladder-Lock Wrist Adjustment\r\n• One Hand Cuff Adjustment\r\n• Guantlet Style Cuff\r\n• Goggle Squeegee ","options":[{"id":9794797,"name":"xl","price":69.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9794798,"name":"xxl","price":69.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":30.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27050517/-/klimateglove.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27050517/-/klimateglove.jpg","width":334,"height":700}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1662659,"name":"gloves","permalink":"gloves","url":"/category/gloves"}]}]
