I got fed up with throwing out jeans or adorable baby things thanks to a rip that was unrepairable.  So i got out the stockpile and finally got creative.  Fabric flowers like these solved the problem.  \r\nThis set include one denim clip, one khaki piece in tan color with a large metallic brad and one soft blue cotton piece with one medium sized blue colored pearl type of  brad.  The finishing touches can be change as requested.  \r\nThe second photo shows all three pieces.  \r\nThank you to Angie Arthur Photography for the great model shots.
