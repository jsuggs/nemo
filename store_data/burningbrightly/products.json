They are a complex, iridescent, bright green glass. I have enough supply to make 6 with no ability to restock - hence the Limited Edition. If it is still advertised I still have stock.

Imagine a fruity drink and the sound of waves while you relax and rejuvenate.  \r\n\r\nThe tree is constructed within a 2\" hand wrapped parawire form. I have selected wire with a square cross section because I feel this gives the piece a clean contemporary look. You can choose between silver or vintage bronze plating.\r\n\r\nThe limbs and trunk are constructed using a gold plated copper wire. The gold plating is a soft yellow that compliments both the silver and bronze forms while allowing the beauty of the tree to stand out. \r\n\r\nAll materials are tarnish resistant to keep the piece looking new. \r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that each tree is unique and has a life of its own.
