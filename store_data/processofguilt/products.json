Steadily moving through dynamic rhythm changes, the band explores a more diverse vocal approach, mantra-like grooves, a crushing rhythm session, an everlasting love for feedback and more huge riffs than you can ask for in under 45 minutes. With «FÆMIN», Process of Guilt paint desolate sonic landscapes and dig their own place in the scene even deeper.\r\n\r\n<b>EROSION CD / LAST COPIES (less than 10 available)</b>\r\n\r\nThe second full-length recording by Process of Guilt, is a major step forward for the portuguese band. Progressing even further from the post-doom sound crafted on their much lauded debut Renounce, the four musicians keep spreading their creative wings, breaking down genre boundaries and solidifying their very own personality. \r\nThe album was captured, produced and mixed at 5ª Dimensão Studios – between August and November 2008 – by João Bacelar and Fernando Mendes with the band. The tracks were mastered at the Boiler Room, by Collin Jordan (well-known for his work with such bands as Ministry, Minsk or Buried at Sea).\r\n\r\n<b>THE CIRCLE CD / Limited to 300 numbered digifiles! LAST COPIES  (less than 10 available)</b>\r\n\r\nClosing the process started with «Erosion», «The Circle» presents five reinterpretations of the closing song on PROCESSOFGUILT's highly acclaimed sophomore album and opens the door for the composition process of their third full length. Bringing together the creative minds of Sanford Parker (of Minsk, Buried At Sea, Twilight, Circle Of Animals, The High Confessions and overall producer extraordinaire), Echoes Of Yul (the Polish creators of one of the most interesting ambient/industrial debuts in recent years), DJ Mofo (of Portuguese best kept secret Bizarra Locomotiva), Bosque (one of the leading forces of bleak drone/doom/black art) and Sons Of Bronson (featuring members of Spanish sludge masters Lords Of Bukkake), «The Circle» offers a deconstructive circle through an erosive world of calm versus chaos. Besides the five remixes, this abstract descent begins with a new prespective on Erosion's closing track, now (re)mastered – as all the other tracks – by the well known James Plotkin (of OLD, Khanate fame). \r\nPressed as a beautiful limited (and numbered) digisleeve edition of 300 copies, through a partnership between the band and the newly founded Bleak Recordings.\r\n","options":[{"id":34288905,"name":"FÆMIN","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34288908,"name":"EROSION","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34288911,"name":"THE CIRCLE","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114255522/-/bigcartel_cd.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114255522/-/bigcartel_cd.jpg","width":640,"height":480}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3053001,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":10907277,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","position":2,"price":14.0,"default_price":14.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/vinyl","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-02T12:22:44.000Z","description":"FÆMIN Vinyl / Gatefold -
