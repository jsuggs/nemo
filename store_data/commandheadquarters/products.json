Forever\r\n\r\nI would say that this is probably my most sought after design.  \r\n\r\nNot only because it unites all Vietnam Veterans as Brothers, but also because it has all of the elements that you would have encountered during your \"stay\" in Vietnam.  \r\n\r\nHelicopters flank both sides of the design. The palm trees, and of course the word veteran in barbed wire.  \r\n\r\nThe vibrant colors make this design stand out on any color shirt and should certainly be included in your collection of Vietnam t-shirts!\r\n\r\nWe even have a matching patch and window decal! Take a look on our other pages.\r\n\r\nVietnam veteran is a phrase used to describe someone who served in the armed forces of participating countries during the Vietnam War.\r\n\r\nThe term has been used to describe veterans who were in the armed forces of South Vietnam, the United States armed forces, and countries allied to them, whether or not they were actually stationed in Vietnam during their service.\r\n\r\nHowever, the more common usage distinguishes between those who served \"in country\" and those who did not actually serve in Vietnam by referring to the \"in country\" veterans as \"Vietnam veterans\" and the others as \"Vietnam era veterans\". The U.S. government officially refers to all as \"Vietnam era veterans\".","options":[{"id":17771389,"name":"Black

psychological trauma.\r\n\r\nThis event may involve the threat of death to oneself or to someone else, or to one's own or someone else's physical, sexual, or psychological integrity, overwhelming the individual's ability to cope.\r\n\r\nAs an effect of psychological trauma, PTSD is less frequent and more enduring than the more commonly seen acute stress response.\r\n\r\nDiagnostic symptoms for PTSD include re-experiencing the original trauma(s) through flashbacks or nightmares, avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma, and increased arousal—such as difficulty falling or staying asleep, anger, and hyper-vigilance.\r\n\r\nFormal diagnostic criteria (both DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10) require that the symptoms last more than one month and cause significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\r\n\r\nPTSD Veteran Support Services: \r\nhttp://www.va.gov/ \r\nhttp://www.ptsd.va.gov/ \r\nhttp://ptsdsupport.net/

Southeast Asia, until the Indochina Peninsula was colonized by the French in the mid-19th century.\r\n\r\nEfforts to resist the French eventually led to their expulsion from the country in the mid-20th century, leaving Vietnam divided politically into two countries.\r\n\r\nFighting between the two sides continued, with heavy foreign intervention, during the Vietnam War, which ended with a
