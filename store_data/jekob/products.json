Beautifully hand crafted for all those who will go to their grave striving to be closer to the living God. It’s built out of an amp plug which offers an everyday reminder to stay  plugged in & connected to the word and the calling of the Christ. The verse inscribed on the side is  John 15:4-5. “Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.” It’s a fresh new way to witness to your friends, family, or even business associates. It’s unique design and look makes it an instant conversation piece. The first question they’ll ask is “What is it?” That gives you an open door to tell them what it is and what the verse inscribed along the side reads.  The second question is usually “Why an amp plug?” This will give you the chance to use the plug analogy and tie it in with the connection you have with Christ and explain to them how in surrendering to Christ they could have that same connection. Whether your an outspoken person, or more of an introvert, this chain offers a tremendously easy and very casual way for you to share your faith.\r\n","options":[{"id":15009263,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69021283/-/Chain_framed.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69021283/-/Chain_framed.jpg","width":553,"height":669}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2508713,"name":"Accesories","permalink":"accesories","url":"/category/accesories"}]}]
