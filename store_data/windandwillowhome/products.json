Of course, looks aren’t everything…wooden tools are non-reactive and can be used with all types of food unlike metal which can react with some foods and lend it a metallic taste. I’d say they are the best of both worlds.\r\n_________________________\r\nBEAUTY IS IN THE DETAILS\r\n\r\nOrigin: Minnesota, USA\r\nSize: Small Bowls: approximately 7 inch (17.78cm) diameter at the top x 2.25 inch (5.72cm) Deep with a .5 inch (1.27cm) rim.\r\nLarge Bowl: approximately 12 inch (20.48cm ) diameter at the top x 5/8 inch (1.59cm) Rim, 3.5 inches (8.89 cm) Deep\r\nMaterial: Beech wood, Synthetic Rubber\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nEach bowl has been hand dipped by ME. I don’t measure or tape the bowls to create perfectly identical bowls. I believe beauty is in organic lines and natural movement, which means the color dipped portion may vary between bowls and may show more or less wood as your move around the bowl.\r\nWood grains are part of the natural beauty of the wood (wood grains make me HAPPY). Grain colors can vary from light to dark brow or even a greyish hue.
