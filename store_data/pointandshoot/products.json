The adapters are sold out and. We are running a production of new enhanced kits, that will soon be available. Please visit back in a few days.</h2>\r\n\r\nThese Adapters let you <strong>load normal medium format 120 film in cameras made for the 616 film</strong> spools (cameras like old Kodak SIX-16 or Brownie). The 616 film went out of production in 1985 and are extremely difficult to find, and if found are expensive and and obviously expired! \r\n\r\nIf you have an empty 616 spool you can use it as a take-up spool, but when you finish shooting you will have to manually re-spool it in the dark in order to load more 120 films. <strong>With this kit you can load and shoot fresh film without the “re-spooling” issue</strong>: just insert the adapters at the ends of the 120 film spools to make it the same size of the 616 spools. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8259/8696032401_18f4df60c9_n.jpg\" width=\"215\" alt=\"The 120-616 Film Adater KIT\">\r\n<small><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/taiabati/8696032401/in/set-72157633389775216\" target=\"_blank\">see big</a></small>\r\n\r\nThe adapters are made of very durable Nylon plastics with metal inserts where the friction occurs. \r\n\r\nThe kit comes with 4 pieces: three of them are paddings (note the “P” marking), the fourth and most important is a key (marked with “K”). The Key adapter has to be mounted where the camera's spooling handle is, because it has a particular interlocking for the spooling advance: the wind-up lever must connect perfectly with the spool.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8393/8696030193_dab02aa62e_n.jpg\" width=\"215\" alt=\"Kodak Six-16 Model C with 120 film adapters\">\r\n<small><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/taiabati/8696030193/in/set-72157633389775216\" target=\"_blank\">see big</a></small>\r\n\r\nAfter the roll is exposed, just take it out and put the adapters on a new film.

The 616 film went out of production in 1985 so adapters are need to load other types of film.\r\n\r\nThese adapters are made one by one with high precision CNC machines. Insert the adapters at the ends of the 120 film spool and make it the same size of the 616 spool.\r\n\r\nYou will need 4 adapters in order to load the two spool, but you can still purchase only 2 (for the take-up spool). In fact, the take up spool has to be inserted firmly into its place, and the wind-up lever must connect perfectly with the spool. This is why such precise adapters are seggested at least for the take-up spool. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7148/6836331405_31bc06d7bb_m.jpg\" width=\"215\" alt=\"Kodak Six-16 Model C\">\r\n\r\nThe other spool (the new one with the film on it) can be put in its place with some washers or wall plugs. But we suggest you use the quick and easy adapters for the film spool as well. \r\n\r\nAfter the roll is exposed, just take out the adapters and put them on a new film. Then take the empty spool and use it as take-up spool! \r\n\r\nSee more pictures of the adapters in action here: <a title=\"120 to 616 film spool adapters\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/taiabati/sets/72157629217060333/\" target=\"blank\"><strong>120 to 616 film spool adapters</strong></a>","options":[{"id":17494011,"name":"2 adapters, for the take up spool","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":17494013,"name":"4 adapters, for both the spools","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53218731/-/adapters-on-spool.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53218731/-/adapters-on-spool.png","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2876453,"name":"Photography","permalink":"photography","url":"/category/photography"}]}]
