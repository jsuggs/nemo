Hiking medallions would have been mounted on a walking or hiking stick with two or three nails to show the places a person had visited.\r\n\r\nThis specific medallion is from Schloss Banz. Schloss is the German word for “castle”. Schloss Banz is also known as Banz Abbey, a former Benedictine monastery in Germany. Countess Alberada and her husband Count Hermann of Habsberg-Kastl founded it in 1070, when only members of nobility were accepted as monks.\r\n\r\nBecause each Hiking medallion I have is from a different German, Bavarian or Bolivian location, each necklace will be one-of-a-kind. I will send photos of your unique necklace before shipping. \r\n\r\nAll necklaces are made to order. Please allow up to 30 days for me to make the necklace, send photos, receive confirmation from you and finally to ship. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**PLEASE NOTE: The Harz necklace shown has been SOLD, however, I have many more deer head medallions that look just like this, but they are all from different locations. I will include a detailed history of your one-of-a-kind medallion! I will also send photos of your necklace before shipping. Thanks!\r\n\r\nHarz History: The center piece on the necklace shown is a vintage hiking medallion from Harz, the highest mountain range in Northern Germany. The name Harz derives from the Middle High German word Hardt or Hart which means mountain forest. The Harz is home to the legendary summit, Brocken which rises 3,744 ft above sea level and the famous peak, Wurmberg which towers 3,186 ft above Lower Saxony. I cannot be certain of the exact age of the medallion, though it dates somewhere between 1940 and 1960.**\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":22392271,"name":"Default","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.7,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69409595/-/Stagheadneck.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69409595/-/Stagheadneck.jpg","width":774,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98572531/-/stag_banz_close.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98572531/-/stag_banz_close.jpg","width":528,"height":792},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/79663737/-/nikki_hiking.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/79663737/-/nikki_hiking.jpg","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69409643/-/deerclose.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69409643/-/deerclose.jpg","width":725,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98827447/-/packaging_vert_round.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98827447/-/packaging_vert_round.jpg","width":707,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3751343,"name":"$65 and under","permalink":"65-and-under","url":"/category/65-and-under"},{"id":3614107,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]},{"id":9749486,"name":"Gold Bullet Shell Gold Dipped Crystal Necklace","permalink":"gold-bullet-shell-gold-dipped-crystal-necklace","position":3,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/gold-bullet-shell-gold-dipped-crystal-necklace","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-05T18:22:54.000Z","description":"Gold dipped natural crystal, gold bullet casing on a striking black and gold chain.

It has roots in the Middle Ages and originates from the oriental-style artisan work done in Damascus, Syria. The craft, perfected by the Arabs and brought with them to Spain, has remained virtually unchanged over the centuries, and practiced also by Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. Around the XV century damascene became popular in Europe, and Toledo, Spain became famous worldwide for producing such works of art.\r\n\r\nThis necklace features a damascene knife from 1972, oxidized steel with a beautiful gold arabesque motif inlay. TOLEDO is engraved on the knife blade - meaning this was authentically crafted in Toledo, Spain. Rostfrei is also engraved in the blade - this is German for “rust free” which means the blades are stainless steel. \r\nPlease be advised that this IS a knife. Do NOT take it on a plane, or into places where such things are restricted.
