So three each in total.\r\nMega Games are four chaps from Southampton, but on this recording there are only two of them and no drums. Acoustic melodica-punk with ample sing-along moments. This is the most romantic set of songs they will ever record.\r\nTorn Out are two absolute gents from Essex. Just guitar, bass and vocals. They sound like a pissed-off Jack Penate playing acoustic versions of Descendants songs.\r\nThis is a limited edition release. 100 Copies. When they're gone that's it.\r\n\r\nDownload Code included.\r\nSHTDT #02","options":[{"id":9653925,"name":"Default","price":3.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26598477/-/l_7c8fe46618ef435b99328c817aa5fa78.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26598477/-/l_7c8fe46618ef435b99328c817aa5fa78.jpg","width":600,"height":450}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1573445,"name":"Cassette","permalink":"cassette","url":"/category/cassette"}]}]
