The built in handle and carry case made it the first portable typewriter light enough to carry, an instant hit with the pop-art generation and fashion accessory for It-girls. \r\n","options":[{"id":1032463,"name":"Small (to fit chest 34-36 ins)","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":1032467,"name":"Medium (to fit chest 38-40)","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":1032470,"name":"Large (to fit chest 42-44)","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1736440/-/Picture_1.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1736440/-/Picture_1.png","width":933,"height":698}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":210072,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]}]
