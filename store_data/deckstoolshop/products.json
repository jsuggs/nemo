A hidden reinforcement panel underneath strengthens and ensures a flat surface while the chromed-out steel tablebase brings some bling. \r\n\r\nExcellent as a dining table for a small home or apartment. Contract quality. Great in a trendy cafe or yogurt shop. Water-based polyurthethane finish cleans easily with damp cloth. \r\n\r\nAvailable in dining (29\"H) or bar height (42\"H). Standard table top sizes are (24\" x 24\" square) or (30\" x 30\" square.) Custom tabletop sizes/shapes are available. We guarantee the quality of our products and your satisfaction. \r\n\r\nAll Skatecafe Tables are made to order. Due to the nature of the material, broken skateboards, every tabletop is unique and will not look identical to the images shown. We do our best to accomodate special requests for color and board designs. Please allow 2-4 weeks for delivery.\r\n\r\nPlease contact us for shipping to international destinations.\r\n\r\nHave any questions?
