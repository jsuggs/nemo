The lyrics remind us to look back at our mistakes, and trials we have encountered, to become a stronger, better person. The songs flow into each other like a timeline or clip of one's life. In the end, “The Big Picture” comes around full-circle; reflecting back on one's life and seeing the positive in it, as if through the innocent eyes of a child. If you have ever found something worth sacrificing for, experienced the overwhelming feelings of guilt and regret, or struggled battling your own weaknesses, you will be able to relate to this album. Everyone searches for the meaning of life; this is Chaser’s definition.\r\n\r\n1. The Big Picture\r\n2. Debt Of A Nation\r\n3. Nevermore\r\n4. Action to Ashes\r\n5. In This Together\r\n6.
