Convinced yet? No? Ok, I'll explain further.\r\n\r\nComicettes are a miniature comic book that fit into a cigarette box and comes with a magnify glass. Included in every box is a cheap plastic toy all because I loved Cracker Jacks when I was a kid. Oh you once were a kid too? We have so much in common.\r\n\r\nBad Kitty is a black comedy comic strip starring Kitty, who is bad. There are seventy something strips in this book, I'm too lazy to count that high to figure out the correct number. This product would make a bad gift to someone who enjoys hobbies like acting boring or being offended by stuff.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this, now please buy the product.\r\n\r\nYou're welcome.","options":[{"id":22723001,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70407815/-/bad_kitty_comicette_cover.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70407815/-/bad_kitty_comicette_cover.JPG","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3667645,"name":"Comicette","permalink":"comicette","url":"/category/comicette"},{"id":3667647,"name":"Book","permalink":"book","url":"/category/book"}]},{"id":7179263,"name":"UNDERCULTURE Comicette","permalink":"underculture-comicette","position":2,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/underculture-comicette","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-07T11:56:47.000Z","description":"You know the excitement of seeing a large picture very very small? Well you'll surely experience that with the UNDERCULTURE Comicette. Zero words in this miniature book. ZERO! That means no reading! There are far more words in this description of UNDERCULTURE Comicettes than there are words in UNDERCULTURE Comicette. \r\n\r\nEvery UNDERCULTURE Comicette contains a Comicette Book, box, horrible plastic toy, a magnify glass, and a ball point pen cap because I have a lot of ball point pen caps. Why do they make pen caps still? I'll ask Mr. Google about that later. So um, thank you for reading.

I recommend enjoying this book while wearing your best smoking jacket and sipping your very expensive Scotch. Not only does this book contain the same Bad Kitty comic strips as in the Comicette, but it also features the same amount to spelling errors. And remember, if you buy two Bad Kitty Comic Strip Books, you can read one and throw the other into the garbage can.
