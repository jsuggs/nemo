In a contemporary context Willis's experimental and hypnotic sounds fit neatly but uniquely alongside the likes of other sonic 4:4 explorers such as Four Tet, Actress, Nathan Fake and Caribou.\r\n\r\nCalligraphy is by Hetty Fraser.","options":[{"id":21339005,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":5.0},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65897789/-/1000_-_Developed__-_IMGP0786.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65897789/-/1000_-_Developed__-_IMGP0786.jpg","width":1000,"height":948},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70239015/-/winterval_back_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70239015/-/winterval_back_cover.jpg","width":992,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72846355/-/packshot_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72846355/-/packshot_1.jpg","width":825,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":131227,"name":"Sam Willis","permalink":"sam-willis","url":"/artist/sam-willis"}],"categories":[{"id":119392,"name":"LP/ 12\"","permalink":"lp-12","url":"/category/lp-12"}]},{"id":5534879,"name":"The Magic - Ragged Gold - 180g LP (with download)","permalink":"the-magic-ragged-gold-lp-pre-order","position":2,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-magic-ragged-gold-lp-pre-order","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-02-23T16:05:09.000Z","description":"Vinyl includes full album download\r\n\r\n‘Ragged Gold’, the debut album from The Magic released on Monday 25th June 2012, through Half Machine Records.\r\n\r\nThe 180g heavyweight LP will come with free download of the album.\r\n\r\nThe Magic are brothers Geordie and Evan Gordon, born and bred in the small Canadian city of Guelph, Ontario.

Geordie sings, plays guitar and keys, with Evan on bass, backing vocals and production.  They’re also joined by their friend Sylvie Smith from the band Evening Hymns on additional vocals, notably on the frustrated lovers plea ‘Call Me Up’.\r\n\r\nElsewhere on the record they take in syncopated disco rhythms, languid 80s funk, whilst also peppering every song with effortless big FM pop choruses.","options":[{"id":17830741,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59066883/-/Front3_WEB.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59066883/-/Front3_WEB.jpg","width":990,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":107717,"name":"The Magic","permalink":"the-magic","url":"/artist/the-magic"}],"categories":[{"id":119392,"name":"LP/ 12\"","permalink":"lp-12","url":"/category/lp-12"}]},{"id":4189755,"name":"Roberto Cacciapaglia - The Ann Steel Album LP reissue","permalink":"roberto-cacciapaglia-the-ann-steel-album-vinyl-only-reissue-pre-order","position":3,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/roberto-cacciapaglia-the-ann-steel-album-vinyl-only-reissue-pre-order","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-08-02T16:15:56.000Z","description":"Roberto Cacciapaglia is an Italian electronic composer who’s made albums using every possible permutation of the same six notes, right up to modern classical, with ‘The Ann Steel Album’ as the weird anomaly.\r\n\r\nMade with an American model, who moved to Italy to make it big in fashion, Roberto took her languid, Laurie Anderson-esque voice and created a detached futurist popstar.\r\n\r\nThe odd sound of these European futurist pop songs make it sound like the machines are breathing, creating a weird organic/ electronic rhythm section.

Actually it's the feel given by Cacciapaglia's mixture of classical sense compositions (he was trained in Milan's Giuseppe Verdi conservatory) with adventurous experimentalism (he worked for the RAI's phonology research team and also at the CNR in Pisa) what makes the sound of Sonanze so unique.

Released on Monday 7th September 2009 on 7\" and download.\r\n\r\nJumbling Towers is a musical outfit from St. Louis, MO. A subsidy of parent company Money Buckets LLC, Jumbling Towers has been selling musical entertainment and related merchandise since 2006. Their products have received mixed reviews, drawing descriptors such as \"eerie\", \"off-kilter\" and \"fag shit\".\r\n\r\nJumbling Towers' current project is dedicated to the fictitious world of 1981 Kanetown City, and the group of exiled youth who made the music soon to be heard. Their story is one of passion, poverty, and racial tolerance. The Towers themselves practice neither passion nor poverty but are certainly advocates of racial equality.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1157395&show_artwork=true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nwww.jumblingtowers.com\r\nmyspace.com/jumblingtowers","options":[{"id":1395448,"name":"Default","price":3.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2665801/-/IMG_0950_web_version.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2665801/-/IMG_0950_web_version.jpg","width":425,"height":425}],"artists":[{"id":7986,"name":"Jumbling Towers","permalink":"jumbling-towers","url":"/artist/jumbling-towers"}],"categories":[{"id":119125,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"}]},{"id":5479101,"name":"Psychedelic Horseshit - New Wave Hippies EP 7\"","permalink":"psychedelic-horseshit-new-wave-hippies-7-sold-out","position":14,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/psychedelic-horseshit-new-wave-hippies-7-sold-out","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-16T01:58:51.000Z","description":"Debut UK single by Psychedelic Horseshit\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F8046763&show_artwork=true\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":17671339,"name":"Default","price":3.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53794709/-/images.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53794709/-/images.jpeg","width":223,"height":226}],"artists":[{"id":3569,"name":"Psychedelic Horseshit","permalink":"psychedelic-horseshit","url":"/artist/psychedelic-horseshit"}],"categories":[{"id":119125,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"}]},{"id":5479111,"name":"Woods - To Clean 7\"","permalink":"woods-to-clean-7-sold-out","position":15,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/woods-to-clean-7-sold-out","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-16T01:59:54.000Z","description":"Debut UK single by Woods\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1206489&show_artwork=true\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":17671393,"name":"Default","price":3.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53794829/-/woods-cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53794829/-/woods-cover.jpg","width":360,"height":359}],"artists":[{"id":7772,"name":"WOODS","permalink":"woods","url":"/artist/woods"}],"categories":[{"id":119125,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"}]},{"id":153132,"name":"Pacific! - A Tree 7\"","permalink":"pacific-a-tree","position":16,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pacific-a-tree","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2008-09-16T16:25:32.000Z","description":"Second single from Pacific's debut album 'Reveries'.
