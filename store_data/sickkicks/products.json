In many of those stories, Koi are transformed through their efforts and perseverance, able to climb waterfalls and become dragons. The Koi as a symbol represents perseverance in the face of adversity and strength of character or purpose. The Carp can also represent wisdom, knowledge, longevity, and loyalty.\r\n\r\nIn this image, in combination with flowing water, the koi symbolizes courage, achievement, and overcoming life’s obstacles.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, the koi has long been a symbol of masculinity and strength. Legends tell of it leaping up the falls at Dragon Gate. In the process it transformed into a dragon, proof of its successful struggle against the long odds. If caught, the koi is said to await the cutting knife without a quiver, in the manner of the Samurai warrior facing the sword. A popular fish like the koi has spawned many legends and myths over the centuries.</i>\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy the shirt and help support Japan!\r\n\r\n*The characters on the back of the shirt are \"Courage\" \"Love\" and \"Hope\".
