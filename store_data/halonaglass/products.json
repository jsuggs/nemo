Completely customized!  Can be hung in a window or displayed on  a shelf (you will need to purchase a plate holder or lean it against a wall).

Information on Color Psychology here: http://psychology.about.com/od/sensationandperception/a/colorpsych.htm\r\n\r\nOf course, you can always just pick your favorite colors. A few things to know: 1. The color is generalized, meaning if you say Green, it could be a light green or dark green. Please SPECIFY if you have preference. There will always be at least 2 iridescent glasses in the main quartz. Please look at picture 2, to see what iridescent means if you're not familiar. Picture 1 and 2 are the same piece (to show you how wonderful the iridescent can make pieces look!). I try to use textured glass, but it really varies from what I have in stock at the time. Most pieces will be made from entirely different textures to really offset each other. Also, often there are streaks of other colors in there, but the color you choose will be the main color you see. Please note the amber in Picture 1 has streaks of white, yellow, pink, etc but is still very much a amber crystal.  \r\n\r\nWHEN ORDERING: Please put in the notes the color for each Crystal following the numbered chart.
