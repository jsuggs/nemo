Avoid getting liquid in this tube when filling the Clearomizer. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen unfastening the base (atomizer head) to refill the Clearomizer, the seals are temporarily broken and liquid will leak from the mouthpiece or escape into the center tube. Always wrap a cloth or piece of tissue around the mouthpiece when unfastening the base of the Clearomizer.\r\n\r\n\r\nGurgling noise or leaks: This is a sign that liquid has found its way into the metal tube in the center of the Clearomizer (and usually occurs after a refill). Ridding the center tube of liquid will resolve the issue. To do so without emptying the tank, remove the Clearomizer from the battery, wrap a cloth or tissue around the battery end of the Clearomizer and blow through the mouthpiece. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe atomizer head of the Protank can unfasten when unscrewing the tube or base. Always secure the atomizer head before reinstalling the base of the Protank.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is normal to find a small amount of liquid in the battery contact area when removing the Clearomizer or any atomizer. We recommend cleaning the battery before charging it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen possible, keep the tank full and never below 1/3 full of eLiquid (\"topped off\"). This helps maintain the \"vacuum\" in the tank and prevent leaks.\r\n\r\n\r\nAtomizer heads have an average lifespan between 10 to 20 days. When the atomizer head wears down, it may begin to leak. Replace the atomizer head with a new one if available.\r\n\r\n \r\nPlease Note: This product is not covered by warranty and cannot be exchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\nPackage Contents:\r\n1 x Kanger Protank 2 (Pyrex tank, top cap, bottom cap and 510 base)\r\n1 x 510 Drip tip\r\n2 x Atomizer Head for Kanger Protank","options":[{"id":49133859,"name":"Default","price":23.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128295420/-/photo_1.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128295420/-/photo_1.JPG","width":2448,"height":3264}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":14386968,"name":"Innokin iClear30 ","permalink":"innokin-iclear30","position":8,"price":18.99,"default_price":18.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/innokin-iclear30","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-24T17:31:44.000Z","description":" \t\r\nInnokin iClear 30 Dual Coil Tank Clearomizer\r\n3 ml Capacity\r\nDimensions: 3\"L x  3/4\"D\r\n\r\nThe iClear 30 features dual coils, an easily replaceable atomizer head, a large 3ML capacity, and rotatable threaded mouth piece.\r\n\r\nReplaceable Dual Coil Innokin iClear 30 is the first dual coil clearomizer with a replaceable atomizer head, making it very inexpensive to maintain, while providing huge amounts of vapor and flavor.\r\n\r\nThe huge capacity is another great feature of the iClear 30.
