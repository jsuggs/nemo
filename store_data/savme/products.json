Goodman once was just a ordinary attorney for the Las Vegas mob scene in the 90's but when he was elected Mayor of the GREAT city of Las Vegas he took his tie off and showed people how crazy he really is. A spokesperson for Bombay Saphire Gin and an avid alcoholic, in Goodmans tenure as Mayor he advocated alcoholism in elementary schools and hated graffiti. That's where I come in. Oscar Goodman stated that graffiti writers who are caught should have there thumbs cut off in a public forum. Well what better way to show homage to the man who helped push countless numbers of graffiti writers to keep on vandalising by making the Ex-Mayor of Las Vegas into a custom 7in vinyl toy.\r\nToy is made from a standard Kidrobot 7inch Munny and comes with:\r\n\r\n-Custom box and \"Birth Certificate\"\r\n\r\n-Removable glasses\r\n\r\n-Original sketch for the signed and numbered toy\r\n\r\n-???Mystery accessory???\r\n\r\nSo get one today!

I was only able to fit half of my crew mates on this page, hoping \"Clicked Up Vol.2\" will fiish up the names... Mainly used black and silver sharpies, also added a colored SOA AUB BSA down the center of the piece. I added the waldo as a joke.. try and find your name! Once it was all finished I stenciled out some names and layered them over the top with a transparent black.
