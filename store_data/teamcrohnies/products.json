Soon after, George was also diagnosed with a mild case of Churg Strauss, and Eosinophilia. George developed blood clots, kidney stones, pneumonia, Stongyloides (a parasite), and antiphosolipid syndrome antibodies. He continues to see many different specialists because it is still not clear if there is another disease that George is suffering from and his illness is still not under control. George went from a Coxswain for Loyola’s Crew Team, and enjoying being a teenager to a young man having to accept a very adult role. \r\nOur family continues to struggle emotionally and financially because of the illness of our son. \r\nPlease join us on Saturday, November 5th 2011 we will have a fundraiser at Monastero’s Restorante 3935 W Devon Ave. Tickets will be $50.00 per person which includes a dinner buffet and entertainment, cash bar will be availible. The proceeds from this event will go towards George’s medical expenses. We will have silent auctions, and raffles. As George would say \"It's A Party!\"\r\n\r\n**Online sales have ended. Tickets will still be available at the door on Saturday Nov. 5th starting at 6:30pm.**","options":[{"id":14612825,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43667081/-/george.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43667081/-/george.jpg","width":240,"height":150}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2457763,"name":"Special Events","permalink":"special-events","url":"/category/special-events"}]},{"id":4460097,"name":"Team Crohnies Wristbands","permalink":"team-crohnies-wristbands","position":3,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/team-crohnies-wristbands","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-09-18T06:43:35.000Z","description":"Support Team Crohnies by purchasing one of our new Awareness Matters Wristbands.
