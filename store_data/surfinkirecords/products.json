Richie’s band Unnatural Axe were invited to play thanks to Suz Motta and Pierpaolo de lulis who found them on a My Space page created by Richie’s daughter…the Chord Rockers were born. \r\nAstrid now fronts Miss Chain and the Broken Heels, Alex is the singer and guitarist for Dissuaders.\r\nPop meets Punk and in the middle was Richie’s new found desire to write music again. Richie started writing as soon as he got back to the US in the hopes of building a Rock & Roll bridge between Boston and Italy.\r\nIn the spring of 2007 Richie retuned to Rome again, this time in support of and backing Cheetah Chrome. Alex booked studio time and played guitar and Astrid sang. Basic tracks had been recorded in Boston with Frank Dehler of Unnatural Axe on Bass and Jack Clark of Jerry’s Kids and Unnatural Axe on Drums\r\nOver the course of the next few years, as time permitted the songs were completed. The sound is a blend of Richie’s Boston Rock foundation, Alex’s aggressive guitar style and Astrid’s pure pop sensibility. All held together by Frank & Jack.\r\n\r\nSide A:\r\nSalaria\r\nYou're the One\r\nSubway\r\nNo Time\r\n \r\n \r\nSide B:\r\nToo much Stuff\r\nSunny Sunday\r\nCandy\r\n\r\nThe 1st press of the record

no it's THE YUM YUMS again! The world's most famous power-pop band is back with another album! Their fourth full-length is called THE YUM YUMS Play Good Music, and it's absolutely true! It's stacked with catchy hi-energy, guitar-driven power-pop songs, complete with sugary multi-layered harmonies and lyrics that seems to be stolen from some 12 year-old girl's diary. Like Joss Hutton once wrote in Bucketfull Of Brains Magazine, 'Let's consider the three minute pop-song for a second or two: so simple in it's construction, so inscrutable in it's perfection, so many who have tried and failed! For me the YUM YUMS have been THE band to watch over the past few years, their perfect (yep, it's true) take on the \"power-pop\" thang is a source of constant pleasure and amuzement'. A pretty good description that is, but what more can we say about those ambassadors of power-pop? They deliver REAL POWER-POP, with the word power written in capital letters. Putting together the essential ingrediences of the music of the RAMONES, the PLIMSOULS and the OHIO EXPRESS, the 6t's and the 7t's, bubblegum and punk, pop and rock'n'roll, just to create their very own YUMMY sound. So, what we're talking about is extremely catchy pop-music with a fat, rockin' guitar sound, well executed vocal-lines, ridin'-on-the-waves drums and a crunchy punk feel to it. It simply makes you feel good! Their previous album \"Whatever Rhymes With Baby\" took THE YUM YUMS touring through Spain, Italy, Germany, Japan and USA. This new album may even take them to Sweden!","options":[{"id":48039258,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":107,"name":"French Polynesia","code":"PF"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":151,"name":"Marshall Islands","code":"MH"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":179,"name":"Papua New Guinea","code":"PG"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":226,"name":"Tuvalu","code":"TV"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":2.0},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":20,"name":"India","code":"IN"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":168,"name":"New Caledonia","code":"NC"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":183,"name":"Pitcairn","code":"PN"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":196,"name":"Samoa","code":"WS"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127513023/-/yumyums_lp.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127513023/-/yumyums_lp.gif","width":350,"height":346}],"artists":[{"id":249213,"name":"Yum Yums","permalink":"yum-yums","url":"/artist/yum-yums"},{"id":249216,"name":"Twistaroos","permalink":"twistaroos","url":"/artist/twistaroos"}],"categories":[{"id":3065105,"name":"DISTRO","permalink":"distro","url":"/category/distro"},{"id":1594310,"name":"LPs","permalink":"lps","url":"/category/lps"}]},{"id":14822532,"name":"The Twistaroos \"Twisted\" LP","permalink":"the-twistaroos-twisted-lp","position":21,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-twistaroos-twisted-lp","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-13T18:39:37.000Z","description":"The Yum YUms turn into the Twistaroos and start to play catchy Rock & Roll they way you would expect them to do!\r\n\r\nSide A\r\n1.
