Pirates were crews of men who would sail the fierce and uncontrollable waves in search of wealth, looting rival ships, fighting vicious battles and these stories of debauchery have become timeless. \r\n \r\nThe pummel of a blistering cannonball or the sharp blade of a cutlass in battle ensured many men met a watery grave.\r\n\r\nThis crewneck pays tribute to the buccaneers of history. It's perfect for ocean warfare, pillaging galleons and plunging into the icy depths.\r\n\r\nThis crewneck sweatshirt is printed on American Apparel with custom printed neck tag.

The developments in medicine, technology and science during Queen Victoria's reign were staggering, from the development of the telephone, cameras, lightbulbs, anaethestics and steam powered machines all pushing the envelope during this era.\r\n\r\nThere was a Industrial Revolution in Britain, where factories and machines were built and developed as amazing feats of engineering. \r\n\r\nHowever it wasn't all for the best. London became incredibly overpopulated. With this boost in economy came a huge divide in class. The Upper classes formed their aristocracy, passed laws and were aggressive in keeping their society selective. It is out of this aristocracy that many laws and traditions are still held in Britain today, regardless of ludicrousy.\r\n\r\nThis Deathly Gentleman invites you to join the upper classes.
