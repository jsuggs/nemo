Narwaldo loves making friends. His favorite way is poking holes in boats. Then one by one, he meets his new friends as they join him in the briny deep.\r\n\r\nYou will get a Narwaldo in your choice of purple, blue, or pink. Narwaldos have a fleece front and coordinating cotton print on the back.  Each doll is unique, so your Narwaldo may differ slightly from the photo. Narwaldo is approx. 22 inches tall and 11 inches at his widest\r\nHe will come with a tag that tells his story.\r\n\r\nEach WonkyDoll is lovingly sewn by me. Please allow up to one week for your Narwaldo to be made.\r\n\r\nâ™¥ WonkyDolls are created for the adult collector, and may not be suitable for children.
