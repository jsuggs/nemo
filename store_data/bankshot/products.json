This is a must for fans of Billy Bragg, The Specials, Al Green, The Slackers and ? and the Mysterions. The Ghosts are Out.. was recorded with David Age at Boston's New Alliance Studios, and mixed and mastered at Ice Station Zebra in Medford, MA by David Age and Ducky Carlisle.\r\n\r\nThe Glow immediately call to mind the 60s production work Phil Spector, the pop stylings of Elvis Costello, the white-boy soul of the Spencer Davis Group, and the rock revivalism of 80's Billy Joel. On their debut album, The Ghosts Are Out… The Glow kick out 12 maximum rock n’ soul anthems to rattle your teeth and shake that ass. It's a mix of Motown, Stax, and raw punk ferocity. These are songs about life, loss, and the human condition. These are songs about heartbreak, about tragedy, gin-soaked rage and bargain-bin whiskey redemption. This band is about confronting the ghosts of your past and learning to walk among them.
