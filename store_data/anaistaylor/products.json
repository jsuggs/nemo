It also features recipe ideas to use that month's produce and inspiration for enjoying the season to the fullest.\r\n\r\nAll illustrations are hand-drawn from organic fruit and vegetables from my local farmers markets in Sydney, using a range of materials including pencil, pastel and charcoal.\r\n\r\nThe calendars are beautifully printed on thick gloss stock which can be written on. They are bound with a hanger so you can hang your calendar somewhere to inspire you every day!","options":[{"id":10197781,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/28585415/-/cover2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/28585415/-/cover2.jpg","width":595,"height":842}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1730779,"name":"Calendar","permalink":"calendar","url":"/category/calendar"}]}]
