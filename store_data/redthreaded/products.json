The exact style can be customized almost any way you want, and I love working with clients to create the dress of their dreams.

The bodice will have a sturdy twill interlining and steel boning, and will lace in back with silver or gold grommets*.

These stays are based upon existing corsets of the 18th century in both pattern and construction.  The corset will be constructed from English cotton coutil lined with cotton twill, with an outer layer of shimmering silk. The edges will be bound in either matching silk or a fine cream Egyptian cotton. Each tab is meticulously bound with a combination of machine and hand sewing, ensuring a smooth, durable finish with no visible stitches.\r\n\r\nIt is boned with 2 types of boning--steel and historically-accurate reed boning. The steels give more strength to the reed in key areas, but the reed allows the entire front of the corset to be boned without adding the weight of the steel. It also gives a lovely, slightly raised appearance to the boning channels, which mimics more closely the look of period corsets. An interior waist tape will be incorporated so that the waist will not stretch. Two metal bones span the front of the bust horizontally, and these help with the conical decolletage and silhouette popular in the 18th century. A wooden, removable busk is included.  \r\n\r\nThe corset will lace up center back with silver grommets (can be switched to gold by request). This can be changed to hand bound eyelets for an additional $50 fee.

The sleeves are full but not cumbersome, adding graceful movement to the silhouette. \r\n\r\nAs with all of my costumes, this garment is high quality and will be made to last.  The bodice will be flatlined to the hip with an additional layer of linen for structure and durability. All interior edges are serged, and hems are machine topstitched for durability. The sleeve seams are stitched with french seams, since the interior of the sleeve is visible.\r\n\r\nThis style is also very flexible, depending upon how you accessorize it: dress it up as shown with a fancy belt or sash (not included), or dress it down for a peasant look with a leather or rope belt. \r\n\r\nI will need the following measurements:\r\nBust measurement\r\nWaist measurement\r\nWaist to floor measurement\r\nBack of neck to waist\r\nand preferred color (choice is subject to current availability, though I will do my best to find the exact shade you desire) \r\n\r\nPlease see my <a href=\"http://www.redthreaded.com/policies\" target=\"_blank\">Policies Page</a>  for current production lead times, as these can be up to 4 months during busy seasons. \r\n\r\nEmail me at redthreadedcs@gmail.com if you have any questions prior to purchase, or if you would like to set up a payment plan.

This corset is based upon existing corsets of the 18th century in both pattern and construction. Wear it under your court gown or as part of your pastoral peasant costume.  \r\n\r\nThe corset will be constructed from English cotton coutil lined with cotton twill, cotton fashion fabric, cream cotton bias binding.  It is boned with two types of boning--steel and historically-accurate reed boning. The reed allows the entire front of the corset to be boned, while remaining very lightweight. It also gives a lovely, slightly raised appearance to the boning channels, which mimics more closely the look of period corsets. An interior waist tape will be incorporated so that the waist will not stretch. Two metal bones span the front of the bust horizontally,  these help with the conical decolletage and silhouette popular in the 18th century. The straps extend from the high back (which really helps maintain the perfect posture of the period) and tie onto the front. Busk pocket and removable wooden busk included. \r\n\r\nThe corset will spiral lace up center back with silver grommets. This can be changed to hand bound eyelets for an additional $70 fee. If you would like the upgrade, contact me and I will create a custom listing with the correct price for you to purchase.\r\n\r\nI will need to know the following:\r\n\r\n-Bust measurement\r\n-Bra size\r\n-Waist measurement\r\n-Underarm to waist measurement (taken with your arm relaxed at your side)\r\n-Desired cotton fashion fabric color.

It is a gorgeous, flattering shape with a multi-seamed back, interesting zone-front detail and tight sleeves, perfect for your next Marie Antoinette themed party. It will be made to your measurements and in a silk taffeta color of your choosing.  The silk is decadent and makes a fabulous rustling sound when walking. The gown will be made to appear as historically accurate as possible, all visible stitching done by hand, including the hand bound buttonholes and hand covered buttons. \r\n\r\nThis gown will be made with lots of pretty details! Cream or black silk satin ribbons lace through hand bound eyelets at the wrist, these can hang loose or be tied in a bow. A similar looped trim in black, cream, or other color or trim of your choosing finishes off the zone front. The skirt will be knife-pleated to the bodice, and the graceful point in the back of the bodice is flattering and elegant. \r\n\r\nThis gown listing consists of a silk petticoat, overdress with split front, and a bum roll for the correct silhouette. I highly recommend the wearing of stays (corset) with this dress, as it is not heavily boned. The model is not wearing a corset in the photos, and as you can see, it is not as smooth through the bodice as it should be. \r\n\r\nThis is a custom order and will take a number of weeks to complete.

It re-creates the conical shape of the 16th century, and features a deep front point, front lacing for ease in dressing, a high back for support and posture, boned tabs, and straps.  It is fully boned throughout with historically accurate reed, or \"bents.\" The reed is remarkably light and comfortable, and quite strong!  The two bones at the front are steel, to support the lacing. The corset, or \"stays\", will have an inner strength layer of high quality imported English cotton coutil, and a lining of twill. You get to choose the color of linen you would like for your fashion fabric. I can also make them in a solid cotton, or silk for an additional $15.\r\n\r\nThirty hand-bound eyelets are the finishing touch to the authentic look of this corset. Grommets can be substituted if desired (which will reduce the price by $70). \r\n\r\nThis corset is meant to lace closed center front, and will be made 2\" smaller than your measurements to allow for squish and a little stretch.

The steel boned bodice will be constructed from a double layer of canvas, allowing it to be worn without a corset, while creating that rigid, conical look of the time period. The sleeves attach to the shoulder straps with buttons and elastic loops, or ribbon ties.The wide neckline falls off the shoulders somewhat, highlighting the decolletage. Fabric for the gown can be silk, brocade, velvet, etc, depending on your wishes. \r\n\r\nThe skirt is \"cartridge pleated\" to the bodice, an historically accurate technique. I include deep pockets in the side seams, so that you can easily hide your wallet/camera/other 21st century items at Faire. \r\n\r\nThe sleeves are based on historical portraits. They are straight, but roomy, and taper to a tight wrist.  The chemise can be pulled through slits in the top for a decorative effect. Your sleeves can be trimmed with lace, buttons, etc at the cuff. \r\n\r\nA linen chemise, also included with this dress, is decadently full and gathered to a band at the neck.
