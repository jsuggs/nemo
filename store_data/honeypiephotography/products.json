Newborns photograph best in their natural state so no need to provide anything other than your beautiful baby. \r\n\r\nFollowing the session you'll have access to a private online gallery to share with family & have access to all the gorgeous products available in this store. You newborn session also comes with a gogeous complimentary 9x6 print ~ which is chosen by you following the session.\r\n\r\nThe month you're expected to give birth is popped in my diary as a rough idea when your session will be held, as we all know babies have other ideas & if your baby is early or late thats absolutely fine, your due month is just a provisional date for us both. \r\n\r\nThe best time to contact me is before you have your little one, upon booking I’ll pop your due date in my diary. Once your baby arrives please email me full birth details, name & a photo of your baby, then I’ll contact you with the newborn session tips document & some available dates. \r\n\r\nAll of my newborn sessions are held within 14 days of baby’s birth (preferably within 5-10 days) therefore its super important to contact me after the birth. After 14 days it’s much harder to get those cute curled poses & baby is more susceptible to waking, baby acne & being colicky. If you’ve already given birth & have stumbled across this site please contact me & I’ll do my best to squeeze you into my schedule.\r\n\r\nI understand that just after giving birth the last thing you’d want is to do anything strenuous, the session is so super relaxed and everything is taken at baby’s pace, if your baby wants to stop for a cuddle break then we all stop & have a cup of tea! I’ve had many parents fall asleep during the session – it’s really that relaxed! \r\n\r\nWith my background in Midwifery, your baby is in very safe hands, I’m very confident handing newborns & their safety is more important to me than bagging THAT shot.\r\n\r\nSimply choose the month that your due & i'll pop you in my diary. I completely understand that little ones will arrive when theyre good & ready so selecting your due month is just so i can secure a session slot for you in my diary around your due date. the best time to book is after your 12 week USS as some months book up very quickly!\r\n\r\n\r\n...i'm looking forward to being your newborn photographer! \r\n\r\nTrina x","options":[{"id":49815912,"name":"December
