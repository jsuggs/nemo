I also give recipes for things we eat on winter holidays: like Plum Pudding for Christmas, Colcannon on Halloween, Galette des Rois on Epiphany.\r\n\r\n\"Just like with Home Made, I did everything in this very personal cookbook myself again: the design, the illustrations and I prepared all the dishes for photography.

How do you create an oven smoker from scratch in just  two minutes? How do you make ice cream without an ice cream machine? And how can you use your homemade cheese, smoked fish, ice cream and many other products in original recipes? In this cookbook Yvette explains all of this. In clear step-by-step stories illustrated instructions, you’re encouraged to learn and prepare new cooking techniques without needing to run to the store to buy expensive ingredients or complicated kitchen gadgets. After reading this book, you’ll be able to say that everything you cook is HOME MADE.\r\n\r\nThe book begins with breakfast and works its way through the day: how to bake your own bread in the morning and fix a healthy and original lunch after that, towards the afternoon: how to make your own brewed tea, bake cakes, the happy hour: how to make your own drinks, liqueur, how to make nibbles and bites, the evening: dinner, cheese, dessert, through the night: how to make mustard, ketchup and mayonnaise for those who need something to eat, after a night out at the pub. There are even recipes for doggy treats. The book ends with menus: assembled with the recipes, to combine to dinners or buffets for all occasions.\r\n\r\nHome made is all about making everything yourself, and so did Yvette van Boven to make this book: She made her own fonts, drew the illustrations, wrote all the recipes, prepared the food for the photographs  and designed the book. Her husband, photographer Oof Verschuren, took all the beautiful images.\r\n\r\nYvette van Boven (Ireland, 1968) divides her time between Amsterdam and Paris. She is a freelance food stylist and recipe writer and owns, together with her cousin, a restaurant and catering company in Amsterdam. She also illustrates books and magazines. Her work appears regularly in magazines such as Delicious., Elle Food, Flow, Margriet, newspapers and books.\r\n\r\nThrough December, books ship free from Egg & Dart - Happy Holidays from our home to yours!","options":[{"id":50558328,"name":"Default","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129359532/-/Screen_Shot_2013-12-13_at_5.53.04_PM.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129359532/-/Screen_Shot_2013-12-13_at_5.53.04_PM.png","width":400,"height":511},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129359547/-/photo_4_copy.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129359547/-/photo_4_copy.JPG","width":1600,"height":1600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129359550/-/photo_1.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129359550/-/photo_1.JPG","width":1546,"height":1546}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5226780,"name":"Gifts","permalink":"gifts","url":"/category/gifts"},{"id":6518034,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":15342567,"name":"Etta + Billie Lotion BUY NOW","permalink":"etta-billie-lotion","position":8,"price":28.0,"default_price":28.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/etta-billie-lotion","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-05T03:22:03.000Z","description":"Calming lavender soothes and protects.
