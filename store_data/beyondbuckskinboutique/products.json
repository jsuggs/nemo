To the Lakota, AK Wyan is the supernatural icon of Quillwork and rawhide painters. She is represented by the triangles that fold together to become a double helix. Adorned with Turquoise stone beads and Swavorski Crystals, these earrings bring contemporary chic to the traditional regal. Double-sided and ultra lightweight, they measure 5\" X 2.5\".\r\n\r\nThese earrings begin by soaking the hide till it becomes pliable and easier to cut. Once the shape of the earring is cut, it is flattened up to four days until the hide fully dries. The earring shapes are painted by hand and holes are drilled to add the finishing touches.

These beads are from the Alert Bay/ Fort Rupert area where there was a Hudson's Bay trading post that bought furs from the Kwakwakw'wakw people. These beads have an actual history of being traded in the fur trade. This item ships from Canada. \r\n\r\nOriginally Russian blues were made in Bohemia. They really don’t have a lot to do with Russia. They were actually shipped across Russia to China where they were faceted. The faceted blue beads were then shipped to Alaska and down the North American Coast and into the North American “Northwest”. They appeared in Alaska just prior to the 1870’s. They were popularly traded during the fur trade era. They are glass beads known for their numerous and irregular facets, and blue coloring; transparent and opaque. There were deviations in the number of facets and they were made in white, light blue, and black. The old ones are collectible. Today the new Russian blues, (glass faceted Russian cuts), are known for their beauty. They are made in the Czech Republic in a variety of sizes and colors in fine glass that the Czech Republic is known for.

The necklace measure 18 inches long and features Russian blue beads, Hudson Bay white hearts, China black beads and red seed beads. These beads are from the Alert Bay/ Fort Rupert area where there was a Hudson's Bay trading post that bought furs from the Kwakwakw'wakw people. These beads have an actual history of being traded in the fur trade. \r\n\r\nHudson bay white hearts were traded during the fur trade era. In the mid-1800’s they became known as Hudson Bay beads. They had two distinct colors of glass – one layered over the other. The outer layer was red and the inside layer was green, yellow, or white. The newer versions of the Hudson Bay beads are known as white hearts and have a white inner layer and a clear glass exterior from the range of the rainbow colors. Sizes and shapes vary. They are made today in France, Czech Republic, and India.\r\n\r\nOriginally Russian blues were made in Bohemia. They really don’t have a lot to do with Russia. They were actually shipped across Russia to China where they were faceted. The faceted blue beads were then shipped to Alaska and down the North American Coast and into the North American “Northwest”. They appeared in Alaska just prior to the 1870’s. They were popularly traded during the fur trade era. They are glass beads known for their numerous and irregular facets, and blue coloring; transparent and opaque. There were deviations in the number of facets and they were made in white, light blue, and black. The old ones are collectible. Today the new Russian blues, (glass faceted Russian cuts), are known for their beauty. They are made in the Czech Republic in a variety of sizes and colors in fine glass that the Czech Republic is known for.

Each of these designers present a unique style, informed and shaped by their relationships to their different tribes, communities, cultures and identities. This partnership allowed for this group of artists to share Native American historical legacies of creativity and tradition, while also blending the fun and colorful aesthetic that is Paul Frank.\r\n\r\nThe “Paul Frank Presents” fashion collection includes this tee by Navajo artist <a href=\"http://solo505.com/\">Dustin Martin</a>. The tee brings forth traditional geometric patterns while incorporating the playful energy of the Paul Frank company and color palette. \r\n\r\nAbout the design, Dustin explained, \"My contribution to the line was built on the concept ‘Point Lips, Not Fingers.’  When I was growing up, my grandfather taught me it was rude to point fingers (literally and figuratively).  So, like many Navajos who grow up on the rez, I learned that pointing my lips was a polite alternative to conventional hand gestures.  \r\n\r\n\"The design I cooked up uses a cultural quirk (lip-pointing) to embed meaning and humor into the image and remind viewers of what sparked the collaboration. Graphic silhouettes of a Dine man and woman are met by Julius (Paul Frank’s signature brand character) lost on a hike through Native America.  Their pointed lips show that the monkey’s childish curiosity has been met with patience and respect rather than gesticulating rudeness.  \r\n\r\n\"Elsewhere in the design you’ll see the Paul Frank brand surrounded by (and integrated into) familiar ‘Native’ geometry.  But these perfectly symmetrical shapes evolve into abstract fields of modern-looking angles.  These jarring shapes imply new directions -- for thoughts, for friendships, for artistic traditions, for brands.  Fresh trails can only be blazed with the help of patient and forward-thinking guides.  These guides point lips, not fingers.\"\r\n\r\nThe tees are part of a limited edition capsule collection, and are produced in small quantities. Available in white and grey crew neck tees. <a href=\"http://solo505.com/\">Click here to learn more about Dustin Martin on his artist website</a>.

The necklace measure 37 inches long and features 16 Dentalium Shell, 15 Russian blue beads, and 30 Hudson Bay white hearts. These beads are from the Alert Bay/ Fort Rupert area where there was a Hudson's Bay trading post that bought furs from the Kwakwakw'wakw people. These beads have an actual history of being traded in the fur trade. \r\n\r\nHudson bay white hearts were traded during the fur trade era. In the mid-1800’s they became known as Hudson Bay beads. They had two distinct colors of glass – one layered over the other. The outer layer was red and the inside layer was green, yellow, or white. The newer versions of the Hudson Bay beads are known as white hearts and have a white inner layer and a clear glass exterior from the range of the rainbow colors. Sizes and shapes vary. They are made today in France, Czech Republic, and India.\r\n\r\nOriginally Russian blues were made in Bohemia. They really don’t have a lot to do with Russia. They were actually shipped across Russia to China where they were faceted. The faceted blue beads were then shipped to Alaska and down the North American Coast and into the North American “Northwest”. They appeared in Alaska just prior to the 1870’s. They were popularly traded during the fur trade era. They are glass beads known for their numerous and irregular facets, and blue coloring; transparent and opaque. There were deviations in the number of facets and they were made in white, light blue, and black. The old ones are collectible. Today the new Russian blues, (glass faceted Russian cuts), are known for their beauty. They are made in the Czech Republic in a variety of sizes and colors in fine glass that the Czech Republic is known for.

These earrings measure 1\" x 1\" and feature ancient artifacts that date back to the 1800's. These beads are from the Alert Bay/ Fort Rupert area where there was a Hudson's Bay trading post that bought furs from the Kwakwakw'wakw people. These beads have an actual history of being traded in the fur trade. \r\n\r\nThe Hudson Bay white heart beads were traded during the fur trade era. In the mid-1800’s they became known as Hudson Bay beads. They had two distinct colors of glass – one layered over the other. The outer layer was red and the inside layer was green, yellow, or white. The newer versions of the Hudson Bay beads are known as white hearts and have a white inner layer and a clear glass exterior from the range of the rainbow colors. Sizes and shapes vary. They are made today in France, Czech Republic, and India. The China black beads never became very popular as there were too many of them. Nonetheless, they were used in beadwork.

This partnership allowed for this group of artists to share Native American historical legacies of creativity and tradition, while also blending the fun and colorful aesthetic that is Paul Frank.\r\n\r\nThe “Paul Frank Presents” fashion collection includes this jewelry set by Taos Pueblo and Comanche artist <a href=\"http://thesoftmuseum.com/\">Autumn Dawn Gomez</a>. She explained, “Seeing that Julius has experienced so many different kinds of lives and been all around the world many times, I tried to capture his most beautiful memories of nature and beyond. I wanted to capture what he saw on his adventures, including what is represented in this collection: a California Beach at sunset.\"\r\n\r\nThe collections feature the silhouette head of Julius the monkey in a Hama bead crown, necklace, and cuff, and give a nod to traditional concepts about the environment and beadwork while incorporating the playful energy of the Paul Frank company and color palette. The items are part of a limited edition capsule collection, and are hand-produced in small quantities by the artist. <a href=\"http://thesoftmuseum.com/\">Click here to learn more </a>about Autumn and to shop directly from the artist. <a href=\"http://shop.beyondbuckskin.com/artist/autumn-dawn-gomez-comanche-taos-for-the-soft-museum\">Click here to shop </a>other great styles on BBB from Autumn and The Soft Museum!","options":[{"id":41083569,"name":"Cuff","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":41163009,"name":"Necklace","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":41163015,"name":"Cuff & Necklace","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":41163012,"name":"Crown","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46014513,"name":"2 Cuffs","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127417845/-/1425565_622406577800958_1097185337_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127417845/-/1425565_622406577800958_1097185337_n.jpg","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124052058/-/SEASIDE_SUNSET_ed.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124052058/-/SEASIDE_SUNSET_ed.jpg","width":2335,"height":2335},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124052052/-/SEASIDE_SUNSET_CUFF.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124052052/-/SEASIDE_SUNSET_CUFF.jpg","width":2700,"height":2700},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122653164/-/Autumn_sea.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122653164/-/Autumn_sea.jpg","width":2700,"height":2700},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122680332/-/PF_Seaside.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122680332/-/PF_Seaside.JPG","width":420,"height":420}],"artists":[{"id":140591,"name":"Autumn Dawn Gomez (Comanche / Taos) for The Soft Museum","permalink":"autumn-dawn-gomez-comanche-taos-for-the-soft-museum","url":"/artist/autumn-dawn-gomez-comanche-taos-for-the-soft-museum"}],"categories":[{"id":3050015,"name":"Street Style","permalink":"street-style","url":"/category/street-style"},{"id":3050017,"name":"Accessories","permalink":"accessories","url":"/category/accessories"},{"id":5954556,"name":"Paul Frank x Native Designers","permalink":"paul-frank-x-native-designers","url":"/category/paul-frank-x-native-designers"},{"id":5924439,"name":"Sale","permalink":"sale","url":"/category/sale"}]},{"id":11222478,"name":"Decolonize Box Logo Hoodie","permalink":"decolonize-box-logo-hoodie","position":227,"price":70.0,"default_price":70.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/decolonize-box-logo-hoodie","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-17T22:58:15.000Z","description":"This limited edition hoodie was designed by Jarrett Martineau (Cree/Dene) and features an embroidered red and white \"Decolonize\" box logo on a 100% Cotton hooded sweatshirt.

Bird, (Navajo/Hopi/Santa Clara Pueblo) the owner of Mea B'fly Designs. The earrings come in three options: Small Dangle (1.25\" circles), Medium (2\" circles) and Large (2.5\" circles). The name of her small business is a combination of Mea, a childhood nickname short for MaRia, and B'fly, short for butterfly \"in honor of my late great grandmother and giver of all that is special and cherished by me - family and self.\"\r\n\r\nEach graphic print is made by Bird, starting with a focal background image that she elaborates with other design elements.

The result suggests neon video game backgrounds from the early ‘90s paired with the bold geometry of Southern Plains beadwork.\"\r\n\r\nThe items are part of a limited edition capsule collection, and are hand-produced in small quantities by the artist. <a href=\"http://thesoftmuseum.com/\">Click here to learn more </a>about Autumn and to shop directly from the artist. <a href=\"http://shop.beyondbuckskin.com/artist/autumn-dawn-gomez-comanche-taos-for-the-soft-museum\">Click here to shop </a>other great styles on BBB from Autumn and The Soft Museum!","options":[{"id":41163189,"name":"Cuff","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":41163192,"name":"Necklace","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":41163195,"name":"Cuff & Necklace","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46014546,"name":"2 Cuffs","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124052316/-/MORNING_MEADOW_ed.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124052316/-/MORNING_MEADOW_ed.jpg","width":2392,"height":2392},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124051764/-/MORNING_MEADOW_CUFF_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124051764/-/MORNING_MEADOW_CUFF_2.jpg","width":2520,"height":2520},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122654052/-/Autumn_mountain.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122654052/-/Autumn_mountain.jpg","width":3000,"height":3000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124051698/-/MORNING_MEADOW_CUFF_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124051698/-/MORNING_MEADOW_CUFF_1.jpg","width":2952,"height":2952},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122638917/-/Hangtag_6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122638917/-/Hangtag_6.jpg","width":2700,"height":2700}],"artists":[{"id":140591,"name":"Autumn Dawn Gomez (Comanche / Taos) for The Soft Museum","permalink":"autumn-dawn-gomez-comanche-taos-for-the-soft-museum","url":"/artist/autumn-dawn-gomez-comanche-taos-for-the-soft-museum"}],"categories":[{"id":3050015,"name":"Street Style","permalink":"street-style","url":"/category/street-style"},{"id":3050017,"name":"Accessories","permalink":"accessories","url":"/category/accessories"},{"id":5954556,"name":"Paul Frank x Native Designers","permalink":"paul-frank-x-native-designers","url":"/category/paul-frank-x-native-designers"},{"id":5924439,"name":"Sale","permalink":"sale","url":"/category/sale"}]},{"id":8420688,"name":"The Arrival","permalink":"the-arrival","position":260,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-arrival","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-07T08:23:43.000Z","description":"These earrings come from the creative hands of MaRia A.

It features red cedar bark that has been finely woven into a bracelet. It is accented with a unique abalone shell and measures 8\" x 1\".\r\n\r\nO’Brien weaves baskets, hats and jewelry with red and yellow cedar bark using twining and plaiting forms of weaving. Cedar bark weaving has been part of the culture of the peoples of the Northwest Coast for thousands of years; it was and continues to be an integral part of the culture.

At least one hataathli (Navajo religious singer) told white scholars in the late 1800’s that “people who cut their hair square in the front” taught these travelers how to assemble a raft anointed enough to get them across safely. The vessel was constructed from a bough of each of the four trees represented on the shirt (Top Right Clockwise: Juniper, Ponderosa Pine, Gambel Oak, Piñon Pine). Eventually, their brave journey across the river set motion to these “whirling logs”.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, a wheel of right angles is used to depict this important vehicle to Navajo history. Unfortunately, the Nazi party adopted an uncannily similar image as the badge of their war machine in the 1930’s. This design attempts to reclaim the symbol through revision and abstraction. More importantly, however, it is a means for reinvigorating the oral history that inspired the image in the first place.     \r\n\r\nDetails: White/Black Tee made with 100% combed cotton.

Regularly priced $50. Limited quantities. </b>\r\n\r\nThis exciting collection presents a collaboration between <a href=\"http://paulfrank.com/\">Paul Frank</a> and four Native American designers. Each of these designers present a unique style, informed and shaped by their relationships to their different tribes, communities, cultures and identities. This partnership allowed for this group of artists to share Native American historical legacies of creativity and tradition, while also blending the fun and colorful aesthetic that is Paul Frank.\r\n\r\nThe “Paul Frank Presents” fashion collection includes these jewelry sets by Taos Pueblo and Comanche artist <a href=\"http://thesoftmuseum.com/\">Autumn Dawn Gomez</a>. She explained, \"For this project, I created Hama Bead jewelry using a bold and neon palette combined with strong elements of geometry to create 5 different nature scenes - each captured in the silhouette of Paul Frank’s mascot, Julius. Each design is based on a landscape that I feel close to.  I know that basing my concept on nature may sound cliché, but when done in classic Soft Museum style, it becomes very vivid and almost ultra modern.  The result suggests neon video game backgrounds from the early ‘90s paired with the bold geometry of Southern Plains beadwork.\"\r\n\r\nThe collections feature the silhouette head of Julius the monkey in a Hama bead crown, necklace, and cuff, and bring forth traditional concepts about the environment and beadwork while incorporating the playful energy of the Paul Frank company and color palette. The items are part of a limited edition capsule collection, and are hand-produced in small quantities by the artist. <a href=\"http://thesoftmuseum.com/\">Click here to learn more </a>about Autumn and to shop directly from the artist. <a href=\"http://shop.beyondbuckskin.com/artist/autumn-dawn-gomez-comanche-taos-for-the-soft-museum\">Click here to shop </a>other great styles on BBB from Autumn and The Soft Museum!","options":[{"id":41163087,"name":"Cuff","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":41163090,"name":"Necklace","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":41163093,"name":"Cuff & Necklace","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":41163096,"name":"Crown","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46014576,"name":"2 Cuffs","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126403380/-/NORTHERN_AURORA_ed_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126403380/-/NORTHERN_AURORA_ed_2.jpg","width":2190,"height":2190},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122680314/-/NNorthern_Aurora_Crown.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122680314/-/NNorthern_Aurora_Crown.JPG","width":414,"height":414},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122654064/-/Autumn_Sunrise.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122654064/-/Autumn_Sunrise.jpg","width":3000,"height":3000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124052133/-/NORTHERN_AURORA_CUFF.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124052133/-/NORTHERN_AURORA_CUFF.jpg","width":3924,"height":3924},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122680287/-/Hangtag_6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122680287/-/Hangtag_6.jpg","width":2340,"height":2346}],"artists":[{"id":140591,"name":"Autumn Dawn Gomez (Comanche / Taos) for The Soft Museum","permalink":"autumn-dawn-gomez-comanche-taos-for-the-soft-museum","url":"/artist/autumn-dawn-gomez-comanche-taos-for-the-soft-museum"}],"categories":[{"id":3050015,"name":"Street Style","permalink":"street-style","url":"/category/street-style"},{"id":3050017,"name":"Accessories","permalink":"accessories","url":"/category/accessories"},{"id":5954556,"name":"Paul Frank x Native Designers","permalink":"paul-frank-x-native-designers","url":"/category/paul-frank-x-native-designers"},{"id":5924439,"name":"Sale","permalink":"sale","url":"/category/sale"}]},{"id":12914550,"name":"Beyond Buckskin Candy Colors Gift Set","permalink":"beyond-buckskin-navajo-candy-gift-set","position":284,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/beyond-buckskin-navajo-candy-gift-set","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-08-12T04:23:21.000Z","description":"Treat yourself or someone special to a gift set from Beyond Buckskin, featuring our popular 8-Bit Feather Fantasy Earrings by <a href=\"http://shop.beyondbuckskin.com/artist/autumn-dawn-comanche-taos-for-the-soft-museum\">The Soft Museum</a>, Diné Bizaad (Navajo Language) Bandana by <a href=\"http://shop.beyondbuckskin.com/artist/david-sloan-navajo\">David Sloan</a>, and our <a href=\"http://shop.beyondbuckskin.com/product/beyond-buckskin-lookbook\">Lookbook</a>, all wrapped up in a cute black BBB mini-tote. $55 value.

This item ships from Canada.\r\n\r\nO’Brien weaves baskets, hats and jewelry with red and yellow cedar bark using twining and plaiting forms of weaving. Cedar bark weaving has been part of the culture of the peoples of the Northwest Coast for thousands of years; it was and continues to be an integral part of the culture. The process is deeply spiritual: beginning with an offering of tobacco to give thanks to the tree for its offering, O’Brien then strips, soaks, and prepares the bark to be woven. It is a way to carry on the traditional ways of her ancestors, and share this medicine with the world. The pricing of her art is based on the amount of time spent harvesting the bark, preparation and weaving time, finish and type of weave.","options":[{"id":34184361,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/106979397/-/AO_-_Small_Diamonds_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/106979397/-/AO_-_Small_Diamonds_2.jpg","width":670,"height":670},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/106979409/-/AO_-_Small_Diamonds_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/106979409/-/AO_-_Small_Diamonds_1.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":198366,"name":"Nalaga O’Brien (Haida / Kwakwakw’wakw)","permalink":"nalaga-obrien-haida-kwakwakwwakw","url":"/artist/nalaga-obrien-haida-kwakwakwwakw"}],"categories":[{"id":3050015,"name":"Street Style","permalink":"street-style","url":"/category/street-style"}]},{"id":6116881,"name":"VO Signature Handbag (Brown)","permalink":"vo-signature-handbag-brown","position":288,"price":2000.0,"default_price":2000.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/vo-signature-handbag-brown","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-05-06T04:20:01.000Z","description":"The chic VO Signature Handbag was designed by Virgil Ortiz and bears his signature marks: the Water, Sun, and Wild Spinach designs are just some of the unique and symbolic elements that create the high demand for Ortiz's pieces.\r\n\r\nHeavily sought out by celebrities, royalty, rock stars, and collectors alike, supernova American Indian artist and fashion designer Virgil Ortiz is taking Native fashion to the next level.
