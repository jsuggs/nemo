In terms of ceramics this is a relatively low temperature. Were the bowl to be fired to a higher temperature the burnish would be lost. After firing, the bowl is smoked in order to create the black colour.

These works are the result of my physical interaction with shapeless lumps of clay and a wood-fired kiln. Additionally, there have been many subtle influences in my life, which have carried over into my work and may, at first looking, not be too obvious. There have been many friends and many meetings. There has been a total commitment to this work. There has been, and is, much spirit and soul. There are many stories and memories. And, as an underlying strength of all this, there is the love for the simple act of using my hands to make something beautiful.\r\n\r\nPetrus Spronk\r\nAugust 2010\r\n","options":[{"id":9944420,"name":"200mmwidth/135mmheight","price":2000.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27590365/-/cat_no_23.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27590365/-/cat_no_23.jpg","width":1000,"height":670}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
