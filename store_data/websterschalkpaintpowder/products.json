Our supplier in the US keeps us stocked so we never run out! We are offering it here because it finishes with chalk paint so beautifully! We have four favorite colors, Clear (no color at all) Light (almost clear), Rugger Brown (antique) and Jacobean(almost black). You can achieve a time worn distressed look using Fiddes wax.
