Revive them with this salt and oil based scrub. \r\n\r\nThis is no ladies spa day product - you won't find any lavender or whale-songs music here. Good ol' epsom salts provide exfoliation, along with a relaxing soak. The oils in this scrub start with arnica-infused olive oil, to which we add sweet almond oil, shea butter, and coconut oil. Arnica has a long history of use to help soothe muscles and reduce inflammation, while this combination of oils moisturize and soften skin. Also includes carnauba wax as a thickener, and vitamin E as an antioxidant.\r\n\r\nTo use, first wet your skin. With a dry hand scoop out some scrub and rub it on your skin in a circular motion. Let the scrub sit for a couple minutes, then soak or rinse off in warm water. Polysorbate, an emulsifier, is included as an ingredient to help rinse the excess oils from your skin, so you will feel soft but not slimy.\r\n\r\nFoot and Body Scrub is scented with cinnamon and cedar essential oils, which are both masculine scents and beneficial for removing funky smells from your skin. \r\n\r\nNot just for feet, you can also use Foot and Body Scrub all over to help exfoliate, moisturize, remove unpleasant odors, and soothe sore muscles.\r\n\r\n4 oz of scrub will come packaged in an attractive amber PET jar.
