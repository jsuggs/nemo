Keep the earth happy, make your trip to the farmer’s market or the movies easy, and look good without flashing all of the greater city area.\r\n\r\nA skirt garter is an elastic band that fits around your leg and clips to your skirt to keep it from flying up. The band has a silicon backing to keep it in place, and the clip is metal with plastic teeth to protect any delicate fabric of your skirt or dress.\r\n\r\nNo longer will you live in fear of a strong gust of wind, have to wear bulky shorts under your skirt, or tote around a change of clothes. All you need is one little garter (two if you’re extra modest).\r\n\r\nTo determine your size, measure around your thigh about 3 inches above your knee. 15” and under = small. 15”–17” = medium. 17” and over = large. If you’re on the border, we suggest sizing down – they stretch, after all. All garters (except black) are hand-dyed so color may vary slightly from what you see on your screen.  Elastic width is 5/8\", except for black which is 7/8\".\r\n\r\nPurchase is for single garter.
