Price is per ball.\r\n\r\nfun fact: washing not only cleans these little gems, it helps to re-felt the wool.

He deserves a shot of wheatgrass just as much as the next guy so I made this planter for him.

Each kit includes a packet of seeds sufficient for two plantings. Seeds germinate in 3-5 days and each planting lasts up to 4-6  weeks, with attention.
