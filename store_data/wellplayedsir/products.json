They are made by \"Planet Earth\" and are a size MEDIUM. They are insulated snow pants. They have cargo pockets, and zippers on the bottom for your boots. They also have a few zippers for storing things. These pants are great. Only wore them one time. They are VERY similar to the \"outpost\" style Planet Earth currently sells but they are not identical, as they have been sitting in the garage for a few seasons. They are called the Planet Earth \"Drop\" Pant..They are in NEW condition, minus the tags.
