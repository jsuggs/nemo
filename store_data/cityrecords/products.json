It's enough to make anyone depressed. The LP trails off in melodic dischord, with topics ranging from longing, boredom, aliens and skating. The jangling guitars and heavy bass chip away at the listeners ability to truly validate himself as a human being and, in doing so, create an atmosphere that's conducive to long bouts of depression and anxiety. Don't go jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge just yet though. The packaging of the LP is enough to lift anyone's spirits. Housed in a four color screen printed jacket this LP screams class thanks to our friends at Tankcrimes and Monolith press. I've heard that they've been compared to bands like Double O, Husker Du and Rites of Spring but I just don't see it.","options":[{"id":6706241,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/17691191/-/Face_The_Rail_Cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/17691191/-/Face_The_Rail_Cover.jpg","width":400,"height":400}],"artists":[{"id":32271,"name":"Face The Rail","permalink":"face-the-rail","url":"/artist/face-the-rail"}],"categories":[{"id":1141471,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":1848951,"name":"Yadokai 'Sterile Environment' Cassette","permalink":"yadokai-sterile-environment-cassette","position":2,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/yadokai-sterile-environment-cassette","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-03-06T05:44:50.000Z","description":"This cassette oozes anger, rage and retribution in the only way a band from San Francisco can.

The wait's finally over. For all you dudes and dudettes who didn't get the tape, or ordered the tape but was jipped out of your US coin, City Records has this ultimate piece of noise rock available for mass consumption on quality vinyl. Make any comparisons you want but I just can't put my finger on what the hell Ecoli/Migraine were trying to do... Maybe make your ears bleed. At points you wonder if the guys making this record were on mescaline but most of the time the tunes are so in your face that the listener can't help but gnash teeth, fidget in their chair and wonder if their parents were right, if their life really is going no where (\"Fuck you mom. Fuck you dad.\"). This record is devoid of any punk cliches (hating cops/reality/puberty/chicks) and is self actualizing. Kind of like Baudrillard or Eco. The record becomes human and you become nothing. Hate your family. Hate your friends. Listen to this record. Your a product of the simulacra.","options":[{"id":9190194,"name":"Default","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/24978119/-/front.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/24978119/-/front.jpg","width":615,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":43701,"name":"Snuff Film","permalink":"snuff-film","url":"/artist/snuff-film"}],"categories":[{"id":1141471,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]}]
