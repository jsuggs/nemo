The Star of David (in Hebrew Magen David- literally ‘shield of David’) poetically refers to God. This six sided figure symbolizes that God rules over the universe and protects us from all six directions: North, South, East, West, Up and Down with the middle of the hexagram providing the spiritual dimension.\r\n\r\nThe tree of life is mentioned in the Book of Genesis and it is distinct from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; it is associated with immorality or eternity. And the LORD God said, “The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.” After Adam and Eve fell from God's favor by eating fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they were cast out of the Garden of Eden. Remaining in the garden, however, was the tree of life. To prevent access to this tree in the future, a cherubim and a flaming sword was placed at the garden's entrance. (Genesis 3:22-24)\r\n\r\nIn the Book of Proverbs, the tree of life is associated with wisdom: \"[Wisdom] tree of life to those who take hold of her; those who hold her fast will be blessed.\" (Proverbs 3:13-18).  The tree of life is symbolic of long life, connection, strength, eternity and wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe charm is approximately 1” round and hangs on a 17\" bronze baby ball chain that closes with a ball chain connector clasp.
