So do we. It's a shame to constrain them to the puny confines of a CD sleeve. You have two to choose from.\r\n\r\nThe artwork for \"The Haunted Planet\" was created by illustrator <a href=\"http://joshuaellingson.com/\">Josh Ellingson</a>. It's super awesome, and looks so, so good sized up to 11x17. Full-color on quality 14 pt. gloss cover paper.\r\n\r\nFor our \"No Way Out\" poster, we went with a 13pt matte cover stock that has the same rough feel as the CD. What you don't get on the CD, though, is all the awesome detail in <a href=\"http://www.pklick.com/\">Peter Kim</a>'s original photo. Sized at 12.25x17.25, you can start to appreciate that <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/thecherrydollface\">Cherry Dollface</a>'s right arm is really Betty Page, or the spots on the floor that look like a body has been dragged away. This poster includes a white space below used for writing in show dates.\r\n\r\nThese are great posters and they ship rolled in a sturdy cardboard tube. The shipping is kinda pricey compared to our other items, but tubes ain't cheap. Also, because they ship in a tube, we really can't combine shipping with other items.","options":[{"id":30468761,"name":"The Haunted Planet","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":11825938,"name":"No Way Out","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30859858,"name":"Both Posters!","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95983713/-/photo_3_.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95983713/-/photo_3_.JPG","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1784229,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":3429756,"name":"No Way Out (CD)","permalink":"cd-no-way-out","position":5,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cd-no-way-out","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-03-15T07:51:20.000Z","description":"Here's our CD.
