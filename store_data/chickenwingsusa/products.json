The Swamp that Ding calls home features two good runways, an Air Traffic Controller, a Flying School and a host of other assorted wildlife including all the other Ducks who get to do what Ding is hoping to do himself one day.. Fly South for the Winter with all the other Ducks.\r\n\r\nAs you follow Ding’s daily life cycle of flying attempts, failures, flying lessons, theory classes, exams and everything else that goes on in this feathered parallel world to the other less natural, mechanical form of aviation you will discover a wonderful truth: There is little difference between these two worlds and there is much humor to be enjoyed in both.\r\n\r\nThis book is dedicated to everyone who has ever wanted to fly.\r\n","options":[{"id":26171538,"name":"Default","price":18.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81720405/-/cover-ding.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81720405/-/cover-ding.jpg","width":417,"height":602},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81720465/-/iwanttofly-page012.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81720465/-/iwanttofly-page012.jpg","width":696,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81720501/-/iwanttofly-page015.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81720501/-/iwanttofly-page015.jpg","width":704,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81720537/-/iwanttofly-page124.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81720537/-/iwanttofly-page124.jpg","width":693,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81720561/-/iwanttofly-back.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81720561/-/iwanttofly-back.jpg","width":393,"height":570}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2607873,"name":"Aviation Comics & Cartoons","permalink":"aviation-comics-cartoons","url":"/category/aviation-comics-cartoons"}]},{"id":9667077,"name":"Aviation Humor","permalink":"aviation-humor","position":11,"price":12.95,"default_price":12.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/aviation-humor","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-28T17:27:13.000Z","description":"Surely you have seen a few of the aviation jokes that have been circling around the internet for years.

We have taken him in and made him a Chicken Wings character for many reasons but one sticks out: He is really funny !!\r\n\r\nHis book is really a good gift for anybody you know who loves to read. It's a compilation of tales and funny stories that are very, very loosely connected. This alone also makes it perfect for a pilot like Chuck who can’t follow a storyline through the whole book. But you don’t have to be a pilot to enjoy this book. It’s a lighthearted outlook on life through the eyes of an aviator. We would even go a step further and claim him to be sort of a “modern Saint Exupery” we like the book so much. It is also extremely well written and a real pleasure to read.

Virtually every aviation magazine has written about the book. The mainstream media has covered it as well. The book's companion website clocks over 450,000 site visits per month. (That's even more hits than we get with Chicken Wings, just to put it in perspective!) Each week it receives 50 to 10 updates (PIREPs) from the pilot readers. These PIREPs affect over 80% of the sites reported on in the book. Since the original reports from 1998 aren't accurate anymore, John Purner just recently came out with this Third Edition which features over 80% new content - new restaurants, new airports, and completely updated reports on both from pilots all over the US, Canada, and the UK.\r\n\r\nThe name \"100$ Hamburger\" may need revision as Nobu the chicken stated in one of our recent strips, but the guide and the destination all got revised very recently.

And it’s always a very good idea to learn from other pilots experiences. In my aviation career I have learned as much from books and stories about flying as I did during my commercial training if not more. On several occasions, a story I remembered reading or some one telling has gotten me out of a sticky situation. This DVD is a perfect example for: Learning from the Masters.\r\n \r\nAviation masters, Bob Hoover and Wayne Handley, share the wisdom gained from more than 50,000 (!) hours of combined flying experience, often in extreme conditions. Each of them share how they survived near-impossible-to-escape inflight emergencies by applying simple safety principles. \r\nTotal Run time: 92 minutes.\r\n \r\n“Needless to say, it’s thoroughly enjoyable. More importantly, it serves a great purpose. There are some valuable lessons to be learned from Hoover and Handley. They’re been there; they are masters, so they know of what they speak. Everyone who flies an airplane can benefit from this DVD, although I fervently hope that no one has need to apply the lessons learned.”\r\nCapt.
