The detail and character is even better in person!\r\n\r\n-12 blocks, each approx 5.5 x 5.5 inches\r\n-Rich, abstract blends of poetic color\r\n-Rich thick high gloss finish\r\n-Comes ready to hang and enjoy!\r\n\r\nThis artwork would be beautiful in a home or office. They come ready to hang for easy installation and can be hung in any order or configuration you prefer. \r\n\r\nThe \"Poetic Blocks\" are conceptualized and handmade by me. First, I cut each block of wood and sand. I try to use repurposed or upcycled wood whenever possible.\r\nThen I paint each box seperately a rich blend of layers of acrylic paints. No two are alike.\r\nThis collection has an outstanding shine and gloss. I finish each block, using my own technique, with thick high gloss lacquer glaze. The end result is a spectacular finish or color, richness and shine ----just beautiful!\r\n\r\nThe photos just do not do the detail justice.\r\n\r\nThis listing is for a beautiful original custom sculpture collection of 12 pieces in the color scheme shown. Since all of my work is handmade no two collections or blocks are ever exactly the same. The ultimate product is unique, organic, and truly one of a kind! Your blocks each will look very closely similar to the ones shown with the same colors and tone. However. of you prefer that I make color adjustment to include, exclude or emphasize certain colors just let me know and I would be happy to accomodate you. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, feel free to contact me. \r\n\r\nCUSTOM ORDERS: Want a different color scheme? or different number of blocks? or size of blocks? no problem - I can work with you to create the collection that is right for you.

I attach the circles each to a small block of wood painted black. I drill holes in the back of each block for easy display by simply hanging each one on a small simple nail. The block gives the circles incredible depth and dimension, giving the effect that circles are almost free floating, suspended from the wall. It's a beautiful and fascinating effect. \r\n\r\nThe detail is so much greater in person. Spectacular color and character that photos just can't do justice.\r\n\r\nThe 28 Circles can be hung in any pattern or order you prefer. \r\n\r\nThis listing is made to order. I am happy to accomodate any color preferences you have in mind or can make suggestions based on pics of your space or other inspirations items you like.

I attach the circles each to a small block of wood painted black. The block gives the circles incredible depth and dimension, and also gives the effect of the circles being suspended from the wall. It's a beautiful combination.\r\n\r\nThe detail is just lovely and the workmanship is gallery quality.

Movement of lines across the piece give interest and depth.\r\n\r\nThen a free-hand pattern was created, covering and creating my trees. I use my own unique technique of glazing the piece in high gloss lacquer allowing the background lines to show through the glossy black, adding great depth and interest. The pattern of flowing trees is 'revealed.' The whole piece is covered in a high gloss lacquer for tremendous shine. The final step adds depth and texture to the piece when I outline the trees in a clear raised textural paint.

No two are alike.\r\n\r\nColor Blocks No1  is a dramatic and vibrant artistic statement that is a one of a kind work! \r\n\r\nEach wood block is first hand-cut (by me) and sanded. After the blocks are cut and prepared, I hand paint each block with a beautiful, rich blend of colors going from dark to light variations of Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue. Then I use my own special technique for creating a thick high gloss lacquer coating---making a remarkable and unique finished product.\r\n\r\nSpectacular vibrance ---the photos just can't capture the beauty of the variety of color.\r\n\r\nThe blocks are:\r\nDark Crimson Red to light red\r\nOrange/Red to Yellow/Orange\r\nMarigold to Light Yellow\r\nPurple to Dark Blue\r\nRoyal Blue to Aqua\r\nAqua to Sky Blue\r\n\r\nThe blocks can be arranged in any order you prefer.\r\n\r\nYou could display them from dark to light (as seen in photo) or mix it up for a fun and cheerful color combination (as seen in other photo).\r\n\r\nThe blocks are EASY to hang ----AND to change!\r\nEach block has a strip of magnet attached to the back. I will send you matching strips of magnet with adhesive backing to attach to the wall. This allows for easy installation AND flexibility. You can easily play around with the colors - you could even regularly change the display for a constantly changing and fantastic work of art.\r\n\r\n'Color Block No1' is really an amazing and unique sculptural artwork for your home or office. \r\n\r\n-28 blocks, each 2.5\"x2.5\"\r\n-can be hung close together or far apart\r\n-can be hung in any order or pattern\r\n-can easily be installed AND changed\r\n-Vibrant, rich color\r\n-Thick high gloss finish\r\n-Comes with easy installation magnets (and instructions)\r\n-Each block is numbered on the back so if you want to display it dark to light or vice versa, its already numbered in order for you. \r\n-All of my artwork is signed and dated and comes with a Certificate of Authenticity.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, feel free to contact me. \r\n\r\nI can also work with you to complete a CUSTOM work specially for you with your preferences for colors, size, shape, etc. Really the color spectrum and size of the blocks is unlimited. \r\n\r\nThanks so much!\r\nRosemary","options":[{"id":753274,"name":"Original Artwork - Color Scheme As Shown","price":240.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":753288,"name":"Custom Color Scheme - Your Preference/Choice","price":240.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":22.0,"amount_with_others":22.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":30.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":38.0,"amount_with_others":38.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1060788/-/Color_Block_No1_multicolor_over_sofa.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1060788/-/Color_Block_No1_multicolor_over_sofa.jpg","width":1000,"height":949},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1060792/-/Color_Block_No1_darktolight.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1060792/-/Color_Block_No1_darktolight.JPG","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1060800/-/Color_Block_No1_multiorder.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1060800/-/Color_Block_No1_multiorder.JPG","width":1000,"height":664}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":156562,"name":"Original Wall Sculptures","permalink":"original-wall-sculptures","url":"/category/original-wall-sculptures"},{"id":1543678,"name":"Original Art Block Collections","permalink":"original-art-block-collections","url":"/category/original-art-block-collections"}]}]
