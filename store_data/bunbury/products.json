Lovecraft.\r\n\r\nOriginally produced for the Bottleneck Gallery NYC, for the “Can’t Beat Em, Join Em: The Zombie Show”, the piece depicts the fictional \"Miskatonic University\".\r\n\r\nMuch of Lovecraft’s work has featured this fictional University, and I took inspiration from the original story – here Miskatonic is presented as an old, prestigious school, and combined it with a key moment in the 1985 film (which never actually happens on camera), when the villainous \"Dr Carl Hill\" returns to Miskatonic with the intention of creating zombies from the University morgue. It is the imagining of this scene which created the basis for the illustration. \r\n\r\nOne for horror enthusiasts, and Lovecraft fans alike!\r\n\r\n\"Miskatonic\" is a 4 colour hand-pulled screenprint from Bmarket, on 315gsm heritage white paper.
