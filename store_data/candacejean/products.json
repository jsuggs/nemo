They can grow to 6.5 feet long, are equipped with rear fangs and mild venom. They are slow-moving, active in both the daytime and at night, feeding mainly on young birds and lizards. If threatened, vine snakes will puff up the front of their bodies, in turn revealing vivid coloration usually hidden under scales, and they open their mouths wide. They lie amid the branches of forest trees; proportions and coloration making them almost indistinguishable from creepers and vines.
