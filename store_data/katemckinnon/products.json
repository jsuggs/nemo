How could we not? Volume I, as spectacular as it is, is just the beginning of our explorations. \r\n\r\nPre-orders are only meant for people who know they want the book no matter when it comes out, and want to support the process and receive advance patterns. We can't say whether we will deliver for Christmas or Easter, but we can promise you another beautiful volume full of original work. Yours included, if you bead with us!\r\n\r\nWe hope you'll stay in touch with us online- we'll share our process, new ideas, we'll give you peeks and drawings to keep you beading, and invite you to advance-bead our new patterns. And of course, just as in Vol. 1, we'll be photographing the most exciting pieces for the book.

I'm not carying these books in my studio at this time, but you can pick them up at your local bookstore, or through online sites such as Powells or Amazon.com.\r\n\r\nExcerpts of some of the outstanding reviews:\r\n\r\nThe Jewelry Architect:\r\n\r\n\"McKinnon presents an intriguing, highly professional way to create beaded jewelry that doesn't resemble loving hands at home. 'I'm a maker of components, an engineer of connections,' McKinnon says, and throughout the 15 projects and seven structural elements (e.g., clasps, ear wires, ring findings) she discusses, it's clear that the engineering conceit fuels her work. Curiously, much of the volume's presentation centers on beading, a craft she learned as a child. Yet her incorporation of best-possible materials, whether a slew of Victorian buttons or already fashioned felt cupcakes, distinguishes each design.... So, if today is Tuesday, do we opt to fashion and wear a dramatic mechanical chain, the whimsical Puck's bracelet, or the extraordinarily intricate corset-stitch cuff? Many top-notch choices.\" - Barbara Jacobs, Booklist *Starred Review*\r\n\r\n“Let Kate be one of your teachers. Get the book, read it carefully, and watch the DVD over and over until it is imbedded into your brain. I learned something about myself and my own creative philosophies by reflecting on hers. I wish the same for you”. - Bsueboutiques.typepad.com\r\n\r\n\"My favorite jewelry-making book of all time.\" - Tammy Jones, JewelryMakingDaily.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSculptural Metal Clay:\r\n\r\n\"Insightful tips and instructions for unique designs that inspire jewelry makers to create outside the box.\" — Detroit News\r\n\r\n\"Kate McKinnon is a master of form and a delight to read. Her new book...even comes with a DVD so that you can have Kate guide you...as if she were right there with you.\" — Beading-Arts.com\r\n\r\n\"In the 60 minute DVD, she comes off relaxed and professional on screen and easily demonstrates that she not only knows her stuff when it comes to metal clay and metalsmithing, but she also knows how to teach, something you don't always find with artists.\" – Tammy Powley, editor, About.com Guide to Jewelry Making\r\n\r\n\"Kate McKinnon’s fine silver metal clay pieces are stunning and wonderfully architectural in design. This book will not disappoint!\" – Bead Unique\r\n\r\n\"As a teacher, Kate McKinnon is nonpareil. The book is perfectly beautiful in its presentation, with excellent clear and informative photographs, whether of the tools you will require or of the projects offered. The DVD reinforces aspects of the book which you may have missed.\" – Australian Beading Magazine\r\n\r\n\"Kate is, quite possibly, the best jewelry engineer I have ever met. Her work is not only structurally sound, built to last and comfortable, but it has just that right edgy *snap* to make it truly artful.\" - Jean Campbell, former editor, Beadwork magazine\r\n\r\n\"There is something to be said for an artist who focuses entirely on one medium with a relentless specificity.
