We walked one day, all day, through the city of Phnom Penh, along the riverbanks where the Mekong meets the Tonle Sap, where the waters in the dry season moved by slow, early morning mist and dusty streets, into the deep pinks of lotus buds and red and gold incense sticks at the temples, fading French-Indochine-era tiles inside bright yellow-painted buildings, markets with bright fish and flowers and fruit, gem-toned silk costumes of the Apsara dance, a production by a children's troupe working hard to revive the arts and culture of Cambodia that was almost lost forever in the 70's. This set of necklaces evokes depth and light and all the bright spots in between where I think love and hope must live. I love it on my friend P., who wears the short and medium RIVER necklaces with a heather grey scoop neck and jeans and it's just so beautiful on her, the colors both serene and poppy at the same time, but I can see this dressed up on a little black party dress for a night out or peeking out from a chambray button-down while you paint your masterpiece.\r\n\r\nThe beads we use exclusively are old. Old as 1890's Paris and produced in gorgeous colors difficult to find today, collected on our trips to France over the years, and are sewn directly into the chain on strong thread, a technique we have perfected since 2008. They are sturdy and beautiful and these are a striking choice, full of life, when all you want to feel is joy. Handmade in our NYC studio. Please allow 10-14 days for production.\r\n\r\n-THE shortest is Mekong (19\"), a beautiful soft neutral for quiet everydays in rainwater blue, gloss white, soft mist and cobalt seed beads, the oldest here from Pre-War Paris. \r\n\r\n-The medium is Blue Lotus (24\") designed with a semi-symmetrical mix of larger 1920's & 30's Parisian and African beads and stacking zig-zag rondels in cobalt, black wave, dove grey, cloud white and citron, this middle size is a bright bold piece and is gorgeous and eye-catching on it's own but when it's paired with one or both of the shorter or longer necklaces from the HILL Collection, it truly dazzles.\r\n\r\n-The longest is Apsara (30\"), delicate in size but dazzling in a row of ultramarine, aquamarine, citron yellows, (some with undertones of the little limes found in Cambodia), soft mist, rainwater blue, plum and just a little spot of tangerine to soften the tones. A thoughtful pattern, a mix of matte and shiny, the colors are misty and soft and bright at the same time. The seed and tube beads range from the Jazz-age Paris of the 1920's through the \"Parapluies de Cherbourg\" 1960's.\r\n\r\nBought separately, we'll donate $5 from your purchase to Room to Read, an organization supporting education for girls across Asia and Africa. $5 will buy a book for a child but you'll be donating $20 if you buy the whole set--enough for an entire shelf of books for a school library--and we'll go further take $20 off your purchase of a set!

These are the blues clear as openings in the sky when the clouds move away. These are the colors I always go back to because I see in rain green. The HILL necklaces about my first trips in India, always straight to the Himalayan hills and always during the Monsoon, but this last visit was way South, a trip to Munnar, a tea producing town in the Nilgiri Hills of the Western Ghats of Kerala: wet green slopes with tea as far as the eye can see with soft and striking gray mist in front of monsoon clouds like the swirls in Indian Miniatures, moss covering everything, crumbling cement, a swish of the bright silks of ladies saris and raincoats and umbrellas rushing the rain, the French and cobalt blue of school uniforms on little braided girls marching to school. There has never been anything as awe-inspiring to me as the monsoon in India and these necklaces are the beautiful, ethereal pure deep colors I remember, the ones that root you to the earth, and really, they are the colors of strong girls who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty. This set has my heart because it just *feels* so great with my new soft blue slate long-sleeved tee. But you can wear it with your pretty white lace blouse too, with skinny black pants. Or the other way around...\r\n\r\nThe beads we use exclusively are old as 1890's Paris produced in gorgeous colors difficult to find today and collected on our trips to France over the years.

Handmade in our NYC studio. Please allow 10-14 days for production.\r\n\r\n-THE shortest is Munnari (19\"), in soft whisper tones of very special Art Nouveau-era jade colors and hand-cut pyrite seed beads from Paris. \r\n\r\n-The medium is Nilgiri (24\"), designed with a semi-symmetrical pattern of larger 1920's & 30's Parisian beads and stacking zig-zag rondels in tea-leaf green, cloud blue and progressing shades from dove-gray to black, this middle size is somber in color but a strong statement piece, bold on it's own and even more fantastic layered with one or both of the shorter or longer necklaces.\r\n\r\n-The longest is Monsoon (30\"), delicate in size with pure deep colors like soft-velvety jade, cobalt, French blue, turquoise, concord grape, grass, white and mercury glass, mixtures of matte and shiny tube and seed beads from a long, long time-ago Paris, when Matisse whispered the words, \"Creativity takes courage\".\r\n\r\nBought separately, we'll donate $5 from your purchase to Room to Read, an organization supporting education for girls across Asia and Africa.

This one might be my favorite and wearing it feels like poetry, a beautiful ghazal (but I say that about all the bonbons when I'm wearing them).

The DADES is a statement piece, gorgeous on it's own or layered with the others in this set for your nomadic goddess look.\r\n\r\n-The longest is Essouiara (30\") a delicate in size but strong on color line of apricot, orange and gold, fin-de-siecle shiny white tubes with dots of french blue, passages of turquoise & jade, mixtures of transparent and matte and glimmery hand-cut pyrite, as old as Matisse's favorite palette on his balcony in Tangiers and as strong as the colors he saw in the winter sun.\r\n\r\nBought separately, we'll donate $5 from your purchase to Room to Read, an organization supporting education for girls across Asia and Africa. $5 will buy a book for a child but you'll be donating $20 if you buy the whole set--enough for an entire shelf of books for a school library--and we'll go further to take $20 off your purchase of a set!

Big beads paired with tiny antique Parisian seed beads and little details like the snake tongue lariat at the bottom, the pop of color and antique sequin at the back tie, the hand-cut brass beads and meticulous craftsmanship, choices and attention to detail down to the  beautiful soft sage green and black silk and cotton wrapped Japanese cord make the heart just leap and then sing. The colors of the beautiful tea-laden hills of Southern India, this is such a beautiful piece, I wear mine layered with any of the shorter necklaces to a myriad of compliments throughout the day.\r\n\r\nBeads as old as 1890's Paris produced in gorgeous colors difficult to find today paired with new are picked on our trips to Paris and also found right here in NYC.
