After the drawing is finished, I brush on a varnish over the drawing which protects it. This process also enhances the drawing.\r\n\r\nI am doing this for a great price, $175. I like to keep my art affordable and accesible to  many people. All you need to do is provide me with a decent head shot of your pet, preferably in natural day light and with a digital camera. This makes for good detail needed to reference for a great pet portrait. Send me 3- 5 pictures to choose from for the best portrait.  Tell me characteristic traits that reflect yourself or your pet that you want to show in the pet portrait.  \r\n\r\nPlease e-mail me at ktwillsey@gmail.com for inquiry.  \r\n\r\nCheck out my pet portrait portfolio at http://kevinwillsey.blogspot.com/p/bad-cat-portraits.html\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","options":[{"id":29495168,"name":"Default","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/92674082/-/rockythealleycatBC.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/92674082/-/rockythealleycatBC.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":9431162,"name":"Wicked sweet deal of the week","permalink":"koko","position":2,"price":125.0,"default_price":125.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/koko","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-11T16:13:14.000Z","description":"hello peeps!\r\n\r\nThe wicked sweet deal of the week10/10 to 10/16/2013 is to \"like\" my Facebook page.  \"Like\" Bad Cat Portraits on Facebook and get your pet portrait for $125.
