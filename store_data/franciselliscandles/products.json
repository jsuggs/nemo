Shocking news to say the least. It started with a severe headache that led him to the ER which ended with a meningitis diagnosis - not fun but treatable. Further tests revealed it was much more. \r\n\r\nThe weekend was filled with more tests and visits with doctors. He eventually received two ports to fight the cancer with chemo treatments and a (NEGATIVE) bone marrow biopsy! (Yeah!) \r\n\r\nThe doctors tell us that they are confident that they caught the cancer very early and they will be able to get it into remission. Jason is currently nearing the home stretch of 8 rounds of chemotherapy and his doctors no longer think he will need a stem cell transplant! \r\n\r\nWe KNOW Jason will be a Cancer Survivor and he will get there with all of the support from friends, family and special people just like you...\r\n\r\nWhen you purchase one or more of Jason's Candles, 50% of the proceeds will benefit him directly & help with the huge medical bills he has incurred throughout this whole process. Not only will you be helping Jason, you will be enjoying a candle that is both beneficial to the environment as well as the consumer. Each candle is hand-crafted from a mix of non-GMO soy and organic coconut wax and can also be used as a massage oil and a body moisturizer. The wicks are made from sustainable, organic wood and because the wax is completely biodegradable, the containers can be washed out with soap and water and re-used or recycled. \r\n\r\nJason's favorite scent, Organic Sweet Orange and Olive, is available as well as a few of our most popular Fall/Winter scents. See below for descriptions. \r\n\r\nAmaretto Nog: A Francis Ellis Winter favorite! A holiday warmer of sweet almond and vanilla.\r\n\r\nOrganic Eucalyptus: Medicinal & cool, this candle is made with certified organic and Fair for Life Eucalyptus globulus essential oil and is perfect for when you're feeling congested and need a little fresh 'vapor rub' smell in the air (or on your chest!)\r\n\r\nFall Cabin: Think woody... cedar and oak delicately tempered with cinnamon, bayberry, and other Fall-like spice favorites.\r\n\r\nFirewood: Our most popular Holiday scent! The sweet, comforts-of-home smell of burning wood in a cozy room with a fireplace... It will blow your mind! Complete with a crackling wooden wick!\r\n\r\nFrosted Pine: Sweet orange and hints of fruit add a lively accent to this holiday creation. Fresh western cedar blends with fir balsam, patchouli and amber. Sweetened with vanilla and blended with wild berry.\r\n\r\nNorthern Christmas: Fresh wintry Balsam Pine & lightly spiced cranberry. Surprisingly pleasant and refreshing, puts an exciting new twist on pine!\r\n\r\nOrganic Sweet Orange & Olive: Jason's Favorite! Certified organic & Fair for Life Sweet Orange (Citrus sinensis) essential oil blended with a touch of Olive Blossom.

The Center for Disease Control rated complications from Parkinson’s disease as the 14th leading cause of death in the United States. The prevalence of the disease is expected to increase substantially in the next 20 years due to the aging of the population in the U.S., Europe and globally, as well as an increase in the age-related incidence of the disease. The economic burden of Parkinson’s disease is estimated to be $6 billion annually in the U.S. Learn more about Parkinson's disease.\r\nFor over half a century, the National Parkinson Foundation (NPF) has focused on meeting the needs in the care and treatment of people with Parkinson’s disease (PD). NPF has funded more than $172 million in care, research and support services. Our Patchouli Rosewood candle is not only loved by almost everyone, the essential oils used are believed to be beneficial to those suffering from Parkinson's. This one's for you, Joe!

She was an avid reader and liked to journal and write poetry. She saw things as either right or wrong. She had a tremendous amount of empathy towards kids who were treated unfairly. She was impulsive and lived life to the fullest. She was a risk taker but cared what the result was and how people perceived her. She was very sensitive. She pretended to be tough on the inside but wasn't. She was funny and made funny faces to get you to laugh. She tried to help others with their problems. She loved her friends and they were her world.\r\n\r\nWhen Elyssa was twelve years old she was sexually assaulted by a teenage boy. Following the assault, Elyssa was hospitalized and diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder. I was informed by her team that Elyssa had a predisposition to depression.

It was founded as Providence Day Nursery in 1907 by Janett Sturges offering day-care support for mothers who worked in local factories. The nursery provided the children with three meals a day and weekly health check-ups by a local doctor. For the parents, nutrition clinics and English classes were offered in the evening.\r\n\r\nIn 1916, a building addition included the House of Happiness, a recreational site for older children. The House of Happiness offered classes in reading, woodshop, sewing, sports, arts, dance and home economics. Citizenship classes were also held for the increasing number of immigrants migrating to the area.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, Pearse Hall and Gymnasium was built “for healthful recreation and skilled instruction promoting social responsibility and personal enrichment through group activity.” This building includes classrooms, a large gymnasium, lockers, showers, stage, woodshop, and kitchen. \r\n\r\nIn 1942, the facilities were renamed “Benton House” in tribute to the founder’s daughter, Katherine “Ma Benton” Sturges Benton who took over its direction.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Benton House became a place where the neighborhood gathered for concerts, events and political rallies.\r\n\r\nRich in history, Benton House has always remained rooted in its original mission, as many of its programs, services, and buildings stand as a tribute to previous generations. With unyielding determination, the organization will continue to grow to meet the needs of present and future generations.\r\n\r\nToday, Benton House runs a food pantry that feeds 500 families in the Bridgeport area as well as an organic community garden. They offer an after-school program for children, an audio engineering and event production job-training program designed specifically for youth and Youth Technology Corps (YTC) dedicated to transforming the lives of teens in challenged communities by connecting them to 21st century technology so they can discover new interests, learn relevant life/job skills and develop the confidence to secure a better future for themselves and their communities. They are also in the process of developing a music program & building their very own library.\r\n\r\nWhen you purchase a candle with the Benton House logo, 50% of the proceeds go directly to the organization!\r\n\r\nFind out more at http://www.bentonhouse.org","options":[{"id":42407958,"name":"Organic Patchouli Rosewood (NPF)","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19559891,"name":"German Chocolate Cake (BH)","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19561881,"name":"Pink Grapefruit (BH)","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19561883,"name":"Lily of the Valley (BH)","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19561885,"name":"Basil & Herb (BH)","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50298348,"name":"Organic Peppermint (EM)","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50298351,"name":"Fudge Brownie (EM)","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50298354,"name":"Cappuccino Hazelnut (EM)","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50298357,"name":"Organic Cinnamon (EM)","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123546687/-/option_4.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123546687/-/option_4.gif","width":450,"height":450},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60192375/-/MainLogo.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60192375/-/MainLogo.jpg","width":900,"height":844},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123546723/-/554749_327240480679388_94474977_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123546723/-/554749_327240480679388_94474977_n.jpg","width":750,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2615129,"name":"Candle","permalink":"candle","url":"/category/candle"}]},{"id":6836173,"name":"Memorial Candles","permalink":"memorial-candles","position":15,"price":75.0,"default_price":75.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/memorial-candles","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-31T03:22:08.000Z","description":"Perfect for a wedding memorial candle! \r\n\r\nPlease email franciselliscandles@gmail.com for a complete selection of Memorial Candles...\r\n\r\nBiodegradable & dermatology-tested for use as a massage oil & body moisturizer as well as a candle.
