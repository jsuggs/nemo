What the heck is a Shishi?  They're <a href=http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/shishi.shtml>these awesome temple lions</a>, and we had to make a soap dedicated to them.  Our Sakura Shishi soap is a well rounded mimic of what real cherry blossoms smell like, with the slightest hint of fruity undertones.  Super clean, super fresh, super nice! Cast in a light pink bar, and dusted with bodysafe silver mica.\r\n\r\nThe label is a collectible vinyl sticker, featuring artwork by <a href=http://www.neogeen.com>NeoGeen</a>.\r\n\r\nAlso available as a <a href=http://contactcaffeine.bigcartel.com/product/scent-marking-solid-perfume-in-a-tube>solid perfume</a>.\r\n\r\nSee what other people have to say about this soap <u><a href=http://contactcaffeine.yuku.com/topic/28/Sakura-Shishi-Japanese-Cherry-Blossom>here</a></u> on our forums.\r\n\r\nCon*Tact's soap is a very mild <u>vegetable glycerin</u> combined with shea for moisturizing.  The lather is incredibly thick and is great when used with a bath scrubby pouf for extra suds.  \"Frosting\" may occur as the caffeine crystallizes on the surface of the soap, and will rinse off with the next use.  Our soaps are all available without caffeine as well!
