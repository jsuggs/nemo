She's been part of many playlist meetings and knows what radio programmers are looking for.\r\n\r\nThis session can be very helpful if you have a rough demo recorded (even acoustic) or if you've already been in the recording studio.  It's ideal for artistes starting out as well as established musicians.\r\n\r\nIf you book me for a session, I'll listen to your song and let you know whether it's a good one to send to radio presenters and radio stations. A well-written song could attract you prime gigs, publishing and management, so it's important to get those songs right.\r\n\r\nIs it radio friendly?  Is the quality good enough for airplay?  Will you grab the attention of a radio presenter, or will you make the same sort of mistakes we hear everyday whilst putting our radio show together?\r\n\r\nI go through the song second by second - and give you all the positive feedback as well as ways to improve the sound of the song - and the arrangement.\r\n\r\nI can give feedback on 1, 2 or 3 tracks.  If you want more, just email and ask about a price.\r\n\r\nLook forward to hearing from you!\r\n\r\nQuestions? emmascottpresents@btinternet.com","options":[{"id":7977411,"name":"1 track","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21321011,"name":"2 track","price":44.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21321013,"name":"3 tracks","price":59.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63065837/-/Break-Your-Band_web_1_.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63065837/-/Break-Your-Band_web_1_.png","width":842,"height":595}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1495701,"name":"BAND MENTORING","permalink":"band-mentoring","url":"/category/band-mentoring"}]},{"id":8344812,"name":"Break Your Band - radio plugging","permalink":"break-your-band-radio-plugging","position":4,"price":499.99,"default_price":499.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/break-your-band-radio-plugging","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-03T19:10:07.000Z","description":"Pluggin' Baby is here to get your music played on the radio!\r\n\r\nMore details on http://plugginbaby.com\r\n\r\nWe send your music to national, regional, local, community, university and podcast DJ's for you.
