They just pop and are so fun to look at. The little red poppy jasper gemstone complement the champagne czech flower bead. The rustic creaminess of the aged looking flower go so well with jasper.\r\n\r\nAll metals used in earwires are oxized sterling silver. The chain link is actually gunmetal..all the metals go so very well.\r\n\r\nThey measure a total of 1 and 1/2 inches long in total from the top of the earwire to the bottom of last bead.\r\n\r\nPlease Note: The earwires used in the main and 3 top photo is the earwires that will be sent.

I was really lucky enough to talk my local bead shop owner into letting me hand pick several pairs of these beauties! She only had one strand..that was it.\r\n\r\nThis is a very unique, very hard to find cut of labrodite gemstone and thus the only pair I will have for sale probably for a long time. The flash blue and green hues are incredible but not always easy to catch with my camera.\r\n\r\nThe two briolettes are hand wrapped and hang on my very own designed earwires in high quality sterling silver and oxidized. I then hand polished the wire to give it the extra glow that really accents the flash of lights these guys give off.\r\n\r\nThey are light and only measure a total length of 1 and 3/4 inches long from the top of the earwire to the bottom of the bead. The briolettes are a 12 by 8 mm...nice size. Not too big, but not tiny either! Just perfect.\r\n\r\nThanks for peeking!","options":[{"id":1139241,"name":"Default","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.25,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2007337/-/DSCF0036.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2007337/-/DSCF0036.JPG","width":640,"height":480}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":234338,"name":"Ear Candy","permalink":"ear-candy","url":"/category/ear-candy"}]},{"id":270632,"name":"Earrings - Drops of Jupiter","permalink":"earrings-drops-of-jupiter","position":3,"price":38.0,"default_price":38.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/earrings-drops-of-jupiter","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-04-04T06:00:26.000Z","description":"These are so so pretty!
