There are many wondrous things inside this Frankie's covers. A jaunty salute to Dr Who through the decades. A non-creepy look at the secret world of ventriloquists. A chat with three queer lady couples about romance and marriage equality. A yummo recipe for Filipino banana spring rolls. A slightly psychedelic look at Cuban propaganda posters. A decent argument for the Beastie Boys being spiritual gurus. An ode to not loving the beach so much. And some hot tips on how to yodel and win at rock-paper-scissors (but not necessarily at the same time). Of course we have our usual shedload of lovely photography, pretty art-crafty stuff, music, travel and mildly hilarious opinion pieces. Oh, and a quick chat with spooky kids' author RL Stine about how to terrify children. Because it turns out we're actually quite nostalgic about things that go bump in the night.\r\n\r\n<b>Shipping</b> \r\nWe traditionally take great care in shipping your products.

Panorama Forces Vives, Éditions Rousseau, Genève 1970\r\nEditorial: Action in defence of humanity\r\nNicola Di Battista\r\nCONFETTI\r\nSpot Paintings\r\nDamien Hirst\r\nEnduring architecture\r\nThe capacity of architecture to produce lasting meaning led the author to look deeply into the topics of sustainability and responsibility in the architect’s profession\r\nDominique Perrault\r\nTeaching design\r\nThe Spanish architect, a professor of architecture and design since 2002 at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH), describes his teaching guidelines and why he values sharing knowledge in numerous publications on the research he conducts with his students\r\nJosep Lluís Mateo\r\nESAD Saint-Étienne\r\nYann Fabès, the director of the Saint-Étienne Higher School of Art and Design, tells of a “Copernican revolution” that turned a traditional school into an ambitious territorial project based on an idea of design that is highly sensitive to the presence of art\r\nYann Fabès\r\nFausto Melotti and The Seven Sages\r\nThe current exhibition of Melotti’s work in the “Gateway to Milan” room at Malpensa Airport focuses on the creative path that led the Rovereto-born artist to develop different versions of the same subject over the years\r\nAngela Vettese\r\nCorridors\r\nA “servant space” per definition, the corridor can become “the place of lost footsteps”, as Adalberto Libera liked to call it, or a space for possibilities in movement\r\nManolo De Giorgi\r\nGiulio Minoletti: from the archives to the project\r\nBesides their recognised historical-critical value, the architecture archives of the Modern are an extraordinary heritage for the practice of contemporary design. The Swiss architect summarises the reasons for their interest in five points\r\nChristian Sumi\r\n \r\nBellante\r\nEnzo Cucchi has illustrated an art book that is an extraordinary homage to Italian poetry both famous and little-known, to which his highly recognisable drawings add evocative visual comments\r\nEnzo Cucchi\r\nThe Montalbano landscape\r\nThe director of this successful television series describes how the landscape of Inspector Montalbano was created by the magic of cinema: getting rid of cars and thinning the crowds allows the baroque piazzas to come to life\r\nAlberto Sironi\r\nA way of working\r\nThe artist welcomes us to his studio in Cappelle sul Tavo, Abruzzi, where he has given a new dimension to the space by just “touching” it with inner rooms and a deft use of colour and light. Here, he regains his bearings\r\nEttore Spalletti\r\nDesk accessories\r\nWith the new Formwork™ collection designed by Industrial Facility for Herman Miller, the London studio has rethought a whole category of objects in light of the new mixed nature – both analogue and digital – assumed by today’s office interiors\r\nSam Hecht, Kim Colin\r\nTime and matter\r\nEvery architecture project is defined not only by what it is, but also by what it is not. To design a building or a city means designing the voids, too. This concept, and that of time, where architecture can be seen as the archaeology of transformation, are the cornerstones of these two Portuguese architects’ design philosophy\r\nManuel Aires Mateus, Francisco Aires Mateus\r\nCoca-Cola: the red wall of Berlin\r\nIf sharing becomes a fenced enclosure and personalisation means self-referentiality, new and major challenges are emerging for those who conceive and design the spaces where humans live – from Web designers to architects\r\nAngela Maiello\r\n \r\nPROJECTS\r\nRedevelopment of the Old Port in Marseille\r\nAs part of the works promoted for Marseille Provence European Capital of Culture 2013, a large-scale operation to redesign the public spaces around the Old Port has restored urban dignity to a mythical place of modernity, much loved by László Moholy-Nagy, Le Corbusier and Fernand Pouillon\r\nDesign Norman Foster. Photography Xavier Boymond, Edmund Sumner, Nigel Young / Foster + Partners\r\nAn art of living\r\nText Florian Beigel, Philip Christou\r\nThe Benedectine Einsiedeln Monastery\r\nThe insertion of two new volumes into the historical monastery complex in Switzerland fulfils a double role of graft and completion, revealing the search for a delicate balance between the pre-existing and the contemporary\r\nDesign and text Diener & Diener Architekten. Photography Christian Richters\r\nHouse in Ponte de Lima 3\r\nThe Portuguese architect makes a refined new version of the traditional country manors found in Portugal’s Minho region, resulting in a striking contemporary villa\r\nProgetto Eduardo Souto de Moura.

It offers a fresh and intelligent perspective on fashion that is focused on personal style – the way women actually look, think and dress. Featuring ambitious journalism and photography of the highest quality, The Gentlewoman celebrates inspirational women through the distinctive combination of glamour, personality and warmth in its collectable biannual magazine. And now, its growing community of international women will also be championed via its expanding website, set to re-launch this summer.\r\n\r\n<b>The Gentlewoman Issue 8 - Léa Seydoux</b>\r\nThe divine French actress Léa Seydoux is the face of The Gentlewoman’s eighth issue for autumn and winter 2013. Inside, the 28-year-old star of this year’s Palme d’Or-winning Blue Is the Warmest Colour discusses how she managed to cross the famously impervious Euro-Hollywood divide. Léa appears alongside 24 other wonderful women: phenomenal businesswoman Martha Stewart; accessories design genius Katie Hillier; fashion’s greatest dancer Pat Cleveland; the exceptional portrait painter Elizabeth Peyton and phenomenal models Hilary Rhoda and Stella Tennant are just six of them. This edition of the magazine also proffers a variety of personal style uniforms for autumn – from strict skirt-sweater options to one-dress-suits-all solutions. Meanwhile, the current state of the Scottish textile industry and the politics of peeing in public are examined in fascinating essays. All in, it’s a substantial, grown-up issue with intriguing images and frank opinions on every one of its 304 pages.\r\n\r\n<b>Facts</b>\r\nEnglish\r\n304 pages\r\n\r\n<b>Shipping</b>\r\nThe Gentlewoman is always shipped as a package.

is Cereal? \r\nForemost, it’s a magazine rooted in passions – for food, for travel. And for books too, with all the wonderful things they can teach us. Isn’t every day better when you learn something new? \r\nCereal believes that the enjoyment of food and travel are two significant elements of a good life, and more and more of us are in a position to enjoy both on a fairly regular basis now – so much so, that knowing what to experience first can be daunting at times. This is where Cereal comes in. Each quarterly issue of Cereal contains detailed expositions of edible topics, travel destinations, as well as profiles on products, people and places – chosen because they’re relevant, interesting, or have simply caught our attention. \r\nBecause Cereal adores books and their inherent ability to teach, they have structured their magazine as one. Each topic is treated as a chapter, often featuring various articles within it (including a bibliography, when applicable).\r\nThis allows you to explore a subject in depth, giving it the attention and focus it deserves. With the goal of making something timeless, by crafting and curating a tactile experience, we hope Cereal, like a good book, can be read over and over again. Cereal has also made sure that Cereal is a visual feast. Beautiful imagery and design can turn a decent volume into an inspired one, and we think people learn better with pictures. Children’s books are intrinsically visual, so why not apply that ethos to Cereal's content too? \r\nIn part, Cereal is aimed at our inner child. Back when we were little, we learned many a fun fact from the back of cereal boxes. One of our fondest memories of childhood is of waking up to a huge bowl of something crunchy and milky, devouring the words and pictures on the back of the packet. These boxes were the first thing we read each day, and they taught and entertained us. Hence, Cereal. Cereal hopes to become your morning read.\r\n\r\n<b>Cereal 4</b>\r\nIn the fourth volume of Cereal, we travel to Los Angeles, USA; Krakow, Poland; and the New Forest, England. We also explore the cultural and historical significance of grains. In our interlude, we talk to British watchmaker Uniform Wares about their stripped back, minimalist designs.\r\n\r\n<b>Facts</b>\r\n140 pages\r\nadvert-free\r\nperfect bound and printed in full colour on FSC approved 140gsm paper\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\n\r\n<b>Shipping</b>\r\nCereal Magazine is always shipped as a package.

AnOther is a luxurious magazine for over 450 pages, which defines the fashion season. It presents the best fashion photography and the essential campaigns in one beautifully crafted issue.\r\n\r\n<b>Another Issue 25</b>\r\nThis autumn, the extraordinary Cate Blanchett graces the cover of AnOther Magazine’s 25th edition, guest-edited by stylist Olivier Rizzo. Blanchett, star of Woody Allen’s forthcoming film Blue Jasmine, evokes the theatricality and decadence of a new wave Berlin with elegance and wit in a Willy Vanderperre shoot styled by Rizzo. Inside, the Oscar-winner speaks candidly to Turner Prize-winning artist Douglas Gordan in an illuminating two-part interview about transformative moments both in performance and in life. See our exclusive film featuring the actress, shot by Michael Cleary, here.\r\n\r\nThe issue also features a collection of stories inspired by transformation and travel. Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Picciolo, the creative directors of iconic Italian fashion house Valentino speak to Susannah Frankel about their graceful version of modern beauty from their atelier in Rome, and their key looks for this season are captured in a magical story shot by Jeff Bark and styled by AnOther Fashion Director Katie Shillingford.\r\n\r\nTino Sehgal, the Turner Prize-nominated artist of the moment speaks to long-time friend and curator Hans Ulrich Obrist about his pioneering art in a discussion spanning geography and time. Hollywood actress-turned-rancher Patrice Wymore (star of the original Ocean’s Eleven), opens the doors to the Jamaican estate she shared with husband Errol Flynn and remembers Port Antonio in its 1950s heyday. Retired astronaut Eileen Collins, NASA’s first female Space Shuttle commander, looks back on her voyages into orbit and forward to the future of space travel.\r\n\r\n<b>Facts</b>\r\nColour print\r\nEnglish\r\n\r\n<b>Shipping</b>\r\nAnother Magazine is always shipped as a package!","options":[{"id":44238069,"name":"Default","price":8.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":73,"name":"Bulgaria","code":"BG"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":91,"name":"Cyprus","code":"CY"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":100,"name":"Estonia","code":"EE"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":125,"name":"Hungary","code":"HU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.25,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":137,"name":"Latvia","code":"LV"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":143,"name":"Lithuania","code":"LT"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":150,"name":"Malta","code":"MT"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.35,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":184,"name":"Poland","code":"PL"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":189,"name":"Romania","code":"RO"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":203,"name":"Slovakia (Slovak Republic)","code":"SK"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":204,"name":"Slovenia","code":"SI"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":16.5,"amount_with_others":8.25}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124851774/-/281157.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124851774/-/281157.jpg","width":280,"height":371}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4604081,"name":"Fashion","permalink":"fashion","url":"/category/fashion"},{"id":4604084,"name":"Arts","permalink":"arts","url":"/category/arts"},{"id":4604087,"name":"Photography","permalink":"photography","url":"/category/photography"}]},{"id":15201837,"name":"Wrap Pack High Tea","permalink":"wrap-pack-high-tea","position":19,"price":5.95,"default_price":5.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wrap-pack-high-tea","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-29T16:19:03.000Z","description":"Wrap Packs by Wrap happily provide you with all you’ll need when wrapping and giving a gift.

I feel like a phony working on this issue, as mine rarely look like the chilled-out pages that follow. Like many of you, I often spend them typing away or working on a project. We decided to dig deep on the subject of weekends and leisure to re-learn how to do nothing, live more adventurously and embrace those two days, which are meant equally for rejuvenation and invigoration. Take our Weekend issue, kick back, slip off your shoes and simply get out there and enjoy some good food and your favorite people.” —Editor Nathan Williams\r\n\r\n<b>Facts</b>\r\n144 pages\r\noffset-printed and perfect bound, full color on uncoated paper \r\nPrinted in Canada\r\n\r\n<b>Shipping</b>\r\nWe take great care in shipping your product, which will be shipped in an enveloppe.

What the fuck is wrong with us? Let’s be honest, wouldn’t the world be a better place without us? Be it in religion, politics, sports and so on. Men are cheating, hurting others and we are responsible for all the worst stuff in the world. Don’t get me wrong. I am a proud man! But I am also ashamed of my own species. Look at Russia. You can see what men can do to other men. And let’s not even talk about the fanatic Islamic freaks out there. The Pope? The Church? Or the financial crisis nowadays. It is all men’s fault. So what is really going wrong with us? For sure I am not a saint myself. I have got my flaws. I pee and I will never ever sit down to. I watch stupid TV shows without a meaning. And so on.. Yes I am a man. So guys! Let’s think about our attitude, our acting, our way of life. It is in man’s hands to change something in the world. Stand up! Grow some balls and be a real man. Do what you are supposed to do: Stand up for the helpless and the\r\npoor. Respect every human being out there. Be strong but also sensitive. Protect your wife, man, children, friends. It is time to be the strong one and not the weak link in the chain that is humanity.\r\n\r\n<b>Facts</b>\r\nMore than 70 contributors from all around the world. \r\n408 pages – 1,4 kg\r\nSize: 24 cm x 33,7 cm \r\nFull color\r\n\r\n<b>Shipping</b>\r\nKaltblut is always shipped as a package, and handled with great care. \r\n","options":[{"id":43884978,"name":"Default","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":73,"name":"Bulgaria","code":"BG"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":91,"name":"Cyprus","code":"CY"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":100,"name":"Estonia","code":"EE"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":125,"name":"Hungary","code":"HU"}},{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":2.25,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":137,"name":"Latvia","code":"LV"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":143,"name":"Lithuania","code":"LT"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":150,"name":"Malta","code":"MT"}},{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":2.35,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":184,"name":"Poland","code":"PL"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":189,"name":"Romania","code":"RO"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":203,"name":"Slovakia (Slovak Republic)","code":"SK"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":204,"name":"Slovenia","code":"SI"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":16.5,"amount_with_others":8.25}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124597071/-/Coverkl.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124597071/-/Coverkl.jpg","width":375,"height":525}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4604081,"name":"Fashion","permalink":"fashion","url":"/category/fashion"},{"id":4604087,"name":"Photography","permalink":"photography","url":"/category/photography"},{"id":4604666,"name":"Design","permalink":"design","url":"/category/design"}]},{"id":13682421,"name":"Wilder Quarterly - Issue VII","permalink":"wilder-quarterly-issue-vii","position":25,"price":14.95,"default_price":14.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wilder-quarterly-issue-vii","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-20T10:27:38.000Z","description":"Wilder quarterly is for people enthralled by the natural and growing world.

And for books too, with all the wonderful things they can teach us. Isn’t every day better when you learn something new? \r\nCereal believes that the enjoyment of food and travel are two significant elements of a good life, and more and more of us are in a position to enjoy both on a fairly regular basis now – so much so, that knowing what to experience first can be daunting at times. This is where Cereal comes in. Each quarterly issue of Cereal contains detailed expositions of edible topics, travel destinations, as well as profiles on products, people and places – chosen because they’re relevant, interesting, or have simply caught our attention. \r\nBecause Cereal adores books and their inherent ability to teach, they have structured their magazine as one. Each topic is treated as a chapter, often featuring various articles within it (including a bibliography, when applicable).\r\nThis allows you to explore a subject in depth, giving it the attention and focus it deserves. With the goal of making something timeless, by crafting and curating a tactile experience, we hope Cereal, like a good book, can be read over and over again. Cereal has also made sure that Cereal is a visual feast. Beautiful imagery and design can turn a decent volume into an inspired one, and we think people learn better with pictures. Children’s books are intrinsically visual, so why not apply that ethos to Cereal's content too? \r\nIn part, Cereal is aimed at our inner child. Back when we were little, we learned many a fun fact from the back of cereal boxes. One of our fondest memories of childhood is of waking up to a huge bowl of something crunchy and milky, devouring the words and pictures on the back of the packet. These boxes were the first thing we read each day, and they taught and entertained us. Hence, Cereal. Cereal hopes to become your morning read.\r\n\r\n<b>Cereal 3</b>\r\nIn the third volume of Cereal, we travel to Reykjavik, Iceland; Santa Barbara, USA; and the Antrim Coast in Northern Ireland. We also delve into the taste, history and contemporary interpretations of edible flowers and insects. In the interlude, we talk to modern British menswear brand Albam, and take a closer look at the letterpress process with Meticulous Ink in Bath, UK.\r\n\r\n<b>Facts</b>\r\n140 pages\r\nadvert-free\r\nperfect bound and printed in full colour on FSC approved 140gsm paper\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\n\r\n<b>Shipping</b>\r\nCereal Magazine is always shipped as a package.

Since its launch in 2005, the magazine has proven to be a timely, visual, non-academic publication full of first-hand information from creative people.

The magazine explores the boundaries of architecture and anticipates the industry’s future.\r\n\r\n<b>Mark 44</b>\r\nThe past 15 years have seen architecture in Indonesia free itself from the stifling uniformity that defined it during the presidential regimes of Sukarno and Suharto. Large government-controlled architecture firms have made place for small, independent practices that are giving the country a new sense of self-confidence. This issue, Mark focuses on 14 of the nation’s newest projects.

A recipe for mulled wine to chase the cold weather away, a little look at how to raise chooks in the city, a quick trip to Seoul and a refugee's tale that includes pirates? Yep, we've got them, too. Oh, and an in-depth look at the history of big hair, a load of snuggly new winter fashion, and a hard-hitting report on the life of a crazy cat lady.

Published in Berlin and distributed internationally, Sleek is printed in English. Each issue contains a monothematic dossier centered on a topic comprising two opposite concepts and selected as a playful approach to tackling the intricacy of contemporaneous culture. \r\n\r\nConsidering the visual as the most important language of our times, and art and fashion as its most influential disciplines, sleek provides a platform for both while seeking to highlight their aesthetic and intellectual interrelatedness. \r\n\r\nFounded in Hamburg in 2002, the magazine has been published in Berlin since 2005.\r\n\r\n<b>Sleek 37 Faking the Folk Pt. II</b>\r\nSleek magazine bounds out of winter with a spring in its step and a question on its lips: what’s fake and what’s folk today? What’s the fascination with craft and textiles, with romantic landscapes made with Photoshop, and men with beards in bands? There’s an answer too. In 1999 the then-editor of The Face magazine, Richard Benson, wrote a landmark essay, “Faking The Folk” for that magazine on how the emerging fetish for folkiness was a strange combination of the authentic and the artificial, the plastic and the organic. Like all the best journalism, it not only captured the zeitgeist back then but feels even more true now – and that’s why for the all-new, redesigned and re-engineered Sleek, he updates his essay with “Faking The Folk Pt.II”, which opens the Assignment section.\r\nIn there, find fashion stories by photographers including Thomas Lohr, Alexander Straulino, Willem Jaspert, Tomas Falmer and Sabrina Theissen, all of which pull the idea apart and put it back together again in extraordinary ways, plus contemporary art stories that look at romanticism in the Web 2.0 era, the resurgence of handicrafts in fine art, feral photography and more.\r\n\r\nFashion Now – Art Forever\r\nSleek is dedicated to tracking the changing world through the prisms of art and fashion, and there’s much more on offer this Spring: in Sleek’s biggest issue to date (we mean more and bigger pages), find interviews with Kenneth Anger, Takashi Murakami, Jim Shaw, Francesca von Habsburg, Christian Wijnants and Robert Montgomery. Meanwhile Hili Perlson looks at Talia Link’s reanimation of the witch, Francesca Gavin explains the “thingliness” of artist Steven Claydon, Kevin Braddock profiles Belgian man of the moment Christian Wijnants, and there are thoughts on the dawning Anthropocene era, studio visits with fascinating new artists in Berlin and plenty more.\r\n\r\n<B>Facts</b>\r\nIssue Winter 2012/2013, Sleek 36, The Head & Heart Issue \r\n240 pages \r\nEnglish\r\n\r\n<b>Shipping</b>\r\nWe traditionally take great care in shipping your products.

It is the title of an umbrella, a bomb shelter for creative collaboration between the talented youth of today with grit in their teeth and something to say.\r\n\r\nThe platform is a limited edition bi-annual magazine, a portrayal of the beautiful everyday, lying right under noses that were so busy searching they forgot to notice. Style is everywhere; it is an act or gesture, an accent or slur or slang, the latest dog, the smoker’s cigarette, short hair is the new long hair; if you couldn’t care you still care. It is important to describe and distill the time we live in whilst always pushing things forward.\r\n\r\nLAW is concerned with documenting the overlooked and giving people a sense of belonging and recognition that perhaps they wouldn’t normally receive but in no, way shape or form less deserve; style tribes who may not be at the forefront of fashion but have a very particular aesthetic in their own right.\r\n\r\nLAW is a window into the world of the current-undercurrent that nobody is catching and is therefore of greater importance to document. For how long will 90’s Umbro diamonds and Vauxhall Novas still align the streets, from bottom drawers and charity shops, through used car dealers with luminous stickers along pavements stuck in polka dots? It is vital to build these archives of real characters and historic British traces, before their distinct style changes, shops shut up and their language is lost.\r\n\r\nLaw are interested in making fashion accessible by challenging perceptions that it's an elitist world and showing that it surrounds us all. Law hopes to appeal to butchers and builders, everyday boys who wouldn’t mind reading a fashion magazine if only they could appreciate and relate to the content. \r\n\r\n<b>Law 2</b>\r\nContributers\r\n\r\nEdd Harrington, Anthony Sheret, Tom Holt, Joe Willams, Sadie Williams, Elliot Kennedy, David Imms, Clare Acheson, Stuart Griffiths, Joseph Kondras, Joseph Bond, Joe Prince, Lydia Garnett, Sam Hiscox, Daniel Evans, Brendan Baker, Theo Simpson, Peter Hill, Jack Cassidy, Flora Maclean, Ruby Woodhouse, Frankie Goldstone, Martin Seeds, Jessie Rose Williams, Marcus Munnelly, Ben Holden. \r\n\r\n<b>Facts</b>\r\n52 pages on gloss and uncoated mixed paper\r\nPrinted 5 colour offset\r\nSaddle stitched\r\nContent flysheet\r\nLimited edition of 500\r\n\r\n<b>Shipping</b> \r\nWe traditionally take great care in shipping your products.

Ferdinand Thein Hardt 1880, the Royal Grotesk designed in four sections for the Royal Prussian Academy of Berlin, from around 1918, the commercial has emerged Grotesque. At the same time, for example, designed the typographer Morris Fuller Benton 1905-1930 writings of a group of so-called American Grotesque, based on the older Grotesque. Today, different methods for the design of fonts are observed, which can be described as quotes. A number of references relate more or less directly on historical models.\r\n\r\nSome corresponding, current font designs we with pleasure in this magazine. The type essays by Flo Gaertner (Karlsruhe), Robert Schumann (Berlin) and Anna Sinofzik (London) deal with them.

Since its launch in 1997, the magazine has remained faithful to its mission: putting interior architecture on the map as a creative profession that’s equally important as design and architecture. In six issues per year, Frame publishes the world’s most inspiring interiors, spiced up with design, art and creative endeavours like window displays and stage sets.\r\n\r\n<b>Frame #90</b>\r\nIn this issue, lighting designer Sarah Landau, LED maestro Tom Jenkinson (aka Squarepusher) and musician Amon Tobin talk about how light projections can turn music into a physical entity – or in Tom Jenkinson’s words, how ‘music can evoke not only space, but also movement through space.’ We present pictures from the Encyclopedia of Flowers by graphic designer Kenya Hara and flower artist Makoto Azuma and delve into the microcosmic world of flowers and plants. We ask David Adjaye about the two new light-filled libraries he has just completed in Washington, DC, and finally make a stopover in Montreal for a glimpse of the new spaces and projects that make the city shine.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\nThe Shape Shifter: David Adjaye gets social with libraries in Washington D.C.\r\nVertical Vendure: Jean Nouvel's high-rise garden hotel in Barcelona\r\nSpot On: Three creatives use light to present music in space\r\nAn Oasis in Tokyo: A romantic Isabel Marant store, by Ciguë\r\nAs Seen On Screen: How retail spaces are referencing the digital world\r\nA New Eden: Fresh flowering: a passionate perspective on plants\r\nMontréal: Creative, casual, charismatic and Canadienne\r\n\r\nVisions\r\nCubist love from Kotaro Horiuchi; library liberalism from OMA; TheeAe and MenoMenoPiu; and more forward-looking projects from around the world.\r\n\r\nStills\r\nThe best of the Venice Biennale from SelgasCano, Konstantic Gcric, plus Kortrijk highlights from Ross Locegrove, Troika and Makkink & Bey.

In this issue, work can be seen that involve chance, based on errors and inaccuracies that are derived conceptually or systematically - consistent work, the other unconventional ways to go in the design.\r\n\r\nThe typography of the playful handling of tools, forms and concept is a popular means of expanding consciousness. This is (if one considers the large number of submissions for this issue) a widespread phenomenon, which is particularly widespread in the higher education environment. This is not surprising given the experimental results are the basis of a theory in conjunction with a model. Therefore, this issue is in such an extensive collection of typographic experiments in a 48-page special section.\r\n\r\nInaccuracies sometimes lead to new precision - such as the body type of this issue. The body font family was designed by Michael Mischler and Nik Thoenen from Bern fontlabel inland. This was based on a detailed analysis of this occurring inaccuracies in the printed image from the writings of the early twentieth century.\r\n\r\nAnd in the production of this special issue, we have used a somewhat old-fashioned, experimental procedure: The printed sheet of the envelope was printed on two different paper materials in rainbow printing with HKS colors.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these ideas, we present the interesting photo series by Matthias Hubert (Dortmund), who has seen the fans of the reigning German champions on the cowl, and Ken Rosenthal (Tucson, AZ), which opens the experiment, the darkroom. The type essays by Christine Hartmann (Leipzig), Will Hill (Cambridge) and Shelley Gruendler (Galiano Iceland) also deal with the strategy of the experiment. To read, there are also interviews with Peter Bi'lak (The Hague), Michael Mischler and Nik Thoenen (Berne), Martin and Thomas Poschauko (Au near Bad Aibling), Oded Ezer (Givatayim), Donald Beekman and Liza Enebis (Amsterdam) and Neville Brody (London), also an article about the Japanese modernism and the fifth part of the Tokyo Report, both by Ian Lynam (Tokyo) and the next typoakustischen travel report by Frank Wiedemann (Berlin).\r\n\r\n<b>Facts</b> \r\n180 pages \r\n21 x 27 cm \r\nEnglish, German\r\n\r\n<b>Shipping</b>\r\nWe traditionally take great care in shipping your products.

Featuring up-to-the-minute visual material, fresh faces and original voices, the magazine covers and uncovers new trends and talent in contemporary visual culture.\r\n\r\n<b>Elephant #13</b>\r\nWith the feature ‘Post-Photography’ the magazine focuses on photography, or rather, on photography after photography, looking at how artists are transforming and transcending the medium.\r\n\r\nStill with the idea of ‘post-something’ in mind, we look at how post-graffiti street artist Filippo Minelli uses social media as a new ‘street’, a new way of carrying ambiguous messages to the circulating masses. From this we move on to post-painting, or post-reportage, or post-conflict, following Dutch painter Ronald Ophuis as he travels to Sierra Leone in order to research paintings based on atrocities committed during the civil war – perhaps more than any other painter of his generation, Ophuis’s war paintings ask the question of just how far painting can go, and what is the role of the medium in our image-saturated world.\r\n\r\nIranian artist Samira Hodaei tells us about how fast things are actually changing in her homeland these days, and Santa Monica-based, German artist Friedrich Kunath talks about the relationship between smell and memory, Jockum Nordstrom makes music, and Jules de Balincourt remembers going in through the back door, carrying art works into the studios of big-name Manhattan artists – before he became a big name too.\r\n\r\nBut let’s not forget to mention an art guide to Munich featuring interviews with artists such as Tom Schmelzer, Mirko Borsche, Max Geuter, Benjamin Roder, Carlos de los Rios and designer Ingo Maurer – clearly, all is still blue in Bavaria.\r\n\r\nPart I: Open Files: Who to see and where\r\nEdy Ferguson\r\nSiegfried Anzinger\r\nThe Unphotographable\r\nTacita Dean\r\nPhilippe Cognee\r\nBaw-lal\r\nEd Templeton\r\nFreya Pocklington\r\nAnalia Saban\r\nDaan van Golden\r\nOlivier Richon\r\nCatarina Dias\r\nIzaak Zwartjes\r\nBenjamin Verdonck\r\nDarren Harvey-Regan\r\nMichael Krebber\r\nFiona Rae\r\nKaarina Kaikkonen\r\n\r\nPart II: Showcase\r\nRambharos Jha, Louise Despont and Samira Hodaei.\r\n\r\nPart III: Research\r\nComing out Fighting: Featuring Justin Hammond, Adam Dix, Jonny Briggs, Julia Vogl, Tom Howse, Adeline de Monseignat, Juno Calypso and Nicky Deely.\r\nPost Photography: The Unknown Image.

It is the title of an umbrella, a bomb shelter for creative collaboration between the talented youth of today with grit in their teeth and something to say.\r\n\r\nThe platform is a limited edition bi-annual magazine, a portrayal of the beautiful everyday, lying right under noses that were so busy searching they forgot to notice. Style is everywhere; it is an act or gesture, an accent or slur or slang, the latest dog, the smoker’s cigarette, short hair is the new long hair; if you couldn’t care you still care. It is important to describe and distill the time we live in whilst always pushing things forward.\r\n\r\nLAW is concerned with documenting the overlooked and giving people a sense of belonging and recognition that perhaps they wouldn’t normally receive but in no, way shape or form less deserve; style tribes who may not be at the forefront of fashion but have a very particular aesthetic in their own right.\r\n\r\nLAW is a window into the world of the current-undercurrent that nobody is catching and is therefore of greater importance to document. For how long will 90’s Umbro diamonds and Vauxhall Novas still align the streets, from bottom drawers and charity shops, through used car dealers with luminous stickers along pavements stuck in polka dots? It is vital to build these archives of real characters and historic British traces, before their distinct style changes, shops shut up and their language is lost.\r\n\r\nLaw are interested in making fashion accessible by challenging perceptions that it's an elitist world and showing that it surrounds us all. Law hopes to appeal to butchers and builders, everyday boys who wouldn’t mind reading a fashion magazine if only they could appreciate and relate to the content. \r\n\r\n<b>Facts</b>\r\n52 pages on gloss and uncoated mixed paper\r\nPrinted 5 colour offset\r\nSaddle stitched\r\nContent flysheet\r\nLimited edition of 500\r\n\r\n<b>Shipping</b> \r\nWe traditionally take great care in shipping your products.

is a free quarterly magazine printed on an A1 size poster and folded to a 198 x 280mm format. \r\nIn case you’re wondering why it’s the size of a poster, it’s because we would like you to put them up. On your front door, your kitchen window, your bedroom ceiling or even nailed to the door of your local city hall. Screw a blogosphere, we’re taking it back to the oldest of old schools. We are the new pamphleteers, taking on the digital dictatorship of the 2.0 era.\r\nPOSTRmagazine is not here to give you all or even any of the answers; we’re here to raise some questions of our own. We’re here to make sure you keep thinking. We’re the critical footnote at the bottom of the picture perfect, the news satellite on the dark side of the moon, keeping an eye on what the 9 ‘o clock news doesn’t show you.\r\n\r\n<b>POSTRmagazine #13: The Fear issue</b>\r\nHELLO? Is anybody in here?\r\nLate night. The night howls around your house. Floorboards creak upstairs, moaning out like sinners who have been in Hell for too long. The wind creeps its way in through the cracks in your psyche and gleefully whispers threats into your ear. You’re all alone. Nobody cares. You are a social failure and terrorists will invade your house and sacrifice you to their angry God, a useless fat pig to a vindictive butcher. Suddenly, the earth shudders as if pounded once by a divine fist. The last of your stale beer stirs in its glass. You instantly shit a brick and whimper a plea for a quick demise. No fight, no flight – just meek resignation and fearful anticipation. The strong survive and you’re not one of them. You walk towards the front door and put your hand on the knob, sighing once before you pull it open – expecting immediate death at the hands of who- or whatever has finally come for you – only to see nothing standing before you.\r\n\r\nThere are no jihadi to claim your life, no immigrants to take your job. No social circle to judge you and no parents to dissappoint. No bankruptcy, no tumor. There is no judging God standing outside, holding up the balance book of your life while shaking His/Her head in foreboding denial. In truth, there is really nothing to be afraid of – nothing except the all new spine-tingling horror of POSTRmagazine #13: The Fear Issue – OUT NOW IN TERRIFYING 3D-VISION!!\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTRmagazine is free with any other order, use the discount code POSTR13 for a € 0.10 discount.

LIGHT is the opposite of loud and mouthy. In this theme, the first striking contrasts writings, works and images came to us a lot more noisy, in the sense as a quiet, restrained. Shapes us a time - striking and powerful in their events - which rushes past us and drags us. The faint overtones little attention should be paid at this rapid pace.\r\n\r\nHow, then keep holding, the BOLD oppose the LIGHT?

Even in production, this translates: the use of various metallic Chromolux papers and a two-tone finish, which appears 16 Output in six different variants. In the inner part of the reader also expects a further haptic surprise.\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to present two photo series, which interpret the terms BOLD and LIGHT in a special, different way: The historical record of perhaps the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time, Muhammad Ali (UPI / Bettmann / Corbis), as well as a critical photographic counterpoint to David Hamilton's \"soft-purged 'and supposedly easier aesthetics of Mareike Foecking (Dusseldorf).\r\n\r\nWe bring type essays by Jean François Prochez (Clarmart), Horst Wöhrle (Esslingen), Reinhard Albers (Constance) and Nanna Funke (Münster), also interviews with Ian Party (Lausanne), Ludwig Übele (Berlin), Eric Gill, Michael Horsham (London), Doug Wilson (Springfield), refinery AG für Gestaltung (Zurich), Jost Hochuli (St. Gallen), Thomas Lupo (Weissach) and Mareike Foecking (Dusseldorf), as well as reports by Michael Schmidt (Munich), Ian Lynam ( Tokyo) and a new musical travelogue by Frank Wiedemann (Berlin). \r\n\r\n<b>Facts</b> \r\n148 pages \r\n21 x 27 cm \r\nEnglish, German\r\n\r\n<b>Shipping</b>\r\nWe traditionally take great care in shipping your products.

We invite a guest curator – an international fashion designer, group or house – to develop innovative, personalised content to express their aesthetic and cultural values. Each issue celebrates this designer’s ethos: their people, their passion, their stories, emotions, fascinations, spontaneity and authenticity.\r\n\r\nAntwerp’s ‘A Magazine’ has always been much more than a magazine. The key to its cultish allure lies in the subtitle: ‘Curated by’. The twelfth issue belongs to Stephen Jones, fashion’s favourite hatter. Says Jones, “I like a magazine that looks like a magazine. It’s not a book. I didn’t want it to be page after page of slightly meaningless photographs.

These obsessive types populate the pages of volume six.\r\n\r\nThere's Robert Gamblin, who uses science, intuition and a blender to create oil paints that are used by artists the world over. There's retired sailor and shipwright Ray Gascoigne who, at 85, spends hours painstakingly building ships on the world's smallest dry dock – a bottle. There's Kazuko Koike, one of the founders of the Japanese non-brand brand MUJI, whose almost dogmatic obsession with simplicity and usefulness helped define Japan's design culture. There's David Noble, a committed bushwalker who unknowingly unearthed the Wollemi Pine, which had previously only been known from a 150-million-year-old fossil.\r\n\r\nOn the pages you'll also find mushroom farmer and scientist Dr Noel Arrold, Drones frontman Gareth Liddiard, Vimeo co-designer Zach Klein, Tetris-style builder Michael Johansson and Kano Jigoro, the guy who invented judo.

And this March she shines as never before, as Glinda the Good Witch in Sam Raimi’s all-star prequel to the classic film The Wizard of Oz.\r\n\r\nAn exclusive film with Michelle Williams will premiere on anothermag.com this Wednesday.\r\n\r\nStories inspired by the concept of home continue inside the issue:\r\n\r\nAi Weiwei: China’s foremost artist and dissident invites Jefferson Hack into his live-in studio in Beijing\r\n\r\nRaf Simons: The designer gives an exclusive interview to Susannah Frankel on finally finding his home at Christian Dior\r\n\r\nEdward James: Jerry Stafford travels to Mexico to uncover the story of the enigmatic patron to Dalí and Magritte and his tropical jungle hideaway\r\n\r\nCountess Setsuko Klossowski de Rola: The UNESCO Artist opens the doors to Switzerland’s Grand Chalet, the enchanted home she shared with her husband the painter Balthus. \r\n\r\n<b>Facts</b>\r\nColour print\r\nExpected soon\r\n\r\n<b>Shipping</b>\r\nAnother Magazine is always shipped as a package!","options":[{"id":35342568,"name":"Default","price":8.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":73,"name":"Bulgaria","code":"BG"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":91,"name":"Cyprus","code":"CY"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":100,"name":"Estonia","code":"EE"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":125,"name":"Hungary","code":"HU"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":137,"name":"Latvia","code":"LV"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":143,"name":"Lithuania","code":"LT"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":150,"name":"Malta","code":"MT"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":184,"name":"Poland","code":"PL"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":189,"name":"Romania","code":"RO"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":203,"name":"Slovakia (Slovak Republic)","code":"SK"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":204,"name":"Slovenia","code":"SI"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":10.4,"amount_with_others":5.2,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":16.5,"amount_with_others":8.25}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110506269/-/256017.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110506269/-/256017.jpg","width":300,"height":397}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4604081,"name":"Fashion","permalink":"fashion","url":"/category/fashion"},{"id":4604084,"name":"Arts","permalink":"arts","url":"/category/arts"},{"id":4604087,"name":"Photography","permalink":"photography","url":"/category/photography"}]},{"id":11233551,"name":"Dansk -

In our pages you’ll find green thumbs, rooftop gardeners, foodies and chefs, seed savers, architects, hobby farmers, horticulturalists, innovators, amateurs, and experts. Just your everyday mix of growing enthusiasts. Each issue is ‘life through the lens of the growing world’— indoors and out, culture, travel, food and design. Published seasonally for this generation of growers and the next.\r\n\r\n<B>Winter 2013</b>\r\nWilder Winter 2013 explores the deep freeze with a trip to Iceland to see what survives the polar clime and coastal Maine to see the cold, hard realities of oyster farming. Chef Magnus Nilsson shows us the hiemal pleasures of the Swedish landscape and Alaskan native and songstress Kate Earl teaches us how properly to filet a salmon. We have plenty of deep reading for those long winter nights with a brief  history of tree-hugging and an interview with NY Times columnist Mark Bittman. We experience a mid-winter thaw with a visit to Vietnam to learn about international farm to table cuisine. Along the way, we delve into the mythology of the persimmon and figure out why everyone should love the praying mantis. We'll help beginners get into vermiculture, share growing tips for every region and much, much more.\r\n\r\n<b>Facts</b>\r\nEnglish\r\n\r\n<b>Shipping</b> \r\nWe traditionally take great care in shipping your products.
