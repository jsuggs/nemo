(Bag is modeled on a Harley Davidson Cross Bones in the picture)\r\n\r\nEach of my bags are crafted from 3mm drum dyed-vegetable tanned leather and is completely hand-made to order by me in Manchester from start to finish using tradition saddlery tools and techniques. Unlike similar bags for sale, I do not use a machine to create a lock-stitch which can come undone along its length. For my bags, I use a 1mm thick braided and waxed polyester thread, and employ a \"saddle stitch\". As the name suggests, this manner of stitch is from the world of saddlery and is employed for its strength. Here, the stitch is made from a single length of thread with a needle on both ends. Both needles are passed through each hole, creating a stitch which can be described as a running figure of eight. This means that if the thread is torn on one side, the stitch will still hold, unlike a machined lock-stitch which can be pulled out. The saddle stitch can only be done by hand. \r\n\r\nBefore each bag is constructed, I clean and polish the leather before conditioning it with a balm containing beeswax and natural oils.\r\nAdditionally, I take the time to sand, smooth, dye and wax all edges, giving a professional and complete look to the bag.\r\n\r\nDimensions are 11\" width, 15\" tall side, 8\" short side, approx 5\"deep and is made to be mounted on the left side. \r\n\r\nThe top flap is secured by two straps passing through a pair of heavy duty chrome roller buckles. The bag itself is attached to the bike at three mounting points with buckled leather straps and option releasable wide cable ties (both included).\r\n\r\nI can customise the bags according to thread colour, buckles and leather colour.  Furthermore, I can also make the bags from raw leather, giving you complete control of the colour and tolling/carving option. Please do not hesitate to contact me about pricing and options.\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise stated with your order, the bag with black thread.\r\n\r\nAs the bags are made by hand it can take up to fifteen working days for yours to be ready.

I have made this strap from 4mm thick vegetable tanned leather that will look better with age and use. All edges have been slicked and dyed to give a professional, finished look. \r\n\r\nA simple, quality nickel buckle furnishes the adjustment strap whilst the main body is decorated with 1 1/2\" wide celtic cross conchos. Additionally, I have rubbed the rivets with emery cloth to dull them so they match the antique silver look of the crosses.\r\n\r\nThe thickness and width is perfect for heavier guitars like Les Pauls, Flying Vs, Explorers and bigger guitars such as semi acoustics. The weight of the leather means the strap will not stretch over time.

Unlike similar bags for sale, I do not use a machine to create a lock-stitch which can come undone along its length. For my bags, I use a 1mm thick braided and waxed polyester thread, and employ a \"saddle stitch\". As the name suggests, this manner of stitch is from the world of saddlery and is employed for its strength. Here, the stitch is made from a single length of thread with a needle on both ends. Both needles are passed through each hole, creating a stitch which can be described as a running figure of eight. This means that if the thread is torn on one side, the stitch will still hold, unlike a machined lock-stitch which can be pulled out. The saddle stitch can only be done by hand. \r\n\r\nBefore each bag is constructed, I clean and polish the leather before conditioning it with a balm containing beeswax and natural oils.\r\nAdditionally, I take the time to sand, smooth, dye and wax all edges, giving a professional and complete look to the bag. \r\n\r\nDimensions are 4\" width, 13\" base, 5\" height short side, 10\" height long side and 10.5\" top and is made to be mounted on the left side. The dimensions are ideal for keeping a few essentials rather than carrying around a backpack just for your lock and gloves (I keep a 1.4m Oxford chain lock and a PacSafe helmet bag in there at all times). \r\n\r\nThe top flap is secured by two straps passing through a pair of heavy duty chrome roller buckles. The bag itself is attached to the bike at three mounting points with buckled leather straps (included). \r\n\r\nUnlike with the official Harley Davidson bag, passenger pegs can still be installed, but the mounting bracket will need to be brought forward using longer than stock bolts. Please see the following link for more details: http://xlforum.net/vbportal/forums/showthread.php?t=496023&page=3 \r\n\r\nI can fully customise the bags according to thread colour, buckles and leather colour. Please do not hesitate to contact me about pricing and options. \r\n\r\nI use this bag on my own 48, so I am fully aware of the level of quality we bikers require for our money. \r\n\r\nAs the bags are made by hand it can take up to fifteen working days for yours to be ready. \r\n\r\nFree postage if bought as part of a matching set with the Harley Davidson Sportster Solobag.\r\n","options":[{"id":29833551,"name":"Black","price":124.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34135596,"name":"Brown","price":124.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":6.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126276126/-/DSC01283.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126276126/-/DSC01283.JPG","width":1080,"height":810},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126281820/-/DSC01288.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126281820/-/DSC01288.JPG","width":1080,"height":810},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127641939/-/DSC01297.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127641939/-/DSC01297.JPG","width":677,"height":1080},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126212868/-/Brown-Black.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126212868/-/Brown-Black.jpg","width":250,"height":250},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127641960/-/threads.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127641960/-/threads.png","width":1248,"height":330}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6133317,"name":"Motorcycle","permalink":"motorcycle","url":"/category/motorcycle"}]}]
