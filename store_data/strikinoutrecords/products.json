The band had only one release, the 5 song “The All You Know EP” in 2007. They broke up soon after their EP was released and only played a handful of shows in their short existence. Members went on to play in and be involved with projects such as KTP, Transit, All Hands On Deck,  and more. Even though they weren't around long this one and only EP will hopefully leave some sort of mark, at least to a dedicated local fanbase.

The band was formed in the summer of 2004, and they put out a six song demo in late spring of 2005. It was well recieved and landed them on plenty of good CT shows among the likes of fellow natives The Distance, Palehorse and more. Their 7 song EP was recorded with Jay Maas at The Getaway Group (Shipwreck AD The Carrier, Soul Control) and released in February of 2007. The band has since remained fairly quiet but is currently writing new songs. Current members also play in Hostage Calm. Check them out.
