The flights were under constant threat from the Japanese and would fly for up to 32 hours non-stop. The crew and their 3 passengers would see two sunrises on their flights giving them the name of the Double Sunrise Flights. This documentary interviews the last remaining pilot from the Double Sunrise Flights, 93 year old Rex Senior. Rex recalls his times spent on the flights and how the crews were never recognized for what they contributed to Australiaâ€™s history. Narrated by John McNeill (Underbelly - The Golden Mile) and Directed by Daniel Bunker.\r\n\r\nIncluded is the following:\r\n\r\n- The Double Sunrise Flights Documentary \r\n   (28 min)\r\n- Deleted Scenes \r\n   (29 min)\r\n- Return of the Catalina Trailer \r\n   (2 min)\r\n- Return of the Catalina Preview \r\n   (5 min)\r\n- Rex Senior's eBook - \r\n   The Double Sunrise Flight\r\n- 3x Wallpapers\r\n- Printable A3 Poster\r\n- Printable A4 DVD Poster\r\n- Printable A4 Double Sunrise Certificate.\r\n\r\nPlus each DVD comes in it's own 'Top Secret' envelope which is sure to attract attention when it's given as a gift.","options":[{"id":40374822,"name":"Default","price":24.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122482407/-/DoubleSunriseFlightsDVD.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122482407/-/DoubleSunriseFlightsDVD.jpg","width":800,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5890188,"name":"DVD's & Videos","permalink":"dvd-s-videos","url":"/category/dvd-s-videos"}]}]
