He has a Bachelors of Fine Art degree in Graphic Design and a minor in Art History.\r\n\r\nMusic has always been a driving force behind a lot of the ideas that Klay puts on paper. In high school he picked up a guitar and learned a couple of notes until he eventually starting laying down beats on a drum kit. After graduating from college and moving to Seattle, there was no way that Klay could play drums in an apartment. The drums were sold and the money was used to purchase a pair of Technics MK1200's. Turntables were Klay's natural progression in music and also a way to keep his neighbors happy.\r\n\r\nWhether it be the music he listens to while working, the local venues he visits to see various music acts perform, or browsing through one of the many local record shops; music makes him tick.\r\n\r\nHaving done posters for theatre productions in school and an infatuation for all things music, it was inevitable that one day a fusion would become a reality. Klay has been making gigposters or \"showprints\" for local venues such as Chop Suey, The Showbox, Graceland, and The Crocodile Cafe.","options":[{"id":3560971,"name":"Default","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/8683491/-/an_elk.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/8683491/-/an_elk.jpg","width":225,"height":627}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":273164,"name":"Art Prints","permalink":"art-prints","url":"/category/art-prints"}]}]
