Layers of sound decompose amid (possibly channeled) whispers, shrieks, and moans. <i>Less than 10 copies remaining.</i>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://milamrecords.bandcamp.com/album/loki-bound-dream001\">Taste it here.</a>\r\n\r\n<b>Mare Cognitum: The Sea Which Has Become Known CS [DREAM002]\r\n$8.00</b>\r\n<i>Top Right</i>\r\n\r\nProgressive black metal with eyes to the stars from the concrete jungles of southern California.

Drawing from Western and Eastern esoteric traditions respectively, <b>Bleakwood</b> and <b>Ekadzati</b> apply the force of sound as a skillful means to guide and challenge the listener into liminal states and dark dreams. Their efforts move in counterpoint, nudging the listener through ravenous motion, crawling melodic stasis, dizzy rhythmic stuttering . . .\r\n\r\nCo-released with Tactical Solutions Recordings, the split is presented in a unique wingfold sleeve fastened with an obi strip which comes in one of five colors.

On this, his latest offering to date, Ayloss expands further on his experimentation with uplifting atmospherics and invites us to surrender our consciousness, if only for a while, to his musical netherworld. As epic as it is long, single song 'Kathikon' (i.e. 'duty' in Greek) both defies and re-defines the typical black metal blueprints introducing a post-rock-esque flair in its structure  with a rich instrumentation. For most bands this would mean a rather embarrassing prolapse into aimless noodling but Ayloss' knack for warm, expansive guitar narratives à la Wolves in the Throne Room ensures that this makes for a very addictive listen indeed. For the second part obscure extreme metallers Locust Leaves come forth with 'Promise'. I'm sure you've never heard of them but what they lack in reputation they make up for in technical dexterity. Above everything is the song's fluidity and sheer artistic 'out-there-ness' which seamlessly flows from one thematic to the next. Far from easily digestible music, this song demands from the listener to pay full attention; in return 'Promise' offers a unique musical journey which becomes more rewarding with every listen.\"\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.orderoftheta.com/releases.html\">Taste it here.</a> \r\n\r\n<b>Aerugo: Demo MMXII CS\r\n$8.00</b>\r\n<i>Top Right</i>\r\n\r\nTwo tracks of bleeding-raw black/doom.
