The samples come from rare soundtracks that were made in the ’50s and ’60s. This album transcends any kind of age discrimination because it sounds like it could have been released in the 60’s. With his sporadic, sampledelic selection of off-kilter instrumental with ridiculous bass, this is a tripped out project. It is weirdly a refreshing experimental Lo-Fi/Hi-Fi journey into the unseen world of other celestial beings. Just picture the Care Bears on a cloud with a beat machine and a bunch of rare albums, doing some serious head-nodding. You have never heard anything like this on planet Earth.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":9732736,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26868887/-/Tea_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26868887/-/Tea_3.jpg","width":350,"height":350}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1654062,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
