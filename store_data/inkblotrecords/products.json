Recorded themselves using an iphone and a knock off sm58 microphone, the record is intended to work as one piece of music, not as separate tracks. The result is a brilliantly minimalist but powerful recording. This release finds the band moving towards more abstract song structures but still retaining the mathy revolution summer-esque punk rock you've come to expect from Lancaster's favorite sons. The record comes on two different vinyl colors and includes a gorgeous 12 page 11x11 photo book.","options":[{"id":45037923,"name":"Red Vinyl (ltd to 100)","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":45037926,"name":"Flourescent Green/Yellow (ltd to 400)","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125384193/-/1994fuckit.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125384193/-/1994fuckit.jpg","width":350,"height":350},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125384223/-/1994lpbook.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125384223/-/1994lpbook.jpg","width":960,"height":720}],"artists":[{"id":5629,"name":"1994!","permalink":"1994","url":"/artist/1994"}],"categories":[{"id":191891,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"},{"id":191892,"name":"LP color","permalink":"lp-color","url":"/category/lp-color"}]},{"id":13601061,"name":"ANTILLES/STAPH \"split\" test press","permalink":"antilles-staph-split-test-press","position":2,"price":21.0,"default_price":21.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/antilles-staph-split-test-press","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-16T18:56:29.000Z","description":"hand numbered #3 out of 5 copies","options":[{"id":43616025,"name":"black","price":21.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124396149/-/antillesstaphtest.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124396149/-/antillesstaphtest.jpg","width":538,"height":419}],"artists":[{"id":9635,"name":"Antilles","permalink":"antilles","url":"/artist/antilles"},{"id":9636,"name":"Staph","permalink":"staph","url":"/artist/staph"}],"categories":[{"id":191890,"name":"7 inch","permalink":"7-inch","url":"/category/7-inch"}]},{"id":13601019,"name":"RAW NERVES \"we must be dreaming\" test press","permalink":"raw-nerves-we-must-be-dreaming-test-press","position":3,"price":21.0,"default_price":21.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/raw-nerves-we-must-be-dreaming-test-press","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-16T18:54:39.000Z","description":"hand numbered #3 out of 5 copies","options":[{"id":43615920,"name":"black","price":21.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124396026/-/rawnervestest.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124396026/-/rawnervestest.jpg","width":538,"height":469}],"artists":[{"id":43578,"name":"Raw Nerves","permalink":"raw-nerves","url":"/artist/raw-nerves"}],"categories":[{"id":191890,"name":"7 inch","permalink":"7-inch","url":"/category/7-inch"}]},{"id":6215973,"name":"Beau Navire | Lumens LP ","permalink":"beau-navire-lumens-lp-preorder","position":4,"price":11.0,"default_price":11.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/beau-navire-lumens-lp-preorder","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-05-17T21:44:24.000Z","description":"\"Lumens\" is Beau Navire's second full length release and will surely serve as a genre defining staple in hardcore.
