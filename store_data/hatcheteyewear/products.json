Going to college is sweet.. sometimes. The reason I brought up college is because in college you read lots of books. So many books in fact that your eyes start to droop, get bloodshot, before you know it, you are getting arrested because you look high..\r\n\r\nWell that never happened to me. You ask why? Because I used visine and performance enhancing wooden sunglasses while I read. BOOM! I wore the Understudy in Dark Bamboo through my semester of college and my eyes were fine, plus they made me smarter.\r\n\r\nThat is how I graduated after one and a half semesters. I know sweet right?\r\n\r\nUnderstudy wooden sunglasses in Dark Bamboo include:\r\n\r\n    Polarized lenses\r\n    A comfort fit design\r\n    Spring hinges\r\n    A soft protective pouch\r\n    A cardboard box\r\n    A bigger cardboardbox\r\n    A stress relieving bubble bag\r\n    A shipping label\r\n    A sticker that says Hatchet Eyewear\r\n    A piece of twine\r\n    A tag\r\n    Some tape \r\n\r\nYeah, I guess I failed to mention that Understudy wooden sunglasses in Dark Bamboo not only made me smart, but they made me cool. That is why I was the president of all the fraternities, played every position on our lacrosse team, and became the Dean of our university.\r\n\r\nI did so by showing everyone my intelligence and poise through demonstrating my Bamboo sunglasses and the positive effect they had on the environment. He was so impressed he quit his job, walked to China and became a bamboo-ologist.

I mean, let’s face it, they are great. They are great ON THEIR OWN. They don’t need to use anything as a crutch. Santa Cruz is an independent woman, she doesn’t need to pair up with anyone.\r\n\r\nCan you imagine peanut butter without jelly? Or America without obesity (that would be sweet)? NO! I can’t imagine a hot dog without a bun or a carrot with a celery stick. I wish I could imagine backs without body hair. But when I think about Santa Cruz wooden sunglasses in Zebrawood I don’t need to think about anything else.\r\n\r\nThe awesomeness of these wooden sunglasses are partly because of the stock:\r\n\r\n    Polarized lenses\r\n    A comfort fit design\r\n    Spring hinges\r\n    A soft protective pouch\r\n\r\nSanta Cruz wooden sunglasses in Zebrawood do not need another part. They are what they want to be and they do it on their own. If I could make any exception to this rule it would be that.
