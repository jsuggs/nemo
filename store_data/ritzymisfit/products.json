It is very durable and will not tarnish aside from the patina added purposefully to give the antiqued effect.\r\n\r\nThe “flaws” or “blemishes” or “imperfections” that I adore turn out to have some variation from piece to piece. The MINI’s, however are a little more uniform than the classic. So a third degree is less messy than it’s classic cousin.\r\n\r\nThere are approximately 3 categories of “character”.\r\n\r\nPLEASE READ before purchasing:\r\n\r\nCHARACTER:\r\nThe first degree of character is almost perfect. These are almost completely round, and even around the edges.\r\nThe second degree has more character, or flaws (which I personally love) and may be less perfectly round, and more rustic looking.\r\nThe third degree has a lot of character, in the way of roughness, (not sharp), inconsistencies, and uneven overflow of metal. Many of these are my ultimate favorites.

And it makes us breath-taking.\r\n\r\nRitzy Misfit has recently been seen in/on:\r\n\r\nSept. 2012 Beautiful Bride Magazine \"Fab Finds\" \r\nThe Bachelor \r\nBachelor Pad, on ABC (mini with pink crystal) \r\nThe Bachelorette, worn by Ali herself! (see other listings for examples) \r\nKendra Wilkinson from the girls Next Door\r\nAnd Jillian Harris on 2009 Bachelorette. (turquoise J) \r\nThere have also been many other unconfirmed sightings on amazing people!\r\n\r\nThis listing is for a stunningly original pendant; melted and stamped by hand. They are then painted, rubbed, sanded and buffed until at the peak of imperfect perfection!\r\n\r\nThey are each one of a kind pieces of art. No pendant can be completely replicated.\r\n\r\nThe “flaws” or “blemishes” or “imperfections” that I adore turn out to have a few degrees of roughness. For me, the rougher the better. Like myself. Ü\r\n\r\nThere are approximately 3 categories of “character”.\r\n\r\nPLEASE READ before purchasing:\r\n\r\nCHARACTER: \r\n-The first level of character is almost perfect. These are almost completely round, and even around the edges. \r\n-The second degree has more character, or flaws (which I personally love) and may be less perfectly round, and more rustic looking. \r\n-The third degree has a lot of character, in the way of roughness, (not sharp), inconsistencies, and uneven overflow of metal. Many of these are my ultimate favorites.\r\n\r\nPAINT: \r\nAmount of paint choices: \r\n1. Not so much \r\n2. Medium \r\n3. Lotsa \r\nAgain, this is relative and may vary. ☺\r\n\r\n****In the message to seller IN PAYPAL, or emailed to ritzymisfit@gmail.com please include: \r\n1. the degree of character \r\n2. the color you would like \r\n3. the amount of paint \r\n4. how you heard about us!****\r\n\r\nFeel free to be as specific as possible. I’ll do my best to make one you will LOVE, and the more I know, the closer I’ll be!\r\n\r\n**If we don't receive adequate details about your pendant in PAYPAL, we will need to contact you to get the information which may delay the production/arrival of your order.**\r\n\r\nPlease allow up to TWO WEEKS before items are shipped. We are usually ahead of that, but we give ourselves some wiggle room as I make each from scratch AFTER you order. :)\r\n\r\nA RUSH service is available; contact us at ritzymisfit@gmail.com for pricing and details.\r\n\r\nThanks so much and have a wonderful day! \r\nxx","options":[{"id":23032611,"name":"Default","price":33.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71356635/-/dinosaurs.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71356635/-/dinosaurs.jpg","width":300,"height":240},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71356691/-/classic_no_paint_k_NEW.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71356691/-/classic_no_paint_k_NEW.jpg","width":1000,"height":753},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71356675/-/Beautiful_Bride_Cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71356675/-/Beautiful_Bride_Cover.jpg","width":770,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71356765/-/RitzyMisfit_503.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71356765/-/RitzyMisfit_503.JPG","width":1000,"height":660}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3708379,"name":"Weddings/Bridal Party","permalink":"weddings-bridal-party","url":"/category/weddings-bridal-party"},{"id":2438809,"name":"Your Choice of Color","permalink":"your-choice-of-color","url":"/category/your-choice-of-color"},{"id":3694693,"name":"Symbols/ Pictures","permalink":"symbols-pictures","url":"/category/symbols-pictures"}]},{"id":6072825,"name":"WONKY Wax Seal Pendant - Color of Your Choice","permalink":"wonky-wax-seal-pendant-color-of-your-choice","position":24,"price":38.0,"default_price":38.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wonky-wax-seal-pendant-color-of-your-choice","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-05-01T04:59:44.000Z","description":"-Ritzy Misfit \r\n-Original wax seal necklaces\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ ENTIRE LISTING BEFORE PURCHASING**\r\n\r\nThis listing is for the WONKY pendant, in the color of your choice which is our largest pendant.

These are almost completely round, and even around the edges. \r\n-The second degree has more character, or flaws (which I personally love) and may be less perfectly round, and more rustic looking. \r\n-The third degree has a lot of character, in the way of roughness, (not sharp), inconsistencies, and uneven overflow of metal. Many of these are my ultimate favorites.\r\n\r\nPAINT: \r\nAmount of paint choices: \r\n1. Not so much \r\n2. Medium \r\n3.

As seen in the \"fab finds\" in September's Beautiful Bride Magazine!\r\n\r\nAlso great for Christmas Gifts, birthday's, baby showers, mothers day, etc! Buy a multiple listing and get one for each of the women you love!\r\n\r\nSee other listings for discounts on multiple pieces.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ ENTIRE LISTING BEFORE PURCHASING**\r\n\r\n-The original hand stamped wax seal pendants\r\n\r\nNo one is perfect, but we are all beautiful. These pendants give the feeling of being beautiful, unique and rough around the edges at the same time. They reflect the wonderful, flawed idiosyncrasies in us all. And it makes us breath-taking.\r\n\r\nRitzy Misfit has recently been seen in/on:\r\n\r\nBeautiful Bride Magazine's \"Fab Finds\" Sept 2012\r\nThe Bachelor' on ABC (many pieces)\r\nTexas Women on CMT (many pieces) \r\nBachelor Pad, on ABC\r\nThe Bachelorette, worn by Jillian and Ali \r\nKendra Wilkinson from the girls Next Door\r\nAnd Jillian Harris on 2009 Bachelorette. (turquoise J) \r\nThere have also been many other unconfirmed sightings on amazing people!\r\n\r\nThis listing is for a stunningly original pendant; melted and stamped by hand. They are then rubbed, sanded and buffed until at the peak of imperfect perfection!\r\n\r\nThey are each one of a kind pieces of art. No pendant can be completely replicated.\r\n\r\nThe personalized initial pendant is my ultimate best seller. It can be made into any letter you choose.\r\n\r\nThis piece is approximately the size of an american half dollar, and is quite substantial. For smaller sizes, see appropriate listings. :)\r\n\r\nThe “flaws” or “blemishes” or “imperfections” that I adore turn out to have a few degrees of roughness. For me, the rougher the better. Like myself. :)\r\n\r\nThere are approximately 3 categories of “character”.\r\n\r\n****PLEASE READ before purchasing:\r\n\r\nCHARACTER:\r\n\r\nThe first level of character is almost perfect.
