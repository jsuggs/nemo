What keeps us grounded from realizing the beauty, dreams, and inspiration within? This question arose as I contemplated the answers and slowly realized, for me it was fear.\r\n\r\nFear of doing what was calling within kept me grounded, fear of lack, not having enough money, qualifications, support, Know-How, fear...Fear seemed to pull at me and at times keep me grounded when I desired flight! This realization alone allowed for the release and knowing it's a choice each day - to fly.\r\n\r\nWhat keeps you from taking flight and spreading your fabulous colors in the sunlight?

I wanted to be more creative and follow my dreams but didn’t know how and felt like, at my age and w/a family, those dreams had passed me by. Boy was I wrong! After working w/Stephey I realized how I was the one who gave up on my dreams and how though they may not have taken the shape I thought - they are so coming true! I really love working with Stephey and consider her to be stellar support on my creative journey. She continues to be my go to when I need a dose of inspiration or an assertive nudge to get moving again. MG\r\n\r\n\r\nMy healing session with Stephey brought me answers and clarity I needed to thrive as an artist - I hated admitting I was suffering but I was. She taught me a valuable heartlink technique I use everyday to connect to my Angels and get clarity on my path. She also helped me to realize I was further along than giving myself credit - that made a huge difference in my confidence! That's what Stephey has given me most - the confidence to be who I am and the tools to live how I want. I'm not suffering from those negative thoughts anymore! EM\r\n\r\nI've been working with Stephey now for three months. I came to her because I wanted to be happier. I realized I was denying what my spirit wanted - to be an artist. Stephey has been working with me to create small changes I can take action on everyday - and I am and am feeling so much for alive! I look forward to our sessions each week! What a life saver and breath of fresh air! I recommend her if you're needing some direction in your life and art, she does both, which is what i need. Not only have I been feeling better, like a cloud lifted from my head but my art is infused with new beauty and added meaning - thanks to Stephey and her many ways to make a session fun and informative!

Each person has a life force. It is as real as any other part of our human system. It's just as real as our circulatory system that directs the blood flow to every cell of our bodies. The only difference is that we can't readily see, touch, or draw our energy system. It's rather something we experience.\r\n\r\nIntegrated Energy Therapy® (IET) is a powerful healing system with a result of personal freedom. IET releases negative experiences from our body (physical, mental, emotional, spiritual and karmic) allowing us to create a life we truly desire.\r\n\r\n<b>IET™ gets the \"issues out of our tissues\"</b>\r\n\r\nOur bodies contain 9 cellular memory areas, where negative energy gets stored in our muscles. Negativity actually gets \"integrated\" into our bodies. The 9 areas are located throughout our bodies starting at the top of our head to the bottom of our spine. If we feel good, pain free, energetic, secure about who we are and where we're going in life - All those cellular memory areas are free and in optimal health. Positive experiences fill our life with vitality. HOWEVER, if we feel insecure, sad, angry, are experiencing aches or pains - Those are the blocked areas needing release. Negative experiences clog our energy systems and life, just as French Fries clog our arteries.\r\n\r\nIET identifies each cellular memory area, and then removes the negative energies while imprinting positive energies. Through accessing the 9 points and without having to relive the trauma of the past, release of suppressed emotions and memories occur. Once these energy blocks release, they lead us to optimal physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health. This healing empowers us to live within our personal integrity. Freed of negative energy, we begin to live a life of joy, ease and renewed spirit.\r\n\r\n<b>WHAT DOES IET TREAT?</b>\r\n\r\nFor Many people feelings of being overwhelmed, anxious, and tired become a way of life. Living this way can lead to:\r\n\r\n    * Health problems headaches, digestive disorders, back & neck pain tension, & sleeplessness – among others\r\n    * Emotional problems such as anxiety, irritability, depression, panic attacks, isolation, and worry – among others\r\n    * Conflict in relationships, both personal & professional\r\n    * Being unproductive & unhappy at work\r\n\r\n<b>Benefits of IET</b>\r\n\r\nThese types of issues, which originate from physical, emotional and mental stress, often involve an unhealthy complex between mind and body. For example, the mind can run away with worry as the body looses appetite & feels energized through long hours of busyness. Alternatively, the mind decides to create change, “have a better life”, and the body rebels with exhaustion, flu, or headaches. Experiences described above are ideally suited for IET treatments.\r\n\r\n    * Releases tension and everyday stress that makes you feel tired, burned out and overwhelmed\r\n    * Creates a renewed sense of vitality\r\n    * Supports healing on all level – physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual\r\n    * Beings balance to your life, allowing you to enjoy a clear sense of purpose and direction\r\n    * Leaves you with a deeply relaxed calm state of being\r\n    * Empower you to create a life you truly desire\r\n    * Provides insight and inspiration as to your life purpose\r\n    * Removes you from the cycle of habitual behavior\r\n\r\n<b>Schedule your private session today!

A life with a free heart that listens from within and knows its true value and celebrates it by creating what is needed on and of the page - including \"creative time outs\".\r\n\r\nTitle: A Creative Time Out: Creating art off the page a black and white sketch\r\nDetails: 6x8 print\r\nimage: 5x7\r\n\r\nHow do you know when you’re procrastinating completing a project (or reaching a goal) verses when you need to indulge a creative time out by creating nothing but rest from the creative process all together?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question eluded me during my early years as an artist. During that time, I often felt victimized by creative blackmail the Muse employed frequently.\r\n\r\nHer threat was to leave me suffering creative constipation from artist’s block. I lived in fear of this threat, which often drove me to exhaustion by over working myself.\r\n\r\nI can remember feeling a sense of urgency to drop what I was doing in order to fulfill the presented idea. If I didn’t take immediate action, the inspiration would be lost forever because I didn’t catch it or seize the urgent moment. I use to lovingly refer to myself as being the muse’s bitch during that time.\r\n\r\nIt was a time of creative enslavement.\r\n\r\nFreedom came only after the realization I hated feeling held hostage creatively to, well, my creative process. This is when everything turned around. I began to create differently.\r\n\r\nI created a new creative process, one that allowed rest and supported engaging other aspects of life – off the blank page.\r\n\r\nIs your creative process currently working for you? Are you satisfied with your creations on and off the page? If so, what is working? If not, what needs refinement? What could you change? How could you create differently while bringing your vision to completion?\r\n\r\nAs an artist, if an idea isn’t working in paint or photography I simply rework it until, well, it WORKS. Often times the finished piece is better than originally envisioned. Have you experienced this within your creations?\r\n\r\nMost people don’t finish what they start.\r\n\r\nDo you give up on your ideas before realized or do you stay with them, going the distance until realization is yours? I stay with it. I’m devoted to bringing ideas to fruition until the concept is complete. Sometimes this means choosing to ditch the project all together and starting from scratch or deciding to move onto a different project all together. As Kenny Rodgers says, “You got to know when to hold ‘em and know when to walk away.”\r\n\r\nAs the creator I have control over the when it is complete and the how (the process) it is completed (so do you). The process is no different in creating the LIFE you truly desire.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf something in your life isn’t working and you find yourself wanting more time or sleep then rework your choices. Take a creative time out.\r\n\r\nCreate your masterpiece called life INCLUDING the process in which to create it.\r\n\r\nI began saying no to late night art binges and yes to sleep. I began saying no to anxiety and the fear that I must create it NOW or ELSE and yes to trust. I began to trust that the fields of inspiration are real and as an artist, I know where they are (you know where they are too) and how to reap the fruits of their visions.\r\n\r\nI realized I served creativity better when creating creative time outs.\r\n\r\nAre you feeling frustrated with your creations? Your LIFE? Do you feel held hostage creatively to your creative process? If so, remember, as an artist who is busy creating a LIFE, you can choose to rework your choices until your LIFE is working for you. Remind your self that often times the finished piece isn’t what you originally envisioned – it’s so much more!\r\n\r\nTake a creative time out and embrace the life you never planned on.  \r\n Gesture Drawing of female model: A study in movement VII\r\n\r\nGiclee Print on watercolor paper of original drawing created in black marker.\r\n\r\nPrint measures 6\" x 8\".
