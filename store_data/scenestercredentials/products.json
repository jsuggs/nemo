The Tanks feature a full steam ahead pounding style brought forth by the crushing bass of Adam Luksetich (Nethervoid), the over the top vocals and lyrics of Kevin Koppes (the dude wears mic guantlets!), and the drum wizardry of Joe \"The Madman\" Ross (weather is happening, swing by seven). In their own words, \"We live in Iowa City, IA. We're all originally from Dubuque, Iowa. We'd love to play a show in your town. Especially if we're on tour. We hope to tour a lot more in the future. It's ever-so-much fun.\" One of the best live bands we've ever had the pleasure of seeing. As for a sound, we think it sounds a little like if Shellac played nothing but Kiss covers. Fun, talented, and seriously fucked.
