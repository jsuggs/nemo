In Birdsall's hands, light takes on a thousand forms, whether inspired by the relentless vertical rays of the East African coast, a hazy palpable dawn over Samoa, or the silent light of the winter Northland that illuminates but does not warm. It is the essential aspect of light that is at the heart of Birdsall's art. It is the life he gives this light that has cast him to the forefront of Alaska's art community and beyond.","options":[{"id":9842483,"name":"Default","price":310.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50759649/-/triptic-cl.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50759649/-/triptic-cl.jpg","width":1000,"height":510}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1671516,"name":"Art Prints","permalink":"art-prints","url":"/category/art-prints"}]},{"id":2815511,"name":"Russia Alaska Reunion, Triptych  - Shipping Included","permalink":"russia-alaska-reunion","position":2,"price":160.0,"default_price":160.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/russia-alaska-reunion","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-10-22T13:09:43.000Z","description":"<B>\"Russia Alaska Reunion\" \r\nBARBARA LAVALLE\r\n\r\nThis  triptych print is comprised of three separate sheets with each image size 13.5\" x 22\"signed by artist</B>\r\n\r\nBarbara Lavallee is known for her happy people.
