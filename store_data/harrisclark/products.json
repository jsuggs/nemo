A few year ago we decide to blend a jar of their pecans with a half of cup on honey, set it in the window to see if the oil of the pecans would infuse the honey. Well, it worked and worked well. We've learned to place the pecan honey in a window seal encourages the pecans to release its oil and darken to honey.
