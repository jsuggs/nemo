The duo – husband and wife Owen and Vik Shirley – created sublime soundscapes that were complemented by Vik’s breathless vocal delivery. In 2007 their debut album “Winning Is For Losers” was released on Malicious Damage and it’s fair to say the sound of that album directly influenced the formation of our own little imprint, and the melodic aesthetic that we continue to champion to this day.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the label we made a commitment to the band that if at any stage they were ready to release more music, we’d love for them to become a part of our family. That commitment has been carried through to this year, where we are proud to announce the release of their sophomore effort ‘Hy-Brasil’, a truly beautiful set of songs that will soothe your soul.\r\n\r\n‘Hy-Brasil’ refers to a phantom island which was said to lie in the Atlantic Ocean, west of Ireland. An expedition to find the island was once launched from the band's hometown of Bristol. The band felt a connection to this journey - setting out to unknown territories when making the record. The ethereal nature of memory and time that permeates this myth runs through the album, played out in plaintive melodies and melancholy voices. \r\n\r\nThe album opens submerged in the echoes of the past, as hazy rhythms entwine laconic vocals to create a hypnotic effect on the listener. Layers of melody unfurl across minimal percussion before blossoming into an overwhelming wall of sound. With each track the album progresses into stranger, darker territories before your mental moorings finally break and leave you afloat in a blissful ocean of sound. Canola Tenderfoot’s sound is as timeless as the myths they embrace – a hidden gem suffused with a grace and eloquence that is something to be treasured.  \r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\n01.Setting Sail For Hy-Brasil\r\n02.Eleanor's Elegy\r\n03.Fade\r\n04.Histories\r\n05.I'm Not Sinking\r\n06.Token\r\n07.Semper Victrix\r\n08.Rebel Angel\r\n09.Karolijn\r\n10.Lock Out\r\n11.No Pasaran!\r\n\r\n<object height=\"18\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F12307042%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-hsU9s&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=tiny&amp;font=Arial&amp;color=272727\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed wmode=\"transparent\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"18\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F12307042%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-hsU9s&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=tiny&amp;font=Arial&amp;color=272727\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>   ","options":[{"id":46361223,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.99,"amount_with_others":2.99,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.99,"amount_with_others":4.99}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126269397/-/SLM099_Canola_Tenderfoot_Hy_Brasil_Front_Cover_Web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126269397/-/SLM099_Canola_Tenderfoot_Hy_Brasil_Front_Cover_Web.jpg","width":700,"height":700}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5661798,"name":"Releases","permalink":"releases","url":"/category/releases"},{"id":6505011,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":15432216,"name":"Canola Tenderfoot - Hy-Brasil (DL)","permalink":"canola-tenderfoot-hy-brasil-dl","position":2,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/canola-tenderfoot-hy-brasil-dl","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-09T09:19:04.000Z","description":"Way back in the mists of time at the turn of the century, before the creation of Slime Recordings, we were introduced to the music of a band called Canola Tenderfoot.

Conceived as a companion piece to that incredible document of the golden age of rave music, ‘Maru-Sō‘ follows on with four incendiary tracks that merge the heritage of electronic music into something altogether new and wonderful. \r\n\r\n‘Basstime’ thunders into being with cavernous drums and a bassline so gargantuan it will rattle your ribcage. Sci-Fi chords glisten under the hood, propelling the track forward with a sense of the cinematic, full of foreboding and dread.\r\n\r\n‘Circle Jerk’ envelops your brain stem with an insistent acidic groove, undulating into infinity with the singular purpose of making you move. Faint strands of mournful chords add an air of melancholy to proceedings as the percussion builds up into a gargantuan jacking rhythm.\r\n\r\n‘Calliste’ straps you in tight for a ride to the darkside with a body-popping electro groove and snapping percussion. Throwback melodies drop in and out of the mix to amplify the feeling you are trapped in an arcade machine somewhere around 1983.\r\n\r\n‘Boomhaur’ starts off with what sounds like a planet being unwillingly terraformed then descends into a relentless techno assault. Stark percussion overlays ominous rave stabs before unfurling into an acidic wig-out for the final furlong.  \r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\n1. Basstime\r\n2. Circle Jerk\r\n3. Calliste\r\n4.

The Parisian producer has been on a roll recently, working with the legendary Grems and tearing up sets at the hottest parties around France. Since completing his inaugural release for Slime, he’s also been hard at work in the lab cooking up some new beats for us – and he doesn’t disappoint with his sophomore effort, ‘Glasgow’. The acrobatic percussive style of the former has been refined into an exhilarating showcase of rhythm and melody that has no equal.\r\n\r\n‘Glasgow’ sparks into life with a disjointed groove that slowly unfolds into a dark tropical roller, soulful vocals woven into glittering melodies and kinetic percussion. The track snaps back and forth into hyperactive interludes of pressurised beats per minute for an energising ride to the dark side.\r\n\r\n‘Ideal’ drifts into existence built around a mournful chord progression, strapped to a slow motion R&B jam that is infused with a cinematic foreboding. Vocals are strewn across the mix like depth charges as the dramatic synth work elevates the track into something truly mesmerising. \r\n\r\n‘Whitney’ takes a foot off the accelerator for a low-slung number that exudes sensuality through every smooth pore of its structure. Languorous vocals permeate the mix as a narcotic funk groove pops and snaps through unexpected turns that jump start your synapses.\r\n\r\nOn the remix tip, up and coming London-based producer Lion Gonzalez toughens up the lead track with a heavyweight half-step, complete with fizzing atmospherics and sparkling keys. Fellow Parisian and labelmate Hybu steps up with a beautiful mutation of a track from Neue Grafik’s previous release, turning ‘Bauhaus’ into a stone-cold house classic, perfect for all discerning warehouses worldwide. \r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\n1.

Formed by Broken Lip from BSN Posse and fellow producer Energy Man, the pair combine cutting-edge beats with a melodic flourish for a fresh style that is pure sunshine. For their debut release on the imprint they deliver a beautiful set of tracks, backed up with some killer remixes from the extended Slime family.\r\n\r\n‘I’m Ready’ is built around a mournful sequence of chords moored to a bouncing garage beat. Soulful vocals add some weight to proceedings as the melody builds up into a heady brew of emotion. The track continually shifts forward with imperceptible sonic additions that keep your ears busy all the way.\r\n\r\n‘Free’ glides in on soft chords and bubbling percussion before unfurling into a gorgeous mix of shimmering atmospherics and shuffling beats. Saccharine vocals are liberally sprinkled on top to give the track a sweetness that keeps you coming back for repeat play.\r\n\r\nOn the digital flip, the lead track is taken to task by labelmate Kontigo, who deconstructs it into a half-step groove that gives the elements of the original acres of space to breathe. Swedish producer Totte takes on ‘Free’, twisting it into a full-on floor filler, replete with rave stabs, rolling beats and a mutated bassline that will begs for the wheel up.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\n1.

Bringing the bounce back that he applied to ‘Comin’ Back’, he comes correct again with a brace of killer dancefloor cuts that strip things down to the basics with a simple hook and a speaker-popping kickdrum.\r\n\r\n‘Shaolin’ gets straight to the point with a driving four to the floor, strapped to a looping melody. Shuffling percussion is dropped in on top to give proceedings some serious swing, and here less is most definitely more as the track rides the rhythm all the way.\r\n\r\n‘Curious’ takes things a little darker, with a skittering beat and echoing vocal snippets sprinkled over a seriously heavy bassline that will keep feet on the floor long after the lights go up.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\n1.

Having further refined his formula of silky smooth melodies across intricate percussive patterns,  here he presents four cuts that are charged full of emotion and beauty.\r\n\r\n‘Torn’ drifts in on plaintive chords and mournful atmospherics before dropping into bubbling percussion and cavernous sub-bass that adds some serious weight to the track. Glittering keys flicker over the surface with the lightest of touches, delivering a beguiling sense of melody.\r\n\r\n‘Vivid’ picks up the pace with a skittering percussive layer woven into a rising tide of chords. The beat rolls into a deadly piano hook that lifts this track up to the next level.\r\n\r\n‘Softly’ warms the vibe up nicely with a late night sultry house jam, sparkling keys and vocals working the mix all the way down into your heart and soul. Pure audio goodness.\r\n\r\n‘Monoform’ strips things back with a skeletal beat and faint chords interspersing soft female vocals across a rolling bassline for some no-nonsense, heads-down 4am dancefloor action.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\n1.Torn\r\n2.Vivid\r\n3.Softly\r\n4.Monoform\r\n\r\n<object height=\"18\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F11750050&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=tiny&amp;font=Arial&amp;color=272727\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed wmode=\"transparent\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"18\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F11750050&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=tiny&amp;font=Arial&amp;color=272727\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>   \r\n","options":[{"id":47397519,"name":"Default","price":2.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127029189/-/SLM094_DYP_Torn_Front_Cover_Web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127029189/-/SLM094_DYP_Torn_Front_Cover_Web.jpg","width":700,"height":700}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5661798,"name":"Releases","permalink":"releases","url":"/category/releases"}]},{"id":14632863,"name":"Clima - Today","permalink":"clima-today","position":8,"price":2.0,"default_price":2.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/clima-today","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-05T12:20:29.000Z","description":"Slime Recordings heads to Spain to welcome new recruits Clima to the label. Having already established themselves with an impressive collection of releases across a variety of imprints, the duo’s style traverses D&B, dubstep, garage and more with ease. A flair for melody is bolted to intricate drum patterns to produce a sound that is pure sunshine.\r\n\r\n‘Hombres Que Avanzan’ drifts in on hazy atmospherics and ethereal keys before sweeping into a laidback half-step. Subdued female vocals float through the framework of the track as it quickly transports you into a dream-like state.\r\n\r\n‘Today’ continues the horizontal vibes of the former track with soulful vocals and warm pads that are shot through with a sense of late nights drenched in summer sun. Sparkling percussion keeps the mood bubbling throughout as the rhythm takes over your soul.\r\n\r\n‘Tell Me One’ straps staccato vocal stabs to a snap beat whilst glittering keys spiral up around them.

Mournful chords and sweeping melodies sparkle across the surface whilst the bassline expands across playful keys.\r\n\r\nOn the digital flip, fellow label mate Akin re-constructs the original into a sparse meditation, with spacious chords harnessed on the back of a narcotic half-step rhythm.

With two killer singles under his belt in ‘Rolling’ and ‘Popularity’, the London producer has perfected a unique take on house music with a narcotic slow-motion feel that extrapolates the energy of the traditional four to the floor and twists it into something fresh and vital. Returning with the agenda-setting ‘This Ain’t Disco’ he has stepped his techniques up a notch to deliver a true dancefloor thriller.\r\n\r\n‘This Ain’t Disco’ sticks to the title’s statement throughout – it ain’t disco that’s for sure. What it is instead is a throbbing monster of a track, alternating through pulsating drums and a mammoth bassline into sparkling melodies and spaced-out chords. One thing is for sure though – it’s a guaranteed floor filler.\r\n\r\n‘Anyway’ sees Retrospekt team up with Polish producer Platkovksky for an altogether lighter affair, with soft pads and rolling percussion sweeping across staccato vocals and bass stabs.

The album garnered a lot of accolades, with Igloo Magazine calling it “a genuine work of substance” and Electronic Music Magazine describing it as “immensely satisfying”.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the success of the release, Slime has commissioned six producers to remix some of the key tracks on the album. The result is an intriguing selection from some of the most creative underground producers working today.\r\n\r\nFirst up we welcome Submerse back to the label. One of the most talented producers around, here he develops on the sound he has been cultivating on his Project:Mooncircle releases with a slow motion version of the lead track from the album, ‘Otherland’. Extrapolating all the original elements of the track and twisting them into something completely new and refreshing, it’s clear to see why he is so highly regarded as an artist.\r\n\r\n‘Otherland’ is taken into another direction by the legendary drum & bass producer Macc, who we have managed to coax out of retirement to tackle this remix. The original’s ethereal qualities are kept intact, but infused with truly astounding drum work and delicate melodies reconstructed with pin-sharp clarity for a mix that is truly special.\r\n\r\nFor the final remix of the lead track, Dublin-based producer Genetix twists the original into a shuffling deep dubstep roller replete with sparkling synths and cavernous low-end that will rattle chests and elevate minds.\r\n\r\nNext up, Bristol-based producer Lojik takes on ‘Clouds’. One of the stand-out tracks from the original release, it’s staccato downbeat rhythm is finessed into a bass-heavy groove with superb bars from Bristol MC Koast driving the beat forward alongside the sublime vocals of New York vocalist Winter.\r\n\r\nSwedish producer Petter B takes on the closing track from the album, ‘Synthesis’. The Drumcode artist manipulates the spaced-out style of the original into a rolling techno stomper where sparkling melodies are strapped to a heavy-duty groove with devastating results.\r\n\r\nCompleting the set Bristol-based producer Discord takes ‘Synthesis’ into altogether darker territory with a throbbing techno jam complete with acidic licks and snapping percussion that continually builds until the dancefloor will be in a frenzy.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\n1.Otherland (Submerse Mix)\r\n2.Otherland (Macc Mix)\r\n3.Otherland (Genetix Mix)\r\n4.Clouds (Lojik Mix)\r\n5.Synthesis (Petter B Mix)\r\n6.Synthesis (Discord Mix)\r\n\r\n<object height=\"18\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F10897454&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=tiny&amp;font=Arial&amp;color=272727\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed wmode=\"transparent\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"18\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F10897454&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=tiny&amp;font=Arial&amp;color=272727\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>   ","options":[{"id":45219579,"name":"Default","price":3.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125461761/-/SLM090_Materia_Atlas_Remixed_Front_Cover_Web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125461761/-/SLM090_Materia_Atlas_Remixed_Front_Cover_Web.jpg","width":700,"height":700}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5661798,"name":"Releases","permalink":"releases","url":"/category/releases"}]},{"id":14021322,"name":"Aaron Static - I Won't","permalink":"aaron-static-i-won-t","position":12,"price":1.0,"default_price":1.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/aaron-static-i-won-t","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-07T11:34:15.000Z","description":"Australian producer Aaron Static returns to Slime after his previous release ‘Reflections’ on the imprint showcased his incredible flair for melody across a wide spectrum of genres.

For his sophomore effort with Slime he delivers two cuts that have become firm fan favourites already.\r\n\r\n'I Won’t' sweeps in on a plaintive piano groove, wrapped around a gossamer percussive lilt that builds and builds into a truly beautiful garage roller.

Sharp percussion adds the backbone to the groove as it develops into a smooth summertime roller.\r\n\r\n'Again' drops back on the tempo with melodic keys and wistful vocals scattered in the mix. Packed to the brim with warmth and character the track builds relentlessly, taking the listener horizontal with it as it goes.\r\n\r\n'The Tide' toughens up with a harder rhythm and hypnotic beats. Subtle melodies intersperse the mix as the bassline locks in the groove and drives the track forward.\r\n\r\nFor the finale, London producer Barefoot extrapolates the best elements of the former track and straps it to a bubbling tropical house beat, fizzling percussion and undulating bass expanding out the core into something of a future classic.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\n1.44\r\n2.Again\r\n3.The Tide\r\n4.The Tide (Barefoot Mix)\r\n\r\n<object height=\"18\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F8745801&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=tiny&amp;font=Arial&amp;color=272727\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed wmode=\"transparent\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"18\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F8745801&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=tiny&amp;font=Arial&amp;color=272727\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>   ","options":[{"id":43325538,"name":"Default","price":2.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124190199/-/SLM086_Sker_The_Tide_Front_Cover_Web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124190199/-/SLM086_Sker_The_Tide_Front_Cover_Web.jpg","width":700,"height":700}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5661798,"name":"Releases","permalink":"releases","url":"/category/releases"}]},{"id":13260051,"name":"Fortay - Clouded Sounds","permalink":"fortay-clouded-sounds","position":17,"price":2.0,"default_price":2.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fortay-clouded-sounds","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-30T09:32:20.000Z","description":"Coming to us from Bristol by way of London, Slime welcomes aboard the talented new producer Fortay.

Invested with emotion, humour and personality, his music was light years away from our usual output but we simply couldn't resist his charms.\r\n\r\nThe resulting love affair brought 'Selected Acid Works' into reality, his debut long player for the label and the culmination of many years worth of time spent honing his sound in sweaty bedrooms and dark basements. Fast forward to this year, and Jeeroj is back with his sophomore effort 'Midnight Resistance', and the question is always the same – how do you follow up something that took ten years to make?\r\n\r\nThe answer is simple. Extract the formula and expand it into brand new galaxies of sound. 'Midnight Resistance' takes all of the charm of the former release and catapults it through brave new worlds – touching on italo disco, jungle, house, breakbeat, techno and of course lashings of acid. It shows a satisfying evolution to his sound and holds a promise for what's to come in the future.\r\n\r\n'Midnight Resistance' sounds like the soundtrack to some long-lost giallo masterpiece, ice-cold electro beats, slap-funk bass and marauding keys the companion to a scene of some leather-trousered maverick driving his roadster recklessly through neon-slicked city streets.\r\n\r\n'Sunday Drive' shuffles and undulates into being with a cavernous acid squiggle creating the sonic tentacle that slowly penetrates your cerebellum and squeezes your brain dry.\r\n\r\n'Sproket' drifts in on a haze of bucolic melodies, building up into an exhilirating labryinth of jungle rhythms that short circuits your brain back to it's pagan roots and will have you burning effigies of the old gods in next to no time.\r\n\r\n'Take My Pocket' sounds like the official anthem of the Nation of Cthulu, and rest assured when they awaken from their thousand years sleep and dredge themselves from the bottom of the sea this will be playing as they eat our souls.\r\n\r\n'Ambient Seagull' creates a warm ocean of sound in your mind, lapping up against your amygdala with profound results.\r\n\r\n'Could It Get Any Worse' takes the husk of Human League, stretches it to snapping point and then launches it into the heart of the sun. The resulting supernova shines radiation down on our faces as we look to the heavens whilst the sky burns.\r\n\r\n'Doubletto' straps a panic alarm of a kick drum to echoing atmospherics, inducing paranoia and jubilation in equal amounts within all those who hear it.\r\n\r\n'CSRD XVII' sounds just about as close to an anthem as you can get, if your idea of an anthem is a bottom-heavy acid freakout strapped to warehouse-grade rave music.\r\n\r\n'Mincely' sparkles with glittering keys and low rolling bass stabs before unfurling in the final furlong with a glorious jungle rinseout.\r\n\r\n'Space Lounge' brings proceedings to a close with laconic pads wrapped around a bouncing kick drum, spiked through the centre with melancholy acid lines, tweaks and bleeps. \r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\n01.Midnight Resistance\r\n02.Sunday Drive\r\n03.Sproket\r\n04.Take My Pocket\r\n05.Ambient Seagull\r\n06.Could It Get Any Worse\r\n07.Doubletto\r\n08.CSRD XVII\r\n09.Mincely\r\n10.Space Lounge\r\n\r\n<object height=\"18\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F8392059&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=tiny&amp;font=Arial&amp;color=272727\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed wmode=\"transparent\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"18\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F8392059&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=tiny&amp;font=Arial&amp;color=272727\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>   ","options":[{"id":40959909,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122486196/-/SLM081_Jeeroj_Midnight_Resistance_Front_Web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122486196/-/SLM081_Jeeroj_Midnight_Resistance_Front_Web.jpg","width":700,"height":700}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5661798,"name":"Releases","permalink":"releases","url":"/category/releases"}]},{"id":12437625,"name":"OTTO - Movement","permalink":"otto-movement","position":22,"price":1.5,"default_price":1.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/otto-movement","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-18T10:39:47.000Z","description":"Slime reaches it's 80th release, and with it welcomes to the label the mysterious producer O.T.T.O for a sublime odyssey into sensual house music.

Melodic flourishes trigger false memories implanted in your brain of neon-soaked nocturnal escapades in some tropical paradise.\r\n\r\n'Midnight'  takes an altogether bumpier percussive route, with garage drumwork creeping over echoing vocal snippets for a darker twist to the former track.

Stripping back the already skeletal framework he used for his last release to give the beat space to breath at an almost unprecedented level, he delivers a haunting essay into the hinterland of dark ambience.\r\n\r\n'Fume' sets the scene with an ethereal array of pads and keys interlocking to form an atmospheric opening sequence that compliments the proceeding tracks.\r\n\r\n'Heat' creaks into existence on a uneven bed of fractured drums and drunken keys. Hazy vocals pour through the gaps to give proceedings a solemn, melancholy edge. Deceptively simple it might seem, but on a heavy system the kick alone will rupture ribcages.\r\n\r\n'Circa' drifts in like mist across a dark land, glittering bleeps and narcotic melodies swept underneath with a creeping sense of foreboding.

Bodwan makes his debut here for the imprint but is no stranger to the scene, having turned out a handful of impressive remixes for other artists in his trademark inventive style over the past year. Bringing together multiple strands from house, garage, dubstep and beyond, he creates a compelling new sound that is rich with texture and emotion.\r\n\r\n'Above' drifts in on an ocean of soothing sounds, washing over a raft of percussive elements before the bassline rolls in and renders everything with a sun-blushed warmth. From here the song reaches shore, and wanders into a strange hinterland of haunting vocals and harmonies.\r\n\r\n'Apart' extrapolates the melancholy of the former track and distills it through a much tougher framework. Beats crystallize to diamond against a solemn piano solo before taking the track to the other side, with you along for the ride.\r\n\r\n'Someone (Makes You More)' brings a house rhythm to proceedings with startling effect, building layer after layer of vocals and melody across the span of the track with dizzying results.

Here he brings his precision-cut breakbeats to the fore with two superb slices of forward-thinking electronic music.\r\n\r\n'Sunblast' is a super smooth hybrid of house, garage and dubstep that is built around a looping vocal and cavernous bassline. Glittering bleeps and glacial pads add to the atmosphere as the rhythm draws you deeper in.\r\n\r\n'Non-Stop' raises the temperature with a subtle groove laid over tropical percussion and warm chords.

Here he builds on the raw, emotive power of that release by extrapolating the melodic essence of his previous work and pouring it into a harder, more focused style and sound.\r\n\r\n'Hazy' is built around an undulating column of percussion, bubbling over a laconic dubstep rhythm. Vocals extolling the virtues of a certain herb only serve to strenghten the heavyweight flex of this beat.\r\n\r\n'Slew' rolls in on eerie chords and bass stabs, before a narcotic house beat drops in to expand the sinister edge to this track. Clipped FX adds to the ominous atmospherics, leading you on a downward spiral into darkness.\r\n\r\n'Aight' lightens the mood with a retro house cut that feels like a long-lost warehouse classic, soulful vocals and scattershot percussion drenched over a raw four to the floor. \r\n\r\n'4Tres' brings proceedings to a close with a widescreen feel – cinematic chords and rolling beats strapped to a chimeric bassline that builds up to a melodic crescendo.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\n01.

Spectral atmospherics roll over a shuddering percussive rhythm, all held up by a serpentine bassline snaking it's way up your spinal column. Warped sirens and baritone vocals add the final flourish, but really it was game over for any dancefloor from the first few bars.\r\n\r\nTomb Crew step in on the flip to bring the heat with a twisted remix that can only be a product of their equally twisted minds.

Half-whispered vocals soar around the track like ghosts in the machine, adding to the mystery.\r\n\r\n'Duke' brings the heat with a jacking groove straight out of Chicago circa 1986, deconstructed for  the future with ethereal vocal embellishments and off-kilter piano stabs.\r\n\r\n'Future City Film Club' drops a relaxed 2-step shuffle over reverberating vocals and bubbling basslines.

Over a narcotic half-step rhythm, Koast delivers a heartfelt paean to hedonism taking its toll, whilst Winter adds her gossamer voice to proceedings, elevating the track into something solemn yet beautiful.\r\n\r\n'Grounded' evokes hazy summer nights spent in a neon-soaked metropolis, as live strings, guitar and brass coalesce into a laidback groove that exudes a rich sensuality.\r\n\r\n'Shallow Waters' goes south of the equator and turns the tempo up for a rolling house cut with live Rhodes and flute in a playful interchange. \r\n\r\n'Shadows' finds cavernous space in dubwise rhythms, with a booming sub-bass strapped to skittering beats and emotive chords.\r\n\r\n'Headspace' combines dub and techno textures with startling results, offering up an expansive galaxy of spectral sound to drift into.\r\n\r\n'Skylight' sees the return of songstress Winter to add sugar-sweet vocal textures over a gorgeous drum & bass rhythm that is full to the brim with sunshine.\r\n\r\n'Downstream' draws the listener down deep into a seductive house groove with live saxophone played with a mischievous touch by Startslow. \r\n\r\n'Ruins' is a joint composition between Materia and the highly-regarded Bristol producer Forsaken, who combine for an atmospheric slow house jam with a moody energy all its own.\r\n\r\n'Synthesis' completes the journey with a grand flourish, delving into tech-house territory for an epic nine minute excursion into interstellar rhythms that takes you off the edge of the world into ecstasy.\r\n\r\nAll physical copies come with FREE digital versions.\r\n\r\nDeluxe Edition includes : CD / LP / DL / Posters / Stickers\r\n\r\nTracklisting : \r\n\r\n01.Otherland [8:35]\r\n02.Clouds (featuring Koast & Winter) [4:59]\r\n03.Grounded (featuring Justin Lewis) [4:55]\r\n04.Shallow Waters (featuring Ben Wood & Paul Quinn) [7:21]\r\n05.Shadows [7:19]\r\n06.Headspace [7:04]\r\n07.Skylight (featuring Winter & Startslow) [7:20]\r\n08.Downstream (featuring Startslow) [5:26]\r\n09.Ruins (featuring Forsaken) [4:40]\r\n10.Synthesis [9:13]\r\n\r\n<object height=\"18\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F4722574&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=tiny&amp;font=Arial&amp;color=272727\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed wmode=\"transparent\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"18\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F4722574&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=tiny&amp;font=Arial&amp;color=272727\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>   ","options":[{"id":39030885,"name":"CD","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39030888,"name":"LP","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":39030891,"name":"Deluxe","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.99,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.99,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121149906/-/SLM070_Materia_Atlas_Front_Cover_Web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121149906/-/SLM070_Materia_Atlas_Front_Cover_Web.jpg","width":700,"height":700}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5661798,"name":"Releases","permalink":"releases","url":"/category/releases"},{"id":6505011,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"},{"id":6505041,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]},{"id":12098799,"name":"Latcha - Invisible","permalink":"latcha-invisible-ep","position":33,"price":1.0,"default_price":1.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/latcha-invisible-ep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-30T13:48:08.000Z","description":"Slime welcomes UK producer Latcha to the label after a string of impressive appearances on imprints such as Immersed Audio and Loft Party.
