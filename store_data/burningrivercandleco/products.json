Soy will create a full wax pool, eliminating the common 'tunneling' of candles, which leaves wasted wax around the edges. Soy is water-soluble, making clean-up easy, so your handcrafted ceramic tumbler can be safely reused.\r\n\r\n- Lavender: our lavender candle is crafted with pure lavender essential oil. This oil has a highly fragrant floral, herbaceous scent; filling space with a fresh floral aroma.\r\n\r\n- Lemongrass: a popular Asian herb, is popular for it's earthy, citrus aroma. The strong throw of this candle will provide a simple touch of clean fragrant notes to any room. \r\n\r\nThis candle is a collaboration with Gina DeSantis Ceramics.  Each container is made from porcelain clay and may vary slightly from the photo because they are handcrafted.\r\n\r\nThey measure approximately 3 inches in height and width.\r\n\r\nFind out more about Gina DeSantis Ceramics at http://ginadesantisceramics.com/","options":[{"id":40355847,"name":"Lemongrass in Cherry Blossom container","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40355850,"name":"Lavender in Cherry Blossom container","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40355853,"name":"Lemongrass in Faux Bois container","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40355856,"name":"Lavender in Faux Bois container","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122071767/-/il_570xN.480441444_oowy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122071767/-/il_570xN.480441444_oowy.jpg","width":570,"height":340}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5875179,"name":"Candles","permalink":"candles","url":"/category/candles"}]},{"id":12684003,"name":"Incense","permalink":"incense","position":2,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/incense","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-31T01:25:45.000Z","description":"Our scented incense are hand dipped and allowed to soak for a minimum of 72 hours.\r\n\r\nThis is for a package of 20, 11\" sticks packed in a seal-able plastic bag so it will continue to stay as fresh as the day it arrives.","options":[{"id":40354500,"name":"Patchouli","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40354503,"name":"Grass","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40354506,"name":"Tobacco Flower","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40354509,"name":"Nag Champa","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40354512,"name":"Sweet Sandalwood","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122274861/-/240.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122274861/-/240.JPG","width":1472,"height":1429}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5875182,"name":"Incense","permalink":"incense","url":"/category/incense"}]},{"id":12684135,"name":"Room Spray","permalink":"room-spray","position":3,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/room-spray","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-31T01:32:40.000Z","description":"Each spray contains 4 fluid oz in an amber bottle.
