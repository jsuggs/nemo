LEGO pieces are plastic, rigid, geometrically modular standardized units mass produced by man. Clouds are biomorphic, fluid, randomly shaped forms of water and ice produced by nature.\r\n\r\nHowever, what makes these extremes similar is their symbolic meaning. LEGO and clouds represent the creative dreams and aspirations of children of all ages.\r\n\r\nEach LEGO cloud sculpture in the series is titled after the word, \"cloud\" in a foreign language. This evokes the notion that LEGO is a universal toy and clouds are universal elements.\r\n\r\n+++ SIZE +++\r\nz\" length x z\" depth x z\" height\r\n\r\n+++ MEDIUM +++\r\nLEGO 2x4 bricks adhered together with permanent glue\r\n\r\n+++ ORIGINAL +++\r\nThis is an original sculpture signed by the artist.\r\n\r\n+++ EDITION +++\r\nThis sculpture is part of an edition.

The embedded RAM chips symbolize computer language. Communication streams have rapidly evolved in the last 20 years into an expeditious, instantaneous form of contact through the cold, impersonal, abstract means of technology. The white, hand-written language goes in the opposite direction. Its forms are inspired by elegant, handwritten Latvian messages on postcards from the early 20th century.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are commonalities between these subject matters. Both languages can be difficult to master. Despite the strong presence of technology in today's world, essentially no single person has mastered all the programming languages used to drive it. The Latvian language was chosen for this series because of its notorious reputation for being onerous to learn. This is further emphasized by the interpretative direction used in representing these Latvian postcards through abstracted, sumptuous curvatures and rhythmical delights.\r\n\r\nIt's in the representation of rhythmical delights that both subject matters geminate. Both forms feature repetition of shapes and forms found in the exact, rigid quadforms of the RAM and the elegant, ascenders and descenders of the handwriting.\r\n\r\nAlso, both languages studied here can die off with the passage of time. In fact, thousands of programming languages have come and gone in the last 50 years. The languages of eastern Europe have seen their share of dialects come and go during their tenure.\r\n\r\nThe RAM and handwriting contrast and compare in various symbolic and formal ways, thus demonstrating the powerful range and capabilities of mankind to create language.\r\n\r\n+++ SIZE +++\r\n9.125\" wide x 12\" high x 1.5\" deep\r\n\r\n+++ MEDIUM +++\r\nRAM, screws, enamel paint on rescued wood\r\n\r\n+++ ORIGINAL +++\r\nThis is an original sculpture signed by the artist.\r\n\r\n+++ GUARANTEE +++\r\nThe artist has personally created and signed this sculpture so you are guaranteed the highest quality art.
