Loosely based on the U.S. Civil War, using that past horror as a vehicle for expressing personal angst, while never letting themselves lose touch with the present. Or, perhaps more importantly, their sense of off the wall black humour.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest albums in recent memory out now on Merok. This version is the CD, but we also have it on vinyl and featuring a FREE download of the whole album if you click here:  http://merok.bigcartel.com/product/titus-andronicus-the-monitor-double-vinyl-lp-with-free-download-code\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":7155101,"name":"Double L.P","price":11.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.99,"amount_with_others":2.99,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.99,"amount_with_others":3.99}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/18811511/-/titusart.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/18811511/-/titusart.jpg","width":452,"height":448}],"artists":[{"id":4937,"name":"Titus Andronicus","permalink":"titus-andronicus","url":"/artist/titus-andronicus"}],"categories":[{"id":158523,"name":"Twelve Inch Vinyl","permalink":"twelve-inch-vinyl","url":"/category/twelve-inch-vinyl"},{"id":217281,"name":"Albums","permalink":"albums","url":"/category/albums"},{"id":217282,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]}]
