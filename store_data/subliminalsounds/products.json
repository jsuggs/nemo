Originally released during the summer 1973 on the obscure Gump label. Powered by a C-3 organ, Ludwig kit and 50-watt Marshall head with a home-built cabinet, the skilled 3-piece band (not a quartet that the band name would have you believe) absolutely soars on this record blasting away fantastically. The delicate use of the studio echo-chamber lends a magical, gossamer reverb to the whole album's sound.

From the original master tapes and with the original artwork, including previously unpublished archival pictures and liner notes. The album contains a mysterious, shamanistic and highly psychedelic  “folk music” infused with incredible soundscapes of derailed fuzzed out violins, soaring guitars, rattling hand percussion, droning vocals and pulsating bass rhythms. Originally released in 1972, the album sold 300-400 copies and was then withdrawn and the reaming copies discarded making Jola Rota a much rumored and sought after Swedish droned-out and mesmerizing psychedelic artifact. The legendary Swedish musicians on this album include Pugh Rogefeldt, Göran Lagerberg, Mats Glenngård and Thomas Netzler.","options":[{"id":42030486,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":13.5,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":13.5,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":13.9,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":7.2,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":13.9,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.35,"amount_with_others":8.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123047673/-/JolaRotacover-small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123047673/-/JolaRotacover-small.jpg","width":709,"height":711}],"artists":[{"id":226872,"name":"Joakim Skogsberg","permalink":"joakim-skogsberg","url":"/artist/joakim-skogsberg"}],"categories":[{"id":6040671,"name":"Vinyl LP","permalink":"vinyl-lp","url":"/category/vinyl-lp"}]},{"id":13075407,"name":"Resan LP","permalink":"resan","position":3,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/resan","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-20T20:12:13.000Z","description":"(Swedish price ca 220 kr) \r\n\r\nLimited edition 500 copies Facsimile exact reissue with a in-depth biography written by The Amazing / Dungen lead guitarist Reine Fiske and previously unpublished photographs.. The colourful and turbulent late 1960’s created a ground for a world-spanning counter-culture and musical phenomenon that swept all over Europe. In Sweden and in Stockholm specifically, the sign of those times gave rise to diverse politics, anarchistic and playful happenings that all intertwined eventually giving birth to a rather small but highly prolific and unique musical scene. Resan (The Trip) was surprisingly released on the Swedish CBS subsidiary label Epic in 1973 and is the rarest of all the major-label releases within the Swedish psychedelic/progressive era. It has been seen as continuation of the legendary Swedish Life album as it features all the former Life band members.  The Resan (The Trip) crew all lived together in a hippie commune outside of Stockholm. The album represents a unique and almost hidden part of the most “heady” Stockholm psychedelic-rock-history. The uniqueness and rarity of Resan (The Trip) is in its blissful but at times dark atmosphere. Strong composition with full band electric instrumentation including some stellar fuzz guitars, spacey flutes etc. Pretty much everything you could wish for in a record like this. The album’s rather splintered musical palette is something of a perfect but peculiar mix of preaching hippie-naivety rooted in the psychedelic late 1960´s, though clearly coming of age in the slightly darker 1970´s.","options":[{"id":41734515,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":13.5,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":13.5,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":13.9,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":7.2,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":13.9,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.3,"amount_with_others":8.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123059817/-/RESAN-FRONT-KORR.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123059817/-/RESAN-FRONT-KORR.jpg","width":480,"height":484}],"artists":[{"id":226959,"name":"Resan","permalink":"resan","url":"/artist/resan"}],"categories":[{"id":6040671,"name":"Vinyl LP","permalink":"vinyl-lp","url":"/category/vinyl-lp"}]},{"id":13075932,"name":"Baby Grandmothers 2xLP","permalink":"baby-grandmothers","position":4,"price":27.5,"default_price":27.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/baby-grandmothers","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-20T20:44:21.000Z","description":"(Swedish price ca 239 kr) \r\n\r\nBaby Grandmothers were a short-lived Swedish band, but one of the most prolific and unique psychedelic, modal, experimental power-trios to emerge out of the Scandinavian psychedelic underground-scene in 1967. Although hailing from Stockholm, Sweden, they only released a single in Finland, which has since become one of the most sought after pieces of vinyl from the era. Baby Grandmothers were formed out of the legendary R&B / beat band T-Boones in the summer of 1967. T-Boones are probably best known for their “At the club/King of the Orient” single which is one of the best, and most collectable, out of the Swedish garage beat-era. Guitar-wiz Kenny Håkansson joined the band in 1965and with the group down to a trio they drifted into the psychedelic sounds of the time and in August 1967 released the single “I Want You”, which definitely was the first hard-rock recording ever made in Sweden. The band was then re-christened Baby Grandmothers by the co-founder of the newly opened psychedelic club Filips, for which he needed a house-band. Filips was the legendary breeding ground for bands such as Hansson & Karlsson, Pärson Sound, as well as orgiastic all night jams with foreign luminaries such as Jimi Hendrix and the Mothers of Invention. Baby Grandmothers also supported Jimi Henrix on his Swedish tour in 1968 and then turned into Mecki Mark Men, who became the first Swedish rock band to tour the US. Founding member Kenny Håkansson went on to form the highly influential Kebnekajse, who created the Swedish electric folk psych sound. This unique collection brings live-recordings made at Filips, their impossibly rare single and a rare live recording made in Finland.

This 2-CD set presents the most remarkable Swedish underground band, known in a later incarnation and continuation as International Harvester and Träd, Gräs och Stenar (Trees, Grass and Stones), and features both intricate studio recordings and orgiastic live performances. Pärson Sound never released any records in their time and that is why a very few have heard about them at all. The recordings date from 1967/68 while the band explored unknown musical territory as well as inner- and outer space. In 1968 they were invited by Andy Warhol to play at the opening of his exhibition: \"Screens, Films, Boxes, Clouds and a Book\", at the museum of Modern Art in Stockholm and also opened for the Doors. Influenced by the musical concepts of Terry Riley, Pärson Sound worked at discovering and perfecting their own unique approach towards the mixing of rock and minimalism. They created some of the most remarkable psych- trance- drone- pre-noise music- rock sounds ever recorded. Pärson Sounds music described contexts, interplay and organic growth and shaped a conception of the world - an opposite of fragmentation, individual achievements and intellectual construction. This world was to be perceived as one body, a whole of inviolable parts. The minimalist repetition with slight changes gives associations of a slow growth, of cyclic process, of breathing, pulse, life, movement and machines. The persistent repetition gives the listener an opportunity to discover the sounds, to meditate, to go into the music, join the same journey. Many times one can discover a relationship with music of other cultures. In comparison the music of the Western world can feel cursory, unreliable - as a fear of entering deep into feeling. Pärson Sound's compositions often consist of harsh structures - a rhythm pattern with ostinato bass, a melodic figure - which forms a base for improvisation. Other songs have a more thoroughly elaborated structure that still leaves room for variation. The moment, the audience, the location formed their music. Their key phrase was \"We, Here and Now!\" With time, the music came to have an increasing \"religious\" or shamanistic streak - with a raised demand of intensity, presence and warmth - a striving for euphoria and ecstasy. The bands psychedelic approach towards music is so fresh and vital that it transcends time.
