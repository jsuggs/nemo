He was a beautiful Crystal Blue. As quick as he was there, he was gone.  Tucked back under my bed, never to show up in my room again.\r\n\r\nIt was such a beautiful way to be introduced to the Spirit World.  He was so inviting and one of the most beautiful things I had ever laid eyes on!\r\nThru my childhood and teenage years, these kind of happenings were just part of life.  But since they weren't talked about openly, I tried to keep them to myself as much as i could.\r\n\r\nFast forward to my life now and I am proudly open about my spirituality. I surround myself with a healthy group of like-minded individuals and am so grateful to be supported by my family  I give readings, do house cleansings and do animal communication to those who seek out my services.\r\n\r\nI feel very fortunate to do what I do.\r\nI feel like my life is blessed and every day I am on a quick path to fulfilling my life's purpose.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of my services.\r\n\r\nOne Question Email Reading.  $15.00\r\nPlease keep it to the ONE Question you would like to focus on.\r\nAllow 72 hour response time after sending your payment. Thank you.  \r\n\r\n30 Minute In-Person Reading - $40.00\r\nThese readings are conducted at my office in Enumclaw, WA.\r\nI will cover as many questions that you would like to focus on in the 30 minute time period.  Payment required to hold reservation.  After payment has been received, you will be notified by phone to schedule your reservation.\r\n\r\nAnimal Communication - $70.00  \r\nThese readings are always fascinating and fun!  Because our animals are reflections of ourselves, this reading will most likely involve reading of your animal and yourself.  I usually conduct them at the animals home so that they are more relaxed and easier to communicate with.  This reading lasts about an hour depending on the detail and how many questions you have. Payment required to hold reservation. After payment has been received, you will be notified by phone to schedule your reservation.\r\n\r\nHouse Cleansing and House Reading - $70.00  \r\n Do you have a home or office that has some unexplained \"feelings\" in it or unexplained \"happenings\"?  I will walk thru every space in your home, record if I see or feel any spirits and then give it a cleansing with sage and chime vibrations.  On average this will take two hours to complete. I travel to your location and do this in person.  Payment required to hold reservation.
