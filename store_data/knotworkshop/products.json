Maybe one who will remember happily the days of the original NES? Truth be told I'm old enough to remember Atari... but yeah, we'll leave it at that.\r\n\r\nI remember hours and hours in my friend's basement playing Super Mario Bros. I was so jealous as I didn't have a Nintendo. When I finally got one, I had it hooked up to a black and white tv. And played Zelda forEVAH! No game these days can match the pure joy of those first NES home video games. I still pretend to have a sword and try to save Zelda on occasion. I also jump on mushrooms and pack our luggage with increasing speed in the back of the car. My kids think I'm insane. \r\n\r\nIf you would like this item customized in any way, I'd be happy to do so. We can even put your loved one's names instead of the NES games if you'd like! Please just send me a message so I can create your own unique design! If I don't get back to you right away, be patient. I'm probably playing Zelda.\r\n\r\nMug is microwave and dishwasher safe. Ink is heat-set but please do not use abrasives on the drawn surface.\r\n\r\nNote, mug will be made to order so may vary slightly from photo.\r\n\r\n***Also, shipping cost is due to mug weight. These are the old fashioned, heavy duty diner mugs. They hold about 8 oz but weigh over a pound each! If you get tired of drinking coffee you can use this as a light gym weight. :)***\r\n\r\nWant to see some more funny crap?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://knotworkshop.bigcartel.com/products\"><u>Shop here</font></u></a>","options":[{"id":42688425,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":12.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":20.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123747717/-/Nintendo_Heart_EDIT_6.jpg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123747717/-/Nintendo_Heart_EDIT_6.jpg.jpg","width":972,"height":972},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123747696/-/Nintendo_Heart_EDIT_2.jpg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123747696/-/Nintendo_Heart_EDIT_2.jpg.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123747699/-/Nintendo_Heart_EDIT_3.jpg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123747699/-/Nintendo_Heart_EDIT_3.jpg.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123747702/-/Nintendo_Heart_EDIT_4.jpg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123747702/-/Nintendo_Heart_EDIT_4.jpg.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1896409,"name":"All Funny Mugs","permalink":"all-funny-mugs","url":"/category/all-funny-mugs"},{"id":3495995,"name":"Nerd Mugs","permalink":"nerd-mugs","url":"/category/nerd-mugs"},{"id":5209116,"name":"Ceramic Mugs","permalink":"ceramic-mugs","url":"/category/ceramic-mugs"}]},{"id":13002105,"name":"Funny bracelet Doctor Who Eleven Matt Smith aluminum adjustable brushed silver tone mens womens","permalink":"funny-bracelet-doctor-who-eleven-matt-smith-aluminum-adjustable-brushed-silver-tone-mens-womens","position":2,"price":16.0,"default_price":16.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/funny-bracelet-doctor-who-eleven-matt-smith-aluminum-adjustable-brushed-silver-tone-mens-womens","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-16T13:41:38.000Z","description":"Brushed silver tone bracelet in lightweight, adjustable, affordable aluminum- hand stamped with \"eleven is my favorite\"\r\n\r\nI assume you're reading this because you understand what 'eleven is my favorite' means.

TARDIS repair?)?\r\n\r\nWhile this isn't an exhaustive list, it will help in your search.\r\n\r\n1) We usually don't go out on Saturday nights. And in fact on many other nights we are on the internet discussing episodes we've seen, we've yet to see, and/or who may be playing a particular character or writing a particular episode.\r\n\r\n2) We think bow ties are cool.\r\n\r\n3) When we walk into rooms and say stuff like 'wow it's bigger on the inside' we laugh- even though it's not funny at all to anyone else.\r\n\r\n4) All our screwdrivers are sonic. As well as our pens, forks, lipsticks- anything that can be held in the hand and withstand whirly noises.\r\n\r\nThere are many other ways to distinguish us. But those should be good enough. And if you see us, make sure you talk to us right away- as we could depart quickly to travel in time with our Doctor. No, not in an ambulance. Not that kind of doctor.\r\n\r\nRing is 1/2\" wide and made of lightweight aluminum- a metal that won't tarnish! Yay! And it's especially great if you're buying for a gift as it's far less a nuisance than sterling silver or nickel on sensitive skin. \r\n\r\nYour ring will be made to order so it may vary slightly from the photos. The handmade to order nature of this item makes every ring one of a kind!\r\n\r\nPlease make sure to let me know your size. Most folks will need the medium, but for a man or maybe a thumb you may want to size up. Ring is adjustable to fit most. \r\n\r\nI'm also very happy to take custom orders.

Not as adults. It's much funnier to have a mug that has 'I'm farting' on it. Really. I've done research and studies and shit. I can show you the graphs if you'd like.

If you get tired of drinking coffee you can use this as a light gym weight. :)***\r\n\r\nWant to see some more funny crap?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://knotworkshop.bigcartel.com/products\"><u>Shop here</font></u></a>\r\n","options":[{"id":30248849,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":19.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":12.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":19.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":7.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":20.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94976335/-/Sugarlock_Diner_EDIT_2X.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94976335/-/Sugarlock_Diner_EDIT_2X.jpg","width":999,"height":999},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94976567/-/Sugarlock_Diner_EDIT_1X.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94976567/-/Sugarlock_Diner_EDIT_1X.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94975103/-/Sugarlock_Diner_EDIT_3.jpg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94975103/-/Sugarlock_Diner_EDIT_3.jpg.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94975047/-/Sugarlock_Diner_EDIT_4b.jpg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94975047/-/Sugarlock_Diner_EDIT_4b.jpg.jpg","width":917,"height":917}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1896409,"name":"All Funny Mugs","permalink":"all-funny-mugs","url":"/category/all-funny-mugs"},{"id":3817779,"name":"Funny Tea Mugs","permalink":"funny-tea-mugs","url":"/category/funny-tea-mugs"},{"id":5209116,"name":"Ceramic Mugs","permalink":"ceramic-mugs","url":"/category/ceramic-mugs"}]},{"id":6791141,"name":"Hobbit Wall Art Home Decor hand embroidered black white ","permalink":"hobbit-wall-art-home-decor-hand-embroidered-black-white","position":22,"price":32.0,"default_price":32.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/hobbit-wall-art-home-decor-hand-embroidered-black-white","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-25T21:54:59.000Z","description":"\"Why O Why did I ever leave my hobbit-hole?\" in black cotton, hand embroidered on real wool felt in 5\" hoop.\r\n\r\nWhy did I leave my hobbit-hole?

And when you're drunk it's hard to tell which glass belongs to which person. Let these wine warmers help out. Granted since you could be described as both a drunk and a lush you might get confused.

Have they invented a zombie vaccine and no one told me? Read on.\r\n\r\nCustomers have been asking me for ages to make an item to include in their Zombie Apocalypse Survival Kit. Ask and you shall receive. While this cozy won't turn the beverage inside your mug into a zombie vaccine, it's probably good to have a label just in case one becomes developed. That way, during a zombie apocalypse, no one chugs it thinking it is just a regular cup of joe, wasting the entire supply of vaccine in one gulp.\r\n\r\nNow if we want to get really geeky we can argue whether a vaccine could really exist to prevent zombification. But I won't bother wasting your time with that here. What I will say is that *if* one were to be developed, this cozy is a necessity during a zombie apocalypse.

These are the old fashioned, heavy duty diner mugs. They hold about 8 oz but weigh over a pound each!

That's a damn fine snack.  Or meal.  Or diet.  I'm not a big fan of cherry pie though.  I love pie, especially at Thanksgiving.  But cherry pie?  Not so much.

I guess I think the idea of going around the planet killing people is entertaining.  Kind of warped.  But really I just like the martinis, the beautiful cars, and the baccarat. How does one baccarat anyway?  I'm not sure anyone actually knows.  It's probably only secret spies who play it.  They all pretend they know what they're doing just to spy on one another. \r\n\r\nAnywho, I'm sure James Bond drinks tea even though I don't think he's ever done it in a film.  But that's because he's quite clearly an alcoholic.  Have we ever seen Bond drink anything but martinis and champagne?  He is a highly functioning booze hound.  Probably how he can live with having killed all those powerless, low paid henchmen.

This is set in a 30mm x 40mm oval silver plated bezel on 20\" silver plated cable chain with spring clasp.\r\n\r\nOkay I don't think time lords probably wear a necklace announcing to everyone that he or she is in fact a time lord.  And if you have the series reboot as part of your Doctor Who canon you'd know that the time lords are nearly extinct.  But for that reason alone I think it best that all time lords identify themselves.  It's sort of like drawing a fish in the sand for Christians during times of persecution.  But most of us don't live near a lot of sand.  And when you think about it, if there's lots of sand, there's little chance of having a stick to draw in it with.  Which means you have to use your hand and then get sand under your fingernails.  Blech.\r\n\r\nSo long story short, wear this necklace and should you stumble upon any actual time lords they'll think you're one too.  And then they'll not ask any questions at all and instead just take you in their TARDIS to the next time lord convention.\r\n\r\nNote, pendant is not water resistant so please don't wear it if you plan on bathing.

I'll steal someone else's definition:\r\n\r\nFrom wikipedia:\r\nSláinte (slahn-chə) is a word literally translating as \"health\"[1] and is commonly used as a drinking toast in Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\nI don't think that pronounciation is completely accurate. I think it doesn't have enough slurring in it. \r\n\r\nWho doesn't need this cozy? When you've barfed and then wiped your face with your palm, you need a bit of extra grip on your glass, right? This cozy is that grip. And it makes you irish even if you're not. And who doesn't want to be Irish? Well, probably the English, but that's a long story.\r\n\r\nThis cozy is shown on a pretty standard pub beer glass with 12 ounces of liquid in it. It's an approximately 16 oz glass if filled to the very, very top. However, cozy should stretch to fit most any pub glass.\r\n\r\nif you'd prefer something custom on this cozy, just send me a message. I'm sober most days and can work with you on a personalized item. Also note that cozy is made to order so please expect some slight variation.\r\n\r\np.s. lager and pint glass are not included... unless you visit NC.

Please do read on.\r\n\r\nYour ipod/iphone is trendy. Your music is trendy. You only download the trendiest apps. Why shouldn't your case be trendy too? Nothing's as trendy as a mustache my friend. I don't know why but facial hair is in. It's actually out. Facial hair growing in is probably some kind of disorder.\r\n\r\nThis case is all wool and will keep your gadget from scratches and dirt. It will even cushion it upon a fall. I have dropped mine many a time and don't even hear a crack as it hits the floor because the wool is like a cushion. And bonus is that if the screen gets fingerprints on it, you can simply use the case itself to wipe it down. The soft yarn works great.\r\n\r\nApproximately 4.5\" long and 2.5\" wide. Should fit most standard size ipods, ipod touch and iphone. Please send me a message if you'd like one sized for a Nano or Shuffle or some other specific gadget. I'd also be happy to make this item in a different color. Just send me a message and I will be thrilled to make your own unique design.

How pointless.  Not to mention ugly.\r\n\r\nI am sure it's a sign of me rapidly approaching middle age. But I am starting to think gnomes are really cool. I even purchased a few for my front yard. The plastic flamingo can't be far behind.\r\n\r\nI'm not certain why I find gnomes appealing. I'm not normally into short men, nor men with beards.

I can only think of two kinds of people.  Those who don't know what an elf is and those who are stupid.  Cause if you're an elf you get to have sex with Legolas.  It's worth it to have pointy ears and everything.  Even if you are a man.  Who wouldn't go gay for Legolas?  Even the Pope would.  He may have already in fact.\r\n\r\nSo the next best thing to being an elf and screwing Legolas is this necklace.  I know.  It's quite a distant fricking second.  But it's the best I got.  Tell me your name (in the notes portion of paypal) and I will embroider it in Elvish on this pendant.  You can also pick a color other than black thread if you'd like.

That counteracts all the epic power your regular epic behavior creates.\r\n\r\nNote, pendant is not water resistant so please don't wear it if you plan on bathing.

Not literally though. Well I guess you might use it if you were literally getting buggered but only for reasons that are too dirty to write about here.\r\n\r\nPocket Plain Notebooks with ruled (lined) pages, each with a heavy duty cardboard cover with visible stitching on the spine.

It's only 4\" so it's big enough to state in no uncertain terms that you too love 'fuck' but not so big that you could break any signage laws in your town.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to customize this hoop in any way I would be happy to do so.

Note- item will be made to order so please expect some variation.\r\n\r\n*Any mug cozy can be made into a bottle/can or travel cup cozy for only $2.00 more.\r\n\r\nWant to see some more funny crap?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://knotworkshop.bigcartel.com/products\"><u>Shop here</font></u></a>","options":[{"id":21462941,"name":"Regular Mug","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21462943,"name":"Travel Mug","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21462945,"name":"Bottle/Can Koozie","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.25,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63755341/-/STFD_regular_mug_redux_EDIT_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63755341/-/STFD_regular_mug_redux_EDIT_2.jpg","width":853,"height":853},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63755349/-/STFD_regular_mug_redux_EDIT_3b.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63755349/-/STFD_regular_mug_redux_EDIT_3b.jpg","width":853,"height":939},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63755317/-/STFD_regular_mug_redux_EDIT_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63755317/-/STFD_regular_mug_redux_EDIT_1.jpg","width":854,"height":853},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66664217/-/STFD_travel_Redux_Again_EDIT_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66664217/-/STFD_travel_Redux_Again_EDIT_1.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1896409,"name":"All Funny Mugs","permalink":"all-funny-mugs","url":"/category/all-funny-mugs"}]},{"id":5971689,"name":"Funny coffee mug Will There Be Cake crochet handmade","permalink":"funny-coffee-mug-will-there-be-cake-crochet-handmade","position":100,"price":14.0,"default_price":14.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/funny-coffee-mug-will-there-be-cake-crochet-handmade","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-19T04:40:03.000Z","description":"Hand embroidered 'Will there be cake?' in brown cotton thread on real wool felt patch, sewn on a handmade pink acrylic crochet coffee mug tea cup cozy.\r\n\r\nWill there be cake?

The scent that has meant breakfast for generations. But it's good other times of day too. On a burger. On a club sandwich. Crumbled on top of a salad. You name it- bacon makes it better. If you're a vegetarian, well, I shed a tear for you.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm not sure why vegetarians don't eat pork anyway. At every single barbecue joint I've been to there are huge, often neon, pigs who look positively thrilled that we're going to eat them. In fact, I'm pretty sure I've seen one where the pig is actually on his back with a fork in hand digging into his own belly. Yes folks. Bacon is so good pigs become cannibals for it.\r\n\r\nBacon shaped stripes and pig patch with 'I <3 BACON' should greet you each day around your coffee or tea.

He is my new guru in this field. To commemorate me picking him as a mentor I have made this cozy with my favorite of the guru's mantras: duh, Winning!\r\n\r\nSo often if I had just had this phrase from the holy Sheen I could've saved myself so much anguish. \r\n\r\n-When I freaked out in 5th grade because I got called to the board to do a division problem I was clueless about- if I had just shouted at the teacher, 'duh, Winning!' and walked out my life probably would be a lot better now. \r\n\r\n-Or how about that time when I got pulled over for going through that red light when it had definitely been yellow? I'm sure if I had just yelled at the cop, 'duh, Winning!' and floored the accelerator to get to my appointment at the drug testing facility, things could've been different these last ten years.\r\n\r\nI made this cozy in a sort of colorful, rainbow-ish acrylic. It could be beautiful or it could be grotesque. I'm not really sure. I thought it suited Charlie Sheen's words perfectly. However, I would be happy to customize this cozy for you in anyway. Just send me a message, preferably through a national tv interview or on a new twitter account, and I'll make it to your specifications.\r\n\r\nNote, cozy will be made to order so just like Charlie Sheen, please expect some potential variation. \r\n\r\n*Any mug cozy can be made into a bottle/can or travel cup cozy for only $2.00 more.\r\n\r\nWant to see some more funny crap?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://knotworkshop.bigcartel.com/products\"><u>Shop here</font></u></a>","options":[{"id":12266198,"name":"Regular Mug","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12266200,"name":"Travel Mug","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":12266202,"name":"Bottle/Can Koozie","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.25,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/33085070/-/Duh_Winning_5_B1_EDIT.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/33085070/-/Duh_Winning_5_B1_EDIT.jpg","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/33085078/-/Duh_Winning_EDIT_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/33085078/-/Duh_Winning_EDIT_1.jpg","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/33085086/-/Duh_Winning_EDIT_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/33085086/-/Duh_Winning_EDIT_2.jpg","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/33085094/-/Duh_Winning_EDIT_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/33085094/-/Duh_Winning_EDIT_3.jpg","width":640,"height":640}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1896409,"name":"All Funny Mugs","permalink":"all-funny-mugs","url":"/category/all-funny-mugs"}]},{"id":3710652,"name":"Funny coffee mug Haterade crochet handmade","permalink":"funny-coffee-mug-haterade-crochet-handmade","position":122,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/funny-coffee-mug-haterade-crochet-handmade","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-05-06T16:13:41.000Z","description":"Hand embroidered 'Haterade' in bold orange cotton thread on real wool felt patch, sewn on handmade neon orange acrylic crochet coffee tea mug cozy.\r\n\r\nGulp, gulp, gulp.

You know, you've had maybe some greasy food, a drink or two, and you're running on little sleep? The only thing that will make you feel better is a hot mug of coffee, tea or bourbon. But even though you're doing your best to look presentable, you don't really want to talk to anyone as things are just a bit out of sorts? \r\n\r\nYou need this mug cozy then. Just put it on your mug and everyone will know it's all gone a bit wonky. \r\n\r\nI would be happy to make this cozy in a different color or combination of colors for you. I'd also be happy to customize the wording on the patch, or leave it off entirely. Just put a note in the message to seller and I'll be thrilled to create your very own design. Item will be made to order so please expect some slight variation.\r\n\r\n*Any mug cozy can be made into a bottle/can or travel cup cozy for only $2.00 more.\r\n\r\nWant to see some more funny crap?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://knotworkshop.bigcartel.com/products\"><u>Shop here</font></u></a>","options":[{"id":11794894,"name":"Default","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.25,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58620933/-/Wonky_mug_cozy_edit_1_square.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58620933/-/Wonky_mug_cozy_edit_1_square.jpg","width":590,"height":590},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/34112532/-/Wonky_mug_cozy_edit_4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/34112532/-/Wonky_mug_cozy_edit_4.jpg","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/34112644/-/Wonky_mug_cozy2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/34112644/-/Wonky_mug_cozy2.jpg","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/34112660/-/Wonky_mug_cozy3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/34112660/-/Wonky_mug_cozy3.jpg","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/34112668/-/Wonky_mug_cozy5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/34112668/-/Wonky_mug_cozy5.jpg","width":640,"height":640}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1896409,"name":"All Funny Mugs","permalink":"all-funny-mugs","url":"/category/all-funny-mugs"}]},{"id":3478884,"name":"Funny coffee mug Don't Panic crochet handmade","permalink":"funny-coffee-mug-don-t-panic-crochet-handmade","position":156,"price":14.0,"default_price":14.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/funny-coffee-mug-don-t-panic-crochet-handmade","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-03-24T20:02:07.000Z","description":"Hand embroidered funny 'Don't Panic' in red cotton thread on black felt patch, sewn on handmade black acrylic crochet coffee mug cozy.  \r\n\r\nYou could use mug cozy in a couple of different ways.

It's a phrase that generations before us never knew or used. And yet now it's part of our daily language. What exactly is a baby daddy? Well, it could mean different things to different people. It could be good or bad. You could have a good baby daddy meaning you love the guy but didn't marry him before procreating (tsk, tsk). Or, it could be bad, as in, 'he's just a baby daddy' meaning that oddly, he wasn't good enough to marry BUT you still screwed him and had a baby with him.\r\n\r\nOne thing I think everyone agrees on is that a baby daddy probably drinks beer. Cause drunk guys love having sex with women without protection. So this is the perfect gift to say, 'thanks for knocking me up asshole' or 'thanks for impregnating me honey' (depending on your perspective).\r\n\r\nI would be happy to make this item for you in any other colors or customize the writing. Just send me a message and I will be happy to make a cozy with your favorite profanity. Or even something more pedestrian if you wish.

Handmade crochet in lemon yellow cotton.\r\n\r\nEat pray love? I say eat shit die. Yes, they say there are only two things certain in life. I say there are three. You eat. Later you shit. And eventually, you die. Okay, you could probably add breathe in there, or maybe even drink, but then there'd be no parody, so shut up.\r\n\r\nYou also could interpret this cozy in a slightly ruder way in 'eat, shit AND die'. You know, something you'd want someone you don't like very much to do. But then again, we will all do it. So it's not something very insulting. It's like saying 'go and breathe and then die!' Oooh, burn!\r\n\r\nYes, yes, I know the saying is really to actually eat the shit, and then die. But honestly, would eating shit kill you? I don't think so. I'm sure you wouldn't feel well later, but I think you'd live.

Note, I doubt that anyone has uttered 'om nom nom nom' while eating a scone. But what else could I put? Crumpets? Really?\r\n\r\nI would be happy to customize this cozy in any way. As shown it is in a lovely mocha brown which I think perfectly signifies milk chocolate chunks in a biscuit the cookie monster would love. But I'll make it in a different color if you so choose. I can also customize the writing to a unique message. Just contact me so we can create your design together.\r\n\r\nNote, these items are made to order. So please expect some slight variation.

Get current. Text me. I don't really want to talk to you and have a *gasp* conversation. I want to type to you at my leisure and read your response when convenient. I also want to be able to claim I didn't get your text should you try to communicate something uncomfortable, demanding or otherwise forgettable.\r\n\r\nI need to rest my vocal cords so rather than even utter the words 'text me' I am just going to have it on my coffee mug. I'll point to it with my finger, which is extraordinarily strong given all the time it spends typing. And if you don't understand and start talking, I'll simply text you, 'Stop talking. Text me.'\r\n\r\nI would love to customize this item for you in any way. I can change the colors, change the writing- whatever you'd like I can do. Just text me your specifications. What? Don't have my number? Okay, email me.
