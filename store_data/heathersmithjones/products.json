I return to this series from time to time, and work on them in between other paintings.  <i>Zinnias no. 1</i> is a new piece that I painted this summer. Inspired by the zinnias in our garden I reflected on the dots of color among the green. Working on this series is so fun, that it is hard to stop making them! I have chosen just a few favorites to offer here as fine art prints.\r\n\r\nThis is a limited edition, fine art print of my original watercolor painting. It is professionally printed on acid-free matte paper using archival inks. The paper has a smooth surface that shows the detail and color beautifully. Each print is hand-signed on the front, and titled, numbered, and signed on the back. Comes with a certificate of authenticity. Copyright watermark is for photo purposes only and not on the actual print. \r\n\r\nThe lowermost photo shows the print in a standard 5 x 7 frame, with a mat window opening of 4 1/2 in. x 6 1/2 in. These prints also look nice with a square cut mat. Frame not included with print.\r\n\r\nShipping charges within the continental United States are included in the price of this print.

I return to this series from time to time, and work on them in between other paintings. <i>Zinnias no. 4</i> is a new piece that I painted this summer. Inspired by the zinnias in our garden I focused on a lively application of blues and greens surrounding the warm colors. Working on this series is so fun, that it is hard to stop making them! I have chosen just a few favorites to offer here as fine art prints.\r\n\r\nThis is a limited edition, fine art print of my original watercolor painting. It is professionally printed on acid-free matte paper using archival inks. The paper has a smooth surface that shows the detail and color beautifully. Each print is hand-signed on the front, and titled, numbered, and signed on the back. Comes with a certificate of authenticity. Copyright watermark is for photo purposes only and not on the actual print. \r\n\r\nThe lowermost photo shows the print in a standard 5 x 7 frame, with a mat window opening of 4 1/2 in. x 6 1/2 in.
