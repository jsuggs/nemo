Each gel is individually labeled for easy recognition at night and has an individual eyelet to ensure the hole where the gel is mounted is not worn down after repeated use, this is also reenforced to stop ripping or breakages.\r\n\r\nThe colours in the pack can be layered to create new colours. e.g if you mix the Green gel with the Blue gel you will create a turquoise, the gels are also big enough to fold over in to two layers of the same colour to create a more intense colour.\r\n\r\nEach pack of lighting gels comes with a free Noctography lanyard which makes light painting even easier, this enables you to have the gels around your neck and easily accessible from a quick release clip on the lanyard. \r\n\r\nMade by a Light Painter...For Light Painters\r\n\r\nOrders over £20 will receive a free gift!\r\n\r\nwww.noctography.co.uk","options":[{"id":16204347,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/85052685/-/6442358111_e8a89e7835_b.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/85052685/-/6442358111_e8a89e7835_b.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2673079,"name":"Lighting Gels","permalink":"lighting-gels","url":"/category/lighting-gels"}]},{"id":4936347,"name":"Noctography - Abandoned House Star Trail - T-Shirts and Vests","permalink":"noctography-abandoned-house-star-trail-t-shirt","position":3,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/noctography-abandoned-house-star-trail-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-11-25T21:18:17.000Z","description":"Help support Noctography by buying a T-shirt or Vest.
