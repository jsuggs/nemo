Damn heavy and brutal hardcore all the way from Italy ! The tracks are fast and hit you full on square in the jaw.  With powerful vocals that fit perfectly. Blame It On The Ocean generate a hell of a lot of energy.   Fans of the heavier side of hardcore will love this. Composed of 6 tracks, we can define \"Ruins\" an album influenced by band like American Nightmare, Cursed. This album is a kicking ass album.

Sentenced to Life is the highly-anticipated follow-up to the band's raging 2010 debut album, Heavy Breathing. The new album projects an even more vile, metallic sonic attack than it's predecessor... with a bit less rock and roll swagger and more full-on crushing death metal rage. This is a product of furious creativity jammed into a short span of time, written in the seemingly endless Winter after returning from their November 2010 European tour. Bearing 10 thunderous tracks in just under 33 minutes, Sentenced to Life features such smashing BLACK BREATH hits as Feast of the Damned, Doomed, Forced Into Possession, Home of the Grave and of course the title anthem, Sentenced to Life. The band once again recorded at God City Studios with Kurt Ballou (Converge), and had the finished product mastered by Alan Douches at West West Side. Easily the band's most thunderous recording to date, BLACK BREATH sentence every listener to a life of head banging after spinning this motherfucker!\r\n\r\n<b>Tracklist</b>\r\n01.

While the album blazes out of the gate with the aptly titled \"Heartache,\" songs like \"Orphaned\" and the intense \"Plagues\" prove that breakneck speed and heaviness aren't necessarily interrelated, and when Converge lower the tempo, they're able to effortlessly transcend traditional notions of \"heaviness.\" Devotees of Jane Doe will also be blown away by epic tracks like the nine-minute \"Grim Heart/Black Rose,\" a doom masterpiece which features guest vocals from Only Living Witness' Jonah Jenkins.

From the first organic stick clicks of opener \"Flowermouth (The Leech)\" musical chaos explodes in every direction imaginable. As their tangle of guitars and angular percussion violently lurches about, it's apparent that Code Orange Kids are unconcerned with following the predetermined path of any existing sub-genre (i.e. they are their own unpredictable animal). Code Orange Kids' dirges effortlessly become staccato bursts in \"Liars // Trudge\" and \"Nothing (The Rat), two songs with so many hairpin turns they are difficult to put into words. While adversely, songs like \"Colors (Into Nothing)\" and \"Calm // Breathe\" unfurl as beautifully layered musical expanses. As impressive as these dynamics are, it is Code Orange Kids' untamed heaviness and emotion in the title referenced songs \"Choices (Love is Love)\" and \"Bloom (Return to Dust)\" that will leave you floored. These two monstrous beasts smear the divisions between art-rock, punk, doom, and noise in a way never heard before. Without a doubt, \"Love is Love // Return to Dust\" is truly impressive, as much a work of art as it is an album.

Successfully melding their progressive musicianship, punk fervor, and vital political/social awareness into one intense vision.Originally based in straight-ahead hardcore and classic punk, Coliseum have continued to progress with each recorded effort. Before finding a permanent home on Relapse records in 2006, Coliseum released music on both Ryan's own Auxiliary label, as well as on Level Plane Records. Coliseum's first full length for Relapse, \"No Salvation\", was released in the summer of 2007 and was met by praise from critics and kids alike. To celebrate the longtime friendship between Coliseum and Deathwish, we are proud to announce the release of Coliseum's \"True Quiet / Last Wave\" 7\"EP. Featuring artwork by friend John Dyer Baizley (Baroness, Kylesa, Cursed), \"True Quiet / Last Wave\" gives us the first taste of Coliseum's evolution since 2007's \"No Salvation\". The hook laden A Side \"True Quiet\" takes hold with its all too familiar story of self imposed isolation, told to a dc influenced metallic jangle. While the percussively driven B Side \"Last Wave\" serves as a hair raising commentary on the ethical and economical darkness of our present day. Both songs collectively embodying the honest artistry that defines Coliseum at their very core. <br><br> <b>Tracklist</b>01. True Quiet<br> 02.

A dizzying hybrid of Shoe-gaze shimmer, Hardcore vulnerability, and Black Metal intensity. From the opening drone of the album it's as if we are are peering through a dream into the private world that is Deafheaven's \"Roads to Judah\". Layers and layers of instrumentation build, tangle and swirl before the real onslaught begins. A ferocious drum fill then thrusts us from the serene into a free fall, as if the ground below suddenly gave way. From there we plummet through one awe inducing sonic fog into the next, blurring the traditional lines of song. Hyper blasts of speed rage and pulse while lush guitars bellow, roar and whine with unorthodox melody. And just as we feel we've departed from reality from the aural overload, tortured vocals cry out from afar. Serving as a stark reminder that there is something very human about \"Roads to Judah\" and Deafheaven themselves. Though the title could suggest something otherworldly, the \"Judah\" referenced is in fact the \"N Judah\" train, the busiest line of the San Francisco transit system. A relatable landmark to compliment the haunting ambiguity that surrounds Deafheaven and the music that they collectively create. On it, much of the lyrical writing and personal reflection for this album took place. With that said, \"Roads to Judah\" isn't Heavy Metal role play, but a beautifully blackened artistic exploration of the issues and self loathing that can cloud every day life. A stunning a achievement emotionally and musically that will surely shape aggressive music for years to come.\r\n\r\n<b>Tracklist</b>\r\n01. Violet\r\n02. Language Games\r\n03. Unrequited\r\n04.

Both bands play this dark crust,doom,punk style. DOWNFALL OF GAIA contribute two (more one long) song to this split. It starts very slow, like you already heard it on some of their last songs on 'epos'. It grows and grows over a few minutes until it breaks out. Epic, atmospheric parts meet blast. To compare it to other bands you can say ALPINIST meets FALL OF EFRAFA here. IN THE HEARTS OF EMPERORS are the counterpart to DOG. I really could copy and paste what I wrote before. Three dark, downtuned songs array to one long song here. Dark and angry vocals meet hard guitar lines. Reminds me very much to AMENRA. The LP comes in a heavy gatefoldcover with a printed inside. The vinyl itself is pressed on heavy (180gr).

They have released no new music since then and it is in full jarring fashion that they rise from what were seemingly ashes of a once shining punk machine to create new material entitled, Rejoice the End/Rage of Sanity 7” with a new and improved quartet.

The end result is an awesome audio blast of radness, and earlier this year Germany’s GOLDUST unified with Maryland’s FULL OF HELL to give us just that, release by Get This Right Records. GOLDUST kicks shit off with a gnarly short burst of dirge core called “Entrails” – it’s almost instrumental, it’s layered in a dark emotional distortion energy. They really bring the noise on “Ruine,” which is way longer and kicks out the jams from the very first second that it comes on. GOLDUST’s songwriting really shines on this cut, which is full of mammoth breakdowns that will have you saying, this band knows what the fuck they are doing. I like this song also because of the sinister melody that flows throughout it, plus the vocal delivery is interesting, with the call and response thing that they have happening. And I can’t forget to talk about the war cry drumming on “Ruine,” at the same time that riffs from hell will be slicing at your throat! FULL OF HELL are on some next shit for this split – these dudes have totally transformed their version of hardcore into something that has other genres coexisting within the same song. “Rat King” is the first tune on their side, and it’s all fucking that and then some. I really dig the way the song starts with a long intro of distorted feedback, before launching into a ferocious rampage of groove-laden hardcore. The way the vocals are laid down in this song is extra cool, and grabs your attention for sure. The second song, “Kopf Meines Vaters,” is a fucking tornado of grinding madness that swirls around your skull and leaves you in a state of insanity. FULL OF HELL keeps banging you with their hammer of punishment on “Vessel Deserted,” where they combine weirdo noise with spazz core and murder grind to totally wreck shop and rip a brand new hole in the universe! When it’s all said and done, if you do not have this 7″, you know the drill, you better cop it!<br><br><b>Tracklist</b><br>01. F.O.H.- Vessel Deserted <br>02. F.O.H.- Kopf Meines Vaters <br>03.

Produced by Tim Cossar and Dean Baltulonis, \"Background Music\" is anything but what the title implies, standing the test of time as a true hardcore classic. From the machine-gun like snare roll of opener \"(we are)\" into Wes' cry of \"this is the soundtrack to saying goodbye…\" the atmosphere around American Nightmare is emotionally electric. Setting an tone that resonates in anthemic songs like \"am/pm\", \"hearts\", and \"your arsonist\". These and the rest of the songs on the album blend a youthful violence and vulnerability into something rabid, hopelessly romantic, and refreshingly real. All qualities that, after almost ten years, \"Background Music \" continues to resonate loudly with every listen. Deathwish, under exclusive license from Equal Vision Records, are proud to announce the reissue of \"Background Music\" on vinyl format. The album is packaged in a special Gatefold jacket with revamped artwork and each comes an oversized/double-sided poster, never printed before.

Produced by Jim Siegel (Blood For Blood, Slapshot) and Tim Cossar, \"We're Down…\" is true milestone of a hardcore album. Encapsulating the personal growth, strife, and struggle of the band members that helped to create it. From the first strummed notes of opening instrumental \"(It's Sometimes Like It Never Started)\" the album feels intensely personal and thematic. In many ways, it is as if we are listening to the beat of the open heart of the creators. Because of this, it's difficult to pinpoint any high point in the music and lyrical content. Every song on \"We're Down Til' We're Underground\" effortlessly carries intense emotional weight in all it's layers. After all, it's an album born out of pressure and pain more so than most hardcore records (past or present) will likely ever be.

Making hairs stand on end before bursting out with their now trademark rage and intensity. Shockingly violent, this inhuman pace continues through the next ripper \"Greed Taught...\", until the epic closer \"Dismal Tide\" crashes down as emotional debris from the fury.

With his guidance Loma Prieta tracked to tape 12 songs intensely emotional songs. Written during a time of great personal suffering and transition for the band \"I.V.\" is the creative culmination of those collective experiences. From the opening breath of “Fly by Night”, Loma Prieta crash and bang melody and discord together into one beautiful work of art. This grinding theme continues throughout \"I.V.\" in stunning songs like the aptly named three parter \"Trilogy 4, 5, and 6\". Creating a powerful and unpredictable ebb and flow to their emotional outpouring. As the dust settles on the distorted haze in closer \"Diamond Tooth\", an artistic coherency and clarity emerges that can only be described as Loma Prieta. A new kind of melancholy chaos that should be familiar, yet challenging, to those who enjoy bands like Love Lost But Not Forgotten, Pg. 99, La Quiete, and the ilk.\r\n\r\n<b>Tracklist</b>\r\n01.

Nonetheless, Loma Prieta have managed to forge a distinctive form of expression that is entirely their own.<br><br> Raein are an emotional and discordant punk band from Italy originally founded by members from La Quiete and Neil on Impression. Upon their formation in 2002, the band began releasing a dizzying amount of music, over 12 influential releases/appearance in under four years time. This original incarnation of Raein disbanded in late 2005. But after a hiatus of almost 2 years the band officially regrouped in September 2007. Since the reformation the band has released to moving albums and toured the world extensively on their own terms. Considered to be leaders in the new wave of emotional post-hardcore, Raein carry a similar spirit and sound as bands Orchid, Saetia, and others.

Since their forming in 2010, No Omega have been working hard on creating a sound that's both vibrant and melancholic. The idea of No Omega is to fuse a furious hardcore sound with a sludgier, more dark, melodic and resolute post-metal sound. No Omega always aim at writing something new; something that doesn't sound like everything else. The guitars are heavy, the vocals are filled with power and emotion, and the drums shift between straight up thrash/punk to lumbering and brooding metal. A lot has happened since 2010 and the band has managed to form a pretty solid foundation to build upon. Both the music and the lyrics are more experienced. It's a lot more polished and finished in a fashion. The love for experimenting is still there. The love for expressing angst and fixating on the darker and more negative aspects of life and of our species is still there. The love for heavy and melodic post/modern hardcore is still there. 2013 will be a year of constant touring and taking No Omega to the next level.\"\r\nRecorded and engineered by Erik Lindbergh at Ljudkross.

Opener \"Origin\" strikes hard of the gate, crashing down with swirling guitars, thunderous drumming, and vicious vocal stylings. From there, Oathbreaker push the limits of brutal with \"Hierophant\", a crushing mid paced masterpiece infected with a \"Wolverine Blues\" spirit. While songs \"Thoth\" and \"Glimpse Of The Unseen\" carry a Doom Metal like candor that would even make Tom G. Warrior proud. Song after song, the chaos ensues within the Oathbreaker vortex as they explore all shades of heavy. Then, as suddenly as their rage appeared on the horizon, it recedes to reveal the album's mesmerizing title track \"Mælstrøm\". A dark acoustic passage that shows Oathbreaker's ability to not only unleash a fury, but control the musical super storm within. Without question, Oathbreaker's \"Mælstrøm\" is one of the best debut albums we've ever heard, and we trust you'll feel the same way.\r\n\r\n<b>Tracklist</b>\r\n01. Orgin\r\n02. Hierophant\r\n03.

With a population of just over four thousand gang members, East Palo Alto may be a peculiar place for a punk band to go, but nestled in its urban isolation is acclaimed engineer Jack Shirley and his Atomic Garden Studios (formerly the ShitBox). There under Shirley's attentive ears, Punch poured their patchwork sound into their latest work, \"Nothing Lasts E.P.” The influences on “Nothing Lasts” are as varied as the 5 members’ musical backgrounds, spending time in bands as diverse as Doppelganger, Loma Prieta, and Bullets In. As with their previous releases “Nothing Lasts” straddles a variety of hardcore sub-genres. From thrash to d-beat to straight up youth crew Punch recombines all of these genres to create something all their own without ever being forced or cheesy (they're vegan, duh). “Nothing Lasts” is a slightly more introspective release for the band which lyrically and musically explores active nihilism – the idea that it is better to actively break down your walls and change yourself rather than to sit around and wait for the world to spoon feed you.

From the opening barrage of \"Soul Slayer\" and \"Built On Graves\" the evolution of Rise And Fall is absolutely stunning. Heavier and harder than ever, it quickly becomes apparent that every aspect of their musicianship has grown leaps and bounds in recent years. Guitarist Cedric Goetgebuer balances bone shattering heaviness and unorthodox melodies unlike any other musician today. Bringing each song to post-apocalyptic life with an electrifying intensity. All of this is complimented by Bjorn Dossche's emotional vocal outpouring as it spills across the album with unforgettable realness. Rise And Fall continue this musical battery throughout, however it is when they unleash the dynamic \"In Circles\" and the epic closer \"Knowing\" that the true scope of their creative vision sinks its teeth in. Both songs utterly haunting, moving, and unpredictable in their unique twists and turns. Blurring the divisions and dismissing the limitations that exist within much of contemporary heavy music.All in all, Rise And Fall's \"Our Circle Is Vicious\" is a stunning artistic achievement. One that will surely cast a shadow over the aggressive music world for many years to come.\r\n\r\n<b>Tracklist</b>\r\n01. Soul Slayer \r\n02. Built On Graves \r\n03. Harm's Way \r\n04.

Respected by the worldwide hardcore and metal scene this 4 heads band come from Trieste (IT), and in the last 4 years thanks to their album \"Solve Et Coagula\" produced by Kurt Ballou from Converge and released by SouthernLord, and their incessant European / American Tours with bands like Converge, Trap Them, Deafheaven, Tombs, Touchè Amorè (just to name a few) they've become one of the most important European hardcore-metal bands. Now, the hardcore-infused, nihilistic black metallers return with another shattering album that is even more chaotic, noisy and ferocious than its predecessor. “Agnus Dei” , their 4th studio full length, always produced by Kurt Ballou and released by Southernlord is nothing if not abrasive and filthy in every way, with The Secret delivering frantic tempos, ripping riffs and piercing screams. These guys are pissed-off and the songs are simply relentless.  The band can go from some storming black-metal (\"Darkness I Became\" and \"Post Mortem Nihil Est\" for example) to some filthy, crusty sludge (“Heretic Temple” and “Vermin of Dust”) without ever loosing intensity or its sense of repugnance.\r\nBands like The Secret show no respect for the physical and mental health of their listeners, they simply force you take notice and remind you what extreme, hostile music is all about.\r\n\r\n<b>Tracklist</b>\r\n1.

Solve Et Coagula is the band's third release and their first for Southern Lord. Sitting well alongside other newcomers to the Southern Lord fold, (Black Breath, Masakari), This album is a sonic interpretation of a total loss of faith in social system, religion, personal redemption and every institution. Their sound combines elements of hardcore, noise, metal and post rock to create a dark, heavy yet dynamic sound topped by the noir and cryptic atmospheres of the lyrics. Influenced by bands from Meshuggah to Mogwai, The Secret's music is a complex and intense stream of consciousness which drives the listener through unexpected sound scapes.\r\n\r\n<b>Tracklist</b>\r\n01.

Their demo was a breath of fresh air, but “Rough Ground” is ready to take them to the next level. Combining the lesson of acts like Modern Life Is War with their own personal touch, Up River develop a powerful yet melodic hardcore, combined with angst and sickness, alternating mid tempos to fast and furios rhythms and gang vocals. 4 tracks that punch you in the stomach and leave you breathless.
