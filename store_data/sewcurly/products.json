If you need additional snack bags, they can be ordered at a reduced rate of $5 per bag.\r\n\r\nThese eco-friendly bags are made of 100% cotton material.  All the bags have a fabric tag on them.  I like the tag because it allows the bag to be attached to a car seat or stroller strap.  It also makes it easier to pull the bag out your diaper bag or purse.  Each bag comes with a velcro closure.  It makes it super easy for little hands to open and close all by themselves.  It's also strong enough to keep everything inside.  \r\n\r\nThe Snack Bag is my girls' favorite.  It is 5\" x 4.5\".  It holds their snacks (cheerios, goldfish crackers) and even lunch (cheese,  veggies, even chicken nuggets & french fries).  Some children use them to hold crayons, Polly Pocket dolls, and trading cards.  The uses are endless. \r\n\r\nAll the bags can be embroidered with a name or an initial.
