The building, erected in 1898 is the work of noted local architect William Peter Finneran.\r\n\r\nThe Gentleman’s Club itself was formed by Dr William Nesbitt, an Irishman, a doctor, a coroner and Gisborne’s Resident Magistrate.\r\n\r\nFor over 120 years, the Poverty Bay Club membership swelled and shrank in size reflecting the events of the day. It is interesting to note women were not allowed to become members until 1988.\r\n\r\nThis gorgeous framed print is a lovely souvenir for those who have fond memories of the building! \r\n\r\nIt measures 34 x 43cm, black box frame with white mount.
