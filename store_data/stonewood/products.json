A land of long fields and rough mountains; a battleground where two of the Earth’s protectors meet the worst of humanity’s excesses made flesh. And one of them, Jake Walker, doesn’t even know what he’s doing. Not really. He’s only had a few weeks to get used to the idea. And it’s not long enough. Luckily, the other, Stone, has had millennia to get used to it. And that is long enough. But it’ll take more than time to beat this enemy, and nothing, nothing, is guaranteed.\r\n\r\nOpen up to 18th DECEMBER 2013","options":[{"id":25943022,"name":"Default","price":6.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":4.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/80932785/-/DarkPeak-cv2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/80932785/-/DarkPeak-cv2.jpg","width":666,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2398411,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":7838313,"name":"Dark Peak – Signed Limited Edition","permalink":"dark-peak","position":2,"price":35.0,"default_price":35.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dark-peak","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-05T14:59:36.000Z","description":"Dark Peak: The First Elemental \r\nFICTION: NOVEL\r\nISBN: 978-0-9569122-2-0\r\nPrice: £35.00 (Hardback) plus P&P\r\nExtent: 332pp\r\n\r\nSigned Limited Edition Hardback with Artwork.\r\n\r\nT﻿his Limited Edition hardback is beautifully produced with a hand-printed linocut of the Limestone Map, a central feature of the novel’s narrative.

Less well known is John's own poetry. Notebook in Hand is a selection from his collections as well as unpublished and new poems. His poetry is both simple and complex - tender, funny, poignant, and companionable, it is also edgy, acerbic, troubled and disappointed. As well as his better-known comic poetry, Notebook in Hand presents tender lyrics and trenchant political meditations, some of which may surprise, but will certainly delight, his readers.\r\n\r\n﻿ISBN: 978-0-9569122-1-3 \r\nPublisher: Stonewood Press \r\nPrice: £10.95 (Paperback)\r\nExtent: 128 pages\r\nPublication: February 2012","options":[{"id":17757783,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54092503/-/notebook-cv.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54092503/-/notebook-cv.jpg","width":350,"height":544}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2398411,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":4331313,"name":"Said and done","permalink":"said-and-done","position":5,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/said-and-done","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-08-27T21:34:42.000Z","description":"Said and done: New writing from Brittle Star\r\n\r\nProduct details\r\n\r\nPaperback: 128 pages\r\nPoetry and Short fiction anthology\r\nPublisher: Stonewood Press\r\n(August 2011)\r\nISBN-13: 978-09569122-0-6\r\nProduct Dimensions: 211x136mm\r\n\r\nEdited by Jacqueline Gabbitas, Louisa Hooper, David Floyd and Martin Parker.
