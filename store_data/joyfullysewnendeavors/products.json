Please specify upon checkout.\r\n\r\nMy pillow poofs are about 16 inches in diameter by 8 inches high. They have a zipper hidden underneath the handle where the stuffing goes in. The zipper will also enable you to wash the pillow should it need a good cleaning.  If you live locally I can stuff the pillow for you, otherwise it will be sent to you unstuffed. It takes about 20-24 oz of fiberfill to fill the pillow depending on how firm or fluffy you would like it to be. I can ship a stuffed pillow but shipping will be $12.95.\r\n\r\nI am now offering pillow inserts for the pillows. This allows you to take the insert out containing the fluff if you would just like to wash the cover. The inserts will also have zippers.

Before purchasing a pillow please contact me at joyfullysewnendeavors@gmail.com so that we can discuss what type of pillow you would like.  Afterwards, feel free to purchase your pillow. It can take up to 2 weeks to finish the pillow depending on how easily I obtain the desired fabric so please have patience.\r\nSteps to Order a Pillow: \r\n1. Let me know what type of theme you would like for the pillow (cowboys, robots, ballerinas, animals, etc.)  \r\n2. This will then give me an idea as to what fabrics to look for.  After obtaining some fabric ideas I will email you pictures of the possible fabrics. Before I purchase a fabric I will need confirmation from you as to which fabric you like. Please let me know if you don't care for any of them and I will start searching again. \r\n3. Once a fabric has been chosen and you have submitted an order, I will order the fabric and get your pillow poof created!\r\n\r\nMy pillow poofs are about 16 inches in diameter by 8 inches high.
