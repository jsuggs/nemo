Bennett (of Kent origins) composed his 'Trumpet Concerto' in 1993 and is dedicated to Maestro Tim Reynish. It contains three movements of vast contrast, including a beautiful second movement 'Elegy for Miles Davis' where the trumpet soars in this deeply felt ballad.\r\n\r\n'Fenix Blue' written by Peter Meechan makes reference to the large blues influence in the piece, but the Fenix referred to in the title is a dedication to the Phoenix 2 capsule that rescued the 33 Chilean minors who were trapped underground for 69 days in 2010, the last of whom was brought to the surface in the capsule as Meechan completed the piece. \r\n\r\nWe conclude with Ferrer Ferran's telling of the Pinocchio story. This symphonic suite takes us through the trials and tribulations of the famous puppet and all his wild adventures. With large symphonic scoring, this epic work is a fitting end to the concert.\r\n\r\n15th February at 19:30pm \r\nAll Saints Church, Mill Street, Maidstone, ME15 6YE.\r\n\r\nTickets are £10 adults, £8 concession, children under 12 FREE.\r\n\r\nTickets available for collection on the door only.
