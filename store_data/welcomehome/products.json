For CCA, Skaer has created a special edition from this series. Having collected the yellow, cyan and magenta plates directly from the newspaper, Skaer hand-printed a series of pages, one for each day of the exhibition. Only a few sparse details from the intended layouts remain as Skaer allows the information to become abstracted, creating ghostly histories of the day’s news. \r\n\r\nLucy Skaer was born in Cambridge in 1975. She completed her BA at the Glasgow School of Art.  From 1997 Skaer co founded the collaborative group Henry Viii’s Wives, and worked at Transmission gallery in Glasgow, where she had her first solo show in 2000.  In 2003 Skaer was short-listed for the art prize Becks Futures and exhibited at the first Scottish presentation at the Venice Biennale, where she also presented in 2007. Skaer’s recent solo presentations include Kunsthalle Basel (2009) for which she was nominated for the Turner Prize, Kunsthalle Wien (2012) Yale Union, Portland (2013) and Tramway, Glasgow (2013).\r\n\r\nThis is sent board backed and recorded delivery via Royal Mail.","options":[{"id":49296900,"name":"Default","price":350.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":6.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128416311/-/Lucy_skaer.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128416311/-/Lucy_skaer.jpg","width":1754,"height":2483}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":209472,"name":"the drawing room","permalink":"the-drawing-room","url":"/category/the-drawing-room"},{"id":209473,"name":"the living room","permalink":"the-living-room","url":"/category/the-living-room"},{"id":209474,"name":"around the home","permalink":"around-the-home","url":"/category/around-the-home"},{"id":2647205,"name":"for him","permalink":"for-him","url":"/category/for-him"},{"id":2647207,"name":"for her","permalink":"for-her","url":"/category/for-her"},{"id":2652555,"name":"for home","permalink":"for-home","url":"/category/for-home"},{"id":6765204,"name":"CCA editions","permalink":"cca-editions","url":"/category/cca-editions"}]},{"id":15172917,"name":"Welcome Home/CCA editions - Ciara Phillips, scarf","permalink":"welcome-home-cca-editions-ciara-phillips-scarf","position":2,"price":125.0,"default_price":125.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/welcome-home-cca-editions-ciara-phillips-scarf","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-28T16:26:12.000Z","description":"Scarf, Digital print on silk twill, 68 x 68cm, 2013, Edition of 30, £125\r\n\r\nGlasgow-based artist Ciara Phillips has produced a limited edition silk scarf depicting a detail from a recent series of screen prints entitled The Century. Made by Phillips for And more, a solo exhibition at Inverleith House in May-June 2013, The Century is a collection of 100 unique screen prints inspired by printing processes developed by 18th century physician and botanist Johann Hieronymous Kniphof in Botanica in Originali, seu Herbarium Vivum (1754-64) and refers to Kniphof's production of prints in groups of 100 called 'centuries'.\r\n\r\nRecent exhibitions include: Workshop (2010 - ongoing), The Showroom, London (2013);  /prospekt/ Funktion / Disfunktion, Neues Museum Nürnberg (2013); There Will Be New Rules Next Week, Dundee Contemporary Arts, Dundee (2013); And more, Inverleith House, Edinburgh (2013); The Souls: A Twice-Told Tale, CEAAC (European Centre for Contemporary Art Projects), Strasbourg (2013); Slippery under pressure, OUTPOST, Norwich (2012); Pull Everything Out, with Corita Kent at Spike Island, Bristol (2012); Start with a practical idea, Gregor Staiger, Zürich (2012); The only rule is work, Kendall Koppe, Glasgow (2011), Springtime will never be the same, Deuxieme Bureau/Galerie Parisa Kind, Frankfurt (2011) and Zwischenraum: Space Between, Der Kunstverein, Hamburg (2010).
