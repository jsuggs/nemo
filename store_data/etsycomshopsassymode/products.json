Although not stylish in a past life they have been recreated and made into very cute and practical pieces of art. The knitted fabric has been glued onto a heavy canvas ensuring that the knit does not fray or pull stiches. It has also been lined with a heavy material so the bag does not stretch or loose shape. The interior contains 2 small zip pockets and 1 large zip pocket. The straps are made from deer skin and the bag has been decorated with an assortment of beads. I have had one of these bags years and recently had it drycleaned. It now looks brand new again.","options":[{"id":7722161,"name":"Default","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/20492261/-/DSC02748_opt.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/20492261/-/DSC02748_opt.jpg","width":724,"height":543}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":2138691,"name":"Red Leather Satchel","permalink":"red-leather-satchel","position":3,"price":180.0,"default_price":180.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/red-leather-satchel","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-03-29T04:47:56.000Z","description":"With all the new wild shapes and designs in bags these days there is still a demand for the classic satchel.
