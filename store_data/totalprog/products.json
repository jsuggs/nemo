Recorded and Mastered by Ben Gardner (That Fucking Tank, Pulled Apart By Horses). This is the bands second recording and came out in 2007. It was immediately bummed by all the glossy mags for its ultra trendy post metal tendencies and its progtastic atmospherics. Shortly after its release, 20 Buck Spin (Coffins, the Obsessed, Black Bones Angel) asked if they could put out the CD version. The Band embraced this opportunity and the CD version + 2 bonus tracks followed shortly after.","options":[{"id":7700651,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":8.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/20436361/-/Untitled-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/20436361/-/Untitled-1.jpg","width":936,"height":936}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1302161,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":2132771,"name":"Electric Mud Generator - To The Disdain of Polyhymnia CD PROG 02","permalink":"electric-mud-generator-to-the-disdain-of-polyhymnia-cd","position":2,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/electric-mud-generator-to-the-disdain-of-polyhymnia-cd","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-03-28T20:09:26.000Z","description":"TOTAL PROG are proud to present the EMG recording in all its heavenly glory.
