But one can't say that girl's hairdo and purple bodycon dress weren't trendsetting. The color combo of gunmetal grey and camel makes it perfect for Fall as the temp starts to drop. The over-sized collar is faux fur lined, but not the kind of faux fur that feels like rug. It's the kind that you want to pet...and pet. A slightly longer length in the back adds a touch of drama, which you'll need on your Mission: Fabulous. Pockets!\r\n\r\nFit: True to size.

Odette triumphs over the floozy that is the Black Swan. And why not? Pink is so the new black. We can't even go into how we much we love this dress. The possibilities are endless. This is going to be the dress you wear everywhere for the rest of your life. Dramatic drop waist (when was the last time you saw a drop waist on anything other than a wedding dress or that awful prom dress you wore in the 80s?), super low back, *poofed* skirt. And trust us, you have never seen a pink this wearbly delicious. Not too pink, not too rose. It's perfect. This dress is perfect. Here's to the good guys!\r\n\r\nFit: Loving the sorta slouchy but still fitted throughout to show off the figure fit! The key measurement here is the waist. These are running pretty true to size maybe a little generous. A size 2 fits up to a 34 inch bust and up to a 26.5 inch waist. A size 4 fits up to 36 inch bust and up to a 27.5 inch waist.

They’re on the brink of disheveled, but why they do they look so good? There’s something about them. Just like there’s something about this dress. Yes, the daring plunge between the sweetheart neckline. But we think it’s the soft peach net that “covers” the skin (but obviously doesn’t) as if leaving that to the imagination. Look but don’t touch. Likewise, the rest of the dress could have been straight and neat, but instead the designer wanted something more.  We’re just not straight and neat girls. We’ve got edges. \r\n\r\nFit: Fitted, but again, there’s that “Rumpled Sexy” so it’s not meant to be so tight and flat against the body. That said, it’s a little more generous up top than it is around the hips. So if you’re relatively busty up top and narrow down there, you’re golden and we hate you. Just kidding.

We’re thinking early cocktails, classy sit down dinner, and then a night out with the girls at that place you swore you’d never be caught dead at. Now pull your eyes away from the pretty shiny things (we know it’s hard) to the shoulders. We love the slices of silk “sleeves.” An adaptation of the cutout trend without feeling like your little sister just took scissors to your favorite dress.\r\n\r\nFit: Easy.

Sexy. Cool. This one from Keemia is laid back and easy to sport. It’s a double layered stretch silk chiffon racer back with well placed cutouts. Why well placed? Because it makes your waist look tiny! We immediately pictured this dress with a belt looped through the back under the black layer. Chilly? Throw on a nip tucked blazer.\r\n\r\nFit: Runs pretty true to size. The chiffon is stretch so it’s meant to be pretty snug on the body. An X-Small fits a 2 or small 4. The Small fits a 4 small 6.

No? Want to look like you're brooding much? Yes? Well this is your ticket. Stretch dark denim body with black silky pleated uber dolman sleeves (by uber we mean that the sleeves connect all the way down to the hips). A successful brooder must look dark and mysterious, tough but vulnerable for the right someone. Most importantly a brooder must look fab without looking like she spent any time doing it. Good thing this dress just goes over the head, not even a zipper to bother with. You have enough things to think about after all. Super east, super slimming. Now you just need to accessorize with an old copy of The Raven and a coffee, black of course.\r\n\r\nFit: True to size. The denim is super stretchy, but meant to fit pretty snug. A size 2 fits up to 33 inches around the bust, up to 35 inches around the hips. The waist is open thanks to the dolman sleeves. A size 4 fits up to 34 inches around the bust, up to 36 inches around the hips. <a href=\"http://sundaybrunchdress.bigcartel.com/size-guide\">Chuck</a> wears a size 4.\r\n\r\nDesigned in Amsterdam and made in China\r\n\r\n84% Polyester 24% Rayon 4% Spandex ; 100% Viscose \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://shop.sundaybrunchdress.com/customer-service\"> Still not sure about sizing?</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://shop.sundaybrunchdress.com/special-orders\">Don't see your size?</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.sundaybrunchdress.com/mailing-list/\">Get free shipping and give aways here!</a>\r\n","options":[{"id":9863231,"name":"Size 2","price":79.6,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9863232,"name":"Size 4","price":79.6,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27304181/-/poe_front.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27304181/-/poe_front.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27304185/-/poe_side.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27304185/-/poe_side.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27304189/-/poe_back.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27304189/-/poe_back.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27304193/-/poe_close_up.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27304193/-/poe_close_up.jpg","width":800,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1675269,"name":"Tony Cohen","permalink":"tony-cohen","url":"/category/tony-cohen"}]}]
