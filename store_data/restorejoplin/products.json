When it came to serving Joplin we wanted our entire effort to be Joplin based. From screen printing, to promotion, to volunteers, and especially our giving. It was 100% about Joplin.</p>\r\n<p>When tornados hit several towns in Oklahoma last week, we began trying to make connections. We already had friends in Oklahoma City, but it took until late last week to make contact with folks who could help us get funds directly to the smaller communities which were hit.</p>\r\n<h2>These communities should not be forgotten.</h2>\r\n<p>Funds raised from our Restore Oklahoma shirts will be directed to local organizations in these communities. At this point, we don't have enough demand for unique shirts for each town, so this is just a start.</p>\r\n<p><em>If you are connected with one of the towns in Oklahoma and know of a non-profit we can reach out to, please let us know.
