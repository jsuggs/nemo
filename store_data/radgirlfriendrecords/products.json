Rad Company is bad-ass-fast- poppy-thrashing-punk-rock with some stop on a dime blasting riffs and loads of catchy singalong choruses. way too fucking ugly to have any mainstream appeal. this is totally and completely punk rock for the die hards. Sok! is a little more melodic and the vocals go a little more to the snotty side of things but they're just as bursting at the seams with filthy energy. both bands have explosive raw recordings, xeroxed cover and inserts, and it's limited to 500 copies. Upbeat stuff that sounds like a good fucking time with a twelve pack of cheap beer in a sweaty basement at an undisclosed location somewhere in the midwest.
