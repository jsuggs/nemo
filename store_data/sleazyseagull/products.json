However, beyond the color of the material itself, there will always be some minor variations in the printing of our high quality shirts.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL BUYERS: Please be aware that unless you use the very expensive Global Priority Mail option there is absolutely no way to track packages overseas. However, with every order we do generate a courtesy label that proves through the U.S. Postal system that we have both processed and shipped your order and that it is on the way. The good news is that we almost never encounter any lost packages. As a matter of fact we have only had 2 in 3,000 orders come up missing. In the past we have had a couple packages take almost 6-8 weeks to arrive, so sometimes it is just a matter of patience and understanding that when dealing with international parcel exchanges there are many variables and persons handling your item. That said, we cannot be held responsible for them once they are shipped.

During the 1980s he toured America extensively and performed a number of high profile television appearances. It was in the UK, however, where Hicks first amassed a significant fan base, packing large venues with his 1991 tour. Hicks died of pancreatic cancer in 1994 at the age of 32. He was and still is one of the funniest comedians of all time.

Holder\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUT:\r\n\r\nREVISITING THE YUGOSLAV WAR TWENTY YEARS LATER\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago this April, the war that would eventually tear the former Yugoslavia apart came to Bosnia when a small detachment of Serb soldiers, hiding in the Holiday Inn in Sarajevo, opened fire on a large crowd of demonstrators surrounding the Parliament building. On that day the world was introduced to a modern city and a country that would very soon after be swept under the jackboot of the largest ground war fought on European soil since World War II. But with the advent of the war in Bosnia, there were more than just scenes of combat on the nightly news. From this small country in Eastern Europe there suddenly came harrowing images of Nazi-like death camps, the absolute devastation of thousand year old cities, one of the longest city sieges since Leningrad, and from 1991 to 1999 the loss of over a million lives would change, not only the course of Balkan history, but the history of the world forever. In 2002, at age 24, G.M. Holder traveled alone to former Yugoslavia where he lived for eight months, shocked at how little had been done to reconstruct the former republics. Thus, in his new novel, Love Songs & Monster Songs, he examines a side of warfare very rarely documented: postwar life. Here, regeneration through violence, the tyranny of memory, and the absolute chaos of peace are just a few of the themes set forth by Holder in this novel which follows a young American narrator through four countries into the heart of Bosnia. On the eve of his departure, however, he falls in love with Lejla, a young woman who, coincidentally, escaped from Sarajevo with her family as a little girl. And with the recurring appearance of an angelic young girl brutally wounded in the four year siege of Sarajevo (who may or may not be a ghost of the war) his reasons for going there are slowly unraveled as she helps him to resolve a complex obsession for a country that he may never be able to fully understand. Symbolically, allegorically, and figuratively interlinked, the lives destroyed by the Yugoslav war are exhumed in a novel, not only about the civilian position as it shifted both during and after the war, but what has been reified in its afterlife when its people are not yet ready to forget. Here is a glimpse of life after the death of a country as it heals from the largest European conflict since World War II, recounted not only by someone who has seen these things firsthand, but by a believer in the ultimate beauty of its resurrection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR BIO\r\n\r\nG.M. Holder was born in the United States in 1977. In 2002, at age 24, he traveled alone to postwar former Yugoslavia where he lived for just under a year, spending much of his time in Sarajevo. After returning to the United States he worked for almost ten years writing Love Songs & Monster Songs, which chronicles many of his experiences there. In 2007 he traveled to Northern California where he began research for a trilogy he has been writing since then about the Zodiac killer. Later that year he also hitchhiked across the country collecting stories for a book which concerns Gutterpunk, train hopping, and hitchhiking cultures. Amongst other ongoing projects he is also at work on a large book of Seven Apocalypses and a novel about chronic pain and the disability system. Though he is still widely unrecognized outside of underground literary circles, Holder’s lyrical and encyclopedic writing style is already being compared to the likes of Thomas Pynchon, James Joyce and William T. Vollmann. Since 2000 he has lived in Portland, Oregon. He is also the author of “The Introduction to the World.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Info:\r\n___________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nTitle: Love Songs & Monster Songs\r\n\r\nCategory: Fiction/Literature\r\n\r\nAuthor: G.M.
