An alternative Islamic name for this symbol is the Hand of Fatima or Eye of Fatima, in reference to Fatima Zahra, the daughter of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). An alternative Jewish name is the Hand of Miriam, in reference to Miriam, the sister of Moses and Aaron. Levantine Christians call it the hand of Mary, the mother of Jesus. It is a kind of \"protecting hand\" or \"hand of God.\" While \"khamsa\" literally means \"five\" in Arabic, some associate the significance of the five fingers to the five books of the Torah for Jews, the Five Pillars of Islam for Sunnis, or the five People of the Cloak for Shi'ites. Recently, activists for peace in the Middle East have chosen to wear the khamsa as a symbol of the similarities of origins and tradition between the Abrahamic faiths. \r\n\r\nThese khamsat are cast in bright and living color and are foregrounded against a haze of a folkloric semiotic narrative. The fingers can point up or down. You can ideally hang it in your bedroom for a splash of color or broadcast it proudly in your living room as a badge of your commitment to interfaith dialogue and peace.\r\n\r\nThis painting comes unstretched as a scroll on primed cotton canvas.
