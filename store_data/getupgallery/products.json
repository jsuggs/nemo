The book includes versions of 'the' image as well as a copy of correspondence from the soon-to-be President himself thanking Mr. Fairey for his support.\r\n\r\nThrough the lens of esteemed writers and critics such as Carlo McCormick, Steven Heller, Henry Rollins, Rob Walker, Roger Gastman and more, readers can learn about Shepard Fairey, the roots of the omnipresent OBEY street art campaign, his design practice and prolific gallery exhibitions.\r\n\r\nThis massive book pulls no punches and all areas of the enigmatic artist's work, travels and travails are illuminated. From exhibitions, posters, flyers, silkscreens and stickers to high altitude pursuits, citations and police beatings, it's all documented in a museum quality layout and binding. The evidence is in, and it's clear that Shepard Fairey is not one to rest on his laurels, the work must go on. For both long time fans wanting the complete collection and those just curious to know what this OBEY business is all about, Obey: Supply and Demand is the answer.

Portraits of advocates of the working class and oppressed define the collection. Fairey stakes the claim that artists, musicians and writers such as Joe Strummer, Jean Michel Basquiat and Cornel West all have parts to play in stimulating response to injustice.\r\n\r\nWith energy and urgency befitting the title MAYDAY, Fairey captures the radical spirit of his subjects, using portraiture to celebrate the artists, musicians and political activists he most admires. Says Fairey, \"These people I'm portraying were all revolutionary, in one sense or another. They started out on the margins of culture and ended up changing the mainstream. When we celebrate big steps that were made in the past, it reminds us that big steps can be made in the future.\"\r\n\r\nIn Fairey's mind, the persistence of difficulties in the political, environmental, economic, and cultural arenas points to the definition of Mayday as a distress signal: \"By now we thought we would be in post-Bush utopia, but we're still having to call attention to these problems.\" Like any mayday call, however, the sounding of the alarm also brings hope for help on the way. \"If we stay silent, there's no hope,\" Fairey muses. \"But if we make noise, if we put our ideas out there, then maybe we can make a change like the people in the portraits have done.\"\r\n\r\n168 pages, Hardcover, 9 1/2'' x 12 1/4'' (241 x 311 mm)\r\n134 color illustrations, English","options":[{"id":29273714,"name":"Default","price":25.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91951262/-/mayday-01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91951262/-/mayday-01.jpg","width":325,"height":450}],"artists":[{"id":73897,"name":"Shepard Fairey","permalink":"shepard-fairey","url":"/artist/shepard-fairey"}],"categories":[{"id":4237356,"name":"Books & Magazines","permalink":"books-magazines","url":"/category/books-magazines"}]},{"id":9356507,"name":"Idle Idol: The Japanese Mascot","permalink":"idle-idol-the-japanese-mascot","position":62,"price":11.95,"default_price":11.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/idle-idol-the-japanese-mascot","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-07T00:44:19.000Z","description":"by Edward Harrison & John Harrison\r\n\r\nGreeting you with large moving claws from on top of buildings, outside shops with a fist raised to the sky and in restaurant windows staring unblinkingly, the Japanese mascot is almost unavoidable.

This image was meant to parody a Banksy rat. The rat \"was\" hand drawn by me, it is not a photoshop image of an actual Banksy rat. I did model it after his rats however. Typically models sign a release for the use of their image in a work of art (not always however). The rat is upset that his image was used by Banksy and wants his share of the pie, hence the dollar signs. The image was done as a street piece which is where it should have stayed. I got some crap for trying to make a buck from Banksys name and use of the rat. The intent was to make a joke, a parody. In hindsight I think it was a little cheesy to make the print, but I jumped the gun and made it anyway. None-the-less they are made and I can't bring myself to toss them. So, I'm technically giving them away, the 50 bucks barely covers shipping, tubing, and the production of the prints, it's still a loss for me. 2 color silk screen on white 250gsm Stonhenge paper 30 inch wide X 22 inch high, signed, numbered, embossed - handmade by me.\" - Rene Gagnon","options":[{"id":13731124,"name":"Default","price":150.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/92700650/-/aaa.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/92700650/-/aaa.jpg","width":325,"height":450},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/40619534/-/rene-gagnon-banksy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/40619534/-/rene-gagnon-banksy.jpg","width":580,"height":434}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4547045,"name":"Sold","permalink":"sold","url":"/category/sold"}]},{"id":4152292,"name":"Sustain by Dave Kinsey","permalink":"sustain-by-dave-kinsey","position":167,"price":150.0,"default_price":150.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sustain-by-dave-kinsey","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-07-26T11:30:58.000Z","description":"18″ x 24″\r\nScreen Print\r\nSigned & Numbered\r\nEdition of 175","options":[{"id":13715644,"name":"Default","price":150.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/92700818/-/aaa.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/92700818/-/aaa.jpg","width":325,"height":450},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/40558246/-/kinsey-sustain.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/40558246/-/kinsey-sustain.jpg","width":591,"height":790}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4547045,"name":"Sold","permalink":"sold","url":"/category/sold"}]},{"id":4992489,"name":"Art is Life by Steve Whelan","permalink":"art-is-life-by-steve-whelan","position":168,"price":130.0,"default_price":130.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/art-is-life-by-steve-whelan","status":"sold-out","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-12-03T00:51:08.000Z","description":" \"Art is Life\" David QR code is a 2 color screen print on 140# Vellum paper, that when scanned with a smart phone (and a qr reader app), the code reads \"Art is Life\". \r\n\r\nThe piece mixes the classic masterpiece of David with the state of the art QR code that when viewed up close becomes it's own art form.
