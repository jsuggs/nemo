They have the most naturally gorgeous earth colour and has a very very faint but pleasant woody aroma. They feel dry to the touch, are incredibly lightweight but have a mildly abrasive quality that makes them a perfect choice for keeping your pins clean and sharp.\r\n\r\nPin cushions make lovely handmade gifts for friends, family and teachers so why not consider making a few this year! \r\n\r\nPackaged by volume these crushed walnut shells are available in bags of 140ml ... which weighs almost 100g and is enough to fill a 7-8cm square pin-cushion.\r\n\r\nSold in units of 140ml with discounts available for larger quantities.\r\n\r\nShipped from the UK.","options":[{"id":13654178,"name":"140ml","price":4.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13654180,"name":"700ml","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":13654182,"name":"1400ml","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/40360598/-/DSC_0672.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/40360598/-/DSC_0672.jpg","width":1000,"height":667}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2271940,"name":"Pin Cushion Stuffing","permalink":"pin-cushion-stuffing","url":"/category/pin-cushion-stuffing"}]}]
