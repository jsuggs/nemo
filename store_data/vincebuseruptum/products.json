Trips.\r\nAfter a self produced Ep in 2010 and many shows around Europe supporting bands like Vibravoid, White Hills, Fatso Jetson, Samsara Blues Experiment, Yawning Man, they finally comes in a full length.\r\nSeven tracks for a total of 42 minutes of pure instrumental groovy psychedelic rock never boring, influenced by all the blues and the psychedelic space rock of the 60's and the 70's.\r\nDa Captain Trips was born basically as a jam band who capture its own nature on stage carried by the atmosphere of the moment in fact on this record they have tried to recreate the same attitude and the spontaneity they use normally on stage and in rehearsal room .\r\nAll songs have been recorded live at Elfo Recording Studio(Piacenza-Italy) by Alberto Callegari and mixed & mastered by Marco Ranalli at Andruid Studio(Pescara-Italy).\r\nThe recordings has been mastered keeping the dynamic range on the value 11 to maintain the lower compression possible and the highest dynamic.\r\nThe songs “Leaving the mainland again” and “Sargassian Way to Definitive Blue” has been previously released on the first Ep but with different arrangement and without synth.\r\nThe drawing of the cover has been made by Sappah (drummer of the band) .\r\nTotally addicted to vintage amps, effects & instruments they met on their way two great indie labels who have decided to invest in Da Captain.\r\n\r\nThe cost
