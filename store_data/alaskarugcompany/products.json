It is a 4 wrap knot and diameter approximately 3-1/2\"= (the ball size) . If you need a different size just let us know but this one is for an approximately 20 inch wrap around then insert ball into loop and walk away from a beautiful window treatment. \r\nIf you measure around your curtain with a string and measure the string where you would like your tie back to be and give me that measurement -- we will gladly make yours to fit custom.\r\n\r\nSimply wrap the tie back around the curtain as many times you need to and then put the monkey fist ball in the loop and it will hang snug.\r\n\r\nAll the materials used have been recycled and we UP-CYCLE it to something that now has a purpose again.\r\n\r\nGreat for any nautical theme.\r\n\r\nIt is hand-woven from Alaskan Fisherman rope/line that we are recycling.

You can clearly see in this rug that this rope has some sun and wear to it as it has been used to catch a lot of fish over the years but it is still very durable and makes for a great sturdy rug.\r\nThis mat is great for beach houses or ideal for anyone with a nautical design. We live by the sea and they are just great to have at every door way to wipe feet or to throw literally anywhere as a throw rug in a bathroom or kitchen, as water will not harm this rug.\r\nCan be washed in cold water and is best with cold water hose outside and then lay flat for drying in sun.\r\nGreat gifts for friends that have everything or to treat yourself to a recycled item.\r\n\r\nI will be happy to make custom rugs for you so please don't hesitate to contact me through this listing and tell me what you have in mind.
