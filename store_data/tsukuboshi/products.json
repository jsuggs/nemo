Wind, thunderstorm, rain, snow … Is he the clergyman who announces the debacle? Wants he to make the partition of the event or simply to point us of the finger the natural beauty? Two interpretations, two faces of the sound object. The touchy power of Static Island, second piece of 12 minutes, lets envisage the most black intentions. After a bucolic introduction at the edge of river, it is under the barrage of humming basses, of dusty showers, that he releases striking images, words were cut by a radio voice. The sky scolds, leaving then behind him the twinkling and generous landscapes of Dentrites or Frozen Tones.\r\nSix long pieces pull Aymeric de Tapol in best sound: economic arrangements, simple centrings which leave to narrative compositions taking the influence on \" the fieldrecording effect \". Aymeric comes to walk on the ground of the parts of the country of the east triangle (one majorities of the recordings during the residence \" European Sound Delta \" on the barge which have to navigate the Rhine, enter Mons, Brussels, Antwerp, Rotterdam, Cologne and Frankfurt, another part in Strasbourg), record \" in the former(ancient)\", in some unique grips and without alteration, retouch, showing several facets of his attractive know-how of sound recordist and composer (he works for the contemporary dance, the radio creation, for the cinema and the documentary movies.).\r\nThe grips buzz in a quite at once ample, deep way, but also celestial and melodic. The fright and the dissonances, the echos and the organic masses, the symbolism means - ageuse of the sound and Microsound, its album invites us above all to rediscover the earth by listening to the singing of stars .. far off.","options":[{"id":12644352,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36829622/-/Aymeric_light_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36829622/-/Aymeric_light_cover.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[{"id":56840,"name":"Aymeric de Tapol","permalink":"aymeric-de-tapol","url":"/artist/aymeric-de-tapol"}],"categories":[{"id":1967508,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":3453840,"name":"Leafcutter John \"Tunis\"","permalink":"leafcutter-john-tunis","position":3,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/leafcutter-john-tunis","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-03-20T00:44:41.000Z","description":"\"Tunis\" arose from a project within the framework of the partnership with the festival FEST in Carthage and Tunis.

A sound conclusion which we find on this album built from the recording of the performance.\r\nIt is not for all that a live recording, but a real new album. It is a beautiful surprise.. Half of the titles take an approach slightly scratched with a folk or religious song. Other half presents compositions taking their source in the concrete music.

But the two musicians are first of all story tellers, whether in their solo projects or here for this first collaboration. Inventing a pop folk on the edge of the cliff, extrapolating contemporary or acousmatic music in the universes of Oval or Microstoria, each track presents a new aspect of a work based on encounters and individual attempts... Treated strings, natural sounds of the wind or the street, harp rustling or bucolic guitar melody, the music makes noise or listens to the world around. Gusts of desires mixed with microscopic synthetic sounds let music turn into a wild protean piece of work, quiet and sparkling. Space and silence. We get totally sucked into these sonic mechanisms made in turns of metal or ebony. Polished crystalline sounds, blurred and repeated microsounds, sound waves echo like our every day life. The artists develop and intensify things here. The spiky nano-systems of our urban lives... still, these fragrances do have a certain undergrowth tonality.","options":[{"id":11632916,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/33543400/-/Sogar_SebRox_moy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/33543400/-/Sogar_SebRox_moy.jpg","width":640,"height":480}],"artists":[{"id":56836,"name":"Sebastien Roux","permalink":"sebastien-roux","url":"/artist/sebastien-roux"},{"id":56852,"name":"Sogar","permalink":"sogar","url":"/artist/sogar"}],"categories":[{"id":1967508,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":3454064,"name":"Lodz \"Heniek\"","permalink":"lodz-heniek","position":5,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lodz-heniek","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-03-20T01:42:23.000Z","description":"Lodz signs a unique and successful disc, which is not without evoking a sort of B.O of fantasy and dumb film, taken out of some rubble of the XXth century.
