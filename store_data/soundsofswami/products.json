They do remind me of a band from the 90’s called Bluetip as well which is a very good thing in my eyes\" - Paul Hoddy, Mass Movement\r\n\r\n\"Oh my God, is it ever cool. Fucking cool and then some. The opening track, 'Brass Tax' is a total killer\" - Neil Duncan, Issue Punk Zine\r\n\r\n\"More red hot punk action from the incredibly reliable TNS Records, Soulful, angry, passion-fuelled and with a sense of humour. Brilliant!\" - Jumbo Records\r\n\r\n\"The one thing that strikes you about Sounds of Swami is the variety of music tempo even during individual tracks. The very first song on the album, ‘Brass Tax’, emphasises this point exactly as break neck verses are interspersed with much slower and melodic lines. This is a brave thing to do but on the whole they pull it off with great effect\" - Punkonline.co.uk\r\n\r\n\"This clearly demonstrates the bands own justifiable belief in their abilities; the entire album is awash wash with ideas and an obvious desire to challenge their audience; the musical textures that run through the entire album are what elevates Sound Of Swami\" - Phil Newall, LouderThanWar.com\r\n\r\n\"Punkish choruses, fast, wild, energic and ironic and social lyrics this album have it everything you need packed in noise\" - MPTY Zine, Romania","options":[{"id":29653610,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/93205370/-/Swami_Album_Cover_Front.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/93205370/-/Swami_Album_Cover_Front.png","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":21650,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":290719,"name":"Halcyon Days 7\" EP (2009)","permalink":"halcyon-days-7-coming-june-09","position":4,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/halcyon-days-7-coming-june-09","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-05-03T15:08:14.000Z","description":"<b>Halcyon Days</b> - The second ep on 7\" with free MP3 download included.\r\n\r\n<b>Side A</b>\r\n1.
