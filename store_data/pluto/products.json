Honing their distinguishable style by inflecting the melodies of emo with aggressive hardcore dominance, these four young men have capitalized on the wave of metalcore bands that emerged in the public&#8217;s eye throughout 2001 and have succeeded in creating their own niche in a scene that seems to be overflowing with talent. Similar to such lauded independent artists as Thursday, Thrice, and Grade, Shmunks for You rage with the passion of devoted musicians and the conviction of their faith. The combination of screams and light singing works most effectively on &#8220;You Don&#8217;t Need a Death Certificate to Die,&#8221; where Adam Sands and Scott Victory feed off each other&#8217;s every word as their lyrics delicately deal with being ready to die. Other high points on this spiritually cluttered album include &#8220;Twenty-Four Hours&#8221; and the moody harmonies of &#8220;The Known Is Ended.&#8221; While those less inclined to enjoy groups who promote religious faith may not find much here to enjoy, anyone with an open mind or a solid love of hardcore/punk should be more than pleased with Shmunks for You. ~ Jason D.

Blazing and raw, if you&#8217;re into bands like Rancid and Good Riddance, check this out.\r\n\r\n\tCrafting snotty hardcore punk diatribes based around the trials and tribulations of being a rebellious teenager, Kansas City&#8217;s the Underdog Conspiracy follow in the footsteps of other die-hard punk rockers such as Good Riddance and Face to Face. Their full-length debut, simply titled Victory, traverses the common ground that many other similar groups have covered before, yet the raw, unrestrained energy displayed here is worth hearing. Musically the Underdog Conspiracy are centered around the prominent bass presence of Joe Krohn and gritty vocal delivery courtesy of Ryan Antrim and Ryan Beye. The guitars hark back to Lifetime and older Suicide Machines influences, yet occasionally one can glimpse a dedicated, simplistic rock/metal style that recalls early Black Sabbath. The majority of the tracks that make up Victory are the expected punk offerings, brief and straight to the point. When the group extends their attention span and makes it past the three-minute mark, they manage to truly shine, such as on &#8220;Alone&#8221; and the title track. Other standouts include the infectious hooks that create the bulk of &#8220;The Storm Is Now,&#8221; the stop-and-go rhythm of &#8220;Blindness,&#8221; and the spiritual ode &#8220;Eulogy.&#8221; ~ Jason D.

The band played together for over two years before recording their first e.p., which they released independently (and later caught the attention of Takehold Records, who re-released the e.p in 1999). They play a brand of pop-punk with equal doses of a emo-pop thrown in like pro&#8217;s. While the album starts out on a punkish note, it ends with some beautiful, well-played emo rock appealing to fans of Dear Ephesus, Appleseed Cast, Pedro the Lion, and Brandtson. Crisp production combine with this group&#8217;s talent to make this album a winner.
