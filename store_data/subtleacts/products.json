You spot a bird you have never seen before. You listen to its song, watch as it cleans its feathers while perched on a limb just overhead. Your mind is racing - take a picture, take a picture before it leaves! And as you bring your camera up to snap the photo, it's gone, lost in the canopy. Drats! Well at least you have this handy little notebook to write down a description of the bird, draw a sketch of it, before you forget! Just don't forget your pencil...\r\n\r\nI based this hand carved stamp off of all of the sweet badges kids earn in scouting groups. Why should kids (and law enforcement officers) be the only ones with badges? You deserve a badge for being the type of person who cares to write things down the old-fashioned way - with a pencil or pen!\r\n\r\n*************\r\nJournal Information:\r\nMoleskine Notebook\r\n3.5 inches by 5.5 inches\r\n64 lined or blank pages\r\nPocket in the back to store loose notes\r\n\r\nThe carved stamp does not come with the notebook.
