I look at my own writing personae as a character in a noir film who doesn't take any bull and is always quick with a well-timed and dagger-sharp jab to the place where I least expect it but need it the most. It also helps that my favorite genre of movie is the heist or long con noir themes. Those films always have an elder leading the novice. A power struggle increases the dramatic tension within the film. Within my life, it is my writing potential that is always leading, instigating, and punching me to do more. And sometimes, as in good noir films, I'm always one step behind a double cross.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":16095817,"name":"Small","price":17.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16095819,"name":"Medium","price":17.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16095821,"name":"Large","price":17.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16095823,"name":"X-Large","price":17.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":20.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/48791701/-/brick_fisted_web_size_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/48791701/-/brick_fisted_web_size_2.jpg","width":500,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49586433/-/Brick_fisted_reshoot.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49586433/-/Brick_fisted_reshoot.jpg","width":500,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58047297/-/Brick_fisted_postcard_tshirt_product_web_size_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58047297/-/Brick_fisted_postcard_tshirt_product_web_size_2.jpg","width":1000,"height":667}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1943784,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":4325939,"name":"Vrsd I : 3","permalink":"vrsd-i-3","position":3,"price":17.5,"default_price":17.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/vrsd-i-3","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-08-26T18:15:18.000Z","description":"<font face=\"impact\" size=\"2\">Emotions run deep in this jellyfish themed Tshirt hand screened with eco-friendly inks on American Apparel  Tri-blend Track unisex tshirts.

That is pretty obvious. It is much more. I lived in Music City for 4 good years. I made a wealth of friends and it is still a city I would happily return to visit. Most southern cities get a reputation for not having what New York, Chicago, or Los Angeles has to offer in things to do. When I first moved to Nashville and after a hard relationship split I wrote Coffee/Bars to capture the mood I was in at the time. The building featured is a downtown landmark familiar to most Nashvillians and one that, I hope, presents a hopeful future for this beloved former city of mine. The poem may have a sad theme but there is a humorous undertone that, I believe, is in every sad song belted out in Nashville's music scene...which doesn't always involve country.</font>","options":[{"id":14165695,"name":"Small","price":17.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14165697,"name":"Medium","price":17.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14165699,"name":"Large","price":17.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14165701,"name":"X-Large","price":17.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":20.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36273366/-/Nashville_is_not_NY_final_web_size.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36273366/-/Nashville_is_not_NY_final_web_size.jpg","width":500,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72745399/-/Nashville_product_size.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72745399/-/Nashville_product_size.jpg","width":500,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/42089047/-/Nashville_postcard_tshirt_product_websize.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/42089047/-/Nashville_postcard_tshirt_product_websize.jpg","width":1000,"height":667}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1943784,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":3601514,"name":"Vrsd I : 1","permalink":"vrsd-i-1","position":5,"price":17.5,"default_price":17.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/vrsd-i-1","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-04-15T07:13:20.000Z","description":"<font face=\"impact\" size=\"2\">Chicago's famous skyline featured in Versed Apparel's premiere Tshirt design.
