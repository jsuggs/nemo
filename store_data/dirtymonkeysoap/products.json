Sprinkle a bit of this in your bath and relax at the end of a long day while your stress melts away.\r\n\r\nThe salt I use comes directly from Dead Sea Salts LTD. Israel. I do not add any dyes and only add high quality fragrance or essential oils. The salt is a medium fine grade that will dissolve very nicely in the bath without being too rough on the skin or causing grit beneath you in the tub.\r\n\r\nThis listing is for one roughly 9 oz. size jar of bath salts. The container is recyclable and reusable.\r\n\r\nIf payment is received before 5 p.m. Eastern time I will ship your order out the same day. Please be sure your shipping address is correct. I will send you a tracking number and as always will include goodies for you to try.\r\n\r\nThanks for shopping the Dirty Monkey Soap Co.!
