The metallic gold and silver inks, his kindly smile and a few of his best rallying cries offset the potential sting of featuring the good doctor in the iconic format of his greatest foe's thoroughly debased instrument of central control. The glow-in-the-dark inks and rock & roll typography are visual exclamation points that help communicate Dr. Paul's message of liberty boldly. This striking, collectible proclamation of support for Ron Paul's inspiring run at the highest office is sure to be treasured by any whose apathy he's cured.\r\n\r\nThe silkscreened print features a 16\" x 20\" image area printed in in 4 colors (Deep Green, Metallic Gold, Metallic Silver & Glow-in-the-dark Florescent Yellow) on 18\" x 24\" Matte White Art Paper printed by the legendary ink slingers at Iron Forge Press.
