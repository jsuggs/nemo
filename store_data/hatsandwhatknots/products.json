Well now you can crochet my Adjustable Cocoon Photography Prop. This cute photography prop can be adjusted to fit the tiniest of newborns, to infant. \r\n\r\nMy son was almost an ounce shy of 9 lbs when he was born, and those tiny photography props don't always fit newborns. So I came up with this neat idea to have an adjustable cocoon. Not only can it be used as a cocoon you can lay it down and use it as a blanket as well. \r\n\r\nHere is a You Tube video of the actual photography prop. \r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9-9u4TEKgM&feature=g-upl\r\n\r\nThis is such a versatile photography prop you will sure fall in love with it.\r\n\r\nThis pattern is written is US terms.
