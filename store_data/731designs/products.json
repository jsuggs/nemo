The idea came from my niece who sat down to write me a letter in my handy notebook. She told me to not to read it until she was finished. I thought it was the sweetest thing, and immediately jotted down the date, her name and where we were at the time.\r\n\r\nIn a time when kids are texting and typing in their laptops, I thought this would be a great way to help them discover the art of writing, and the beauty of handwriting. It is also a great memento of their first writings. Each page has a space for you to write down the date, and place they were at when they wrote down their first scribbles. It might not seem like much now, but it will make for great memories when they grow up, and they grow up so fast. \r\n\r\nThe notebook can be a keepsake for the child, or for the parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles in their lives. Choose from pre-filled tags stating, \"a gift for my Mommy and Daddy\", \"a gift for Mommy and Mommy\", \"a gift for Daddy and Daddy\", or \"a gift for [ you fill in the blank]\". Please state what you would like the tag to read when ordering.\r\n\r\n5.5 x 7.5 inches, 42 pages all-together, lined sheets with the alphabet and numbers for your little one to practice their writing, and blank sheets with moon, star and sun to keep their first drawings. Layout and illustrations all done by me. 70 lb ultra white felt paper, textured hard cover in light yellow or light gray. Comes with handy hand painted muslin bag, drawing made with letters from the alphabet.","options":[{"id":45770316,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125850846/-/IMG_5923.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125850846/-/IMG_5923.jpg","width":1959,"height":1594}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3749753,"name":"Gift ideas","permalink":"gift-ideas","url":"/category/gift-ideas"}]},{"id":8995328,"name":"Good Luck \"card\" gift set","permalink":"good-luck-card-gift-set","position":2,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/good-luck-card-gift-set","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-17T19:00:39.000Z","description":"This playful flat note card is linen paper on one side, with beautiful textured shimmering paper on the other.
