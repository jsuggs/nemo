Combine this with the richly colourful, pure wool tartan base and soft green worsted weight wool lining, and you have a bag made of the most ridiculously luxurious materials.\r\n\r\nMeasuring approx. 11\" x 12\" and 4\" deep, the \"Dr\" bag has a firm plastic base, and metal twist lock and feet. The interior pocket is closed with a YKK zip. The faux tortoise shell handles are hard, scratch resistant polyester acrylic and have an opening of approx. 5\" from the top of the bag, to the top of the inside of the handle. To add further enhancement, they have been attached with tabs of rich yellow Italian lambskin leather.\r\n\r\nAll my bags are entirely handmade by me in a smoke free, and pet free studio. They are double-stitched throughout, and triple stitched at any stress points. To keep their shape, they are all fully interfaced with ultra thick interfacing, and each comes packaged in its own protective cotton dust cover.\r\n\r\nEvery single bag we create is a one off design, never to be repeated in exactly the same way again.

The unbrushed mohair adds an interesting textural contrast and this, combined with the butterscotch toned chain handle, just screams luxury. The heavy weight cotton lining is printed with a stylized seagull design and ensures the bag is as hard-wearing as it is beautiful.\r\n\r\nMeasuring approx. 14\" x 18\", the \"Vivienne\" is a substantial, fashionably over-sized bag with a totally on trend shoulder strap. The bag closes with a metal twist lock in the flap closure, and a magnetic snap inside the bag for extra security. Each of the three pockets, two exterior and one interior, closes with a YKK zip. The chunky chain handle is scratch-resistant polyester acrylic, and adds drama and interest, without adding weight.\r\n\r\nAll my bags are entirely handmade by me in a smoke free, and pet free studio. They are double-stitched throughout, and triple stitched at any stress points. To keep their shape, they are all fully interfaced, in this case, with the same interface as used in winter-weight patchwork quilts, and each comes packaged in its own protective cotton dust cover.\r\n\r\nEvery single bag we create is a one off design, never to be repeated in exactly the same way again.
