The band have taken their riff-heavy Classic Metal sound and shifted the groove and aggression up a gear while also incorporating more progressive arrangements. As always, Laura’s wailing vocals and harmonies give the album a truly unique edge. Chris Fielding’s (Conan, Electric Wizard, Cerebral Bore, Primordial) production has given the whole album a huge sound with the analogue warmth missing from many modern metal albums. \r\n\r\n1.
