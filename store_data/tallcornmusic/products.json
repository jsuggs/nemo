Calabash is no longer around, but it was nice because you could search for music by country, and they had an extensive African library.  I was browsing through the music from Mali, and I came across a couple of tracks from Jah Youssouf's album Son Son Son.  His music struck me as being such an interesting combination of influences - distinctly West African but somehow referencing something much larger.  At some point, I did a Google search for Jah Youssouf and discovered that he actually had a website and was doing a little bit of touring in Canada.  I looked into trying to see a show of his, but the timing was bad so I couldn't catch him.\r\n\r\nA couple years later I decided to try and take a trip to Mali.  I wanted to learn more about Malian music, and I was fascinated about Africa in general. I thought I'd try and get in touch with Jah since he was one of most interesting contemporary Malian musicians that I had heard.  I tried to send  a few emails through his website, but didn't hear back from him.\r\n\r\nA few months later (May of 2009) I found myself in Bamako, Mali.  In a great stroke of luck, I got an email from one of Jah's Canadian friends, JP Melville with Jah's cell phone number a couple of days after I arrived. I called Jah up initially just to ask if he was playing any shows while I was going to be in Bamako - he wasn't, due to the fact that he was in the throws of trying to organize another trip to Canada.  We made plans to meet up, and he kindly invited me out to his house in Moribabougou for lunch (about 30 minutes outside of Bamako). I brought my little Zoom recorder to our lunch date, and we did a little bit of casual recording at his home. I was hooked.  I was immediately struck not only by Jah's gifts (which I already had some exposure too) but also by his wife Bintou's prowess as a musician. I had already made plans to take a trip to out the Dogon Country, but we made a plan to try and record as much as possible after I returned, and they graciously offered to let me stay in their home.  I did just that and these recordings are gleaned from those two weeks at their home in Moribabougou, Mali.\r\n\r\nI think it's worth noting how distant my time with Jah and Bintou felt from the routines of my western life. Despite Jah's accomplishments as a musician (touring a little bit overseas and extensively in West Africa, a good deal of local acclaim from a song called \"Ne toun be min\", and his music making it to a website where I could hear it in the first place) he and his family lived a very fragile existence.  Their home did not have running water and electricity was provided by a car battery.  The most basic of needs were difficult to come by.\r\nDespite this, there was a graciousness and openness to Jah and Bintou as well as their family and friends that seems very hard to come by in most places I've lived and travelled.\r\n\r\nI was completely enchanted and enveloped by Jah and Bintou's music.  I hope you enjoy these recordings, and I'd be delighted if money from selling them could provide a little stability for Jah and Bintou's family.  They are such gifted musicians and kind people.  I feel very lucky to have had that time together in Moribabougou and to have these recordings as a memento.\r\n\r\n-Brad Loving (a.k.a.

With an effortless grasp on sound design, Laufer combines deceptively simple and emotive melodies, subtle bass drops and swinging slow motion drums. His early work has placed him at the forefront of a new wave of rising talent amongst West Coast producers...\r\n\r\n\u000b\u000bInspired by the desire to write songs and create a release of full-range instrumentation and vocals all his own, Laufer promptly began home-recording Bad Vibes, his proper full-length debut album for the Friends of Friends label.

Translucent Red 12\" Vinyl with Translucent Gold 7\" in Poly Vinyl picture disc/colored disc sleeve with flap. \r\n\r\nFor Jasper Patterson AKA Groundislva, creativity combined with the video game, sci-fi sounds and general aesthetics of the 1980’s have been instilled since day one. A young 20 year old hailing from Venice, California, Jasper's father both animated and directed the classic “Take On Me” video by A-Ha and while Groundislava isn’t exactly the next logical step from the Norwegian new wave group, Jasper takes that same creative freedom and emotion and injects it into a sound grounded in beats, video games, technology and self-proclaimed “nerdy shit.” As part of the Wedidit Collective (helmed by his old\r\nschoolmate Henry Laufer, better known as Shlohmo), Groundislava is the next representative stepping into the light and exposing a group of youngsters each with their own nonchalantly expert takes on forms of beat and electronic music.\r\n\r\nWhile deeply infatuated with the styles of house music and minimal techno (check “The Dig” or “Stealth River Mission”), on his debut self-titled LP, Groundislava takes old templates of 8 bit and chip-tune styles and turns them into worlds full of oozing, swirling melodies backed by driving drum beats, heavy bass drops and soaring vocal melodies in spots from vocalist Weary. Alongside the crop of up and coming worldwide electronic producers such as Shlohmo, Young Montana? and another former classmate Baths, Patterson is\r\nprimed and ready to unleash his unique brand of woozy 8-bit composition. Whereas much music that utilizes the 8 bit sound tends to feel fully mechanized and soulless, GIL injects heartfelt harmonies and melodies that demand attention – “Final Impasse” and “One For Her” will surely make you stop in your tracks and listen up. Elsewhere, Wedidit cohorts Jon Wayne and Shlohmo stop by for the track “Shlava,” with Wayne delivering super on point and off the cuff raps on top of Jasper’s laid-back video game beat vibes. Another early favorite is the sinister and downtempo “Animal,” featuring Weary’s dark and twisted croons. After a well-received free EP giveaway in early '11, Groundislava’s self-titled debut LP + 7\" is scheduled for release on 4/12 through the Friends of Friends Music label. Included with the 12 song long-player are remixes from Young Montana? and Clive Tanaka... with plans for a split cassette with Shlohmo scheduled for summer.\r\n","options":[{"id":11399736,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":14.75,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":24.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/32714024/-/ground_is_lava_digital_v1-small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/32714024/-/ground_is_lava_digital_v1-small.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/34805140/-/GIL.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/34805140/-/GIL.jpg","width":800,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":54434,"name":"Grounislava","permalink":"grounislava","url":"/artist/grounislava"}],"categories":[{"id":1788751,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":3370600,"name":"Groundislava gold 7\" vinyl featuring remix by Clive Tanaka and Beaunoise","permalink":"grounislava-gold-7-vinyl-featuring-remix-by-clive-tanaka-and-beaunoise","position":15,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/grounislava-gold-7-vinyl-featuring-remix-by-clive-tanaka-and-beaunoise","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-03-04T01:12:01.000Z","description":"Comes with digital! 7\" translucent gold record in Poly Vinyl picture disc/colored disc sleeve with flap. \r\n\r\nA : The Dig\r\nB: Panorama (Clive Tanaka and Beaunoise Remix)","options":[{"id":11400138,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/32714328/-/ground_is_lava_digital_v2_yin_yangless_-_small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/32714328/-/ground_is_lava_digital_v2_yin_yangless_-_small.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":54432,"name":"Shlohmo","permalink":"shlohmo","url":"/artist/shlohmo"}],"categories":[{"id":1788751,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":3370392,"name":"Beaunoise - Ambient I - Cassette","permalink":"beaunoise-ambient-i","position":16,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/beaunoise-ambient-i","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-03-04T00:23:57.000Z","description":"SOLD OUT - Please visit \r\n\r\nhttp://www.freewebs.com/burgerrecords/apps/webstore/products/show/2316429\r\n\r\nComes with digital!\r\n\r\nBeaunoise - Ambient I Cassette\r\n\r\nMiembro de la orquesta\r\n\r\nBuy digital only here: http://beaunoise.bandcamp.com/","options":[{"id":11399476,"name":"Default","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.46,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/32713572/-/TC012digital_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/32713572/-/TC012digital_cover.jpg","width":627,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1788753,"name":"Cassette","permalink":"cassette","url":"/category/cassette"}]},{"id":3202689,"name":"Salva's \"Complex Housing\" Blue Vinyl LP ","permalink":"salva-s-complex-housing-blue-vinyl-lp","position":17,"price":11.0,"default_price":11.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/salva-s-complex-housing-blue-vinyl-lp","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-01-29T03:13:45.000Z","description":"*** COMES WITH DIGITAL *** Blue 12\" vinyl in Poly Vinyl picture disc/colored disc sleeve with flap. \r\n\r\nA Friends of Friends / Tall Corn Music Joint Release\r\n\r\nXLR8R 8/10\r\nPitchfork 7.6/10\r\n\r\n***\r\n\"Paul Salva is a funky motherfucker,\" says The Fader. Beyond those who already know this, the rest of the electronic music world is catching wind of the 29 year old producer, DJ, promoter and label boss. Already heralded by the Numbers, Ernest Endeavors and LuckyMe crews in the UK, the Low End Theory residents in LA and his own Frite Nite label/crew in SF, Salva is primed as he preps the release of his debut album, Complex Housing for the Friends of Friends (FoF Music) label.\r\n\r\nGrowing up in Chicago in the 80's, Salva cites early inspiration in all sorts of of electronic and sampled-based music ranging from electro, juke, analog house, ghetto house, underground hip hop and bass productions. With a strong foot in all of these idioms, Salva creates a future-leaning style of electronic dance music that is all his own. Shimmering synthesizers collide with funky vintage drum programming, heavy bass drops and rapid arpeggios to create an album that remain both listenable and danceable.\r\n\r\nWith big boomers like \"Wake Ups\" and \"Blue\" bringing out the inner future-funk beat junky, the record switches gears and influences with the glistening sleeze/pop of Zackey Force Funk's guest appearance on \"40 Karats\" and a more housey/UK Funky approach on \"Keys Open Doors.\" Salva also pays homage to his Chicago-house roots covering Robert Owens' classic \"I'll Be Your Friend\" and bringing it into the 21st century, making this album a true dance music melting pot.\r\n\r\nSalva also invited some friends to the mix as remixes from B Bravo, MachineDrum, My Dry Wet Mess and Lando Kal all represent on the record. What makes this album unique is not only Salva's experimental yet melodic approach, but the diversity and taste he shows while doing it...\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":10913415,"name":"Default","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31080197/-/COMPLEX_HOUSING-FINAL.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31080197/-/COMPLEX_HOUSING-FINAL.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31086041/-/logoFOF-small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31086041/-/logoFOF-small.jpg","width":926,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1788751,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":3074573,"name":"Clive Tanaka y su orquesta's \"Jet Set Siempre 1°\" Aqua Vinyl Record","permalink":"jet-set-siempre-1-aqua-vinyl-record","position":18,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/jet-set-siempre-1-aqua-vinyl-record","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-12-30T00:46:23.000Z","description":"Comes with digital!\r\n\r\nAltered Zones Best Albums of 2010: \r\n\r\n\"His Jet Set Siempre 1° tape melts down sounds from all over the globe into vintage synth bangers.

When spring 2009 found him living in Chicago “working a steady job and sort of cruising on autopilot,” he decided to quit said job and take a month-long trip to Mali, an experience that affected him profoundly and influenced to a major degree the material that would come to be Onze Pedras, his full-length follow-up to the recent Brightest Solids EP. Returning to the US, he moved to Brooklyn, spent five months refining the music, made further trips to Japan and Texas, and finally hit Chicago's Soma studios in December of 2009 to pull everything together in the company of Tortoise's John McEntire. If, therefore, the album exudes a globe-trotting vibe, no one should be too surprised, given the recording's circuitous production history (for the record, he's also spent time in Brazil and France, locations that likewise influenced the album's tracks). Call it Fourth World electronica if you like, or don't call it anything if you'd rather just listen and let Lobisomem's tripped-out music wash over you.\r\n\r\nAugmented by a smattering of guest musicians (guitarist David Daniell, drummer Nori Tanaka, and guitarist Matt Leer, to name three) Loving contributes harmonium, synthesizer, melodica, piano, electronics, and laptop to the recording. The African influence surfaces prominently in the percussion patterns that animate “Oxbow,” even if that dimension quickly vanishes, leaving an electronic drone in its wake. That influence is felt again during “Consonants and Vowels” when chanted vocals and hand percussion appear. On the hip-hop tip, we have the boom-bap of “She's Made of Clay,” the Casio-tinged electronic jam “Concussus” (spiked by a mellow trumpet solo by Jaimie Branch), and “Under the Aegis,” which merges hip-hop and African music with a grooving slab of bass-heavy funk. There are also hints of krautrock (“Another Song about Euryale”) and a pulsating electro-fireball distinguished by Bob Jones' string presence (“Incumbent Upon Us”). In contrast to the quick-change character of the other pieces, Loving lets the electro-acoustic dirge “Saidera Harmony” unfold patiently.\r\n\r\nLike the musics of Tortoise and Four Tet, Loving's music sidesteps easy pigeonholing (the heavily rhythm-oriented electro-shuffler “Zinc” could even pass for a Tortoise outtake). Tracks chameleonically change colours several times, with krautrock and spacey loping grooves giving way to African or post-rock episodes and becoming genre-defying hybrids in the process. All such details make Loving's Lobisomem project seem connected in spirit, even if tangentially, to an act like The Art Ensemble of Chicago, which has been challenging genre conventions for decades with its own world music. \r\n\r\n-TEXTURA","options":[{"id":10966669,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31253097/-/Lobisomem_Onze_Pedras_small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31253097/-/Lobisomem_Onze_Pedras_small.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1788751,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":3220585,"name":"Lobisomem's \"Brightest Solids\" 180 Vinyl EP","permalink":"lobisomem-s-brightest-solids-180-vinyl-ep","position":22,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lobisomem-s-brightest-solids-180-vinyl-ep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-02-01T22:30:23.000Z","description":"*** COMES WITH DIGITAL ***\r\n\r\nLobisomem makes electronic music. His music, however, does not fall comfortably into the boxes that one normally uses to categorize electronic music. It is neither dance music, nor raw experimental noise. It is instead a hybrid of more subtle influences referencing African, South American, and Jamaican music as well as more native forces such as hip-hop and jazz. Lobisomem’s artistry has also been impacted by his immersion in Chicago’s improvisational music scene. The music on this recording, Lobisomem’s second release “Brightest Solids – EP,” began as laptop compositions, but upon arrival at the studio the music was migrated to tape, manually manipulated and mixed in an entirely analog studio set up, and mastered straight to vinyl lacquer. The results are a unique amalgam of sound and rhythm, digital and analog, precise angular turns and gentle organic sweeps. Work has begun on a full-length LP that will also be released on Tall Corn Music.
