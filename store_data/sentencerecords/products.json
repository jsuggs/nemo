Lianne brings a human touch and focal point to the otherwise perfect experimental electronic music of d_rradio. John Peel once described Lianne Hall as “one of the great English voices.”  How right he was.\r\nMaking spaces is a beautiful album and will undoubtedly be in every “Best Albums of the Year 2010” list, come December.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Textura:\r\n\"Pitched somewhere between Susanna Wallumrød and Edie Brickell, Hall's voice is a remarkably expressive and emotive instrument, whether it's waxing rapturously in “The Moral at the End” and “Up” or fragile and delicate when floating o'ertop a stuttering hip-hop base during “Under Water.” d_rradio is no slouch in the arrangement category either, with the songs boldly sewn together from a richly atmospheric blend of guitars, strings, piano, bass, and drums. Driven by a funky acoustic bass figure and swinging 4/4 pulse, “Stormy Weather” pushes the collaborators into trip-hop territory, while “Full On” strips things down to acoustic folk song form. In fact, virtually every song finds them tackling a different style—compare the dramatic torch song “Dressing Up,” with Hall's velvety voice accompanied by an orchestral backing, to the wistful, REM-like folk song “Spring” as an example of the kind of contrast that extends throughout the set. If I'm still a tad confused about exactly who and what d_rradio is after hearing its two most recent releases, I'm nevertheless enjoying both, despite their diametric differences.\"\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n1) ‘The Moral At The End’\r\n2) ‘Under Water’\r\n3) ‘Stormy Weather’\r\n4) ‘Full On’\r\n5) ‘Berlin Winter’\r\n6) ‘Dressing Up’\r\n7) ‘Up’\r\n8) ‘Making Spaces’\r\n9) ‘Spring’\r\nTotal running time: 30:26","options":[{"id":5747101,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/16130731/-/Making-Spaces.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/16130731/-/Making-Spaces.jpg","width":354,"height":354}],"artists":[{"id":27191,"name":"d_rradio & Lianne Hall","permalink":"d_rradio-lianne-hall","url":"/artist/d_rradio-lianne-hall"}],"categories":[{"id":970921,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":1560611,"name":"'Leaves' by d_rradio","permalink":"leaves","position":3,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/leaves","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-02-11T19:58:39.000Z","description":"2xCD album by d_rradio on <a href=\"http://www.symbolicinteraction.net/\">Symbolic Interaction<a/>.\r\n\r\nFrom Norman Records (Album of the Month):\r\n\"From the off, the opener lulls you into a warm dense dark orchestral drone which sucks you in to the point of acceptance that you're just gonna have to get it. It did it for both Brian and me within minutes. I guess the inital obvious comparison is the more recent Stars of The Lid stuff what it being a bit more orchestral sounding and all warm and droney. Elements of the ambient end of Brian Eno are apparent too... It's very melodic and there's quite a lot going on really, for the sort of music that it is. It's a peaceful uplifting experience which is something I've not had in a while. it's abso-fucking-lutely gorgeous and if you're into ambience and drone then you need this. Fans of Brian Eno, Stars of The Lid, Williams Basinski, Harold Budd, the Infraction label will lap this up like starving kittens. Dense waves of drone and melody are battering me sideways.

Fuelled by a subdued euphoria, d_rradio's post-rock meets electronica output recalls Hood at their poppiest and Ulrich Schnauss at his moodiest. Clocking in just short of forty minutes, there is enough invention at play and lushness in the production to make it work to savour for post rock and electronic heads alike.
