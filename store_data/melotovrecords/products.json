Deathwish</i>\r\n\r\nFor “I.V.” the band’s Deathwish debut, Loma Prieta once again worked with longtime collaborator Jack Shirley (Atomic Garden Studio).  Written during a time of great personal suffering and transition for the band \"I.V.\" is the creative culmination of those collective experiences. From the opening breath of “Fly by Night”, Loma Prieta crash and bang melody and discord together into one beautiful work of art. This grinding theme continues throughout \"I.V.\" in stunning songs like the aptly named three parter \"Trilogy 4, 5, and 6\". Creating a powerful and unpredictable ebb and flow to their emotional outpouring. As the dust settles on the distorted haze in closer \"Diamond Tooth\", an artistic coherency and clarity emerges that can only be described as Loma Prieta. A new kind of melancholy chaos that should be familiar, yet challenging, to those who enjoy bands like Love Lost But Not Forgotten, Pg. 99, La Quiete, and the ilk.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F25827815\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":33353617,"name":"Default","price":10.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.04,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.58,"amount_with_others":3.47}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/104616256/-/Loma_Prieta_IV.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/104616256/-/Loma_Prieta_IV.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":194872,"name":"Loma Prieta","permalink":"loma-prieta","url":"/artist/loma-prieta"}],"categories":[{"id":279182,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"},{"id":1599298,"name":"Distro","permalink":"distro","url":"/category/distro"},{"id":2176986,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"},{"id":2517311,"name":"MELOTOV SALE!","permalink":"melotov-sale","url":"/category/melotov-sale"}]},{"id":10641556,"name":"Incendiary/Xibalba - s/t split 7\"","permalink":"incendiary-xibalba-s-t-split-7","position":13,"price":4.5,"default_price":4.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/incendiary-xibalba-s-t-split-7","status":"sold-out","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-04-19T05:26:57.000Z","description":"<i> Red marble vinyl; digital download.

Deathwish</i>\r\n\r\n\"Early Frost\" by Heiress is a grim and discordant artistic journey into the cold soul of the Pacific Northwest.\r\n\r\nRecorded by renowned engineer Jack Endino (Nirvana, Seaweed, etc), \"Early Frost\" opens with the airy post-everything beast \"All Ruins\" and immediately sets an ominous tone. Wasting no time, Heiress then dive deep into the awe inducing title track \"Early Frost\". A beautifully haunting song filled with delicate melody and hair raising emotion. Songs like the unforgettable \"Beyond Fevering\" and eery \"Splintering\" continue this sonic exploration, experimenting with cryptic vocal stylings before unfurling true sonic power. All of first level observations aside, what is so refreshing is just how non-metal and unpredictable Heiress are, while they carry such a foreboding collective soul. Heiress melodiously twist when other artists would predictably turn up the volume. For example in the stunning track \"Again, Before\" Heiress masterfully introduce a pan flute, where other artists would inject a stereotypical guitar solo. After nine mesmerizing tracks, we are led through the darkness to the epic closer \"Bolt and Tomb\", a song which opens with thirty seconds of hypnotic percussion, building to a crescendo of truly glacial proportions. \"Early Frost\" from Heiress is an essential experience for those who are searching for substance in today's heavy music world.","options":[{"id":33353722,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.04,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.58,"amount_with_others":3.47}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/104616676/-/Heiress_Early_Frost_LP.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/104616676/-/Heiress_Early_Frost_LP.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":194881,"name":"Heiress","permalink":"heiress","url":"/artist/heiress"}],"categories":[{"id":279182,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"},{"id":1599298,"name":"Distro","permalink":"distro","url":"/category/distro"},{"id":2176986,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"}]},{"id":10444243,"name":"Graf Orlock \"Los Angeles\" 7\"","permalink":"graf-orlock-los-angeles-7","position":15,"price":6.5,"default_price":6.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/graf-orlock-los-angeles-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-09T19:52:59.000Z","description":"<i>2nd pressing, poster.

Personal favorite song on this record is \"Asphalt\" which is a testament to the hindsight bias of personal sacrifice in times of hardship.

While playing countless local shows and touring consistently they have joined forces. Engineered and Mastered at Earth Capital Studios, this record displays both bands deriving influences from pioneers such as Left For Dead, Catharsis, Integrity and His Hero is Gone. This is their most truthful, heavy and clearest work to date.
