Jonathan Walters, Sam Beere-Hasman, and Parker Thompson are now dropping their second album, Please Stand By, their first in over three years.\nDingus combines the jazz influenced vocal class of Ben Folds Five, pop sensibility of Blink 182 and the straight up kick ass driving hardcore punk of Lagwagon. Jonathan Walters&#8217; effortless tenor intones and Sam Beere&#8217;s sweet croons combine for enticing and infectious harmonies that one cannot resist but sing along. \nPlease Stand By holds ten solid tracks of mesmerizing melodic pop punk featuring romantic laments, hierarchical protests, and songs regarding post high school life. The album contains bass and guitar licks so lush and carefully placed, it is difficult to abandon these three Grand Forks, N.D. natives among today&#8217;s punk market. Dingus&#8217; musicianship is simply palpable and contains a true and innovative girth of modern pop punk, which can be appreciated by a wide alternative audience.\n\n","options":[{"id":299316,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124813/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124813/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":2014,"name":"Dingus","permalink":"dingus","url":"/artist/dingus"}],"categories":[{"id":67975,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":61143,"name":"Fridge Full of Dreams","permalink":"fridge-full-of-dreams","position":2,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fridge-full-of-dreams","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2007-12-17T20:05:59.000Z","description":"Forming in early 2004, Minneapolis&#8217; Chicken Poodle Soup is a high-energy ska band which has been a favorite local act for the past 3 years.
