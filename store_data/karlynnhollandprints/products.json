The condition is more common in males than females and is seen most commonly in individuals who have prolonged cranial exposure to cold water, such as swimmers and divers. As such, this bone disease is more commonly referred to as “Surfer’s Ear”. The smooth and rounded abnormal bone growths form in and around the auditory canal over a period of a decade or more and in extreme cases result in loss of hearing and deafness. The skull of the Osteographia’s praying skeleton, originally engraved by Gerard van der Gucht and Mr. Shinevoet with aid of a camera obscura, is paired with an intricate halo.","options":[{"id":46617867,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126468360/-/1384127_10100205932980480_1152024813_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126468360/-/1384127_10100205932980480_1152024813_n.jpg","width":640,"height":640}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6511062,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]}]
