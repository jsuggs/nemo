One thing that skaters wanted improved on them the most was more strength, and of course more speed. And so Bones made the Super Swiss Six, which has 6 larger balls instead of the regular 7. This makes the bearings stronger against impact, and it raises the bearing's top speed by lessening the amount the balls have to turn.\r\n\r\nThe balls roll less, causing less friction. This means they roll longer High top speed, beacause the balls don't have to turn as fast\r\n\r\nStronger than 7 ball bearings, so they last longer\r\n\r\nSo, if you are a little slow to try out something new, the next time you go to buy Bones Swiss, just try out a set of Super Swiss 6 instead. You'll be glad you did.\r\n\r\nWhen you do try them out, they will roll fairly fast right at the beginning, but then they sort of \"break in\", and then they roll REALLY fast. So look forward to that, and don't judge them right away.
