The original shell was found on the Cape Hatteras National Seashore in North Carolina. Wear them non-stop all year!\r\n\r\nThe earrings are 18k yellow gold with 18k posts and friction backs. I have carefully finished the gold so that they retain the deeply ridged concentric circles by lightly polishing the raised circles. Reverse is completely polished. Marked MF 18k. Ships within 2 days.\r\n\r\nI have collected shells washed onto the wild beach of the Outer Banks for years. They are never perfect- and that's ok with me. Shells that make it onto the beach on Hatteras Island are always a little smoother than shells from quieter waters.\r\n\r\nShipping is by FED EX Insured Continental US.
