The bag does not have any fastenings , instead it using a clever knotted technique to keep the bag closed. It has been inspired by the Japanese knot bag.\r\n\r\nIt has been  hand knitted in Rowan summer tweed yarn with a touch of fancy purple , blue , mustard and gold trimmings and enhancements.\r\n\r\nThe bag is felt lined using one of my felted recycled jumpers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Japanese knot bag is known to be used for carrying balls of wool round for your knitting projects. It will keep the yarn tidy and able to be neatly unravelled whilst you knit away.\r\n\r\nBut I see this bag as an ideal little nifty accessory that can be used anytime you want to keep your hands free (or not) , whether walking , cycling or wherever.\r\n\r\nIt's big enough to take make up bag , phone , purse etc , being 22cm wide and 9cm high with a 10cm handle.\r\n\r\nCute little bag.
