The title is stamped in silver above a reproduction of Warhol's signature. Features a foreword by Ingrid Sischy, former editor of Warhol's Interview Magazine, along with essays and interviews with those involved with the project, including Hirst, by Steffie Nelson. Adrian Nyman, Creative Director. Photography by Beau Roulette. Also features an appendix with photographic details. It contains 224 pages. Published by DHW Books, 2008. While shopping in New York, visual artist Damien Hirst came across the latest line from Levi's Andy Warhol collection. Inspired, he contacted Levi's asking about purchasing the entire line. Soon, he was embarking on a new collaboration, building on Warhol's previous work and connecting it to his own, using the common theme of death as a touchstone. This book is an extended document of the conception, creation, and culmination of the new line, which took six months to complete. It seamlessly weaves Warhol's images and design aesthetic with some of Hirst's iconic work, such as the infamous diamond skull, and features the final clothing product modeled by Vincent Gallo, among others. The book coincided with the \"wearable art pop-up shop\" exhibition at the Fred Segal Man, Santa Monica, CA, which was launched on April 3, 2008, which featured two new original works from Hirst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe reported about the collaboration among Hirst, Warhol, and Levi’s at Fred Segal in Los Angeles, now we’re showing you the collector’s book that will be released along with the line. The book will demonstrate the process of creating the collection and the various people involved. Death is a central theme of the book, appropriate for both artists, showing dark and ominous pictures of knives and skulls. The book showcases Hirst’s signature spot paintings and his famous diamond-studded skull, For the Love of God. The book also has an interview with Damien Hirst and fashion photographs done by Beau Roulette feature Vincent Gallo.
