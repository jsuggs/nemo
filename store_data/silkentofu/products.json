Using only a tabletop guitar, effects and the occasional autoharp, he creates abstract droning soundscapes, stripped of all unnecessary elements, focussing solely on the timbre and tone of his instrument.\r\n\r\nIt’s this timbre that is vital in his musical works, in that the harmonic spectrums of the drones and the enhanced sounds he typically produces with his electric tabletop guitar are progressively shifting. Synonymous with timbre is the quasi-poetic phrase tone colour.\r\n\r\nThese elements are equally visible in Gheysen’s visual art, consisting mostly of abstract prints and paintings. There is obviously a play with the tones of a colour, thus an inversion of the aforementioned musical term. This pertinent in- and decrease of saturation and of temperature in the pictorial field is comparable to what is going on in his music.\r\n\r\nMoreover, these are features which are obviously emphasised in the videos the artist has been creating since 2011. They show lines dance rather timidly, make turns or float along accompanied by passing spots and travelling smears in a scenery of inks and paint. The imagery, strongly reminiscent of his prints and paintings, is enlivened by humming guitar sounds. As an inspired symbiosis between his visual art and his music, the video clips constitute a logical step in Gheysen’s intriguing body of work that doesn’t cease to amaze.\r\n\r\nAlthough appearing here for the first time under his own name, Filip Gheysen has been very active in different projects. He is the founder of Glasvocht records and has released albums under the monikers Picturesque, Teledroom (with Portables-guitarist Wio) and is a member of the band 4 Black Boxes (with Jürgen De Blonde aka Köhn and Tom Vangheluwe).\r\n\r\nTrained as a graphic designer, he has also studied ‘printmaking’ at the academy of Ghent and had several expositions.\r\n\r\n‘Tabletop Guitar’ presents both his musical and visual art and adds a third field of interest. His videoworks are the culmination of his two main outlets, giving a new dimension to his art.\r\n\r\nAll tracks are available for streaming on

set edition, limited to 33 copies.\r\nIncludes the regular 12\" LP, a lathe-cut 10\" with one new and exclusive track by each artist and an original Tibetan prayer flag.\r\n\r\n‘A Year To Live’ is the 2nd collaboration between the German dark ambient/noise sound artist ANEMONE TUBE (OUBLIER ET MOURIR) and the French sound experimentalist CHRISTIAN RENOU (BRUME). ‘A Year To Live’ ties in with the highly acclaimed ‘Transference’ collaboration CD (released by Auf Abwegen, 2003), which radiated a subtle (dis)quieting melancholy, but goes beyond it.\r\n\r\n‘A Year To Live’ refers to the same-titled book by Stephen Levine, which deals about preparing for or ‘practicing’ death to remind oneself of the beauty of life. On his deathbed, Socrates exhorted his followers to practice dying as the highest form of wisdom. Levine teaches us to\r\nlive each moment mindfully and created the so-called ‘year to live’, a program of intensely practical strategies and powerful guided meditations, which helps us to live our lives with more awareness before we die. Both artists approach this theme with notably different\r\npoints of view, but complement one another’s vision, in such a precise and dedicated manner, that one can truly not exist without the other.\r\n\r\nBRUME is the experimental music project by CHRISTIAN RENOU, a particularly prolific sound artist, active since 1985. With recordings on Elsie And Jack, Drone, Old Europa Café, Relapse, Staalplaat and his own Brume Rec., Christian Renou has built quite a name for himself over the years and can be considered a legend in the field. On ‘A Year To Live’ BRUME creates environments ranging from the completely abstract to the vaguely specific, using elements such as voice, loops, wide-ranging drones, ghostly ambiences, noise, various electronics and even percussions. The loops and voice samples roam throughout the track list like persistent ghosts wandering in a transcendental, shapeless purgatory, reciting their obsessions like a mantra.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.elsieandjack.com/brume\" target=\"_blank\">www.elsieandjack.com/brume</a>\r\n\r\nANEMONE TUBE has aroused much attention with his two consecutive releases ‘Dream Landscape’ (2010) and ‘Death over China’ (2011), which embody hell’s darkest nightmares to give a good, hard glimpse of Death’s reign over matter and human existence. Now a new form of expression is born and in a sense it is the cathartic aftermath of the unbearable pain caused by the previous realisations. Such an expression required a different vehicle, which is OUBLIER ET MOURIR (‘to forget and to die’). A name perfectly suited to the peaceful,\r\nmeditative, but also deeply emotional and atmospheric character of the music, which is a unique mix of melancholic ambient soundscapes & melodramatic pop sometimes reminding of TOR LUNDVALL and (early) SYLVAIN CHAUVEAU.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.anemonetube.de\" target=\"_blank\">www.anemonetube.de</a>\r\n\r\nReviews:\r\n> <a

Both artists share a fascination for West-Africa, which brought them to work around on this thematic, with their own vision and cultural codes.\r\n\r\nAYMERIC DE TAPOL is an experimental and electro-acoustic composer, based in Brussels. He works for contemporary dance pieces, radiophonic creations and as a freelance sound engineer for cinema and documentary films. Since 1998, he focuses his work on climatic sound takes. The final result is a composition where minimalist soundscapes interact with each other and lead to organic maps, close to microsound or noise. His works could be described as ‘travelling music’: the music score for a non-existing movie.\r\n\r\nSince 1996 TZII has been spreading his magickal corrosive frequencies all over the world by touring from Europe to Australia, passing by the USA, Canada, Japan and Africa, where he played hundreds of shows, spreading cinematic ambient and raw electronic anger. He’s a co-founder and active member of the V-ATAK collective & dvd label, one half of SOLAR SKELETONS and a member of DUFLAN DUFLAN and several other bands. He also works for dance companies, living performances, movie soundtracks and any other mediums with sound inside.\r\n\r\n<EMBED SRC=\"http://a.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8srg4ctpd1rdkv44o1.mp3\" VOLUME=\"50\" HEIGHT=\"30\" WIDTH=\"215\" autostart=\"false\">\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"215\" height=\"161\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Mqp2wY-HTRk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","options":[{"id":23151271,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":20.0},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":142,"name":"Liechtenstein","code":"LI"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":184,"name":"Poland","code":"PL"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":203,"name":"Slovakia (Slovak Republic)","code":"SK"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":29,"name":"Monaco","code":"MC"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71750591/-/stx21lp.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71750591/-/stx21lp.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73467441/-/tumblr_ma4nq7M28H1rdkv44o1_1280.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73467441/-/tumblr_ma4nq7M28H1rdkv44o1_1280.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[{"id":141581,"name":"Aymeric de Tapol","permalink":"aymeric-de-tapol","url":"/artist/aymeric-de-tapol"},{"id":141599,"name":"MS30","permalink":"ms30","url":"/artist/ms30"},{"id":141583,"name":"TZII","permalink":"tzii","url":"/artist/tzii"}],"categories":[{"id":3700361,"name":"2LP","permalink":"2lp","url":"/category/2lp"}]},{"id":7255319,"name":"Brume / Oublier Et Mourir - A Year To Live (lp)","permalink":"brume-oublier-et-mourir","position":9,"price":17.0,"default_price":17.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/brume-oublier-et-mourir","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-15T17:27:11.000Z","description":"Split & Collaboration LP on 140g white vinyl, limited to 300 copies.\r\n\r\n‘A Year To Live’ is the 2nd collaboration between the German dark ambient/noise sound artist ANEMONE TUBE (OUBLIER ET MOURIR) and the French sound experimentalist CHRISTIAN RENOU (BRUME). ‘A Year To Live’ ties in with the highly acclaimed ‘Transference’ collaboration CD (released by Auf Abwegen, 2003), which radiated a subtle (dis)quieting melancholy, but goes beyond it.\r\n\r\n‘A Year To Live’ refers to the same-titled book by Stephen Levine, which deals about preparing for or ‘practicing’ death to remind oneself of the beauty of life.

A name perfectly suited to the peaceful,\r\nmeditative, but also deeply emotional and atmospheric character of the music, which is a unique mix of melancholic ambient soundscapes & melodramatic pop sometimes reminding of TOR LUNDVALL and (early) SYLVAIN CHAUVEAU.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.anemonetube.de\" target=\"_blank\">www.anemonetube.de</a>\r\n\r\nReviews:\r\n> <a href=\"http://africanpaper.com/2012/06/23/brume-oublier-et-mourir-a-year-to-live/\" target=\"_blank\">African Paper</a>\r\n> <a href=http://santasangremagazine.wordpress.com/2012/05/01/oublier-et-mourir-brume-a-year-to-live-engpl/\" target=\"_blank\">Santa Sangre</a>\r\n> <a href=\"http://www.chaindlk.com/reviews/?id=7385\" target=\"_blank\">Chain D.L.K.</a>\r\n> <a href=\"http://havefaithinsound.blogspot.de/2012/12/brume-oublier-et-mourir-year-to-live.html\" target=\"_blank\">Have Faith In Sound</a>\r\n> <a href=\"http://torpedomagazine.nl/2012/08/de-zwarte-doos-028-brume-oublier-et-mourir/\" target=\"_blank\">Torpedo Magazine</a>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"215\" height=\"161\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/rqdPdiTBBus\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","options":[{"id":23151197,"name":"Default","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71170499/-/stx22_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71170499/-/stx22_cover.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":141573,"name":"Anemone Tube","permalink":"anemone-tube","url":"/artist/anemone-tube"},{"id":141575,"name":"Brume","permalink":"brume","url":"/artist/brume"},{"id":141577,"name":"Oublier Et Mourir","permalink":"oublier-et-mourir","url":"/artist/oublier-et-mourir"}],"categories":[{"id":3670331,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]},{"id":7255295,"name":"Epicurean Escapism (tape + dvdr)","permalink":"epicurean-escapism","position":10,"price":12.5,"default_price":12.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/epicurean-escapism","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-15T17:23:32.000Z","description":"EPICUREAN ESCAPISM TAPE COMPILATION + VIDEO DVD-R\r\nOn the occasion of the Epicurean Escapism Festival 7th of July 2012\r\n\r\nTape with exclusive tracks by KRANK, IRM, DISSECTING TABLE, HUMAN LARVAE, ANEMONE TUBE, JARL and a video by MARTIN BLADH.\r\n\r\nPro-dubliated C-50 Tape with silk-screenprint + DVD-R + individual download code. Comes in a luxurious packaging in a limited edition of 100 copies only. All tracks on the tape are unreleased, except for 2 tracks, which are different versions/remixes. Professionally mastered.\r\n\r\nEpicurean Escapism is a festival in Berlin presenting music and art from the viewpoint of escapism. Escape, a way out, abscondence – the escapist attitude is always responding in a displeased way to given circumstances and is a phenomenon of modernism. Just like modernism itself, the term can mean entirely different things. Though often dismissed as an otherworldly hide-and-seek and opposed to responsible engagement, some intellectuals have had a very productive idea of diving into this subjective counterworld, such as the philosopher Ernst Bloch, who by no means understood this as a pure renunciation, but as a “source of energy for the artistic work”, which may only blossom in a state of contemplation and the temporary exclusion of every day influences. It is also a source of new perspectives on the world, ideally detached from mass market, functionality and daily routine.\r\n\r\nThe radically critical, sometimes even phobic aspect of escapism, was encapsulated for the first time by decadent writers of the classical modernism; its traces can be found in poems of Baudelaire and George, in the novels of Huysmans and the fantastic stories of Lovecraft. In these texts, escapism appears as an anthropologically anchored longing (for death) and at the same time as a retreat from the cold reality of a socially icy society whose rationalism, according to Houellebecq, an heir and executor of this literature, would minimize any value and importance of life. As a result, artificial worlds emerge, in which the desired ideal and the horrors of the shunned reality converge; escapism is always aesthetically ambivalent and often more gloomy than flowery.\r\n\r\nSuch an attitude can find its medium in all artistic forms of expression, but the more independent of conscious reflection an art form is, the more suitable it turns out to be. For Bloch, music was “the utopian transgressing art par excellence”; therefore, it’s no surprise that there is a special focus on musical performance at Epicurean Escapism, complemented by related contributions from visual art, performance and film. With their cathartic noise orgies, IRM present the rough and dystopian aspect as well as HUMAN LARVAE, whose doomy and\r\nheavy power-electronics illustrates the exploration of extreme human behavior. Similarily obsessive are the fantasies of the performance artist and painter MARTIN BLADH; in his film works, he showcases the human body in an uncompromising way. Subtle aesthetic alternative worlds arise from the hypnotic oscillating dark ambient sounds of JARL and the gravitating and abysmal dreamscapes of ANEMONE TUBE. With KRANK, John Murphy revives his cataclystic dark ambient industrial monster from the 80s, joined onstage by Till Brüggemann (Gerechtigkeits Liga) and Annie Stubbs (Devotion, SPK) for the first time live for more than 25 years.\r\n\r\nReviews:\r\n> <a href=\"http://noisereceptor.wordpress.com/2013/02/09/various-artists-epicurean-escapism/\" target=\"_blank\">Noise Receptor</a>\r\n> <a href=\"http://africanpaper.com/2012/06/30/v-a-epicurean-escapism/\" target=\"_blank\">African Paper</a>\r\n> <a href=\"http://heathenharvest.org/2013/04/09/various-artists-epicurean-escapism/\" target=\"_blank\">Heathen Harvest</a>","options":[{"id":22973771,"name":"Red package","price":12.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":22973777,"name":"Silver package","price":12.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71170211/-/stx23_Package.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71170211/-/stx23_Package.jpg","width":798,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71170219/-/stx23_red.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71170219/-/stx23_red.jpg","width":816,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71170227/-/stx23_silver.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71170227/-/stx23_silver.jpg","width":788,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":141573,"name":"Anemone Tube","permalink":"anemone-tube","url":"/artist/anemone-tube"},{"id":141603,"name":"Human Larvae","permalink":"human-larvae","url":"/artist/human-larvae"}],"categories":[{"id":3700379,"name":"DVDr","permalink":"dvdr","url":"/category/dvdr"},{"id":3700381,"name":"Tape","permalink":"tape","url":"/category/tape"}]},{"id":7255269,"name":"MS30 - T.I.A.

Both artists share a fascination for West-Africa, which brought them to work around on this thematic, with their own vision and cultural codes.\r\n\r\nAYMERIC DE TAPOL is an experimental and electro-acoustic composer,\r\nbased in Brussels. He works for contemporary dance pieces, radiophonic creations and as a freelance sound engineer for cinema and documentary films. Since 1998, he focuses his work on climatic sound takes. The final result is a composition where minimalist soundscapes interact with each other and lead to organic maps, close to microsound or noise. His works could be described as ‘travelling music’: the music score for a non-existing movie.\r\n\r\nSince 1996 TZII has been spreading his magickal corrosive frequencies\r\nall over the world by touring from Europe to Australia, passing by the USA, Canada, Japan and Africa, where he played hundreds of shows, spreading cinematic ambient and raw electronic anger. He’s a co-founder and active member of the V-ATAK collective & dvd label, one half of SOLAR SKELETONS and a member of DUFLAN DUFLAN and several other bands. He also works for dance companies, living performances, movie soundtracks and any other mediums with sound inside.\r\n\r\n<EMBED SRC=\"http://a.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8srg4ctpd1rdkv44o1.mp3\" VOLUME=\"50\" HEIGHT=\"30\" WIDTH=\"215\" autostart=\"false\">\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"215\" height=\"161\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Mqp2wY-HTRk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","options":[{"id":22973709,"name":"CD, ltd. to 500","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71170003/-/stx21.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71170003/-/stx21.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":141581,"name":"Aymeric de Tapol","permalink":"aymeric-de-tapol","url":"/artist/aymeric-de-tapol"},{"id":141599,"name":"MS30","permalink":"ms30","url":"/artist/ms30"},{"id":141583,"name":"TZII","permalink":"tzii","url":"/artist/tzii"}],"categories":[{"id":3670329,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":7255257,"name":"Wool-E's Choice: Yannick Franck & Filip Gheysen (7\")","permalink":"wool-e-s-choice-yannick-franck-filip-gheysen","position":12,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wool-e-s-choice-yannick-franck-filip-gheysen","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-15T17:15:22.000Z","description":"Two exclusive tracks by experimental sound composer Yannick Franck and guitar-droner Filip Gheysen\r\n\r\n7” vinyl record limited to 110 copies, includes free download\r\n\r\nReleased on the occasion of the international record store day at Wool-E-Shop, Ghent (B), on 21st april 2012\r\n\r\nwww.wool-e-shop.be\r\nwww.yannickfranck.com\r\nfilipgheysen.tumblr.com","options":[{"id":22973679,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71169907/-/stx20.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71169907/-/stx20.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":141601,"name":"Filip Gheysen","permalink":"filip-gheysen","url":"/artist/filip-gheysen"},{"id":141579,"name":"Yannick Franck","permalink":"yannick-franck","url":"/artist/yannick-franck"}],"categories":[{"id":3700357,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"}]},{"id":7255247,"name":"Anemone Tube - Death Over China (cd)","permalink":"anemone-tube-death-over-china","position":13,"price":12.5,"default_price":12.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/anemone-tube-death-over-china","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-15T17:13:22.000Z","description":"One year after the highly acclaimed “Dream Landscape” CD ANEMONE TUBE returns with the new concept album “Death over China”.\r\nNo country in history has emerged as a major industrial power without creating a legacy of environmental damage that can take, if at all possible, decades to undo. China’s rise as an economic power has no clear parallel in history; thus, its pollution problem has shattered all\r\nprecedent developments.\r\n\r\n“Death over China” is a retaliation of nature against humankind. In the same moment it is a dedication to our untamed curiosity for the essence of death and our (inherent in our collective action) secret death wish. In China`s uncompromising economical and social development we see demonstrated, how we – even with the immolation of our health, environment and tradition – are the servants to material progress. Though we are aware of the approaching ecological disaster, we hazard the consequences. Sustainability is sacrificed on the altar of egoist quest for happiness. We consume, we destroy, we thrive, we conjure: “Deathly kingdom of desire, you sustain the life in me, Black death rise!”\r\n\r\nUsing field recordings, collected in Nanjing and Shanghai in 2007, ANEMONE TUBE creates an unsettling yet intriguing, apocalyptic soundtrack with a sinister atmosphere and a depressive undertone – a unique blend of dark ambient, post industrial and power electronics in the tradition of European industrial music.\r\n\r\n“Death over China” is the second part of “The Suicide Series”, for which field recordings provide a conceptional basis. In a poetic way ANEMONE TUBE combines analytical realism of the phenomenal world with buddhist psychology and nihilist rhetoric influenced by the works of Michael Haneke, Hayao Miyazaki, H.P. Lovecraft and Yukio Mishima.\r\n\r\nReviews:\r\n> <a href=\"http://noisereceptor.wordpress.com/2013/02/07/anemone-tube-death-over-china/\" target=\"_blank\">Noise Receptor</a>\r\n> <a href=\"http://kulturterrorismus.de/rezensionen/anemone-tube-death-over-china.html\" target=\"_blank\">Kulturterrorismus</a>\r\n> <a href=\"http://www.vitalweekly.net/787.html\" target=\"_blank\">Vital Weekly</a>\r\n> <a href=\"http://www.connexionbizarre.net/reviews/anemone-tube-death-over-china/\" target=\"_blank\">Connexion Bizarre</a>\r\n> <a href=\"http://witteruis.blogspot.be/2011/08/anemone-tube-death-over-china.html\" target=\"_blank\">Witte Ruis</a>\r\n> <a href=\"http://www.darkentries.be/nl/cds/anemone-tube-death-over-china/\" target=\"_blank\">Dark Entries</a>\r\n> <a href=\"http://www.filthforge.org/reviews/reviews-2011/review-anemonetube-death.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Filth Forge</a>\r\n> <a href=\"http://heathenharvest.org/2011/11/01/anemone-tube-death-over-china/\" target=\"_blank\">Heathen Harvest</a>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"215\" height=\"161\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/V5C-LShWUqs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","options":[{"id":22973661,"name":"Default","price":12.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71169835/-/stx19.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71169835/-/stx19.jpg","width":431,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103496428/-/stx19-packaging.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103496428/-/stx19-packaging.jpg","width":513,"height":718}],"artists":[{"id":141573,"name":"Anemone Tube","permalink":"anemone-tube","url":"/artist/anemone-tube"}],"categories":[{"id":3670329,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":7255243,"name":"Feine Trinkers Bei Pinkels Daheim - Die Legende Vom Heiligen Trinker (cd)","permalink":"feine-trinkers-bei-pinkels-daheim-die-legende-vom-heiligen-trinker","position":14,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/feine-trinkers-bei-pinkels-daheim-die-legende-vom-heiligen-trinker","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-15T17:11:41.000Z","description":"One year after the highly acclaimed ‘Ahuenna’ (Format Noise, 2010), Feine Trinkers Bei Pinkels Daheim returns with the elegantly named ‘Die Legende Vom Heiligen Trinker’.

Originally founded in 1996 in Southern Germany, ANEMONE TUBE has quite made a name for himself in the industrial/noise genre – especially due to the psychogenic nature of his music. On this new release ANEMONE TUBE creates massive ambient/noise soundscapes. The sounds are pulsating, drowning and floating, tormenting and caressing – all culminating in a haunting sonic experience.\r\n\r\n‘Dream Landscape’ is – together with the album ‘Death over China’ – the first part of the ‘Suicide Series’*. To this field recordings made in China provide a conceptional basis.\r\n\r\n‘Dream Landscape’ is a concept album of fierce malignant power. In a poetic way ANEMONE TUBE combines analytical realism of the phenomenal world with buddhist psychology and nihilist rhetoric influenced by the visionary authors H.P. Lovecraft and Yukio Mishima.\r\n\r\nThe special edition bonus DVD is a collaborative work between the brazilian video artist GUSTAVO DE LACERDA and ANEMONE TUBE. The work, entitled 1515, is a conceptual experimental film made in Rotterdam. The soundtrack is based on real-time field recordings\r\nmade in in Nanjing and Shanghai.\r\n\r\nReviews:\r\n> <a href=\"http://www.chaindlk.com/reviews/?id=6067\" target=\"_blank\">Chain D.L.K.</a>\r\n> <a href=\"http://heathenharvest.org/2011/11/01/anemone-tube-dream-landscape/\" target=\"_blank\">Heathen Harvest</a>\r\n> <a href=\"http://existest.org/ee_v3/?p=1560\" target=\"_blank\">Existence Establishment</a>\r\n> <a href=\"http://www.darkroom-magazine.it/ita/104/Recensione.php?r=1866\" target=\"_blank\">Darkroom Magazine</a> (Italian)\r\n> <a href=\"http://www.kindamuzik.net/recensie/anemone-tube/dream-landscape/20494/\" target=\"_blank\">Kindamuzik</a> (Dutch)\r\n> <a href=\"http://www.darkentries.be/nl/cds/anemone-tube-dream-landscape/\" target=\"_blank\">Dark Entries</a> (Dutch)\r\n> <a href=\"http://maeror3.livejournal.com/tag/anemone%20tube\" target=\"_blank\">Maeror3</a> (Russian)\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"215\" height=\"161\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/XaN_d-J7M90\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","options":[{"id":22973505,"name":"Ltd. edition CD","price":12.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":22973507,"name":"Special Edition CD   DVD","price":17.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71169267/-/stx11.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71169267/-/stx11.jpg","width":424,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103498876/-/stx11cover-package.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103498876/-/stx11cover-package.jpg","width":511,"height":718}],"artists":[{"id":141573,"name":"Anemone Tube","permalink":"anemone-tube","url":"/artist/anemone-tube"}],"categories":[{"id":3670329,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"},{"id":3700321,"name":"DVD","permalink":"dvd","url":"/category/dvd"}]},{"id":7255181,"name":"Shift -

Their focus seems to be staying at the forefront of what seems to be a growing movement in what I will freely describe as Ambient Noise. I've never seen this particular pair of words being used as a genre, so run with it, folks... \"The Broken Tusk Of Ganesha\" is one of the best contenders out there in the often stagnant and uninspired world of Drone. When one listens deeply enough, one can be delighted in the many small but essential details that come together so exeptionally. This is not merely Drone, this is somewhere in between that world, Dark Ambient, Ritualistic, and even a more dreamy strain of Power Electronics.      \r\n\r\n“Sri Ganesha\" is the initial track, which sets the tone for most of this six-song collection. What sets this song apart is the almost metallic timbre of afemale voice chanting the timeless Ohm mantra that is somewhat buried under the same howling and low-frequency-style rumble that is present in all tracks.“Omkara (one who has the form of OM)\", has a distorted, almost pink noise sounding wind sound, held down here and there for different lengths of time. A slight but melodic tone can be detected if you listen deeply enough. The finale,“Fudo Myoo (ganesha version) manages to fulfill a bit of what I had expected when I met the album. Here we are granted the sound of a strong and expansive traditional bass drum that reverberates as some sedate horns make it seem like you can almost see a village near the Ganges off in the distance in progress of a ceremonial march. It is in this track that the most layering can be found. When listened to as a whole, \"The Broken Tusk Of Ganesha\" is powerfully meditative, and if you grow to love it as much as I have, it can come to be considered something comforting and spiritual. \r\n\r\nThe presentation of the three-inch CD is something worth mentioning as well. The red-toned visual of what appears to be coiled rope can be seen through the inside an out of the small DVD-style case. The CD itself is red. It looks like Silken Tofu is looking to make this a label trademark. And why not? It seems very practical that more three inches be released, especially in the world of CDr's, and also because of limited tracks for the EP format. This outstanding disc can definitely be considered a tool for contemplation because of it's minimal nature and Cosmic, soul-touching themes. Moz has so much promise, lots of potential.

Full-spectrum rumbling and ripping for those that like their noise raw but well produced. Industrial music for all of you that don't feel the need for a beat, but don't mind the subtle presence of a pulse here and there. If you can accept all of these musical elements in the first track, then we're off to a fine start.\r\n\r\n'Diminished Bones' focuses on the bass frequencies with some nicely situated mid-range buzzing throughout. Rather than being a soundtrack for entropy, it's more like the evolution of decay. A celebration of the positive nature of doubt if you will. Track three kicks off like a machine gone apeshit and later serves as a test for tolerance of the higher frequencies, but never gets downright annoying unless you're prone to such vexation. We're not talking ultrasonics here as everything is quite audible, but an eardrum workout nonetheless. The title 'Swallow The Knife' is disturbing on the surface and may indeed be an apt description of what transpires here. Some of those low tones could very well be the sound of your oesophagus being slowly flayed by a sharp object as the acid along the digestive tract will no doubt have an adverse reaction to such a metallic food. Thanks to the wonders of modern technology, one can experience this phenomena vicariously through Velvet Narcosis.\r\n\r\nThe concluding piece starts off a bit more subdued dynamically but has all the harsh grandeur that characterizes the release overall. It's an organic noise that has the added bonus of some wonderful high-frequency glissandi that set me and the cicadas outside all a-quiver. A very special moment, however brief...applause all around.\r\n\r\nPierre Baps (aka Velvet Narcosis) crams a lot of data into this diminutive format. The EP format works quite well here as the separate tracks retain their own identity, but as a whole 'Surgery By S.D.' never loses momentum nor continuity. It stands out as a finely crafted set amongst the glut of noise releases these days. The key here seems to be to not overdo anything. Every morsel of noise is tasty and in my world that's a good (and rare) thing. Silken Tofu's signature packaging (a mini-DVD case), attractive artwork, and quality printing get the thumbs up again and rounds out a worthy and highly recommended recording.

Here he dives more into the world of microsound, with 7 untitled tracks.\r\n\r\nReview by Heathen Harvest:\r\n\"To answer the question posited in the title, I would say yes. While hiphop, mash-ups and plunderphonics in general are the most obvious manifestations of sonic postmodernism, tape music paved the way almost sixty years ago before the term even existed. Need a history lesson ? Not my job; do your homework kiddo.\r\n\r\nThis little disc is nineteen minutes of superbly executed concrete music collaged from natural and electronic sources. It's a distinctly modern recording with a nod toward the old school of say Bernard Parmegiani or Pierre Henry and to some of the better elements of contemporary noise electronics. It's musical enough to evoke comparisons to Oval and Scanner if you must have names. Only in the 21st century could such a recording be made without obtaining a residency at IRCAM or some other prestigious electronic studio with the most advanced technological resources. Music software has taken care of that whether we like it or not. Any tools are only as valuable as the hands which possess them, however, and luckily Formatt goes about such digital 'cutting and splicing' in a most tasteful manner.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, the use of stereo in the panning and placement of sounds is striking. Add to that the careful juxtapositioning of synthetic and concrete timbres and the material takes on a melodic and rhythmic quality without relying on neither pitch nor meter. In fact it almost swings in some places. A great deal of attention is given to dynamics as well. Silence is used as a musical element and when things get loud they do so for a good reason. It's not until the end of the third track that any abrasiveness surfaces, and when it does it's to great dramatic effect. The fourth track emerges from a glitchy quietude and builds into an architectonic maze. This grows straight through to the end with varying degrees of intensity and reaches an apex in the last track. Here the sounds feel as if they are being physically extracted and dragged through the sonic spectrum before a brief coda brings us back to a microsonic world. Imagine being able to hold radio static in your hand and scrub the walls with it. A bizzare image perhaps, but it works for me and this is some damn fine listening at any rate.\r\n\r\nHistorically, electroacoustic music of this sort is not necessarily known for its sense of continuity and is usually characterized by textural variety. This release embodies the best of both worlds : those of flow and change. It's what my old colleague David Prescott used to call 'dramatic electronic music.' One doesn't need a narrative to create an abstract story. The ghost in the machine has a soul after all, so to speak.\r\n\r\nOther than the fact that Formatt has been active in performing, recording, and as an audio installation artist for over five years, I could find little other information. Regardless, out of five stars this is a six ! It's nicely packaged and comes in an edition of 100 red 3\" CDRs in a handsome little case with color printing. I look forward to hearing more from this artist and this promising young label.\"","options":[{"id":22972963,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71168971/-/st04.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71168971/-/st04.jpg","width":431,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3670453,"name":"CDr","permalink":"cdr","url":"/category/cdr"}]},{"id":7184669,"name":"Formatt - N'Institu (3\" cdr)","permalink":"formatt-n-institu","position":34,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/formatt-n-institu","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-08T01:09:28.000Z","description":"Unfortunately, Formatt is now put to rest. Here however he was highly active, closing the gaps between avantgarde experimentalism, microsound and illbient...\r\n\r\nHere's what others had to say about it...\r\n\r\nVital Weekly:\r\n\"The second release on Silken Tofu is again reserved for a Belgium artist, this time the more known Formatt. His career already spans a couple of years, mainly releasing CDRs, as well as some CD, but they weren't always convincing. Sometimes his pieces are quite alright glitch 'n cut 'n crack, but sometimes it also stays in mere attempts. This new one is no different. Formatt plays around with a slow hip hop like rhythm in the first part of this almost twenty minute piece, sauced and spiced up with computer treatments. Nowhere it falls into a groove, so that is probably not the idea. But what it is exactly that he is after is also hard to tell. It's all a bit too long, seemingly without structure or much intent. It left me behind a bit puzzled. (FdW)\"\r\n\r\nBloodties Webzine:\r\n\"First off, I have to say, great packaging and presentation. This is delivered in something like a small DVD-sized plastic case scaled down to fit a 3” CDR perfectly with high-quality full color print work and a nice looking stamp on the CDR. \r\n\r\nThe sounds are quite nice as well and match the packaging, a glitchy array of bouncing arrhythmic percussion, skipping beats, floating electronica-influenced textures. Formatt has created the soundtrack for a thriving city bathed in the murky white light of electric lamps and the occasional fluorescent light. \r\n\r\nThere are moments when Formatt almost breaks into some kind of trip-hop beat especially within the first few minutes of the 20 minute track, but any attempt at establishing a “song” quickly dissipates as murky drones and pitch-shifting samples have no problem drowning out what could have been. This is the soundtrack for the 21st century, the bombardment of information and passing of a car blaring some contrived beat but not being around long enough to catch exactly what song it was. Finally, you find yourself alone on that dimly lit bridge staring into the black water of the river that flows through town as you catch moments of conversations and laughter from the late-night drunks mixed with the sounds of the dump-truck in the alleyway. \r\n\r\nThe tough thing about music like this is that there are so many ideas presented in so short amount of time that it ends up being a bit forgettable. That is a pitfall that Formatt falls into but one that I believe in future forays they might be able to avoid, as this lies on the edge of almost being effective. I mean, there are a lot of interesting sounds and ideas here they just all seemed so squished together and competing for the listeners attention that it all just seems to pass by in a blur. It fits with the concept but just doesn't really work in practice. \r\n\r\nNot a bad first exposure though at all, I think I'll be keeping this around if not just for the packaging but also to get a dosage of solid experimental music on some lonely rainy night.\"","options":[{"id":22757209,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71168995/-/st02.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71168995/-/st02.jpg","width":431,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3670453,"name":"CDr","permalink":"cdr","url":"/category/cdr"}]}]
