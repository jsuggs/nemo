Ten fun pop songs in twenty minutes etched onto vinyl and contained within a sleeve which is a genuine work of art.\r\n\r\n\"No Monster Club continue to build upon their very own brand of colourful thrash-pop on their debut album, following last year’s Young Guts Champion EP. The emphasis for the trio is firmly on fun, and that easily comes across on record; Fisher Price piano noises, shouty choruses and chugging, staccato guitars wrap around some surprisingly fraught lyrics (“Please be cool whilst I jump out the window”). Despite the air of experimental jamming, Bobby Aherne’s songwriting is fully rounded, melding ye-ye, garage and surf rock to create a record whose sunniness filters through every track. At just 20 minutes long it may be over before it has time to fully register, but No Monster Club’s enthusiasm is well encapsulated on this album.\" - AU Magazine\r\n\r\n\"'dublin' represents a departure for songwriter bobby aherne. while tapping, with ease, into a jay retard / wavves sunshine scumpunk scene oozing over the atlantic, on this full-band, full-studio production the songs burst forth in glorious technicolor. they're not mammoth over-produced behemoths by any stretch of the imagination, but each diamond-sharp song zips by with breezy melodies that are bolstered by imaginative touches - arrangement tricks, unexpected bridges and odd instrumentation that seems to work, as if it would sound odd if it wasn't there. songs like 'parish sports' use a tin-can 60s psyche/left-banke approach at the start before blooming into a melancholy, propulsive pop song. elsewhere, the fabulously titled 'asleep in the grotto' uses out of tune piano and double tracked vocals that marries garage, psyche and teen melancholy to perfect effect.\" - Rough Trade Records\r\n\r\n\"There’s method to the madness, though. While he may indeed shun the classic song structure (six of the ten tracks fall under the two-minute mark), Aherne has nonetheless created a distinctive and wonderfully summery lo-fi sound. Distorted to within an inch of its life, Dublin could well have been dreamt up on some lovely ‘70s acid trip. Album opener ‘Uncle Porky’ and current single ‘Be My Bone’ perfectly merge catchy pop melodies, spiky vocals and thrashing reverbed guitars. ‘Waking My Idols’ meanwhile is surf rock at its finest. This is very good stuff indeed.\" - Hotpress\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n1. Uncle Porky\r\n2. Be My Bone\r\n3. Waking My Idols\r\n4. Parish Sports (Once Everyone Is Happy)\r\n5.

Unearthed after his death, the album has been lovingly mastered by Mark Chester (Grand Pocket Orchestra/Ginnels) and prepared for release by his bandmates, friends and family.\r\n\r\nHaving acquired a laptop for his eighteenth birthday, Bobby started to record for fun and went on to release eleven records on his own, before being joined by Mark Chester (bass) and Paddy Hanna (drums). As a trio they toured Europe, released three further records and shared a stage with the likes of Ariel Pink, So Cow, Sic Alps, Squarehead, Panda Kid, Jeff The Brotherhood, Wavves, Girls Names, Abe Vigoda and HEALTH.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Bobby continued to produce his own solo material as before; a clattering smorgsabord of bubblegum, baroque and symphonic pop, lo-fi rock, psychedelia and TV theme tunes. This is the music which we have collected here: songs for the park, songs for the beach, songs for your kitchen/living room/bedroom, songs for your school, songs for your holidays, songs for your commute, songs for your wedding reception, songs for your kids' birthday parties, and songs for your funeral.\r\n\r\nThere is a lifetime contained within these ninety minutes.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n1.

The album creates an indelibly, cherished harmony beneath upbeat, poppy melodies. There's lots of great guitar sounds, clattering drums, and electric tones (all contorted, all fuzzy, and all in the taste of great lo-fi recordings.) The lyrics on the album also have a another thing going for them. Traveling to mythologies of castles, queens, religious characters and reflections on being young, are all sung with the Dublin Duck Dispensary's modern-day expressions. The one-man outfit of Dublin Duck Dispensary, Bobby Aheme, has as of late become recognized with his newest project No Monster Club, (who are just wrapping up their US tour,) but also, Aheme has been with other groups like Ginnels, Grand Pocket Orchestra and Paddy Hanna. However, Dublin Duck Dispensary, in contrast to the other groups, takes on a more cozy, intimate perspective towards the lo-fi pop tunes. With how intricate, yet boisterous this album is, you can easily imagine how much fun it was to record. Pick up Dublin Duck Dispensary's 'Luanqibazao', as soon as you can.'\"\r\n\r\n-Ray Jackson, Already Dead Tapes, 2013","options":[{"id":22283353,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125796438/-/AD090_02.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125796438/-/AD090_02.jpg","width":790,"height":524}],"artists":[{"id":136445,"name":"No Monster Club","permalink":"no-monster-club","url":"/artist/no-monster-club"}],"categories":[{"id":3607319,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":3611847,"name":"Tapes","permalink":"tapes","url":"/category/tapes"}]}]
