What started out as a (late night) bedroom project, THE WESTERN ADDITION saw the light of day as a solo performance of an 11 minute piece in a packed art gallery with the patrons spilling out onto the street. Today, with the re-release of IT IS EASY TO BE LEFT OUT OF A CONVERSATION ABOUT EXCLUSION, what was once only available at gallery shows and passed between friends, is now available everywhere. The Western Addition continues on in various formations to explore, in its folk-jazz leanings, the connections between visual art and music.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":9938112,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27567525/-/twa1cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27567525/-/twa1cover.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1557107,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":2847591,"name":"Kissing Goats Tee","permalink":"kissing-goats-tee","position":2,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kissing-goats-tee","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-11-08T01:40:12.000Z","description":"Kissing Goats (MF)\r\nAmerican Apparel Girly 100% cotton\r\nlight grey on black\r\nsm 0-2, med 4-6, lg 8-10\r\ndesign: MRS\r\n","options":[{"id":9938181,"name":"SM 0-2","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9938182,"name":"MED 4-6","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9938259,"name":"LG 8-10","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27567705/-/ciao2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27567705/-/ciao2.jpg","width":470,"height":353}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1557110,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":2847596,"name":"Buckboy Tee","permalink":"buckboy-tee","position":3,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/buckboy-tee","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-11-08T01:42:30.000Z","description":"Buckboy Tee\r\nAmerican Apparel Girly 100% cotton\r\nsky blue on army\r\nsm 0-2, med 4-6, lg 8-10\r\ndesign: MRS\r\n","options":[{"id":9938215,"name":"SM 0-2","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9938216,"name":"MED 4-6","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9938261,"name":"LG 8-10","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27567733/-/buckboy_tee_morgan_riccilli_slade.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27567733/-/buckboy_tee_morgan_riccilli_slade.jpg","width":1000,"height":846}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1557110,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":2850702,"name":"refine : refract 1","permalink":"refine-refract-1","position":4,"price":150.0,"default_price":150.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/refine-refract-1","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-11-09T06:39:24.000Z","description":"refine : refract 1\r\n\r\nrefine : refract is an ongoing series, based around multiple mediums, exploring the deconstruction and modification of a sign, and the reconstruction with a very purposeful re-presentation of image and concept. In the first installment, a series of 500 illustrations, digitally manipulated from a single source photograph, play in sequence beginning with a black frame, building up to a complete image, and slowly disintegrating to a black image again, exploring with a Baroque sensibility, the point where an image is complete, and the point where it begins to break down. The soundtrack consists of an abstracted version of ‘Claire de Lune’ by Debussy, again reconfigured from its original conception.\r\n\r\nB/W video with sound\r\n00:25:26\r\nDVD \r\nsigned limited edition of 10","options":[{"id":9946949,"name":"Default","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27598527/-/refine-refract-dvd-morgan_riccilli_slade.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27598527/-/refine-refract-dvd-morgan_riccilli_slade.jpg","width":1000,"height":519}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1689433,"name":"DVD","permalink":"dvd","url":"/category/dvd"}]}]
