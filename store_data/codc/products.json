This band tears into songs like a tornado and their songs are for the most part short and to the point, opting for the quick kill. With titles like “No Tears Fall Through Hollow Eye Sockets” and “Strip Naked For The Killer”, listeners should know exactly what they are in for.\r\n\r\n\tVocally, Joe Horvath squeals, barks and bellows his way through cuts like “The System As The Master Deceiver” and the album’s highly grueling title track like the grind champ that he is, his pig squeals being some of the most powerful out there. In terms of production, one could ask for a bit more thickness, but it’s more than likely that the hollower sounding parts are deliberate, as the band does break into some grinding flurries that carry a substantial amount of weight.\r\n\r\n\tA quality package on the whole, “Zero Comfort Margin” offers appropriately insane visuals and complete lyrics as well. The major downfall is that the album rolls by rather quickly, but that’s why fans buy competent grind CDs such as this, to play them over and over again. Hopefully, your disc player is up to the challenge.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":142484,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36399/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36399/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":26942,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":18742,"name":"Human Harvest","permalink":"human-harvest","position":6,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/human-harvest","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2007-04-13T23:22:27.000Z","description":"2003<BR>\nMartyr Music Group (North, South, Pan Americas)<BR>\nDispleased Records (rest of territories)<BR>\nRecorded, mixed &#38; mastered: Steve Austin, Austin Enterprise.<BR>\nSubliminal messages included.<BR>\nArtwork by: Mark Riddick<BR><BR>\n\n\t<b>Review</b>\n<i>from Deluge Zine</i>\n\n\tFans of this band might be anticipating a surprise with this disc, as <span class=\"caps\">CODC</span>&#8217;s lineup has changed considerably since they released &#8220;The Genocide Machine&#8221; in 2001. The band s drum and bass slots were vacated during the intervening years, but they were only able to obtain one replacement, that being drummer Mike Rosswog. Rather than wait for a new bassist to come along, original members Joe Horvath (vocals) and Jason Andrews (guitar) decided to move forward with the recording of their fourth opus, &#8220;Human Harvest&#8221;.\n\n\tAfter listening to this album for a mere thirty seconds, it becomes apparent that the absence of a bass player has only amplified <span class=\"caps\">CODC</span>&#8217;s insatiable hunger for pure aural savagery. After a brief sample of spoken dialogue, the listener is treated to the equivalent of a 12-gauge shotgun going off in his face. It all starts with Andrews&#8217; guitar riffs, which have evolved into a presence that is blunter and and more forceful than in the past. Fans of the sharper, more precise riffs that adorned &#8220;The Genocide Machine&#8221; might initially find his new style to be less appealing, but this will likely change with repeated listens. Where the previous record was technically satisfying due to the clarity of the guitar tracks, &#8221; Human Harvest&#8221; is a bit foggier and more dense. In fact, it may be necessary to scan backwards after certain passages just to figure out what the hell is going on. This is especially true on the first and third tracks (&#8220;A Family Tree To Hang From&#8221; and &#8220;Salt Rock Eyes&#8221;, respectively), where the mix is thick to the point of near-suffocation. But the band somehow allows this potential flaw to become an asset, in that it creates an impenetrable atmosphere which enhances the album as a whole. With this simple bit of groundwork laid out, <span class=\"caps\">CODC</span> proceeds to immerse you in a world of frightening extremes. Whether it&#8217;s the brutally short (3-5 second) disintegration of tracks like &#8220;No Tolerance For Silence&#8221; and &#8220;White Trash Headache&#8221;, or the perverse intermingling of grind and truncheon-swinging doom on &#8220;Harvest at Dawn&#8221; and &#8220;Corsage of Fresh Meat and Rotting Pride&#8221;, this disc is an unmitigated assault against moderation and restraint. &#8220;Mother Pig&#8221; is one of very few disparate tracks on the album, as it features the aforementioned grind/doom duality, but with a liberal dose feedback and caustic shrills laced throughout.\n\n\tSeveral people have already pointed out the supposed parallels (both thematic and musical) between &#8220;Human Harvest&#8221; and Pig Destroyer&#8217;s &#8220;Prowler in the Yard&#8221; album. Such comparisons aren&#8217;t entirely fallacious, as there is a sort of familiarity in how the tracks flow. Both records evoke a sense of manic urgency with their sudden tempo changes, abrupt stops and starts, and overall style of songwriting (which might best be described as &#8220;stream of conscious&#8221;). Releases such as these don&#8217;t appear to be overly calculated, as the musicians are clearly pulling inspiration from the gut, rather than spending countless hours trying to think everything through. Here is where the sheer brilliance in these bands clearly shines through; their instinctive approach to writing and playing doesn t necessitate a lapse in tightness or execution. With this release, <span class=\"caps\">CODC</span> once again proves that beauty and brutality can (and often does) walk hand in hand.\n\n","options":[{"id":142486,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36401/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36401/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":26942,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":18773,"name":"The Genocide Machine","permalink":"the-genocide-machine","position":7,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-genocide-machine","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2007-04-14T07:05:12.000Z","description":"2001<BR>\nDeathvomit / Necropolis Records<BR>\nSubliminal messages included.<BR>\nArtwork by: Mark Riddick<BR><BR>\n\n\t<b>Review by</b>: <i>UnEarthed.com</i>\n\n\tGiven the events of the past week, I&#8217;ve worked, written, and listened a lot of aggressive music.  These tactics kept my head cleared, and my insanity down to a normal level.\n\n\tThe more brutal the music, the better the effect.\n\n\tIn the world of Grindcore it takes a truly great band to shine.  Circle Of Dead Children (CODC for short) is just such an act.  Their latest offering &#8220;The Genocide Machine&#8221; [Necropolis Records] is a wickedly demented slab of Power/Grindcore Metal.  Blasting, speeds are backboned with segments of slow, massive tempos.  It&#8217;s about crushing artistic brutality, not just speed.\n\n\tThis deviation makes Circle Of Dead Children great, instead of just good.\n\n\tCircle Of Dead Children is fast, filled with raging outbursts&#8230;but that is merely one flashpoints out of many.  Dual vocal assaults (shrill, Hardcore growls and deep, guttural ones), politically fired lyrics, crushing blast beats juxtaposed against frenetic moments, and rhythms so tight that they break the laws of physics.  Circle Of Dead Children are true new school masters of Grind.\n\n\tIt&#8217;s genius&#8230;\n\n\tThe best of these magnificently brutal cuts includes the short, monstrously heavy &#8220;Migration,&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s A Bloody Day When You Get Your Head Nailed To A Cross,&#8221; the bestial roar of &#8220;When We Make The Clouds Scream,&#8221; &#8220;Isabella&#8217;s Nightmare,&#8221; &#8220;From Eros To Thanatos,&#8221; &#8220;Only One Per Coffin,&#8221; &#8220;Wormpaste (Bled Through The Earth),&#8221; &#8220;CTRL<strong><span class=\"caps\">ALT</span></strong><span class=\"caps\">DELETE</span>,&#8221; and the title track.  Circle Of Dead Children go full-on, all guns blazing.\n\n\tOverall, Circle Of Dead Children is an amazing act that incorporates Hardcore into their Grindcore style.  They have created one of the best releases of 2001, as well as one of the finest Grindcore slabs ever.  Take care.  God Bless.  Stay Savage.

This is beyond what we know as grindcore or death/grind or whatever label you want to put on it, as it possesses a level of intrinsic artistry in its construction that is hardly matched by many other musical compositions. You could call this &#8216;atmospheric grindcore&#8217;, but even that seems to omit something essential about it; doesn&#8217;t capture the downward mental spiral of songs like &#8216;10 Fingers (My Last Ten Minutes)&#8217;, doesn&#8217;t give you the essence of emotional disintegration of a song like &#8216;Pigeon Vs. Crow&#8217;.\r\n\r\n\tReleased merely a year after their debut LP &#8216;Starving The Vultures&#8217;, &#8216;exotic sense decay&#8217; represents a departure of sorts from circle of dead children&#8217;s music. Not really in sound (though this record does seem a good deal darker and gloomier than their other releases), but more in construction; it feels more distinctly conceptual than their other works, yet in this regard murkier and more unclear. As loathe as I am to compare the band to Nine Inch Nails, this EP almost seems like a reinterpretation of &#8216;The Downward Spiral&#8217;, where it is the soundtrack to an emotional and spiritual disintegration within the character. Other material by circle of dead children is more external and societal in nature; here, all the conflict is placed squarely within itself.\r\n\r\n\t&#8220;Rip and sew/rip and sew/rip and sew/put me back together&#8221;. &#8216;exotic sense decay&#8217; is about finding the beast within yourself and the pain of being unable to reject it. &#8220;A wooden heart never bleeds/Yet inextricable thoughts still weave introspection&#8221;. Lyrics are packed to the brim with rambling tales of self-destruction and alienation from the world at large, but unlike most grindcore, there&#8217;s no strength or empowerment to be found in such things; instead, only coldness (in some ways making this a great deal more realistic towards the common man). Also unlike most, there&#8217;s little misanthropy to be found here, replaced instead by wracking inner conflict and pain. A taste of it even slips out on the album cover itself: a human face distorted beyond all recognition, shredded apart and recomposed time and time again.\r\n\r\n\tInstrumentally, the band is top-notch at carrying out such an atmosphere. The music is technical and ever-changing, yet has a distinctly &#8216;loose&#8217; feel to its playing. Drums flitter chaotically between barely-held blasting and seemingly random fills, while guitars spin two or three-chord riffs with abruptly shifting melodies and textures or weaving epic tales through tremolo picking. All the instruments mesh and diverge in an organic matter, bound together only by the vocal performance of Joe Horvath (around a 60/40 split between mid-range rasps and deep, guttural growls), who acts as a tenuous rope that holds the rest of the band together. And perhaps such an arrangement is reflective of the EP as a whole: songs bleeding into each other with a reprieve of only brief noise or the sway of guitar feedback before battering into each other again like turkey vultures on the corpse of a woodland animal. The most cohesive track here is the (comparatively at nearly five minutes) epic &#8216;10 Fingers (My Last Ten Minutes)&#8217;, which seems nearly musical compared to previous noise blasts like &#8216;A Wooden Heart Never Bleeds&#8217; or the &#8216;You Suffer&#8217; tributes of &#8216;Wotton&#8217; and &#8216;Grabbing N&#8217;.\r\n\r\n\tThere is a definite note of desperation to the proceedings: not unlike Bodies In The Gears Of The Apparatus&#8217; &#8216;Simian Hybrid Prototype&#8217;, the band seems hell-bent on saying something. But while the Clearwater band understood their message of apocalyptic revelation, this one seems to get confused within itself along the way, grasping for words they can&#8217;t seem to find, growing exponentially in frenzy and damnable haste until all drifts away in the concluding ambient stretch of &#8216;Scarecrow Trailer Park&#8217;. Fitting for a band titled after the grievous assassination of youth, no answers are given; just questions upon questions on the nature of the self. Through its obsessive ripping at the dark curtain that separates the conscious from the present-but-dormant reaches of the mind, circle of dead children has perhaps not revealed as much as discussed out eventual fate.\r\n\r\n\tI suppose it&#8217;s some consolation that someone&#8217;s doing it.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":142604,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36492/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36492/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":26942,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":18775,"name":"Starving the Vultures","permalink":"starving-the-vultures","position":9,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/starving-the-vultures","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2007-04-14T07:14:15.000Z","description":"1998<BR>\r\nWillowtip Records: CD<BR>\r\nS.O.A.

While the name and logo might suggest this is just another goregrind release, it&#8217;s actually a very well done grindcore assault with minor influences of death metal and doom. For their debut release, Circle Of Dead Children manage to pull together blistering heaviness while staying tight and maintaining good tempo control. Amazing structure and an incredible effort on drums, Starving The Vultures is merely the first chapter (albeit a short one) in a long line of releases from this emotionally creative and artistic band. Whether you&#8217;re a fan of grindcore or simply crushing, challenging savagery, this should be on your list.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":142605,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36493/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36493/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":26942,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":18810,"name":"Zero Comfort Margin 10\"","permalink":"zero-comfort-margin-10","position":10,"price":16.0,"default_price":16.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/zero-comfort-margin-10","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2007-04-14T18:14:08.000Z","description":"2005<BR>\nArchlight Communications<BR>\n10&#8221; Gatefold.\nBlack &#38; Gold wax.\nSubliminal messages included.<BR>\nAlternative artwork, complementary to the CD, by Mark Riddick.\n\n","options":[{"id":142728,"name":"Default","price":16.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120175/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120175/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36562/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36562/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":26943,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":18811,"name":"The Genocide Machine  12\"LP","permalink":"the-genocide-machine-12lp","position":11,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-genocide-machine-12lp","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2007-04-14T18:16:39.000Z","description":"2001\nVinyl version of the CD.\nWillowtip Records\n200 on transparent blue hand-numbered\n1000 on black.\nAll packaged in a silver static-bag.\nSubliminal messages included.\nArtwork by: Mark Riddick\nO.O.P.\n\n","options":[{"id":142729,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36563/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36563/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":26943,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":18812,"name":"Exotic Sense Decay 7\" picture-disc","permalink":"exotic-sense-decay-7-picture-disc","position":12,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/exotic-sense-decay-7-picture-disc","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2007-04-14T18:24:13.000Z","description":"*<i> This item is long out-of-print but we recently found a box with a few unsold extras lying in it.

The music lurches and slithers through a bizarre yet totally effective combination of extremes&#8230; It goes from blinding speed to plodding sludge. The vocals go from shrieking to growling to sewer roars and back again. The music ranges from utter chaos to restrained, almost &#8220;arty,&#8221; class. Touches of power violence, black metal, and doom have also been incorporated, but only after they have been run through a musical meat grinder. I&#8217;ve listened to this record a dozen times and I continue to get a different vibe from it each time. The only thing that seems to stay the same is the over-the-top extremeness. You only want to dare this record if you think your music should desecrate your eardrums.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":142730,"name":"7 \" picture disc","price":10.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36564/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36564/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":26943,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":18813,"name":"Starving the Vultures 12\"LP","permalink":"starving-the-vultures-12lp","position":13,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/starving-the-vultures-12lp","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2007-04-14T18:25:27.000Z","description":"1998\nS.O.A.
