If you want to be able to download it instantly, it is also available in my Etsy shop at www.pineapplepophandmade.etsy.com\r\n\r\nOver the last 10 years, I have been hard at work making hundreds upon hundreds of my patchwork festival dresses.  As the years have passed, I have had dozens of kind folks ask if I could share my patterns.  Unfortunately, I had never written down a single pattern because I based my dresses on a set of measurements and let my creative spirit do the rest.  :-)\r\n\r\nI finally sat down and recorded my procedure, step by step, and took pictures and drew diagrams along the way.  Then I stitched it all together into a colorful little package...\r\n\r\nAnd now I am ready to share it with you!\r\n\r\nThe first tutorial I have ever written ~ and I decided to jump right in and tackle the versatile, yet enigmatic, corset back festival dress!!!\r\n\r\nThis is the basic pattern behind my lovely hippie patchwork dresses I have made all these years.\r\n\r\nThis is a digital tutorial in PDF format ~ no hard copy will be shipped.  You will receive your digital file via email.\r\n\r\nThis is a 'bare bones\" tutorial, in that it only includes the basic dress pattern itself ~ patchwork and applique directions are not included.  The short blue \"galaxy\" print dress (2nd picture) is the exact dress I document making in these instructions.\r\n\r\nWhy not include instructions for patchwork and applique?\r\n\r\nWell, there are just so many options for how to make a dress unique and wonderfully you...  I thought it best to pass on the understanding of how the dress is built and leave it up to you to decide what kind of wonderful personalized bits make your heart sing.\r\n\r\nBut no worries!  I have included 20 ideas on how to make your dress completely and totally unique!\r\n\r\nSo, then... What's included?\r\n\r\nWhat you get in this tutorial is thorough 78 pages of step-by-step instructions on the entire process of building your own one-of-a-kind festival dress with over 200 full color pictures and diagrams.  This includes:\r\n\r\nChoosing your equipment\r\nMeasuring for size\r\nSelecting fabric & other materials\r\nPreparing fabric for sewing\r\nCutting custom sized pattern pieces\r\nSewing the dress \r\n&\r\nFinishing with a professional looking hem\r\n\r\nIn addition, I added lots of extra tips and background info including:\r\n\r\nComplete garment care instructions\r\nIdeas on how to personalize the design\r\nTips on setting up an online clothing business\r\nBackground about me & the festival dress\r\nDozens of colorful pictures of finished dresses\r\n\r\nWhat kind of equipment will you need to complete one of these dresses?\r\n\r\nA sewing machine with a straight stitch and a reverse function\r\nSharp scissors\r\nSteam iron/ ironing board\r\nMeasuring tools\r\nquilting pins\r\nFour thread serger (If you only have a sewing machine, you CAN make this dress, but you will need to have a zig-zag function on your  machine to finish seams so they will not fray.  The finished product will probably not be quite as durable as a serged dress would be, but it will hold up for quite awhile.  It is totally reasonable to try this pattern with a zig-zag stitch to see if a serger would be a good investment for the future.)\r\n\r\nI'm also assuming that you have at least a basic understanding of how your sewing equipment works, but if you are a complete and total beginner, this tutorial will give you a good idea of whether or not you want to give it a try.  If nothing else, I think you will enjoy the read and the many, many, many pictures along the way.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial is a PDF document, which once purchased, will be sent to your email address within 24 hours of purchase, and can be downloaded to your computer and/or printed.  \r\n\r\nHappy sewing!!!\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":47392287,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128585463/-/covercollage.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128585463/-/covercollage.jpg","width":800,"height":953},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128585256/-/cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128585256/-/cover.jpg","width":974,"height":808},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127052034/-/DSC00318.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127052034/-/DSC00318.JPG","width":1000,"height":1471},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127052082/-/DSC00115.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127052082/-/DSC00115.JPG","width":1000,"height":1349},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128585145/-/20090829_001.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128585145/-/20090829_001.jpg","width":948,"height":1371}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6587814,"name":"Tutorials","permalink":"tutorials","url":"/category/tutorials"}]},{"id":15080400,"name":"*Midnight in My Garden* Patchwork Maxi Dress","permalink":"midnight-in-my-garden-patchwork-maxi-dress","position":3,"price":155.0,"default_price":155.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/midnight-in-my-garden-patchwork-maxi-dress","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-25T03:40:41.000Z","description":"This stunning dress is made from eleven different 100% cotton floral prints.  Most of them have a black background, a couple have a blue or indigo background, and one has an ivory background, but all of them have bright and bold flowery prints all over.\r\n\r\nAll of those prints mesh so well together ~ they seem to create a lush fabric garden, with the seams barely visible.\r\n\r\nWith that said, I'd like to point out that there are two large pockets on the skirt of the dress.  They blend in with the patchwork so well that you can barely see them.\r\n\r\nThe outer pockets are lined and then double stitched on the bottoms and sides for superior stability.\r\n\r\nThis would be a good time to mention that all of the exposed seams in this dress are serged with a four thread serger and then top stitched.  This makes for a professional looking finish, and the extra peace of mind of super durable seams.\r\n\r\nUp above the empire waist there is the lined bodice, which has a lined pocket stitched to it.  You can keep your goodies safe in there...\r\n\r\nLots of folks ask me if I use darts to shape my bodices.  I do.  We,, sort of...  I figured out a bodice pattern that uses modified princess lines for an even better fit than with darts.  Ah, yes, fabulous curve hugging, bust supporting bodice.  My fave!\r\n\r\nThe straps go over your shoulders and then lace through four sets of loops like a corset, making for a fitted and adjustable dress.

His name was Gutter and he was my entire world for well over 12 years.  \r\n\r\nIn his short life, he influenced the hearts and lives of more people and animals than I can count.  \r\n\r\nHe was the definition of joy and love in a sweet, furry package.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of the the light that he brought to the world, I put together this page to donate to companion animal  rescue organizations.\r\n\r\nBoth Gutter, and his sister, Mona the cat, were both rescues from Last Hope ~ a no-kill animal rescue out of Farmington, MN.  You can find out more info here: www.last-hope.org\r\n\r\nLocally, in Nashville, I have chosen to donate to the Nashville Humane Association.  These folks have been angels in finding forever homes for so many furbabies over the years.  You can learn more about them here: www.nashvillehumane.org\r\n\r\nIf you have an organization that you are particularly attached to, please send me a message through my contact page and I will be sure that the funds reach them.  All I ask is that the organization you choose is a companion animal shelter or rescue of some kind.\r\n\r\nIf you do not choose your own organization, all proceeds will be evenly split between Last Hope and Nashville Humane Association.  \r\n\r\nShortly after I start collecting, I will be setting up a page on this site listing names of folks that have donated to this cause.  If you would like to remain anonymous, please let me know and I will be sure to keep your donation private.\r\n\r\nPets are a blessing to the Human race ~ and Gutter definitely touched the hearts of everyone he met.   My goal here is to honor his spirit and memory by helping these sweet animals find forever homes, where they have all the love and care they need.\r\n\r\nI started the donations here at $1.00 and they go all the way to $100.00.

It features a large landscape applique at the bottom of the center of the front of the skirt.  I call the applique \"The North Woods Lake\" after the vast forests of northern Minnesota, near where I grew up.\r\n\r\nI am a HUGE fan of wearable art ~ this hippie dress style is so versatile for doing just about anything with decoration.  For this one I went all out and did a very large landscape applique with trees, hills, and a lake...  \r\n\r\nThe applique captures the spirit of the woodland, and the colors and prints of the patchwork create a unique, one of a kind, three dimensional frame for the forest image.\r\n\r\nYou may be wondering if I made the applique myself.\r\nI did.  I drew the picture on paper, then transferred it in a 5 step process, by hand, to fabric, and then satin stitched with a sewing machine.  There was no program on the sewing machine for this image.  All I used was a regular satin stitch, thread, and hours upon hours of slow, careful stitching.\r\n\r\nWrapping around the sides and the back of the dress are two panels of Earthy spiral patchwork.  This spiral patchwork is one of the most time consuming styles of patchwork I know how to create.  It is always unique and has a very textured and organic look to it.  In this dress, it represents to freedom that comes from spending time in a place like the great northern woodlands, where there is nothing between you and the pure nature that surrounds you.\r\n\r\nYou may be wondering, as many of my first time customers do, if I serge my seams. \r\nI do!  I use a four thread serger for all of the exposed seams, including patchwork, and then top stitch every one of those seams.  It takes about twice as long to stitch this way than to serge only, but it makes for nice, crisp lines and a super durable dress.\r\n\r\nThe lined bodice is made from a medium brown corduroy that had a dark brown foliage print on it.\r\n\r\nLots of folks ask me if I shape my dress bodices with darts,\r\nI do.  In addition to darts, I specially shape the bodice and its lining to hug curves and provide fabulous support.  There are no squished bust lines here!  \r\n\r\nThere is also a lined secret pocket on the inside of the bodice.  What's a hippie dress without a secret pocket?\r\n\r\nThe straps go over your shoulders and lace through four sets of loops like a corset, and there is a band of elastic at the top of the back of the skirt for a comfortable, adjustable fit.\r\n\r\nMeasurements: \r\nBust: 34\" - 43\" \r\nCup Size: A-B-C \r\nWaist: up to 40\" \r\nHips: up to 48\" \r\nLength (from underarm to hem at side): 44\"\r\n\r\nPlease measure carefully ~ all sales are final and returns will not be taken for items that do not fit.\r\n\r\n*The story behind this dress*\r\n\r\nI made this dress at least four years ago.  It is a tribute to the beautiful lakes and evergreen trees that made up the forests in northern Minnesota.  One of the most peaceful places on Earth is in the midst of a scene like this ~ camping next to a remote lake, watching the calm water, hearing a loon's call in the distance...\r\n\r\nThis dress was originally made for sale, but after I made pictures and put it up for sale for a few days, I decided to keep it.  It is a very rare occasion when I decide to keep my own work...  But I never ended up wearing it.  It has been sitting in my closet since it was made, and it is for too beautiful to only be seen by my walls.  It is my hope that someone comes along and recognizes this scene from sometime in their life and can wear this fabric painting of nature with pride.\r\n\r\nI guess the story wasn't that long, but thanks for reading to the end of it anyway!","options":[{"id":42975945,"name":"Default","price":275.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123951315/-/DSC00409.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123951315/-/DSC00409.JPG","width":700,"height":757},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123951270/-/DSC00399.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123951270/-/DSC00399.JPG","width":700,"height":918},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123951330/-/DSC00405.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123951330/-/DSC00405.JPG","width":700,"height":970},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123951342/-/DSC00404.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123951342/-/DSC00404.JPG","width":700,"height":1153},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123951321/-/DSC00411.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123951321/-/DSC00411.JPG","width":700,"height":863}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5916573,"name":"Long Dresses","permalink":"long-dresses","url":"/category/long-dresses"},{"id":6171204,"name":"Clothing","permalink":"clothing","url":"/category/clothing"},{"id":6490236,"name":"pre-made","permalink":"pre-made","url":"/category/pre-made"}]},{"id":13410192,"name":"Reserved for Alison *Mod Butterfly* Wrap Skirt","permalink":"mod-butterfly-wrap-skirt","position":11,"price":74.0,"default_price":74.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mod-butterfly-wrap-skirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-06T23:36:10.000Z","description":"This skirt is reserved for Alison ~ Please do not purchase this item unless this is you.

I have made a couple variations as wedding gowns, believe it or not!\r\n\r\nThis dress is made of a whole bunch of random patchwork in your choice of color combinations (see ordering options),  There is  huge applique of what I like to call \"The Wise Old Tree\", which is one of my Pineapple Pop original applique designs.  It has a beautifully fitted bodice with plenty of support from lightweight boning and carefully placed seam lines.  The bodice is lined and also has a little pocket on the inside for all the little essentials.  There are extra wide straps that go over your shoulders and lace through four sets of loops like a corset, and an elastic waistband for a snug and comfy fit.  At the bottom of the skirt there is a wide ruffle that matches the fabric used for the bodice.\r\n\r\nI am offering this made to order dress in your custom size.

The \"Wise Old Tree\" applique will be a brown tree with green leaves on all dresses.  The color selection will not change the color of the tree.  I have the descriptions here and you can make the selection when you check out.\r\n\r\n*Earth ~ Green, Beige, Brown & Cream with a Dark brown bodice and ruffle \r\n*Earth & Sky ~ Blue, Green, Beige, Brown & Cream with Dark brown bodice and ruffle (as pictured)\r\n*Ocean & Sky ~ Blue, Green, Cream & White with blue bodice and ruffle\r\n*Wedding Day ~ Cream, White & Ivory with a Cream bodice and ruffle\r\n*Vintage Wedding Day ~ Beige, Cream, White & Ivory with a Beige bodice and ruffle\r\n\r\nThere is also an option for the \"Wedding\" styles to add lining and a train, so choose carefully!\r\n\r\nAfter you have ordered this dress, please send me an email or go to my contact page to give me your measurements and be as accurate as possible because I do not take returns if something does not fit and I have made the dress to your specifications.

I'll replace them tomorrow :-)\r\n\r\nDon't mind the one picture that makes the back look shorter than the front ~ my dress form tilts forward and sometimes makes things look a little \"off\".  The hem is actually even to the gound all the way around.\r\n\r\nThis is one heck of a dress!  This is the dress that I documented step-by-step in my Festival Dress tutorial ~ well, just the dress and not the applique was documented.  If you want, you can read how I made it and see the pictures of it being made.  If you have any doubts about the quality after that, I'm pretty sure you may be one of those folks that's impossible to please...  In other words, this dress is built to last. :-)\r\n\r\nI acquired this fabric awhile back with the idea that I would make a dress with a cityscape applique on it.   When it was time to make the applique, I drew the picture, cut out all the pieces and attached them to the dress.  Then I kept looking at it and it seemed to scream, \"I NEED A TARDIS!\"  Then several other kindly folks ~ some without any prompting ~ said, \"THIS NEEDS A TARDIS!\"  That sealed it!\r\n\r\nSo, All these little pieces of the buildings and the TARDIS were sitting there, ready to be stitched...  It was BEAUTIFUL!  I just love tedious little appliques! :-)  And this one took MANY hours...  Please don't have too much sticker shock ~ the fabric was not cheap and the applique took literally ALL DAY!\r\n\r\nThe dress itself is has seams that are serged and then top stitched and the bodice is lined.  The bodice also has a secret pocket on the inside to stash away all your little secrets.  Sssshhhhh!\r\n\r\nIt has some generously wide straps that go over your shoulders and lace through fours sets of loops like a corset and there is a piece of elastic at the top of the back of the skirt for an adjustable and comfortable fit.  That means that not only can it fit several different sizes, but it will also still fit nicely if you lose or gain a couple pounds here and there.\r\n\r\nMeasurements: \r\nBust: 32\" - 40\" \r\nCup Size: A-B-C \r\nWaist: free size \r\nHips: free size \r\nLength (from underarm to hem at side): 27.5\" \r\nHem Sweep: 78\"\r\n\r\nPlease measure carefully ~ I cannot take returns on items that do not fit.","options":[{"id":49892088,"name":"Default","price":118.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":6.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128844051/-/DSC00342.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128844051/-/DSC00342.JPG","width":700,"height":691},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128844063/-/DSC00344.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128844063/-/DSC00344.JPG","width":700,"height":676},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128844066/-/DSC00345.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128844066/-/DSC00345.JPG","width":700,"height":850},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128844060/-/DSC00343.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128844060/-/DSC00343.JPG","width":700,"height":725},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128844069/-/DSC00346.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128844069/-/DSC00346.JPG","width":700,"height":581}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5916576,"name":"Short Dresses","permalink":"short-dresses","url":"/category/short-dresses"},{"id":6171204,"name":"Clothing","permalink":"clothing","url":"/category/clothing"},{"id":6490236,"name":"pre-made","permalink":"pre-made","url":"/category/pre-made"}]},{"id":13187826,"name":"*Pretty as a Peach* Patchwork Dress","permalink":"pretty-as-a-peach-patchwork-dress","position":27,"price":104.5,"default_price":104.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pretty-as-a-peach-patchwork-dress","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-26T23:05:07.000Z","description":"This is a dress from my old stock ~ it has been sitting here, waiting to find someone to love it for over two years!

I used a stunning eggplant, beige, white, off-white, and fuchsia striped cotton print with the lines going vertically for the skirt. \r\n\r\nAround the bottom of the skirt I made a bordered stripe of square patchwork in coordinating colors.  It's not a ton of crazy hippie patchwork, and this subtle stripe really makes the elegance of this dress shine!\r\n\r\nThe dress drapes beautifully, if not in an unusual way ~ It is longer in the back than in the front, and shorter in the back than on the sides.  It is a fine specimen if whimsical asymmetrical symmetry.\r\n\r\nLots of folks ask if I serge my seams.  I do serge all of my exposed seams with a four thread serger and for an additional punch, I also top stitch every seam.  That makes for a super durable seam with a crisp, professional finish.\r\n\r\nThe bodice is lined and has a pocket on the inside for your little treasures such as your ID, some cash, maybe even a pretty stone you found while you were wearing it...\r\n\r\nDoes this dress's bodice have darts?  Yes!  Well, sort of...  I have been using bodice darts for years, but I recently modified my corset back dress pattern.  Now I specially shape three different bodice pieces with something similar to princess seams ~ a style that seems to fit even better than with darts.  It really hugs and supports curves!\r\n\r\nThere is also an adorable pocket on the top part of the right side of the skirt that is lined with the striped fabric, but the outside is made from a gorgeous vintage lace and it closes with a sweet dark brown oblong wooden button.\r\n\r\nThe straps go over your shoulders and lace through four sets of loops like a corset, and there is an elastic band at the top of the back of the skirt for an adjustable, snug, yet comfortable fit.\r\n\r\nMeasurements: \r\nBust: 33\" - 43\" \r\nCup Size: B-C-D \r\nWaist: free size \r\nHips:free size \r\nLength (from top of bodice to hem at front): 36\"\r\nLength (from underarm to hem at side): 42\"\r\nLength (from top of bodice back to hem at back): 38\"\r\n\r\nPlease measure carefully ~ all sales are final and returns will not be taken for items that do not fit","options":[{"id":42120750,"name":"Default","price":155.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":17.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123350058/-/DSC00125.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123350058/-/DSC00125.JPG","width":1000,"height":1330},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123350073/-/DSC00127.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123350073/-/DSC00127.JPG","width":1000,"height":1563},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123350085/-/DSC00129.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123350085/-/DSC00129.JPG","width":1000,"height":1473},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123350097/-/DSC00130.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123350097/-/DSC00130.JPG","width":1000,"height":1598},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123350115/-/DSC00133.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123350115/-/DSC00133.JPG","width":1000,"height":1196}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5916573,"name":"Long Dresses","permalink":"long-dresses","url":"/category/long-dresses"},{"id":6490236,"name":"pre-made","permalink":"pre-made","url":"/category/pre-made"}]},{"id":15316884,"name":"*All of Time & Space* Crazy Patchwork Bell Skirt","permalink":"all-of-time-space-crazy-patchwork-bell-skirt","position":29,"price":144.0,"default_price":144.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/all-of-time-space-crazy-patchwork-bell-skirt","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-04T03:58:03.000Z","description":"This skirt makes me so very happy...

It has just the right amount of bold, bright prints with more mellow, soft ones.  \r\n\r\nThe skirt is made from panels of each of the fabrics, with a patchwork ruffle around the hem.\r\n\r\nThe lined bodice is made from a soft salmon colored fabric with little bouquets printed all over it.\r\n\r\nSomething that's unique about my bodice design:  Lots of customers ask if I make darts in these bodices.

The air becomes cool and crisp and the leaves suddenly change into a warm rainbow of colors and create a safe blanket to keep the soil warm under Winter's snow.  \r\n\r\nThe title is correct ~ this jacket is reversible. You essentially get two jackets in one.\r\n\r\nThe pattern I used is one that I made something like eight years ago. It's based off of a sleeveless wrap vest, but I added a hood, sleeves, changed some shapes and dart locations, added a lining and pockets... I guess you could say I made it my own!\r\n\r\nOne side is made entirely from a soft, varying wale, Autumn sienna corduroy.\r\n\r\nThe other side is made from patchwork in 100% cotton prints in browns, creams, tans, teals, and sea greens.\r\n\r\nThe corduroy side has an applique of a large tree with leaves that are in transition from summer to Autumn, preparing to cover the ground.  At the bottom of the trunk of the tree there are three little mushrooms ~ the addition of which was inspired by my autumn walks through woods in the Minnesota River Valley.  It always seemed as if all these mushrooms of different shapes, colors and sizes would pop out of the fallen leaves at this time of the year in those woods.  The applique is \"framed\" with an oval cotton fabric with a faux patchwork print in a cream, brown, green, rust, and fuchsia floral pattern.\r\n\r\nThere are four lined pockets ~ two on each side. They are all teardrop shaped and are big enough to keep your hands warm.\r\n\r\nThere is a lined hood with a long point at the back of the hood, which I have seen described as an \"elf\" or \"fairy\" hood. I guess it would remind me of a gnome hat if were standing straight up. :-)\r\n\r\nThe sleeves bell out as they get closer to the cuffs, with the widest point being at the hem.\r\n\r\nThe jacket closes with two buttons.  The corduroy side had a round shell button, and the patchwork side has an oblong carved wood button.\r\n\r\nMeasurements: \r\nThe measurements are based on where the buttons are placed ~ if need be, I can move the buttons out a couple inches to make the jacket larger or a bit smaller. Please let me know if you would like me to do that.

I think I'm going to retire this dress design and make this the last one I make.  Of course I could always change my mind, but I really do think it's time to work on some new ones. :-)\r\n\r\nLike I said, this is a classic design that I have been making since the early days of Gutter's Goods.  \r\n\r\nWhen I first decided to make a Grateful Dead dress, I designed a couple that had small, subtle references.  I really didn't feel like those represented how influential the music has been...  I decided to go \"over-the-top\" and make a proud statement with this dress.  \r\n\r\nThe dress is made entirely from red and blue 100% cotton prints.  \r\n\r\nThere are two giant bolt appliques on the skirt ~ one on the front and one on the back.  Each of them reaches from the bottom of the bodice to the top of the ruffle.\r\n\r\nAround the hem there is a short ruffle that has a narrow stiffener in the hem.  That helps give the hem body and keeps the skirt from collapsing over time.\r\n\r\nThe lined bodice had another applique of the classic Steal Your Face motif in the classic red, white, and blue colors.  All of the details are machine stitched.  \r\n\r\nOn the inside of the bodice there is a secret pocket!!!\r\n\r\nThe straps go over your shoulders and lace through four sets of white loops like a corset.  That and the elastic at the top of the back of the skirt make for a comfortable, snug, and adjustable fit.\r\n\r\nMeasurements: \r\nBust: 33\" - 44\" \r\nCup Size: B-C-D \r\nWaist: free size \r\nHips:free size \r\nLength (from underarm to hem): 46\"\r\n\r\nPlease measure carefully ~ all sales are final and returns will not be taken for items that do not fit.\r\n","options":[{"id":45564546,"name":"Default","price":176.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":17.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125710530/-/DSC00691.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125710530/-/DSC00691.JPG","width":700,"height":762},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125710578/-/DSC00701.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125710578/-/DSC00701.JPG","width":700,"height":833},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125710572/-/DSC00699.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125710572/-/DSC00699.JPG","width":700,"height":1111},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125710551/-/DSC00695.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125710551/-/DSC00695.JPG","width":700,"height":788},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125710560/-/DSC00696.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125710560/-/DSC00696.JPG","width":1799,"height":2107}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5916573,"name":"Long Dresses","permalink":"long-dresses","url":"/category/long-dresses"},{"id":6171204,"name":"Clothing","permalink":"clothing","url":"/category/clothing"}]},{"id":13250652,"name":"*Royal Violet* Infinity Scarf","permalink":"royal-violet-infinity-scarf","position":51,"price":23.0,"default_price":23.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/royal-violet-infinity-scarf","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-29T21:37:27.000Z","description":"This is one of those things that I love to wear ~ I have one almost every day as soon as it's cool enough outside.\r\n\r\nThis infinity scarf is a complete, unending circle, made from a royal purple cotton jersey knit.  \r\n\r\nThis is a heavier weight than a regular t-shirt, so its a great warmer for cold days...\r\n\r\nOne of the great things about these scarves is that you can wear them in so many ways.

You essentially get two jackets in one.  \r\n\r\nThe pattern I used is one that I made, gosh, something like eight years ago.  It's based off of a sleeveless wrap vest, but I added a hood, sleeves, changed some shapes and dart locations, added a lining and pockets...  I guess you could say I made it my own!\r\n\r\nOne side is made from a pinwale stretch corduroy in a beautiful shade of sepia.  The other side is made from some wild patchwork in teals, aquas, greens, and creams ~ basically the colors of a peacock feather.\r\n\r\nThe solid corduroy side has an intensely time consuming applique of two peacock feathers stitched on it.  \r\n\r\nI was very careful to add what I call \"imperfect detail\" to the applique.  This was inspired by the real peacock feather I have.  I noticed that a part of the beauty of the feather is its asymmetry ~ bent barbs, a twisted quill...  I tried to reflect those anomalies with the stitching of the feather images.\r\n\r\nThere are four lined pockets ~ two on each side.  They are all teardrop shaped and are big enough to keep your hands warm.\r\n\r\nThere is a lined hood with a long point at the back of the hood, which I have seen described as an \"elf\" or \"fairy\" hood.

Thank you for the applique suggestion, Heather!\r\n\r\nOn the inside of the bodice is a secret pocket.\r\n\r\nThe straps go over your shoulders and lace through four sets of loops like a corset, and there is a band of elastic at the top of the back of the skirt for a comfy, snug, and adjustable fit.\r\n\r\nMeasurements: \r\nBust: 32.5\" - 37\" \r\nCup Size: B-C-D \r\nWaist: free size \r\nHips:free size \r\nLength (from underarm to hem): 47\"\r\n\r\nPlease measure carefully ~ all sales are final and returns will not be taken for items that do not fit.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of the color differences in the fabrics, please make sure to hand wash this art piece in cold water and drip dry.  Although it can be machine washed, it will last much longer if extra care is taken to protect the fibers in this dress.","options":[{"id":42425001,"name":"Default","price":210.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":12.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123559590/-/DSC00312.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123559590/-/DSC00312.JPG","width":1000,"height":1577},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123559665/-/DSC00321.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123559665/-/DSC00321.JPG","width":1000,"height":1444},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123559626/-/DSC00314.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123559626/-/DSC00314.JPG","width":1000,"height":708},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123559647/-/DSC00318.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123559647/-/DSC00318.JPG","width":1000,"height":1471},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123559701/-/DSC00322.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123559701/-/DSC00322.JPG","width":1000,"height":1508}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5916573,"name":"Long Dresses","permalink":"long-dresses","url":"/category/long-dresses"},{"id":6171204,"name":"Clothing","permalink":"clothing","url":"/category/clothing"}]},{"id":13185234,"name":"*The Sparrow's Gift* Patchwork Maxi Dress","permalink":"the-sparrow-s-gift-patchwork-maxi-dress","position":66,"price":229.0,"default_price":229.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-sparrow-s-gift-patchwork-maxi-dress","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-26T20:41:00.000Z","description":"Ooooooh, this is a perty one...
