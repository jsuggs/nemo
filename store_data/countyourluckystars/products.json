It went through a change here and there- chiefly, his kid brother joined on drums and their friend Scotty on Thunder Bass.  They wrote some things, and they recorded some things, but this was the first cohesive thing that Annabel became known for.  This gem is what got them signed to Count Your Lucky Stars, and we've wanted to release this little guy for quite sometime.  \r\n\r\nFast forward about 5 years and here we are, finally giving \"Now That We're Alive\" a proper release, complete with new artwork designed by Annabel's own Andy Hendricks.

Their final album \"Highway Miles\" was hugely influential in Michigan- especially in Flint scene, in the days before the rage and influence of the internet.  They electrified and unified the scene- it's fair to say they were the scene here.  But they broke up shortly after this gem of an album was released, and time too quickly forgot how great they were.  Even in the darkest corners of the internet it was hard to find mention of our hometown heroes.  But we have a chance now to give credence to a band that never truly got their shot, despite all the hard work.  Even better, it's on vinyl for the first time as a 2xLP and includes a previously unreleased bonus track and gatefold artwork. \r\n\r\nKBC are reuniting for a few shows to celebrate this release in December, so if you are anywhere in Michigan you have no excuse to not be there.

Effectively marrying piano and horns to guitar, bass, drums, and longing vocals, the album is broody, majestic, and open, like a frozen landscape painted by the last dying rays of sun before settling for a long cold night in the dead of winter.
