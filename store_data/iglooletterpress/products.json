Our Book Kits are a great place to start. They include everything you need to create the book shown, and make great gifts to the DIY-er in your life.\r\n\r\nOur newest book kit creates a beautiful and unique book perfect for all ages. The book can be \"read\" traditionally or pulled out to create a special series of stories or photographs.\r\n\r\nIgloo Letterpress was founded in 1996 using a 19th century press and a collection of vintage images and type passed down to owner Allison Chapman from her Grandad. It is this treasure trove that serves as her inspiration for projects and inventive new books and cards. Igloo Letterpress is located in downtown Worthington, Ohio, ten minutes from the urban center of Columbus and ten minutes from miles of beautiful farmland. Igloo walks this unique geographical line to create refreshing designs using found local plates and types. The result is truly urban, truly rural, and Truly Midwest.\r\n\r\nYour piece may differ slightly from what appears in the picture, due to slight variations in the printing process and ink.
