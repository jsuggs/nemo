Old fashioned push in turn on and off buttons/sticks that go from one side to the other when pushed to turn on and off. The cherubs which are porcelain appear to be holding onto columns and each is very detailed. I see no chips or cracks on either lamp. The bases is the old fashioned scroll look in a square stand / base with feet on all four sides. I see only a couple of scuff marks, but not chips on the backs of the cherubs. If you would like more pictures feel free to ask. Assuming these to be very old or either someone made them to look this old by distressing as even the base for the light bulbs are painted along with the antique bases in a shabby distressed \"chippy\" style.

The base wreath was 12\" but With the white lace trim (sorry hard to see the approximately 1 to 1 1/2\" lace around the wreath due to the white lace background), it measures approximately 13\". It is covered with well over 300+ pieces of Vintage and Modern jewelry. I love the way the top center middle portion has dangling pieces of jewelry... Beautiful year round. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind this is not a smaller 8\" wreath but a 13\". Many hours of attention and love have been put into this beautiful OOAK accent. It's a great size to hang above a mantle or on a focal wall. The entire wreath is covered in Jewels. It will come to you ready to hang with a sawtooth hanger. Wreath contains both complete jewelry pieces and parts of jewelry to include Rhinestones, faux pearls, pendants, antique beads, earrings, brooches, etc... Because this wreath contains many tiny pieces, beads, berries, etc., some may come loose or pop off during shipment.

For his age I consider him in Excellent condition, displayed only in my Vintage Toy curio cabinet. His fur is very soft and his arms and legs have wires inside so that he is adjustable. He wears the cutest gold material style collar around his neck with a chain leash and a handle also of the same gold material as the collar. He does not have his sewn in tag.
