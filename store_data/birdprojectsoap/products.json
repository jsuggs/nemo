This new ceramic birdie wears a red heart at its tail which is created by two fingerprints in red glaze that are handprinted at an angle to form the heart. \r\n\r\n“Look at every path closely and deliberately, then ask ourselves this crucial question: Does this path have a heart? If it does, then the path is good. If it doesn't then it is of no use to us.” - Carlos Castaneda\r\n\r\n\"Where there is love there is life.\"  - Mahatma Gandhi\r\n\r\n♥ ♥ ♥\r\n\r\nEach black, bird shaped soap contains a white, ceramic bird, handmade by moi from Louisiana Clay, which remains as a keepsake once the outer soap has washed away.\r\n\r\nThrough the daily act of washing, you will eventually free the clean, white, ceramic birds inside - potent symbols of restoration and recovery.

They are all natural [they contain no shea butter or animal products - I've received many thank you's for that for those that are allergic] and are really wonderful for your skin. The lovely soap is great for all skin types and is not drying for daily use. The heavenly Rigaud Cypress scent has a rich history which began in Paris in 1850 and is delightful for both women and men.\r\n\r\n~ To prolong the life of handmade soap please keep in a soap dish and allow to dry between uses.
