Why do other lists always leave Sunday off? I still have things to do that day... \r\n\r\nThere is also a section for all the “stuff” you need to do, but don’t know exactly when you’ll get it done, a shopping list for all those items you’ll forget if you didn’t write them down, and of course, the doodle spot for mindful wandering. Also included is a space to write an overall theme for the day-- normally for a holiday or someone’s birthday, but you can get creative. Life is more fun that way. And, there are enough pages to last you an entire year!

Two problems: \r\n\r\nA.Between shopping organic, bulk, and specialty, you never get all you need at one store. This makes having one list confusing and almost impossible to keep up with.\r\n\r\nB.When all of the items are jumbled together, it’s hard to remember what you bought where and if you already got it. There’s always something you end up forgetting.\r\n\r\nThis list solves all of that. With space to list what you plan to buy at each separate store, along with perforations to tear off only the section you need to bring inside one store at a time, you have now got a shopping list you can actually use. Simple.\r\n\r\n5.5 x 8.5 / 50 sheets","options":[{"id":11222905,"name":"Default","price":7.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.9,"amount_with_others":4.95,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/32081549/-/BC_shop.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/32081549/-/BC_shop.jpg","width":510,"height":510}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1900307,"name":"Notepads","permalink":"notepads","url":"/category/notepads"}]}]
