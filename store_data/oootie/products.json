However, this robot is such a bad ass US aerospace engineers deployed it onto the martian surface with a SKY CRANE during a sequence known as Seven Minutes of Terror. What a cool freaking entrance! This is also the first time OoOtie engineers showed a little love to the aero/astro kids down the hall with a bow tie that speaks their language. While Curiosity is doing its thing on the fourth rock from the sun, we suggest you take take part in this moment of human ingenuity and snatch up one of these limited edition bow ties before the final count down. \r\n\r\n<b>DO:</b> Did you just a private message from that hottie from the jet propulsion laboratory? Tie this bow on and get ready for blast off.  Other acceptable uses: your aero astro PhD quals, public astronomy night at the observatory, or local science cafe. Attending a party where they would ask if you knew the morse code sequence in its track than if Johnny5 was still alive. Alternatively enjoying the Seven Minutes of Terror.Engineer. \r\n\r\n<b>DON’T:</b> Don't mistake this red and gold number as dressy: curiosity is not a fancy bow tie. Don't wear this tie anywhere that came with a paper invitation that required to an RSVP. Unless the words, Science, Institute, or Astronautics are in the name of the place you are going its probably safe to leave this one at home.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe chose the colors for a reason.
