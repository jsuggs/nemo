As I pull each one of the ornaments in my collection out of it's careful wrappings, I am reminded of years and memories past.   It is amazing how a year will pass by without seeing a particular ornament, and then I do see it again, and it is like seeing an old friend.  Maybe I'm sentimental.  In fact, I know I'm sentimental and it is one of the reasons I decided to begin making ornaments.  I began last year in the middle of December, and only managed to get a few made.  Too late to offer them to others to make their own memories with.  This year I started early.  I hope to offer a new ornament design (or two) every year.  \r\n\r\nThis design is an owl.  It measures 3\" long and 2 1/2\" wide.  You get your choice of metal, brass (in the first photo) or copper (second photo color sample only).  Also, your choice of color for the hanger (third photo).  \r\n\r\nI make these ornaments one at a time by hand just for you.  It begins with sheet metal that I saw the design out of.  The metal is then filed and sanded to make all the edges smooth.  I then stamp by hand the design.  Each and every mark laid down in meticulous fashion one at a time.  After a ring is soldered on for hanging, I oxidize the metal and polish it.  I give it a final brushed finish before sealing the metal to help it maintain it's current color.\r\n\r\nAs you can see the two designs vary.  I can personalize each ornament just for you according to your wishes.  It could be your child's name, your family name, the names of your family, a special word or phrase.\r\nIt can be just nothing but decoration,  Baby's First Christmas, Our First Married Christmas.  Almost anything!  \r\n\r\nAt checkout you will let me know three things:  type of metal, color of hanger, and what you want it stamped with.  \r\n\r\nMy promise to you:  I will make you an ornament that is personal and beautiful.  I will make changes to the designs you see here to accommodate your personal message.  I will use the font best suited to your message.  Every ornament will have the year on it, and my signature stamp.  I am not a machine, and therefore sometimes my letters get away from me.  A slightly misaligned letter is not meant to be seen as a flaw, but as fact that this piece of art is made by hand.\r\n\r\nYour ornament will arrive carefully wrapped in tissue and placed in a drawstring bag.  \r\n\r\nThank you for considering a handmade heirloom quality ornament!
