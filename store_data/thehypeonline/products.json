I had no direction i was just really bullshitin. Just so happenly while i was trying to figure out the design for this shirt I was wearing my Jordan 7 Hares. So basically i just tried to mimic the colors off my shoes and tried to make the shirt look like the retro card from back in the day.

If you don't know who I'm talking about it's no other than the greatest ball player ever Micheal Jordan. I remember when Space Jam came out. I must had watched that movie over a 100 times. To me that will always be a classic. Everytime I watched it I saw Mike with that Toon Squad jersey on. I wanted it so bad but as I got older that jersey bacame very rare so heres the next best thing.

I always appreciated the art work they put into it. My all time favorite anime show was \"Dragon Ball\". I have watched every single episode from \"Dragon Ball\" all the way down to \"Dragon Ball GT\". I loved that show so much i had all the toys and shit. I appreciated this show the most because it was so different from everything else that was out during the time and i would say that if it wasn't for them pushing the boundaries there wouldn't be a \"Inuyasha\", \"Naruto\", \"Yu Yu Hakusho\", and so on. So to pay respect to them I made this.

I was also inspired by the Lebron 8 South Beach shoes. To me I think those shoes were the best shoe from Nike since the Jordan 12(1997). Its a hot shoe but it so hard to find something to match them so here you go.
