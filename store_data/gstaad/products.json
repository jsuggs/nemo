They are heroes. Heroes of the United Nations. Thousands of people are employed by the United Nations and other international organizations in the most dangerous spots around the world, where intestine wars, famine, drought, and natural disasters are killing millions of innocents every day. They are heroes who chose to spend most of their life in poor and under-developed countries in order to make a difference, to improve and save the lives of as many people as possible. They don`t represent a country, they don`t travel first class, they don`t go to lavish diplomatic dinners and parties. Instead, they risk their own life for world peace and security, for providing food and clean water to the poorest people on Earth, for fostering gender equality and social justice, for promoting and nurturing human rights and sustainable development.","options":[{"id":13701622,"name":"Default","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/40511350/-/heroes_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/40511350/-/heroes_cover.jpg","width":159,"height":249}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":127278,"name":"Publications","permalink":"publications","url":"/category/publications"}]},{"id":4622625,"name":"Obama and the United Nations","permalink":"obama-and-the-united-nations","position":2,"price":12.99,"default_price":12.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/obama-and-the-united-nations","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-10-13T05:39:56.000Z","description":"Updated to 2011, \"Obama and the United Nations\" is the second paper of the Gstaad Project's White Papers Series.
