This is followed by the Greenwood, the tremendous title track that perfectly blends country and blues into a fascinating tale about delivering a gravestone to (one of) Robert Johnsons graves. It is a terrific true story with his excellent vocals, slide guitar and nice smooth drum sound that really seems to sum up the mood of indifference that many feel towards the blues legend. He was someone who whilst not the father or \r\nking of the blues was certainly one of the princes and without any doubt popularized the blues in Britain so that we could then transport it back to the U.S and show them what they were missing! Just Ain’t Right has the feel of a Peter Case blues and includes some nice melodic guitar and harmonica sounds, followed by I’d Lose It All, with more of his melodic guitar playing on a strong love song that tells that he would give up everything for his love. Every song that follows is of just as high a quality including a tremendous cover of the old Leadbelly song, Goodnight Irene, even including a gorgeous acoustic guitar instrumental Wonderland. \r\nAmericana Roots UK 2013","options":[{"id":38467404,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/119670942/-/Greenwood-cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/119670942/-/Greenwood-cover.jpg","width":389,"height":393}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5663973,"name":"Albums","permalink":"albums","url":"/category/albums"}]},{"id":12145626,"name":"Slow Drunken Waltz Digipack cd","permalink":"slow-drunken-waltz-digipack-cd","position":3,"price":8.99,"default_price":8.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/slow-drunken-waltz-digipack-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-02T19:44:50.000Z","description":"This short and simple 9-song album is an absolute gem. No frills, and none are needed. Some albums employ simplicity because of restrictions put on the artist: budgetary, time, or otherwise. But Slow Drunken Waltz‘s simplicity is purposeful, and with songs this powerful, there’s no need for fleshing them out; this might endanger the suppleness of the songwriting that is emphasized by the space and the sincerity highlighted by the void of excessive instrumentation.\r\n\r\nBut the instrumentation that does exist strikes that excellent balance between letting a song breathe but not leaving it so bare it lacks accessibility. The music is adept, but also smart and simple, like with the little fiddle instrumental “The Tryin’ Waltz” that instead of using technique to engage the ear, uses taste and tone. And the vocals too, they don’t call on any silly inflections or phony pretentiousness for attention. They are refreshingly straight, solidly “Stevie Tombstone”, just singing as he does, and adds yet another layer of sincerity to the Slow Drunken Waltz.
