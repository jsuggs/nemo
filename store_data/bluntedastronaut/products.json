This time the New York City's representatives team up with Klaus Layer out of Berlin, Germany. Active on the scene for years, DXA once again come back with the essence of Boom Bap, which they're known for. \r\nThe tracks bring a winter vibe reminiscent of DXA's 2012 visit to Germany. Intelligent rhymes, wicked flows and monstrous drum patterns provided by the Crook himself will hit you harder than a V2 rocket. Travel through the stratosphere with a cold Beck's and enjoy both sides of this new release.

He has been in the studio with numerous artists all over the globe. His latest album \"Temple of Doom\" was a great success and received positive reviews worldwide. It featured many veteran MC's, including Craig G, Large Professor, Prince Po, Krumbsnatcha, Blaq Poet, and Grand Daddy I.U. to name a few.\r\n\r\nIt was last year, when talks about this record started. Doom invited Reks and Blacastan to create what was originally planned a 7\" single. After a few months of brainstorming, and organizing the content, together with Doom we decided to extend it to an EP format. \r\n\r\nThough again, produced using the mighty SP1200, we present to you a completely different record than all of our previous releases, our first 10\" vinyl.\r\n\r\n'City Of God' featuring Reks is a powerful narrative about the violent state of affairs in many of America's cities. Inspired by the movie 'Cidade de Deus' by Fernando Meirelles, Reks gives the listener an in-depth descriptive about everyday events one has to experience in order to survive in a tough, concrete jungle. Doom's precisely chopped piano stabs complement his lyrics, adding further gloominess to the track. \r\nThere are two versions of 'City Of God' on this record, the original on Side A, and the \"Park Bench Mix\" featured on Side B. \r\n\r\nOn 'Transmitting Live', Blacastan schools all wanna-be rappers on what it takes to be a true, hard to the bone MC. The charismatic poet, Blac brings us right to the centre of action in a crime-filled neighborhood, where gang violence is omnipresent. His explosive delivery and gripping storytelling blends perfectly with Doom's grimey, head-nodding instrumental. \r\n\r\nThe last track on the EP is a bonus beat called \"SP Madness\". Like in all of the instrumentals on the 10\", here Doom also utilized only 10 seconds of sampling time. \r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n<b>Side A:</b>\r\n1. 'City Of God' feat. Reks\r\nProduced by: DJ Doom\r\nWritten by: Reks\r\n\r\n2. 'City Of God' (Instrumental)\r\nProduced by: DJ Doom\r\n\r\n3. 'Transmitting Live' feat.

To mark this occasion, Blunted Astronaut and DJ Doom are proud to present a very special tribute to one of the most important B-Boy anthems of all time - the 1970 funk masterpiece \"It's Just Begun\".\r\n\r\nHailing from Brooklyn, NYC, Doom has been immersed in Hip-Hop culture since the days of his youth in the early 1980's. Graff writer, B-Boy, DJ, producer - there's not a lot the man hasn't done! On this, his third BA release, he teams up with Nutso for a truly unique project,  revisiting a timeless classic that carries forward the musical legacy of the late, great, Jimmy Castor for years to come.\r\n\r\nHis trusty SP1200 is once again put to work, and with guest appearances by Large Professor, Tony Touch and El Da Sensei (The Artifacts) this limited 7” is guaranteed to be another Blunted Astronaut sure shot.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that the label artwork (by Mr. Krum) is inspired by the layout and typesetting of the U.S. 45 on Kinetic - the much treasured 'original' version.\r\n\r\nB-boys of the world... unite!\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n<b>Side A:</b>\r\n'It's Just Begun'\r\nProduced by DJ Doom.\r\nWritten by Nutso, Large Professor, Tony Touch & El Da Sensei.\r\nCuts/Scratches by DJ Tha Boss.\r\n\r\n<b>Side B:</b>\r\n'It's Just Begun' (Instrumental)\r\nProduced by DJ Doom.\r\n\r\nLimited Edition - 750 copies.\r\n\r\nBAR-7-IJB-0005\r\n\r\n<object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F76807508\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F76807508\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>  <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/bluntedastronaut/dj-doom-nutso-its-just-begun\">DJ Doom & Nutso - It's Just Begun feat.

Hades & RakRaczej - \"RH-\" / \"Energia Zwrotna\"\r\n\r\nBodziers - Pochodzący z Sopotu beatmaker i miłośnik starych samplerów na trójmiejskiej, podziemnej scenie działa od 99 roku, głównie w ramach macierzystej ekipy KSC, współpracując również z innymi raperami z Ziomboi Kliki. Na swoim koncie ma kilka w całości wyprodukowanych przez siebie nielegali m.in. SurkRak \"Cokolwiek EP\", Surkim \"To Coś\" czy PePe \"Antypop\". \r\nSzerszej publiczności dał się poznać dzięki kolaboracji z Hadesem, której owocem były wspólne numery m.in. na \"Prosto Mixtape 600V\" czy reedycji płyty HiFi Bandy \"Fakty, Ludzie, Pieniądze\". Swój styl sam określa jako połączenie klasycznego, brudnego brzmienia lat 90-tych z nieco bardziej wpółczesnymi rozwiązaniami aranżacyjnymi czy rytmicznymi.\r\n\r\nLimitowana do 300 sztuk, kolorowa siódemka jest pierwszym winylowym singlem na koncie Bodziersa . Jest to także pierwsze polskie wydawnictwo Londyńskiej wytwórni Blunted Astronaut . \r\nNa krążku znajdziemy dwa solidne hip hopowe tracki w których spontaniczne, surowe nawijki Hadesa (HiFi Banda) i Raka (DwaZera) doskonale komponują się z brudnymi bitami Bodziersa, wyprodukowanymi na kultowym samplerze E-mu SP-1200. Całości dopełniają szalone cuty Dj’a Kebsa (HiFi Banda) i Dj’a Lolo (13 Crew).\r\n\r\nSprawdź to!\r\n\r\n<b>Strona A:</b>\r\n\r\n1. RH-\r\n\r\n<b>Strona B:</b>\r\n\r\n1.

It was only appropriate to come up with something unique to celebrate this very fruitful year. \t\t\r\n\r\nThe fact that BA once again teamed up with Brooklyn MC, T.R.A.C. is no coincidence, the picture disc format...only appropriate.\r\n\r\n'Sea Of Tranquility' takes the listener on a hypnotic flight through the upper stratosphere to a very special place. The very calm and eerie instrumental (produced by D Melodious) acts here as a quick anesthetic. The message becomes clear after only few opening verses.\r\n\r\n'Show Ready...(Ya Know?)' is a head-nodder that gives the listener a jolt of positive energy. T.R.A.C.'s impeccable flow combines perfectly with Dee's knocking beat to create another sure shot. Ya know?\r\n\r\n-Kuba Bujko, CEO & Founder\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n<b>Side A:</b>\r\n1.

Produced by DJ Doom, the demo tape was recorded on an old Tascam 644 mixing deck between 1995 and 1996 at his Solo Productions Studio in Brooklyn. \r\n\r\nOn this recording, MB Network take you on a 30-minute journey back to the golden era. Through their lyrics, Cillo, Connery and guests (Geoffrey Domma, Kat Caddy, Marquee) provide a very descriptive and authentic image of New York City's streets. Doom's SP1200/EPS16+ combo provides a perfect canvas for eight street serenades combined with three skits. \r\n\r\nThe casette-like design by Mr.Krum is something also worth notice.

As they got older, they started to get influenced by the culture as a whole and began creating music themselves, currently for Da Shogunz.\r\n\r\nDa Shogunz are a European Hip-Hop crew based in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nAt present, the crew includes: 2 MC's (BlabberMouf and Corown Da Sensei aka CDS) and 4 producers (Propo'88, Truffel The Phunky Phaqir, DJ Realize and Kick Back, who moved from Canada to Holland to become part of the group).\r\n\r\nDa Shogunz, along with Het Verzet are the elite of underground Hip-Hop movement in Holland. With each member of the group contributing their unique style, together they form a strong foundation for boom-bap's inevitable revival. \r\n\r\nThis 12” record is comprised of instrumentals and vocal tracks created in traditional ways of Hip-Hop production, reminiscent of the times when the culture thrived. \r\n\r\nIt features MC's the duo has worked with in and outside of Da Shogunz. The vocal section is blessed by BlabberMouf, EllMatic & RawBerry from Holland, Simple One & Mr.Nylson from Germany, K Banger from the US, and Self from Canada. On the B-side there are six exclusive instrumental head-nodders. \r\n\r\nIn a time where mediocrity and corporate interference overflow the music industry, one should admire Propo's and Kick Back's dedication to being true to the culture, and to listeners worldwide.\r\n\r\nIt's the finest of cosmic boom-bap...\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n<b>Side One:</b>\r\n1.

Emskee takes the first verse to set the tone, Saint steps in for the second verse with a storyline, and then they split the third verse with yet another story that is all too familiar with most aspiring artists in the industry trying to make it happen for themselves. An everyday reality record indeed.\r\n\r\n\"The Theory\" is a smooth, jazzy-oriented joint which explains how alot of mc's and producers in the game don't really take the art form of making hip hop music seriously.

More often than not, it was a case of when the sun comes up, roll one last jazz stick, throw some bread in the toaster for the peanut butter and pop in the 1996 world finals DMC tape... - (DJ Noize killed em all)\r\n\r\nIn the words of the Monkee's (and Biz Markie) ''that was then, and this is now''\r\n\r\n10 years later, Dirty Treats took their craft a little more serious and along with mundane 9-5s rented together an apartment on the south coast of Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, England.\r\nNicknamed 'The Jazz Flat' and with girlfriends only in the mix once a month, they turned the apartment into a studio combining equipment, records, and more importantly ideas.\r\nA turntable was also set up in the kitchen for those moments of previewing fresh digs whilst eating.\r\n\r\nWith a view to making an album of their collaborations with emcees and friends, DT decided on finding distribution for their work and started to produce beats together. Anyone of them, at anytime, coming up with a loop, chop, break, drum sound or other nucleus and then layering sounds and arranging together with the scratches going in last.\r\n\r\n<b>'Everything Is Broken'</b> was born from a dark time. Dirty had been living at the apartment for a year before when Treats arrived. When they combined and set up all of their equipment, they realized a lot of repair work was needed to be done to their main tools. Mpc faders and floppy drives broke, screens needed replacing, the custom built 40GB PC computer kept crashing and one monitor speaker had a broken tweeter. Basically, there was a lot to stunt creativity.\r\n\r\nHowever staying productive and without having an option to save any work on the MPC, Hairy sent across just the piano loop and the drums (2 channels of audio) to Virginia's Praverb the Wyse, who saw enough potential in the loop for it to become something. When turning over beats and ideas and sending them anywhere, it's important you have some way of archiving or remembering the track. That day a rough loop of EIB came from the MPC 60 (with a broken floppy drive) to a Fostex multi tracker and then onto a laptop (via a mini disc recorder). Hairy looked around at the half working studio and out of frustration, wondering which piece of equipment should be fixed first, he ended up just naming the file <b>'Everything Is Broken'</b>...\r\n\r\nWhen Praverb returned the vocals, they realized that he had gone with that title and based his lyrics around it. His verses concentrate on witty observations on the current state of Hip-Hop culture and our ailing society.\r\nTreats contributed some real nice melodies which you hear on this track beyond the loop, in the form of horns and vocal samples, and Hairy finally laced the cuts. Lady of Rage is one of the lines scratched, where she spits on DJ Premier's 'Unfucwitable' track, ''I just got dumped and got left broken hearted\". \r\n\r\n<b>Originally Original.</b>\r\n\r\nNot such a cheesy story can be told about Praverb's natural hunger to jump on another DT track. Dirty had been playing around with a jazz guitar loop, which unusually he didn't pitch to his comfort tempo. This forced his MPC 60 drum pattern to be quicker than usual, clocking in around 95.5 BPM. He threw in a sample change for a '2 x 4 bar' chorus in the arrangement. \r\nEager to scratch something on the chorus and not eager to dig too deep at the same time (but still wanting to send something that day!), he reached for Boot Breaks (a break record / scratch tool) put out by Guildford's (UK) Dr. Zygote, an underrated producer and skilled DJ. There, complete in reggae style voice, was the word 'ORIGINAL'. \r\nHairy already new what he was going to call the file...\r\n\r\nPraverb took a little longer than usual, and DT got into some other beats. When the acapellas eventually made it across the Atlantic, Hairy was already bored of the samples and with Treats pushing for a full make over, he was very enthusiastic pulling in the majority of the sounds, pianos, horns, and vocal snippets. They redid the whole track with a new arrangement, keeping the original drums.\r\n\r\nTo this day Ill Treats still keeps the vibe alive and lives in the Jazz Flat, and they both are currently working through the DT catalogue to release more of these soulful jams into the world.\r\n\r\nDirty Hairy  \r\nApril / 2012 / Zagreb, Croatia\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n<b>Side A:</b>\r\n'Original'\r\nProduced by Dirty Treats, Lyrics by Praverb The Wyse.\r\n\r\n<b>Side B:</b>\r\n'Everything Is Broken'\r\nProduced by Dirty Treats, Lyrics by Praverb The Wyse.\r\n\r\nLimited Edition - 300 numbered copies.\r\n\r\nBAR-7-OG-0003\r\n\r\n<object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F46061430\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F46061430\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>  <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/bluntedastronaut/dirty-treats-original\">Dirty Treats - Original feat.

They have been listening to Hip-Hop their entire lives and grew up immersed in the culture that goes along with it. They have been homies for years and have put out numerous projects going back to 2005. Their next endeavor is the 7\" single for their upcoming full-length project. The songs are titled 'I Get Up' and 'Ice's Jazz'. The single will be pressed up on 7\" vinyl with a very unique design and released in collaboration with Blunted Astronaut Records and DXA Records.  \r\n\r\n\"I Get Up\" is a tune with multiple meanings and has a feel reminiscent of the Native Tongues movement. It is about getting up and going for yours and pursuing your dreams. The lyrics of this song will take you on a journey of what it means to be dedicated to something and not giving up on your dreams, even though sometimes you might not see the impact or results of what your doing right away. The song also reflects on DXA's musical passion which is the reason for getting up in the morning and living life.\r\n\r\n\"Ice's Jazz\" is a tune with a heavy jazz influence. It started out as an experiment and was originally destined for a different project but as it came together it started to take on a life of its own and found a perfect fit with the songs DXA was currently working on. The track is an instrumental composed of a lot of different elements for your audio exploration. It is IceRocks' ode to Gang Starr's \"DJ Premier in Deep Concentration\" and Pete Rock's \"Pete's Jazz\", hence the name.  It was a way for him to display his talent as a producer and explore the instrumental world.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n<b>Side A:</b>\r\n'I Get Up'\r\nProduced by IceRocks, Lyrics by DXA.\r\n\r\n<b>Side B:</b>\r\n'Ice's Jazz'\r\nProduced by IceRocks.\r\n\r\nLimited Edition - 300 numbered copies.\r\n\r\nBAR-7-IGU-0002\r\n\r\n<object width=\"380\" height=\"214\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/25Qi4J4wdDE?hl=en_GB&amp;version=3\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/25Qi4J4wdDE?hl=en_GB&amp;version=3\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"380\" height=\"214\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F39043425&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=ff7700\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F39043425&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=ff7700\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>   <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/bluntedastronaut/dxa-i-get-up\">DXA - I Get Up</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/bluntedastronaut\">Blunted Astronaut Records</a></span>\r\n</p>\r\n</p>\r\n<object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F39042720&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=ff7700\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F39042720&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=ff7700\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>   <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/bluntedastronaut/dxa-ices-jazz\">DXA - Ice's Jazz</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/bluntedastronaut\">Blunted Astronaut Records</a></span>\r\n</p>\r\n</p>\r\n</p>\r\n</p>\r\n</p>\r\n</p>","options":[{"id":18178581,"name":"Default","price":6.5,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.89,"amount_with_others":0.49,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.89,"amount_with_others":1.19}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121760076/-/i_get_up_front.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121760076/-/i_get_up_front.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121760121/-/i_get_up_back.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121760121/-/i_get_up_back.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121760124/-/i_get_up_vinyl.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121760124/-/i_get_up_vinyl.jpg","width":800,"height":800}],"artists":[{"id":109937,"name":"DXA","permalink":"dxa","url":"/artist/dxa"}],"categories":[]},{"id":4254411,"name":"Drumat!c - Stay True feat.

The music has inspired and uplifted generations of people since its beginnings and still does in this modern era. But with every art form that reaches its epiphany in commercialization, it starts to get exploited and watered down from what its main purpose was.\r\n\r\nNowadays majority of people feel like Hip-Hop's magic is wearing off and slowly dying because of what it used to be in its \"golden\" days. Blunted Astronaut is here to change this perception with its debut release.\r\n\r\n\"Stay True\" is about finding yourself and figuring things out. Its all about the integrity that you keep with you during your day to day unravelings.\r\n\r\nBeing true to yourself may not always mean you'll come out a winner in the end, but it does mean that you did it the way you intended and didn't sell yourself short for the price of fools gold.. Good or bad, we all have to live with the decisions we make.\r\n\r\nMC extraordinaire TRAC lends his time and his voice to kick it over a jazzy, smooth Drumat!c instrumentation along with IceRocks' funky, ready for the BBQ remix.... The songs may differ in attitude but they convincingly get the point across.\r\n\r\nMusic to elevate.....\"Stay True\" and enjoy!\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n<b>Side A:</b>\r\nStay True (Nightime Mix) feat.
