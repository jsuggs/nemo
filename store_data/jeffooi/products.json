There, he took snapshots and kept a journal of his very unique experience. Later when the series finished, he was determined to document the experience properly for his children.  The journal has gone from a diary to a picture book, to a blog and now a novel.  \r\nJeff describes his first book as not Shakespeare or Steinbeck or even Spike Milligan.
