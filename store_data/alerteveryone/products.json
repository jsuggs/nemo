In April of 2009 they began (for the third time), their first full length album. This time the band decided to work with the Dayton native and Hawthorne Heights pal, Brian Whitten. Whitten co-runs Centre City studios in Dayton and has been recording music for more than five years while touring with his band, Auburndale. Whitten's excitement towards the album and ever-flowing genius were just the breath of fresh air that the four piece had desired. With June 12th, 2009 set as the release date for the eleven track LP titled, “We’re Gonna Have a Parade!”, the band is doing everything they can to promote not only the release show but themselves as a new, revised Alert the Press.","options":[{"id":1642432,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3376289/-/AtP_Album_Cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3376289/-/AtP_Album_Cover.jpg","width":600,"height":399}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":322170,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
