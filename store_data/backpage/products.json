I originally hesitated to offer this no-brainer version because I already had so many in that color way...but if it fits, it fits. I still love the original \"chalkboard\" idea, but I love a happy customer and a proud Pittsburgher more.\r\n\r\nThe Original write-up below:\r\n\r\nHi and hello, hockey fans. It's your old pal Dave Dameshek. When is 66 greater than 99? Well, listen here, fella, and I'll give ya the straight poop.  \r\n\r\nWayne Gretzky may be The Great One, but he's not The Greatest One. That honor belongs to one man and one man only. The Pride of Pittsburgh. The Steel City Savior. A two-time Stanley Cup champ-een as a player and a third time as an owner, he's meant more to his respective franchise than any other athlete in the history of hockey, nay, professional sports. His name literally means The Best. I know him as 66. You can call him Mario Lemieux.  \r\n\r\nUnlike Gretzky, Lemieux came into the league on a terrible team with no supporting cast. And even though he played in an era when it was more difficult to score goals, Lemieux still matched or exceeded Gretzky's scoring pace. When Gretzky was setting his records, the league was all hooey and applesauce. Goalies looked like Mr. Salty and defensemen wore full-length trousers. Egad! \r\n\r\nWhile Lemieux played his entire career in Pittsburgh and saved the Penguins not once, not twice, but three times from financial ruin, Gretzky played for Edmonton, Los Angeles, St. Louis, and New York, tarnishing his legacy with each subsequent stop. Gretzky never won another championship after leaving Edmonton. Yet how much did the Oilers miss him? They won the Cup two years after trading him. Know why the Penguins never moved Lemieux? Because you don't trade the best player to ever play the game!\r\n\r\nLemieux could do everything Gretzky could do, but Lemieux did it in a 6-4, 225-pound frame. Gretzky could never overpower opponents or carry defenders to the net like 66. Lemieux was simply the bigger, stronger man. Had it not been for his health issues, Lemieux would stand alone in the record books. He'll have to settle for rewriting math books. Because by any measure the equation proves true. \r\n\r\n66>99\r\n\r\nBut before I go, let me just say blah blah spicy brown mustard. Blah blah blah breakfast meats. Blah pizza toppings blah blah. It's been a thin slice of heaven. \r\n\r\nNOTE: Scheduling conflicts prevented Dave Dameshek from writing the intro to this shirt, which he helped create. So instead, here's someone pretending to be Dave Dameshek. Let it be known that Dave Dameshek has pledged to provide an official write up, which will be posted when said piece becomes available.\r\n\r\n*This Lemieux 66>99 tee is printed on Chalkboard Green color premium American Apparel fine jersey tees.

He was Pittsburgh’s sacred, adopted son.\r\n\r\nYet contract squabbles meant Mario wasn't exactly thrilled to come to Pittsburgh as a first-round pick. Mario wanted an annual payment of a million dollars in each of the first three years, guaranteed. The Penguins where offering just under that, and an agreement that was suitable to both parties was not met by draft day. When Mario’s name was called, he defied hockey tradition and refused to walk to the podium or to don a Penguins jersey. Because of Mario’s actions, justified or not, many writers and critics described him as an arrogant, spoiled brat. One enraged writer was quoted as saying, “A tasteless demonstration of bad manners, unmatched by anything I’ve ever seen.” It would be the last time anyone from Pittsburgh ever had reason to criticize Lemieux. \r\n\r\nMario's popularity and skill saved the hockey franchise from impending financial doom in 1984, and as the decade wore on, he inspired a mad love affair between Pittsburgh and the sport of hockey. Fans filled the Civic Arena like never before, and the Steel City truly became a three-sport town. \r\n\r\nWe watched the Penguins slowly become contenders, stockpile skilled players, and then win a Stanley Cup, something that was incomprehensible before Lemieux's arrival. That 1991 season is scorched into my brain. I remember the stunning displays 66 performed, including the now legendary goal against Jon Casey in Game Two of the Stanley Cup Finals. I remember the moment Mike Lange stated the Pittsburgh Penguins were indeed Stanley Cup champs, and I remember running out the back door, arms in the air, exclaiming to my father and Mr. Terza that the Penguins had won the Stanley Cup! Dear Lord! How people where not rioting in the streets was beyond me. My dad looked at Mr. Terza, then to me, and said, “That’s good.” \r\n\r\nAt that moment, I knew two things: Mario’s magic had not yet charmed everyone in Pennsylvania, and my father was without a soul.\r\n\r\nThe Penguins tore through the NHL, with star players like Ron Francis, Jaromir Jagr, Kevin Stevens, Rick Tocchet, and Larry Murphy providing Mario with the supporting cast he never had. But in early 1993, it all came crashing down. Even the best hockey player in the world was not immune to the most sobering trials and tribulations life had to offer. Lemieux announced he had Hodgkin’s lymphoma and underwent immediate chemotherapy. And on the day of his last treatment, Mario played a game in the most unholy of unholy hockey cities… Philadelphia. \r\n\r\nOf course the notoriously classless Philly fans booed Mario, right? No, not at all. They gave him a standing ovation. Damn them. If they would of booed the greatest, my hate could be pure; but now I have to give them a pat on the back and put words together that should never be spoken: Philadelphia was pretty classy that day.\r\n\r\nConstant back trouble and his ongoing cancer recovery forced Mario into retirement in 1997. His last game was played before a sellout crowd in the Philadelphia Spectrum, and he received another standing ovation. Damn it.\r\n\r\nA few months after retirement, Mario was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, becoming the ninth player in history to have the mandatory three-year waiting period waived.\r\n\r\nHowever, in my opinion, what shot Mario into the stratosphere of legend is what happened next.\r\nDuring the early ‘90s, the Pens were grossly mismanaged. Money was simply thrown at talent. Those free-spending ways brought two Stanley Cups but left the franchise over $90 million in debt. Some high-priced stars, including Mario, were asked to defer their salaries to help keep the team afloat. Dumping other high-profile players attempted to stop the bleeding, but the ploy ultimately backfired. In 1998, the Pittsburgh Penguins declared bankruptcy. \r\n\r\nIn an unprecedented move, Lemieux, who was owed more than $30 million dollars by the Pens, proposed he recover this money by converting it into equity and buying the franchise. He also promised to keep the team in Pittsburgh. Lemieux later said he would have put in a bid even if he had not been owed the deferred salary. The NHL's Board of Governors approved his application for ownership on September 1, 1999. This made the then-retired star the first former NHL player to become majority owner of his former team. Lemieux assumed the position of Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer of the Pittsburgh Penguins.\r\n\r\nIn what many Pittsburghers describe as one of the most electrifying and unbelievable moments ever, Mario returned to the NHL ice on December 27, 2000. Mario would play the dual role of star forward and owner, a unique position to say the least. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to the timing of the comeback, Mario would have to wear my most hated Penguins jersey, the one often referred to as the “pajama jersey.” Get on your Google machine and look it up. Make sure and have a punching pillow and barf bag ready.\r\nLuckily, this fashion disaster did not tarnish his career.\r\n\r\nOne would think this is all one man can do for a sports team and a city. If you think that, then you must not know Lemieux.\r\n\r\nBy 2004, the NHL entered a lockout, which threatened to end the Penguins and severely damage the league. Rumors surfaced the team was in danger of moving again, this time to Kansas City. I remember the subsequent fire sale of Pens gear in Pittsburgh, which is when I was able to pick up my first authentic Lemieux jersey at a reasonable price. I was of course happy to finally own an authentic jersey, but it made me think the team was finally a goner. And what a horrible feeling it was.\r\n\r\nEnter Sidney Crosby. Somehow, someway, the Pens won the draft lottery in the resurrected 2005 NHL and snagged the most highly touted hockey player in history. Mario graciously opened his home to the18-year-old Crosby. The Kansas City deal was off. Mario did visit Kansas City, but he later said the trip was only to scare Pittsburgh officials into a new arena deal and lease with the team. It worked. Mario’s management tactics and leadership where crucial in obtaining funds for what would be the Consol Energy Center and a 30-year lease between the team and the city. Mario would play one year with Sid the Kid before retiring for the second and final time. \r\nHe has now saved the Pittsburgh Penguins from demise three different times in 20 years. Beat that, Wayne.\r\n\r\nOn June 12th, 2009, Lemieux won his third Stanley Cup, this time as an owner. \r\n\r\nThis French-Canadian has truly carried Pittsburgh on his back.\r\n\r\n* This design is printed on Anvil ring spun cotton tees.

The ink color was specifically mixed to match the original team colors as close as possible, and the premium tee used was also chosen to best represent the original jersey color. \r\n\r\nA brief history of the Pittsburgh Athletic Club:\r\n\r\nThe Pittsburgh Athletic Club (PAC) existed as a member of the Pittsburgh Hockey League (or the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League, as it was later known) from 1895-1904, and then again from 1907-1909. It holds a place as one of the earliest professional ice hockey teams in history.  \r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1895, hockey was introduced to the city of Pittsburgh, and the city introduced artificial ice making to the North America. The Schenley Park Casino fashioned the first artificial ice making plant, and hosted the opening game of the “Great International Hockey and Polo Tournament”, which featured a group of local players from Western University & Pittsburgh Catholic College of the Holy Ghost (now known as the University of Pittsburgh & Duquesne University) against Queens University. Records indicate no account of the final score, but do note more than 2,500 fans attended the game at Schenley Park, and Queens U outplaying the virgin Pittsburghers, who had never played an official hockey contest.\r\nAfter witnessing the energetic fan fare of this contest, the Casino’s management decided to organize a league at the rink, built specifically for amateurs. Organizers named the league the “Pittsburgh Hockey League”, but soon changed to the “Western Pennsylvania Hockey League” (WPHL). They constructed 4 teams, and set the first season for 1896 through 1897. \r\n\r\n1896-1897 Western Pennsylvania Hockey League teams:\r\n\r\n•\tPittsburgh Athletic Club\r\n•\tDuquesne Country & Athletic Club\r\n•\tWestern University of Pennsylvania\r\n•\tPittsburgh (the ‘Casino’ team)\r\n\r\nThe league would play their games in the Schenley Park Casino Tuesday and Friday nights, and threw its first “big league” championship game on November 17, 1896. Played between Duquesne County & Athletic Club and the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, Duquesne coming away with a 2-1 victory and the championship. The success of the league was short lived, since the Casino would catch fire on December 1896, destroying not only the only ice hockey rink in Pittsburgh, but also the equipment of all 4 teams, and the league along with it.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the WPHL and the Pittsburgh Athletic Club would soon experience a revival due the construction of an artificial ice rink at Duquesne Gardens, and the PAC were able to enter a second official season January 24, 1899. The Pittsburgh Athletic Club proved to be the superior team in not only this season, by also the following, capturing the “$500 Trophy” in 1900 and 1901. \r\n\r\nThe 1901-02 season was an important time for WPHL, and Pittsburgh hockey as a whole. This is the first time in history that Pittsburgh was recognized as having professional hockey teams. To meet the expectations of a pro hockey franchise, the PAC filled their team with players from Canada, luring them with the promises of high-paid entertainment and $30 a week cash incentives. The WPHL and its teams lasted until the end of the 1903-04 season. In the end, the league scavenged its best players to field one team named the “Pittsburgh Professionals”. This team of Pittsburgh all-starts would play in the International Professional Hockey League.\r\n\r\nFor the third and final time, the WPHL, as well as the Pittsburgh Athletic Club would be revived for the 1907-08 season. The PAC were able to attract top Canadian talent, while the other teams in the league found it difficult to attract these Canadian stars with the novelty salaries of the past, since professional hockey had spread into Canada. What mainly attracted players to sign were the games played on Duquesne Gardens’ artificial ice, which was not dependant on cold weather to provide a naturally frozen surface. However, as winter began and Canadian rinks became available, the players would flock north to teams closer to their homes. Due to this and other growing pains of an emerging sport, the WPHL and Pittsburgh Athletic Club disbanded after the 1908-09 season. \r\n\r\nAs we know, this would not be the end of pro Pittsburgh hockey, merely the historic beginning…\r\n\r\n* This design is printed on an American Apparel fleece hoodie.","options":[{"id":47170467,"name":"SMALL","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47170470,"name":"MEDIUM","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47170473,"name":"LARGE","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47170476,"name":"XL","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47170479,"name":"2XL","price":47.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":7.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":17.0,"amount_with_others":12.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126862272/-/Pitt_Athletic_Club_Hoodie_FRONT.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126862272/-/Pitt_Athletic_Club_Hoodie_FRONT.png","width":890,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126862257/-/Pitt_Athletic_Club_Hoodie_BACK.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126862257/-/Pitt_Athletic_Club_Hoodie_BACK.png","width":882,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126862548/-/Pitt_Athletic_Club_Hoodie_PERSPECTIVE.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126862548/-/Pitt_Athletic_Club_Hoodie_PERSPECTIVE.png","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126861348/-/Pitt_Athletic_Club_Hoodie_CLOSE_BACK.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126861348/-/Pitt_Athletic_Club_Hoodie_CLOSE_BACK.png","width":658,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2049454,"name":"Pittsburgh Olde Time Hockey Project","permalink":"pittsburgh-olde-time-hockey-project","url":"/category/pittsburgh-olde-time-hockey-project"},{"id":1655305,"name":"Jackets & Long Sleeves","permalink":"jackets-long-sleeves","url":"/category/jackets-long-sleeves"}]},{"id":3636250,"name":"Pittsburgh Athletic Club custom 1901 hockey tee by Backpage Press","permalink":"pittsburgh-keystones-custom-1901-hockey-tee-by-backpage-press","position":6,"price":25.5,"default_price":25.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pittsburgh-keystones-custom-1901-hockey-tee-by-backpage-press","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-04-22T01:18:13.000Z","description":"Pittsburgh has been in the American hockey forefront way before the Penguins moved into the Civic Arena in 1967.

An incredible amount of effort was put into recreating each design from hand, using vintage team photos as references.

The ink color was specifically mixed to match the original team colors as close as possible, and the premium tee used was also chosen to best represent the original jersey color. \r\n\r\nA brief history of the Pittsburgh Athletic Club:\r\n\r\nThe Pittsburgh Athletic Club (PAC) existed as a member of the Pittsburgh Hockey League (or the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League, as it was later known) from 1895-1904, and then again from 1907-1909. It holds a place as one of the earliest professional ice hockey teams in history.  \r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1895, hockey was introduced to the city of Pittsburgh, and the city introduced artificial ice making to the North America. The Schenley Park Casino fashioned the first artificial ice making plant, and hosted the opening game of the “Great International Hockey and Polo Tournament”, which featured a group of local players from Western University & Pittsburgh Catholic College of the Holy Ghost (now known as the University of Pittsburgh & Duquesne University) against Queens University. Records indicate no account of the final score, but do note more than 2,500 fans attended the game at Schenley Park, and Queens U outplaying the virgin Pittsburghers, who had never played an official hockey contest.\r\nAfter witnessing the energetic fan fare of this contest, the Casino’s management decided to organize a league at the rink, built specifically for amateurs. Organizers named the league the “Pittsburgh Hockey League”, but soon changed to the “Western Pennsylvania Hockey League” (WPHL). They constructed 4 teams, and set the first season for 1896 through 1897. \r\n\r\n1896-1897 Western Pennsylvania Hockey League teams:\r\n\r\n•\tPittsburgh Athletic Club\r\n•\tDuquesne Country & Athletic Club\r\n•\tWestern University of Pennsylvania\r\n•\tPittsburgh (the ‘Casino’ team)\r\n\r\nThe league would play their games in the Schenley Park Casino Tuesday and Friday nights, and threw its first “big league” championship game on November 17, 1896. Played between Duquesne County & Athletic Club and the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, Duquesne coming away with a 2-1 victory and the championship. The success of the league was short lived, since the Casino would catch fire on December 1896, destroying not only the only ice hockey rink in Pittsburgh, but also the equipment of all 4 teams, and the league along with it.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the WPHL and the Pittsburgh Athletic Club would soon experience a revival due the construction of an artificial ice rink at Duquesne Gardens, and the PAC were able to enter a second official season January 24, 1899.

An incredible amount of effort was put into recreating each design from hand, using vintage team photos as references. The prints are done meticulously; as to not disappoint passionate, detail obsessed fans, nor myself, often the worst critic. \r\n\r\nThe Hornets, originally a minor-league team for the NHL's Detroit Red Wings, made their debut in the International-American Hockey League in 1936-37. This Hornets tee is a combo of the original ‘36-‘37 Hornets uniforms, and the sleeve patch on the ‘48 uni’s. Both team logos where hand-drawn from photos of the original jerseys. The imperfections of non-computerized artwork are there, but I believe it adds to a tee that is made to look like a throwback. The ink has been specially mixed to both replicate the colors of the original jerseys, and also to coordinate with the color and style of the shirt chosen for the tee. \r\n\r\nHere’s a brief history of the Pittsburgh Hornets:\r\n\r\nThe franchise that would become the Pittsburgh Hornets started play in 1927, playing their first nine seasons as the Detroit Olympics. Then on October 4, 1936, after winning the IHL championship, the Olympics moved to Pittsburgh to become the Hornets. \r\n\r\nJohn Harris, a Pittsburgh theatre chain owner, purchased the Detroit Olympics in October of 1936 and renamed the team the Pittsburgh Hornets. Contrary to popular belief, the Pittsburgh Hornets did not evolve from the International Hockey League's Pittsburgh Shamrocks. Bill Anderson and Bill Hudson were the only two players from the Shamrocks to be on the Hornets roster at the start of the 1936–37 season. That year, the Hornets wore wool jerseys that were likely recycled from the Olympics (front print of this tee).\r\nThe Hornets were in originally in the Canadian Professional Hockey League, which was renamed the International American Hockey League in 1929.\r\nThe Hornets actually lived several lives in Pittsburgh. The first Hornets’ team ended after the 1955–56 season. On March 31, 1956, The Hornets played their final game at the Duquesne Gardens. The original Hornets franchise was suspended for five years because Pittsburgh’s urban renewal project, Renaissance I, called for The Gardens to be torn down. The Gardens would be replaced as the home rink of the city's pro hockey team as construction of the Pittsburgh Civic Arena began in 1958, three miles to the west of the Gardens. At that time, due to all these variables in the city of Pittsburgh, the city of Rochester, New York was awarded a franchise, becoming the Rochester Americans.\r\n\r\nThe Hornets reappeared in the new Civic Arena in 1961 and, after a poor start, they became AHL contenders again. They won a division title in 1964, won the Calder Cup in 1967, which would be their third, then vanished for good. The second Hornets ceased operations on April 30, 1967, when the expansion Pittsburgh Penguins played their first season in the National Hockey League. This AHL franchise had to be terminated in order to make room for the bigger NHL.\r\nRegardless of the bad news, the Hornets would go out with a bang. On April 30, 1967, they finished the sweep of Rochester Americans in the Calder Cup Finals after Billy Harris scored :26 seconds into overtime in what would be the last goal in Pittsburgh Hornets’ history. Thirty-one years after the Hornets first game, Coach Baz Bastien was presented with the Calder Cup. The Hornets were Calder Cup Champions one last time.\r\n\r\n\r\n*This design is printed on Anvil's premium charcoal heather Independence Red \"Sustainable\" tee's.

An incredible amount of effort was put into recreating each design from hand, using vintage team photos as references. The prints are done meticulously; as to not disappoint passionate, detail obsessed fans, nor myself, often the worst critic. \r\n\r\nThe Shamrocks lasted only on short season, from ’36-’37. That being said, finding reference points to recreate the logo were few and far between. I was able to find a team photo, as well as a photo of an original jersey to reference, and re-drew the simple front print by hand. Much like the Hornet’s tee, there are subtle imperfections in the print of this tee, which I feel adds to the quality when recreating a logo from 1936.  The “shamrock” in particular was left looking imperfect to replicate the actual sewn-on patch that dawned the actual jersey. Ink was specially mixed to match the age of the jersey, original team colors, and contrast with the shirt that was picked for this tee.\r\n\r\nA brief history of the Pittsburgh Shamrocks:\r\n\r\nAs stated above, the Pittsburgh Shamrocks lasting one season, from 1936-37, playing in the International Hockey League. The Shamrocks played all of their home games at the Duquesne Gardens. During that lone season, the team finished in fourth place in the West Division behind the Detroit Olympics, Cleveland Falcons and Windsor Bulldogs. It’s estimated that the team lost $36,000 during 1936–36 season, which seams like an ungodly amount for the time.\r\nThe Shamrocks were coached by Sprague Cleghorn who was regarded as one of the dirtiest players in the National Hockey League. For nine of the NHL's first ten years, Cleghorn led the NHL in penalty minutes. He won the Stanley Cup twice with the Ottawa Senators in 1920 and 1921, and one with the Montreal Canadiens in 1924. Prior to the formation of the Shamrocks, the Cleghorn family was already embedded in the history of Pittsburgh hockey. Cleghorn's brother, Odie, was the head coach of the Pittsburgh Pirates when they became the city's first NHL team in 1925. Harold Darragh and Gordon Fraser also played in the NHL with the Pirates.\r\nRookies Jean and Conrad Bourcier also made local history by becoming the first siblings to play professional hockey on the same Pittsburgh team when they joined the Shamrocks in late January.\r\n\r\nAs stated in the Hornets write up, contrary to local legend, the Shamrocks did not evolve into the Pittsburgh Hornets. In 1936, the Detroit Olympics moved to Pittsburgh to become the Hornets. Players were merged with the existing Olympics from the Yellow Jackets and the Shamrocks. Only two players from the Shamrocks, Bill Anderson and Bill Hudson, were on the Hornets roster to start the 1936-37 season.\r\n\r\n* This tee is printed on American Apparel 100% Organic Fine Jersey cotton tees. These tees are made to be the softest, smoothest, best-looking organic cotton tee available, anywhere.

They evolved from amateur to semi-pro and are one the earliest organized teams in Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nThe Yellow Jackets won the USAHA Championship in 1924 and 1925 and were coached by Dick Carroll, who earlier won a Stanley Cup coaching The Toronto Arenas in 1918.\r\n\r\nThe Yellow Jackets wore black and gold uniforms and played in the Duquesne Gardens (1895) in the city's Oakland neighborhood. The Gardens was credited with being the finest indoor, artificial ice surface in North America.\r\n\r\nThe Yellow Jackets were owned by Roy Schooley who sold the team to attorney James F. Callahan. Callahan changed the team's name to the Pittsburgh Pirates, borrowing the nickname from Pittsburgh's professional baseball team.\r\nThe Pirates would become the NHL's third U.S.-based team on November 7, 1925 in joining the New York Americans and the Boston Bruins.\r\n\r\nThe Yellow Jackets returned to Pittsburgh in 1930 after Schooley re-acquired the IAHL team. They were later purchased by Pittsburgh theatre chain owner, John Harris, in 1932. Harris purchased the Detroit Olympics in October 1936 and renamed the team the Pittsburgh Hornets.

We had the Yellow Jackets, the Pirates (yes, at one time the hockey franchise where also named the Pirates), the Shamrocks, the Hornets, and then the Penguins. Pittsburgh hockey can be dated as far back as 1895. Take that Canada. \r\n\r\nThis shirt was made in celebration of the history of Pittsburgh hockey. As we welcome in our brand new arena, make sure you know your hockey history. \r\n\r\n...a brief Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets history:\r\n\r\nThe Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets, of the United States Amateur Hockey Association (USAHA) were formed in 1915. They evolved from amateur to semi-pro and are one the earliest organized teams in Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nThe Yellow Jackets won the USAHA Championship in 1924 and 1925 and were coached by Dick Carroll, who earlier won a Stanley Cup coaching The Toronto Arenas in 1918.\r\n\r\nThe Yellow Jackets wore black and gold uniforms and played in the Duquesne Gardens (1895) in the city's Oakland neighborhood. The Gardens was credited with being the finest indoor, artificial ice surface in North America.\r\n\r\nThe Yellow Jackets were owned by Roy Schooley who sold the team to attorney James F. Callahan. Callahan changed the team's name to the Pittsburgh Pirates, borrowing the nickname from Pittsburgh's professional baseball team.\r\nThe Pirates would become the NHL's third U.S.-based team on November 7, 1925 in joining the New York Americans and the Boston Bruins.\r\n\r\nThe Yellow Jackets returned to Pittsburgh in 1930 after Schooley re-acquired the IAHL team. They were later purchased by Pittsburgh theatre chain owner, John Harris, in 1932. Harris purchased the Detroit Olympics in October 1936 and renamed the team the Pittsburgh Hornets. The Hornets were in originally in the International American Hockey League.\r\n\r\n* The \"Yellow Jackets\" design is printed on ultra soft \"Flex Fleece\" American Apparel unisex zip-up hoodies (9 oz 50% poly/50% cotton fleece, hood with contrast drawcord and zipper, kangaroo pockets, matching rib waistband and cuff). This color is called Peppered Grey. The hoodies are slim fit, very comfortable, not to heavy, not too light. It's really a unique hoodie. \r\n\r\n* XS-M fits women great.\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":10007157,"name":"XL","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10007159,"name":"LARGE","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10007161,"name":"MEDIUM","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10007163,"name":"SMALL","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10007165,"name":"X SMALL","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":2.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":5.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87976418/-/BP_Yellow_Jackets_Hoodie_FRONT.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87976418/-/BP_Yellow_Jackets_Hoodie_FRONT.png","width":835,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87971942/-/BP_Yellow_Jackets_Hoodie_BACK.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87971942/-/BP_Yellow_Jackets_Hoodie_BACK.png","width":739,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2049454,"name":"Pittsburgh Olde Time Hockey Project","permalink":"pittsburgh-olde-time-hockey-project","url":"/category/pittsburgh-olde-time-hockey-project"},{"id":1655305,"name":"Jackets & Long Sleeves","permalink":"jackets-long-sleeves","url":"/category/jackets-long-sleeves"}]},{"id":8463276,"name":"Pittsburgh Pirates NHL custom 1925 hockey long sleeve tee","permalink":"pittsburgh-pirates-nhl-custom-1925-hockey-long-sleeve-tee","position":11,"price":28.0,"default_price":28.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pittsburgh-pirates-nhl-custom-1925-hockey-long-sleeve-tee","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-10T03:34:07.000Z","description":"* Available for pre order\r\n\r\nPittsburgh has been in the American hockey forefront way before the Penguins moved into the Civic Arena in 1967. We had the Keystones, the Yellow Jackets, the, the Shamrocks, the Hornets, and then the Penguins. Pittsburgh hockey can be dated as far back as 1895. Take Pirates that Canada.\r\n\r\nAs a passionate fan of Pittsburgh hockey, a sports history enthusiast, and an artist, it was extremely fulfilling to recreate and print the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets tee. Customers who bought the tee where equally passionate, and turned into email pen pals. Ideas where tossed around to recreate a set of classic Pittsburgh hockey shirts. I realized that all the logos would have to be recreated by hand since only photos of the logos existed, and many of the jerseys had little nuances such as stripes and sleeve logos that would be a crime if not included on the print. I also realized that this would take an incredible amount of time, and skill. I didn’t know if I would ever have the time to devote to making 4 classic tees from the ground up…and then I broke my ankle.\r\n\r\nThese shirts were made in celebration of Pittsburgh hockey and it’s illustrious, and often overlooked, history. An incredible amount of effort was put into each design and print so passionate fans will not be disappointed, nor myself, often the worst critic. \r\n\r\nThis Pirates tee is made to replicate the 1925-26 jerseys. I decided not the keep the Pirates script logo that appears on top of the original wool jerseys, and went with only the simpler “striped P” logo for this tee, just for aesthetic purposes. The front print was recreated on Photoshop to aid in keeping the straight lines and edges. It should be noted that this front print is not the same as the square logo that you will find on image searches for the NHL Pirates. The square logo has different intersecting lines than the original Pirates NHL jerseys, and the \"P\" is not slightly slanted. The front print on this tee replicates the original Pirate’s jerseys. On the right sleeve, a version of the Pittsbugh city crest was recreated from pictures of the original Pirates jerseys. \r\n The gold it was specially mixed to replicate the team colors at that time, and to contrast best with the style of tee picked for this design.\r\n\r\nA brief history of the NHL Pittsburgh Pirates:\r\n\r\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates played their first NHL game on December 2, 1925 in which fans paid $1.00 to see them lose to the New York Americans at The Gardens. The Pirates where the 3rd American franchise in the NHL, and the 7th team overall, coming into the league in 1925, and ceasing operations in 1930. Obviously, the nickname comes from the successful baseball team that had been around for over 25 years at that time. The NHL Pirates are actually the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets that were renamed the Pirates after changing ownership in 1925. The new owner, James F. Callahan cashed in a favor from then MLB Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss to have the right to name his hockey franchise identical to the local ball team. Unfortuantly, Pittsburghers missed having all 3 pro teams named the Pirates by 3 years since the NHL Pirates folded in ’30, and the NFL Pirates (Steelers) where formed in ’33.\r\n\r\nAn equally interesting fact in Pittsburgh hockey history is that the NHL Pirates where the 1st team to don the black and gold colors in the city, basing the scheme around the Flag of Pittsburgh. In a 1925 Pittsburgh newspaper article, the writer refers to the Pirates as \"the Black and Gold\". The MLB Pirates wore the popular color scheme of the time, which was red, white, and blue. The black and gold uniformed Steelers would come into the league 3 years after the hockey Pirates folded in ’30. The National League Pirates were actually the 3rd and final team to wear black and gold, changing in ’48.\r\nIn one of my favorite black and gold facts, the Penguins actually used the long defunct NHL Pirates as an example of a team other than the Boston Bruins to wear the black and gold, after the B’s petitioned the league over Pittsburgh’s jersey color change in 1980. The Pen’s were struggling, and were in danger of losing the franchise when they decided to change the two-tone blue jerseys to black and gold to match the dual-champion ’79 Steelers and MLB Pirates. Creating some sort of alliance with championship teams would hopefully drum up fan support. The NHL allowed the Penguins to change their colors as a result of the Pirates using these colors 50 years prior while playing in the same league as the Bruins. As a result, our fair city is the only one in America to dress all of their major sports teams in the same color scheme. \r\nNote: It turns out that colors don’t make a team successful, but Mario Lemieux does.\r\n\r\nThe Pirates joined the NHL and were assigned to, what would later be called, the NHL's American Division with the Boston Bruins and the New York Americans. The Duquesne Gardens, located in Oakland, served as the team's home arena. The Pirates, dubbed the \"Mighty Steel City Sextet\" in the Pittsburgh Press, were mostly leftovers from the former Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets. Ten former Yellow Jacket players would play for the Pirates.\r\nFor reasons I can’t find exact reasoning behind, the team switched to black and orange uniforms for their fifth and what would be their final season. Baffling and appalling to Pittsburghers, this will answer and age old hockey question…why do the Philly Flyers play with black and orange uniforms? This fact came to be because in five seasons, the Pirates were above .500 and made the playoffs only twice. So, on October 18, 1930 at the NHL Governors meeting, Pirates owner Benny Leonard moved the team to the other side of Pennsylvania and renamed them the Philadelphia Quakers. Leonard's ultimate intention was to return the team to Pittsburgh as soon as a new arena was built. Thirteen players from the Pirates were transferred to the Philadelphia Quakers after Pittsburgh franchise relocated.\r\nThe Quakers had a wretched season in 1930–31. The team then received permission from the NHL on September 26, 1931 to temporally cease operations as they sought a permanent arena in either Pittsburgh or Philadelphia.\r\nMeanwhile The Great Depression would devastate the NHL as 4 teams were forced to fold, leaving behind just six teams. When a new Pittsburgh arena failed to materialize, Leonard surrendered his franchise in 1936. As it turned out, a new arena in Pittsburgh wouldn't be built until the Pittsburgh Civic Arena opened in 1961. The NHL would play with six teams for 25 years before deciding to expand. The expansion in 1967 brought the Pittsburgh Penguins to the NHL and the city of Pittsburgh and the orange and black uniformed Philadelphia Flyers to Philadelphia. \r\n\r\n* This version of the \"Pirates 1925 NHL\" tee is printed on premium black American Apparel ring spun cotton long sleeve tees.

The Jets won consecutive EHL championships in 1951–52 and 1952–53.\r\nThe Jets would join the International Hockey League (IHL), Eastern Hockey League (EHL), and the North American Hockey League (NAHL) before they closed up shop. After joining the new NAHL in 1973, Dick Roberge coached Johnstown to the Lockhart Cup championship 1974–75. \r\nFor me, the most notable part of that season's playoff run included the Carlson brothers, Jeff, Jack and Steve, who became the basis for the Hanson Brothers in the movie Slap Shot. Jeff and Steve Carlson portrayed their fictional selves in the movie, while former Jet Dave Hanson portrayed Jack. The Jets played four seasons total in the NAHL before the league folded in 1977. The team itself folded in the offseason, when the Johnstown flood of 1977 that damaged the arena's ice making equipment.\r\n\r\nJohnstown hockey didn’t stop there…\r\nIn 1988, Johnstown was granted another hockey franchise, which would play in the All-American Hockey League, and ultimately the East Coast Hockey League. The owners originally wanted to name the team the Jets in honor of a team that had played in Johnstown from 1950 to 1977. However, the old Jets' former owners still held the trademark for the name and refused to allow the new team to use it. Fortunately, they had a second choice. A contest was held by the owners, allowing the people of Johnstown to vote for the new team name. Since the now cult hockey movie Slap Shot had been filmed in Johnstown, used the War Memorial Arena for most of the films hockey scenes, and featured a minor league team called the Charlestown Chiefs, the fans readily jumped on the tie-in, and the Johnstown Chiefs were born. It should be noted that the great Paul Newman had said in many interviews that filming Slap Shot in Johnstown was one of the best times of his life.\r\nThis shirt was made to celebrate the 60 years of Johnstown hockey. Unfortunately, Johnstown lost the Chiefs franchise to Greenville, SC after a long, bitter battle between the fans and ownership. Johnstown retained ownership of the name and records, so if a new franchise is awarded, they can be used.\r\nThis Jets logo was the last one used by the team before the 1977 Johnstown flood, which ultimately killed the team.\r\nBRING HOCKEY BACK TO JOHNSTOWN.\r\n\r\n* This design is printed on Anvil ring spun cotton tees.

And who is the Blood Brother?”</h3> \r\n<br />\r\n\r\nWell, it's complicated, and feel free to read the whole stories on each of their products pages. But in short, these designs, shirts, and fundraising efforts have to do with two families that are heavily involved with my life, and my business. My friend Steve, little brother of my best friend and brother in law, directed a documentary that won the top awards at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. Around 2 years prior, he and his producer asked me to design a logo for a film that he was working on in India. I did, and produced around 60 tees. We liked the tee so much, we listed the tee in the store. It worked well in my portfolio, and we agreed to give the profits to a source to be named later. 24 months later, \"Blood Brother\" went to Park City and won over everyone's heart.\r\n\r\nSales of the tee started to rise, and it felt appropriate to start finding a place to send some of the profits. What better way to pay tribute to my friend Steve, his film making friends Rocky & Danny, and the children of India infected with HIV and the AIDS virus, than to give to the charity partnered with \"Blood Brother\", LIGHT, located at givethemlight.org.\r\n\r\nSeveral months later, I was busy combining my love of the absurd with a tee design I promised friend of the business, Brandon Dameshek. See, Brandon's cousin Dave Dameshek has been a friend of the shop since almost it's inception. Dave is a podcast veteran, on which he spins yarns about Pittsburgh sports, food, and Star Wars. I used to listen to Dave's shows constantly while screen printing, and one day decided to contact him. Through that, we started trading t shirts for on-air plugs. It's one of the only times in my life where an on-air personality became an actual friend. Together we have made over a dozen \"Dameshek-related\" tee designs. I was convinced that this \"Cobra\" one would only sell 3 units life-time and prove that it's sole role was to make me laugh, until I received this note from Brandon the other day:\r\n\r\nJuly of 2013, my then 9-year-old niece, Emilia, left basketball practice complaining of a pain in her leg. Incredibly, that \"pain\" turned into a rare form of cancer called Ewing's Sarcoma, of which only 250 cases are diagnosed in the U.S. per year. Now 10 years old, Em has been through several rounds of chemotherapy, as well as a difficult and pain-inducing surgery that resulted in her having part of her hip replaced, as well as a steel rod inserted in her leg. She's lost her hair, as well as a good portion of her youth. What she hasn't lost is her smile, her spirit, and her heart. If you want to get involved, please visit <a href=\"http://www.helpinghands4emilia.blogspot.com/\">Helping Hands 4 Emilia</a> where you can not only contribute directly to Emilia's family, but get involved with numerous, locally-organized fundraisers to support Emilia and cancer research.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I read that, it was decided to re-purpose the pink color Cobra tee that was made as a goof, and give proceeds from the sales to Emilia's cancer fund. Pretty ironic, huh?\r\n\r\nSo, that's what this is all about. Before I started Backpage Press, I helped kids for a profession. There is no reason I have to give that up now that my art pays the bills.\r\n\r\nPlease help us give to the fight against childhood Cancer and AIDS, both in this country and around the world. Watch the \"Blood Brother\" documentary my friend Steve made. It will change your life. Help the doctors save Emilia's life, and those of other little one's like her. Do this by donating to both LITE & Helping Hands..and get a cool shirt for your troubles.","options":[{"id":47069985,"name":"SMALL \"Cancer Fighting Cobra\"","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47069988,"name":"MEDIUM \"Cancer Fighting Cobra\"","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47069991,"name":"LARGE \"Cancer Fighting Cobra\"","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47069994,"name":"XL \"Cancer Fighting Cobra\"","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47069997,"name":"2XL \"Cancer Fighting Cobra\"","price":21.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":47070000,"name":"3XL \"Cancer Fighting Cobra\"","price":23.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":47093361,"name":"Small \"Blood Brother\"","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47093364,"name":"Medium \"Blood Brother\"","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47093367,"name":"Large \"Blood Brother'","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47093370,"name":"XL \"Blood Brother\"","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47093376,"name":"2XL \"Blood Brother\"","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47093373,"name":"3XL \"Blood Brother","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":2.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":5.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126801711/-/Blood_Brother___Cobra_tee_SET.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126801711/-/Blood_Brother___Cobra_tee_SET.png","width":1000,"height":707},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126788778/-/Cobra_tee_PINK.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126788778/-/Cobra_tee_PINK.png","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126788772/-/Cobra_tee_PINK_Sleeve.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126788772/-/Cobra_tee_PINK_Sleeve.png","width":1000,"height":661},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126801576/-/BP_Blood_Brother_FRONT.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126801576/-/BP_Blood_Brother_FRONT.png","width":1000,"height":905},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126801684/-/BP_Blood_Brother_BACK.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126801684/-/BP_Blood_Brother_BACK.png","width":1000,"height":906}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6556719,"name":"\"Help Us Help Kids\"","permalink":"help-us-help-kids","url":"/category/help-us-help-kids"},{"id":3269677,"name":"Dave Dameshek Collection","permalink":"dave-dameshek-collection","url":"/category/dave-dameshek-collection"}]},{"id":13807386,"name":"\"Shek Republic, COBRA Division\" tee by Backpage Press","permalink":"shek-republic-cobra-division-tee-by-backpage-press","position":16,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/shek-republic-cobra-division-tee-by-backpage-press","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-26T18:23:21.000Z","description":"<br />\r\n<h3>You may be asking yourself, \"Why does his new tee just say 'COBRA' on it?”</h3> \r\n<br />\r\nBecause this shop exists to give any and every piece of artwork the possibility to be a t-shirt. Kind of like Affirmative Action for the t-shirt world. Plus, whether it’s an actual reptile or just the word, cobras are cool.\r\n\r\nIn a less dramatic fashion, this tee was printed for a friend of the shop, Cousin Brandon Dameshek. The “Cousin Brandon” refers to the fact he is a cousin of another Backpage Press supporter, Dave Dameshek, who happens to have two Backpage tees in his honor. Years ago, Brandon asked me to create a custom tee design for his blog, “Cousin Brandon’s Mr. Hipster Blog” (cousinbrandon.wordpress.com). Not having any idea where to start, I hurried up and waited. Good thing I did because I would come to know a story, which Brandon explains below. As soon as I heard it, I knew what his tee would be. Blunt, ironic, and absurd… I could see its brutal simplicity in my head. I added the Shek Republic logo (since he is a member by birth) on the sleeve and used the same custom-mixed color on both polarizingly different tee colors (the Pink tee can be found on the \"Help Us Help Kids\" page) to push the t-shirt irony right over the edge. One can be worn by a tough guy, and one can be worn by a fancy lad, so no one goes home angry. “But, of all pastel colors, why pink?” you may ask again. Well, as legend has it, when The Ed had his very first, pre-Backpage tees made, Brandon specifically ordered a pink one. Thus, the pink “Cobra” tee was born… and it looks fabulous.\r\n\r\n<h3> “The birth of COBRA” by Brandon Dameshek</h3>\r\n\r\nAs a boy, Cousin Brandon and his older brother, Mitchell, spent countless summers in hotel rooms, bungalows and tiny homes located at various points along the Jersey Shore. Sometimes Rehoboth Beach, sometimes Wildwood, but always New Jersey. In his earliest years it was the four of them -- Brandon, Mitchell, and their parents, Fred and Jill. They'd spend whole days camped out along the shoreline, Mitchell diving fearlessly into the waves that crashed over him, Brandon cowering, terrified that the ocean might swallow him whole. He watched from the shore, playing in the sand and building architecturally-unsound castles while Mitchell body-surfed, swimming further and further out into the abyss with each passing year.\r\n\r\nBut Brandon was willing to endure his fear of the Atlantic because he knew, at some point, they'd roll up their towels, load up the beach chairs and cooler, and eventually make their way to the boardwalk. There was the promise of french fries and ice cream, of video arcades alive with pinballs popping against the glass and the sound of Tempest, Pac-Man and Joust, of Skee Balls rolling against the cement-like ramp before launching into their point-assigned compartments. There was the certainty of ducking into the \"pet shop\" where they would beg and plead with their parents to no end until walking out with their own Hermit Crabs, each of them temporarily appeased until the tiny creepers would eventually disappear or die.\r\n\r\nAnd, best of all, there were the t-shirt shops seemingly occupying every other storefront. There was the hiss of the steam as the top of the press shut down firm against the bottom flat, leaving some sort of decal or letter configuration in its wake. Each store was littered with nothing but shirts, potential designs covering every square inch of exposed space. It was a tattoo parlor for children. Each and every year the brothers knew there would be at least one trip to the t-shirt shop, where the two of them, Mitchell and Brandon, would eventually step outside and immediately wrap their thin, sand- and suntan lotion-stained bodies in their crisp new garbs.\r\n\r\nBut there was one trip -- one set of shirts -- that stands out among all others. It was the year Mitchell stepped into the sun, emerging from the cave of cheap t-shirts, and instantly pulled the white football-length t-shirt with the black sleeves over his head, proudly showing to all who passed the AC/DC logo accompanied by the front cover of Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap. And on the back? For some reason still unclear today, the nickname \"SKIPPY\" in fat, black, capital letters.\r\n\r\nBut not Brandon. Brandon opted for something sinister. Something angry and evil. Something that so hated the ocean and its relentlessness. His shirt was black, and the design even blacker. On the front, a skull with a snake crawling through the eyeholes and up around the skull's dome. On the back, one word, one name: \"COBRA.\" My god, how he loved that shirt. He wore it constantly, even long after several washings when both the decal and letters slowly, yet assuredly peeled away.\r\n\r\nSo there they stood. Two brothers, side by side, in the light cast down from New Jersey sun. Mitchell and Brandon. Skippy and Cobra. Ready to dive back beneath the Jersey Shore waves, or perhaps set the whole thing on fire.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>* The Cobra tee is printed on Pink and Army Green, AKA Olive Drab, color premium American Apparel fine jersey tees, with specially mixed Rose color ink.

I like them to be strong, resilient, violent, and full of colorful metaphors.\r\n\r\nI’ve always respected people who approach life aggressively, and I respect athletes who play with a chip on their shoulder. I like when people take their jobs seriously and complete their tasks so well they don’t need to “schmooze” or sugar coat their personalities. I like people who are strictly business.\r\n\r\nNo wonder one of my favorite football players would wear a muscle tee under his shoulder pads that read “I WASN’T HIRED FOR MY DISPOSITION.\"\r\n\r\nIn the 1980s, there were only a few bright spots for the Pittsburgh Steelers. While fans and teammates struggled with offensive players like Bubby Brister and Tim Worley, they never had to worry about the linebackers on defense. And few linebackers brightened those dark days more than Greg Lloyd, a man who was ejected from his first NFL game for punching Broncos quarterback Gary Kubiak in the face. \r\n\r\nGreg Lenard Lloyd, Sr. was born in Miami but raised in a broken home in Fort Valley, Georgia. He grew up the youngest of nine children, all abandoned by their mother when Lloyd was two. Scorned and bitter, Lloyd turned the rage into brutal play on the gridiron. Here's his explanation for one of his earliest aggressive acts:\r\n\"I'd be playing against these kids and they'd have their parents up in the stands rooting and hollering for them, and I would get very mad. I'd say to myself, 'I'm going to break your Johnny's nose.' I'd try to kill the kid and then look up in the stands at his parents. Back then, it was the best way I knew how to deal with the anger.\"\r\n\r\nThat a boy.\r\n\r\nHe played college ball at Fort Valley State before being drafted by the Steelers in 1987. A knee injury kept him from starting until ’89. His dominance on the outside of the 3-4 defense began in ’91. Lloyd was one of the first components of the rebuild that took the team to Super Bowl XXX. He finished his career with 54.5 sacks in 147 games, earning his way to 5 Pro Bowls & 1994 Defensive Player of the Year. Not bad for a 6th-round pick. \r\n\r\nIn the Three Rivers days, Pittsburghers celebrated our fearsome linebacker with a banner that hung on the second tier of the north endzone that read “AVOID LLOYD” in large block letters. The slogan served fair warning to visitors of the physical specimen that was Greg Lloyd: 6’2”, 225 lbs, with 6% body fat. He was the forefather of the “cut-up” players we see today. You only begin to appreciate his explosiveness and overall brute strength when you realize he did all of it without ACLs in either knee. Some say he dispensed illegal blows, using the helmet improperly, hitting quarterbacks late, and trying to dismember offensive players rather than simply tackling them. Many of the criticizing detractors were the ones on the receiving end of his wicked blows, like Brett Favre, who Lloyd once hit so hard the NFL fined him $12,000.\r\n\r\nLloyd was widely known as a media recluse, but when you got him to speak, it was usually good.  It didn’t matter if it was speaking out against the disrespectful kids in an autograph line or his thoughts on the conclusion of the ’95 AFC Championship game, it usually was biting, raw, and full of expletives. He took a firm stance on criticizing NFL brass when they started protecting, or better “babying,\" quarterbacks in the early ‘90s. An obvious precursor to James Harrison both visibly and audibly, Lloyd would probably have a stroke if he played in today’s NFL. \r\n\r\n\r\nToday Lloyd is a fourth-degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do and teaches in a studio outside Georgia. Even though a horrific infection to his leg in ’97 threatened his life and ended his career somewhat early (and in Carolina), he speaks of his days in Pittsburgh with reverence and respect. As a fan, I will always look to him in the same way. He helped maintain and preserve the integrity and intensity of Pittsburgh linebackers in a particularly rough time for Steelers football. \r\n\r\nI think there is no better way to conclude than with this quote:\r\n\r\n“If I have to scream, if I have to bite, spit, get a 15-yard penalty, curse somebody out, even if I have to curse out one of my coaches and it means winning, then that’s the ultimate thing. If you don’t like it, the hell with you.”\r\n-Greg Lloyd, 1991\r\n\r\n* This tee is printed with a dark grey ink.

It is widely considered one of the best films of all time and is selected for preservation in the US National Film Registry. \r\n\r\nRobet De Niro is an idol of mine. I can’t think of an actor I respect more, or whose mannerisms I've studied more, than De Niro's. The first time I watched the Godfather films, I watched them one after another on a snow day. Those nine hours changed the way I looked at movies. It was like having a filet after eating round steak my entire life…other movies were just cheap and tasteless in comparison.\r\n\r\nDe Niro, a trained method actor following in the footsteps of his idol Marlon Brando, auditioned for the roles of Sonny Corleone, Michael Corleone, Carlo Rizzi, and Paulie Gatto in “The Godfather\" before he was cast as “young Vito” in “The Godfather: Part II.\" De Niro became the first actor to win an Academy Award while speaking mainly a foreign language, in this case multiple Sicilian dialects. De Niro and Brando, who played the older Vito Corleone in the first film, are the only actors to have won Oscars portraying the same fictional character.\r\n\r\nThis print is highlighting my favorite image of De Niro, as well as all of the Godfather films, in which Vito is shooting Don Fanucci in the doorway of a New York apartment in 1920. Vito stalks the New York underworld boss to his apartment during a “festa” and shoots him dead in a darkened stairway. Vito’s revolver, wrapped with cloth for a makeshift silencer, catches fire immediately after the gun is shot. This event, and captured image, not only marks the beginning of Vito’s reign of the underworld, but also creates one of the most iconic images of American film.\r\n\r\n* This design is printed on Anvil ring spun cotton tees. These tees are incredibly soft, comfortable, and flexible. They have a sliming cut, but not enough that it throws off the sizing.

So while we wait for the nightmare to end, support the hometown team by representing one of the best era's in Pittsburgh baseball history...\r\n\r\nOn September 1, 1971, the Pirates fielded what is believed to be the first all-black lineup in the history of the league. Due to the Pirates high powered slugging offense, they were dubbed \"The Lumber Company\" or \"The Pittsburgh Lumber Company\" outside of the city. Al Oliver played first base, joining second baseman Rennie Stennett, center fielder Gene Clines, right fielder Roberto Clemente, left fielder Willie Stargell, catcher Manny Sanguillén, third baseman Dave Cash, shortstop Jackie Hernández and pitcher Dock Ellis in the starting lineup. Oliver ended the season with a .282 average, including 31 doubles (8th in the NL), seven triples (10th), 10 sacrifice flies (2nd), and five hit-by-pitches (good for 9th in the league). After beating the San Francisco Giants in the NLCS, the Pirates won the World Series, beating the Baltimore Orioles in seven games with Oliver as their regular center fielder.\r\nAbout Oliver, Willie Stargell said, \"When it came to hitting . . . all he ever did was crush the ball. Al was the perfect number three hitter because you knew he was going to make contact\". He had a 23-game hitting streak in 1974 and another streak of 21 games where he got at least one hit. \r\n\r\nThe best hitters in \"The Lumber Company\" were Al Oliver (#16), Manny Sanguillén (#35), Willie Stargell (#8) and Roberto Clemente (#21). All 4 players are represented by their numbers on this design. \r\nRobert Clemente passed away the next year, in 1972, while en route to deliver aid to earthquake victims in Nicaragua. \"Pops\" Stargell went on to be the heart and soul of the Pirates of the 70's. He lead the franchise to another World Series win in 1979. \r\n\r\nNow, isn't this a better way to look at things?\r\n\r\n* This design is printed on Anvil ring spun cotton tees. These tees are incredibly soft, comfortable, and flexible. They have a sliming cut, but not enough that it throws off the sizing.

This was the case when I drove through Pittsburgh on Monday, April 9th, 2001. I go through a Van Halen phase every other year, and ’01 was one of those years. I was listening to a mix of Roth and Van Hagar songs, which to some people is sacrilege. But I don’t play by those rules, and it was the perfect soundtrack for my trip to Opening Day… the very first regular season game ever at PNC Park. Needless to say, I was really enjoying the ride.\r\nSince the North Side was torn up due to the stadium construction projects, I was about to begin my habit of parking in the Strip District, walking through the city, and making my way across the 6th Street Bridge, which had recently been dedicated as the Clemente Bridge. Normally, the beginning of April in western PA is grey and miserable. But, on this Monday, the sun was shining and the air was a comfortable 75 degrees. I couldn't wait to see the ballpark, not to mention the new Roberto Clemente and Willie “Pops” Stargell statues. There had only ever been one statue in Pittsburgh sports history (Honus Wagner batting in front of Gate A at Three Rivers), so adding two new ones was a big deal. \r\nAs I crossed the river and approached the left field gates, I saw Pop’s statue, and it was overwhelmingly huge. The artist had captured Willie’s enormous physical and metaphorical presence at the plate. His stance was wide with his left elbow pointing straight back and an oversized bat sticking straight up in the air. I began to think of all the stories I knew about Willie: his contribution to his team and organization, the “Stargell Stars” he gave out for motivation and accomplishment, the fanfare of “We Are Family” in 1979, hitting a homer into the upper deck of Montreal's Olympic Stadium, and using a sledge hammer to warm up in the on-deck circle to intimidate the opposition (quite possibly the coolest thing ever). This last fact is what I focused on as I admired the enormity of this perfect representation.\r\nI was 15 feet from the Pop’s statue when I noticed the elaborate collage of colors that a dense ring of floral arrangements had created around Willie’s feet. I focused on a man in his 40s who was on one knee. His cheeks glistening in the sunlight from tears, he stood up and performed the sign of the cross. I remained there for several minutes, observing the emotions of my fellow fans who continued to place flowers and photos around the statue. Still looking forward, I whispered to my then-girlfriend, “I like Willie too, but crying is a bit overboard.” The man in front of me immediately turned around and stated, “He died this morning.\" \r\nMy loathing of the Pittsburgh airwaves and my obsession for Van Halen had kept me from the most important news of the day.\r\nIf we had to lose him, it was only fitting he left the world on this day. The Bucs got stomped by the Reds that afternoon, but they received their beating in the most beautiful ballpark in the league on an abnormally pleasant April day in Pittsburgh. The Pirates were nine years into their 20-year decline, but it was obvious PNC Park would be the beginning of a new age for Pirate baseball. I’m telling you, between the new ballpark and the weather, I wasn't sure I was really in Pittsburgh. It was strange for something so sad to happen on a day that was, for all intents and purposes, wonderful. But there was also something poetic about losing an iconic individual who lived and died for our city and its ball club on the dawn of a new era for Pittsburgh. Who says baseball isn’t romantic?\r\nThat day has never faded from my memory, and it likely never will. I took my time to construct this design in order to best represent the thoughts and images that flooded my mind as I approached the dedication, which quickly became a memorial, for our beloved baseball hero.\r\nWe take our statues seriously in Pittsburgh.   \r\n\r\n\r\n* This design is printed with a specially mixed plastisol ink to color match the 1971 Pirates gold caps, and duel cured for a heavy, soft, semi-gloss finish. \r\n\r\n* This design is printed on Anvil ring spun cotton tees.

I’m going to try and not rehash and rant about the pain of the Nuttings’ ownership, Francisco Cabrera, Bobby Bo’s free agency, Barry Bonds calling the team and the city racist, the fire sales starting with Aramis, Sid Bream, the grey cap in the late 90’s, Bob Walk finding a microphone, and yes, enough losing seasons that if they where among the living, they could vote. I can’t take seeing one of the earliest NL franchises, and one of the most storied, be a laughing stock anymore. So lets not talk about this crap anymore…\r\n\r\nMay we now focus on our farm grown prospects, that we have been nearly promised will not be sold for a couple middle relievers in the next several years. Among the future stars that are receiving a fair amount of recognition are Andrew McCutchen, Jose Tabata, Pedro Alvarez, and Pittsburgh born and raised Neil Walker. We finally have a young, talented, good looking bunch of young players, whom quickly worked their way up the minor league system, and might be tight enough with each other & the organization, to stay. Being five minutes from AA affiliate Altoona Curve, I was lucky enough to see 3 of these guys mature as ballplayers. \r\nMcCutchen, a native of Fort Meade, Florida, was drafted 11th overall by the Pirates in ’05. He made the first splash out of the four last season, and was an instant favorite in the city. Dynamic, explosive, and talented, he made us forget Nate McLouth & Nigel Morgan real fast, and happy that he might have been plucked from AAA Indianapolis too soon. Many expect him to make the All-Star team this year.\r\nWalker, as 2004 graduate of Pine-Richland High School in Gibsonia, PA was a standout catcher, and wider receiver on the Ram’s football team. Neil’s father, Tom Walker, was a major league pitcher for the Expos & Angels in the ‘70’s. Neil was awarded the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s “Male Athlete of the Year” twice while in high school. He was signed by the Pirates in ’04, and was invited to spring training in ’07. His Pittsburgh heritage, as well as his RBI’s, has also made him a fan favorite. He is off to an amazing start in the 2011 season. Neil makes all western and central Pennsylvanians very proud that one of our own could help save our team from the basement...no pressure, Neil.\r\n\r\nAs a Bucco fan, I can always remember being optimistic in April and May, but never hopeful and excited. This year feels different, maybe not deep into the playoffs different, but leaving behind the “laughing stock of baseball” tag different.\r\n\r\nKeep your fingers crossed, and don’t wash your socks, we could have a winner here.\r\n\r\n\r\n* This design is printed on \"Storm\" colored Anvil ring spun cotton tees.

I started literally from the ground up, working in a basement that has no business containing an industrial operation. I had $350, enough to cover a low-rent press and a box full of supplies. I had no idea what was going on other than I knew I’d love this. I never would of thought I'd wind up making a professional clothing brand.\r\n\r\nBut it all started with a stencil knife when I was 11 years old. The stencil knife felt very natural, and I rarely put it down. It helped make the artwork I find most interesting. I love monotone and simplicity, and in those years is when I found a connection to its no frills or fuss beauty. The stencil knife is an essential tool in the process of making the type of artwork I love; it is simply my most valued tool. Endless hours were spent in my childhood room stenciling photos from magazines and cutting tonal images into Contrasto Paper to practice my technique with the knife. If you look at my early artwork, and then look at Backpage Press, it all makes sense. \r\nThis design is meant to both metaphorically and specifically represent the journey I took to start this project, not just 5 years ago, but 25. \r\n\r\nThe anvil is used by a blacksmith to forge a piece of metal into shapes. After long periods of pounding, pressure, and manipulation, the end result is either functional, beautiful, or both. The process requires skill and physicality. And when working from the ground up, you’re usually subject to menial, backbreaking labor. In my case, this is not a metaphor, because I often found myself using physical strength to make my living. Many days spent digging ditches, lugging material, and swinging a sledgehammer as a construction laborer taught me how to be resilient and how to physically work hard. My willingness to do work like this opened up doors and set me apart. Without this path, I would not be willing to put in the hours of physical work it takes to run a shop, nor would I understand that it pays off. \r\n\r\nThen you have a stencil knife, a delicate instrument that requires no application of brute force or physicality. It yields just as many beneficial and useful works as the aforementioned anvil and hammer, but only more refined and precise.\r\nAll three objects, both metaphorically or realistically, have made significant impacts on my life and have led to the 5th year of doing my dream job.

These tees are incredibly soft, comfortable, and flexible, and are specifically washed and treated to look like a vintage blue tee. They have a sliming cut, but not enough that it throws off the sizing. Bottom line, these tees will be among your go-to favorite tees. \r\n","options":[{"id":30926251,"name":"SMALL","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30926254,"name":"MEDIUM","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30926257,"name":"LARGE","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30926260,"name":"XL","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30926263,"name":"2XL","price":21.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":30926266,"name":"3XL","price":23.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":30926269,"name":"4XL","price":23.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":2.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":5.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/97153159/-/BP_5_year_F_B.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/97153159/-/BP_5_year_F_B.png","width":1000,"height":744},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/97153225/-/BP_5_year_FRONT_A_.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/97153225/-/BP_5_year_FRONT_A_.png","width":1000,"height":920},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/97153147/-/BP_5_year_BACK.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/97153147/-/BP_5_year_BACK.png","width":1000,"height":874}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3102167,"name":"Backpage Press Line","permalink":"backpage-press-line","url":"/category/backpage-press-line"}]},{"id":9888790,"name":"\"The Grind\" Backpage Press 5 Year Anniversary Limited Edition long sleeve tee","permalink":"career-opportunities-5-year-anniversary-limited-edition-long-sleeve-tee-by-backpage-press","position":29,"price":28.0,"default_price":28.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/career-opportunities-5-year-anniversary-limited-edition-long-sleeve-tee-by-backpage-press","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-12T17:48:11.000Z","description":"Limited print run of 25\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 2013, Backpage Press turned 5…\r\n\r\nI spent the last five years honing a craft I was never trained to do. I started literally from the ground up, working in a basement that has no business containing an industrial operation. I had $350, enough to cover a low-rent press and a box full of supplies. I had no idea what was going on other than I knew I’d love this. I never would of thought I'd wind up making a professional clothing brand.\r\n\r\nBut it all started with a stencil knife when I was 11 years old. The stencil knife felt very natural, and I rarely put it down. It helped make the artwork I find most interesting. I love monotone and simplicity, and in those years is when I found a connection to its no frills or fuss beauty. The stencil knife is an essential tool in the process of making the type of artwork I love; it is simply my most valued tool. Endless hours were spent in my childhood room stenciling photos from magazines and cutting tonal images into Contrasto Paper to practice my technique with the knife. If you look at my early artwork, and then look at Backpage Press, it all makes sense. \r\nThis design is meant to both metaphorically and specifically represent the journey I took to start this project, not just 5 years ago, but 25. \r\n\r\nThe anvil is used by a blacksmith to forge a piece of metal into shapes. After long periods of pounding, pressure, and manipulation, the end result is either functional, beautiful, or both. The process requires skill and physicality. And when working from the ground up, you’re usually subject to menial, backbreaking labor. In my case, this is not a metaphor, because I often found myself using physical strength to make my living. Many days spent digging ditches, lugging material, and swinging a sledgehammer as a construction laborer taught me how to be resilient and how to physically work hard. My willingness to do work like this opened up doors and set me apart. Without this path, I would not be willing to put in the hours of physical work it takes to run a shop, nor would I understand that it pays off. \r\n\r\nThen you have a stencil knife, a delicate instrument that requires no application of brute force or physicality. It yields just as many beneficial and useful works as the aforementioned anvil and hammer, but only more refined and precise.\r\nAll three objects, both metaphorically or realistically, have made significant impacts on my life and have led to the 5th year of doing my dream job. When you put them together, they are both simplistic, and ironic, just like the journey it took to get here.\r\nIt’s cool to reflect, but I’m looking towards the future. This project is now a business and will continue to progress, forging and cutting its way into culture, learning from what has come before.\r\n\r\n*This design is printed with a premium plastisol ink called \"Gold Shimmer\" which gives the design's finish a flat, gold foil luster. It's very hard to show how wonderful this ink looks with photos, but you will love it when you see this product in your hands. In addition, premium American Apparel ring spun cotton long sleeve tees are used to yield the best results for this design. These tees are incredibly soft, comfortable, and flexible, and are the same as the famous American Apparel tees, but with long sleeves of course.","options":[{"id":30930712,"name":"SMALL","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30930715,"name":"MEDIUM","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30930718,"name":"LARGE","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30930721,"name":"XL","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30930724,"name":"2XL","price":29.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":30930727,"name":"3XL","price":31.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":2.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":5.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/97155487/-/BP_5_year_LS_F_B.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/97155487/-/BP_5_year_LS_F_B.png","width":974,"height":644},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/97155859/-/BP_5_year_LS_FRONT_SHARP.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/97155859/-/BP_5_year_LS_FRONT_SHARP.png","width":951,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/97155775/-/BP_5_year_LS_BACK_color_match.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/97155775/-/BP_5_year_LS_BACK_color_match.png","width":1000,"height":979}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3102167,"name":"Backpage Press Line","permalink":"backpage-press-line","url":"/category/backpage-press-line"}]},{"id":9886345,"name":"\"Mighty Mick's Boxing Gym\" tee by Backpage Press","permalink":"mighty-mick-s-boxing-gym-rocky-balboa-tee-by-backpage-press","position":30,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mighty-mick-s-boxing-gym-rocky-balboa-tee-by-backpage-press","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-12T15:40:33.000Z","description":"Most things don’t mean the same to you now as they did over 25 years ago, but the words of Mickey Godmill do. \r\n\r\nHearing Mickey yell, “You gotta eat lightin’ and crap thunda!” in the first “Rocky” makes me want to, well, eat lightning and crap thunder. If you aren’t motivated by the gravely voiced, 76-year-old boxing trainer motivating the lovably illiterate, seemingly washed up boxer, then you just aren’t American.\r\n\r\nI have come across many people, mostly ladies and people born after 1988, that have never even seen “Rocky.” I get very upset at you people, mainly because I just don’t understand you. I recently played “Rocky” for my wife, and she laughed at Rocky screaming for Adrian at the end. I was confused, insulted, and trying to figure out how I could have her arrested. I seem to put a lot more reverence in this movie than some people, but then again, the people I like most feel the same way about Rock and Mick as I do. \r\n\r\nTo make it easier for us to spot each other, I made a tee that would not only look great as we punched beef and chased chickens in between training sessions at Mighty Mick’s Boxing Gym, but also make both Burgess Meredith and Mickey Godmill proud.\r\n\r\nSo get up and buy this tee, you son of a bitch, cause Mickey loves ya.\r\n\r\n* To ensure that all customers are satisfied with the fit they want, this design will be available in two retro inspired styles. The Heather Charcoal/Navy tee is the standard fitting tee, and the Heather Navy ringer tee will be a slim, tight fitting tee. Please read below for more details of both.\r\n\r\n* The premium Heather Charcoal/Navy tee is made by Tultex brand, and offers a light, comfortable loose fit, all the while be more slimming than any the cheap, boxy styles every customer dreads and will never find at Backpage Press. Tultex offers a great look and style to their heather blend, which is why it's used for this design. Specs: 3.2 oz. 40/1 Ultra Jersey 65% polyester/ 35% cotton blend.\r\n\r\n* The ultra premium Heather Navy ringer tee is made by 213 Apparel, and new branch of American Apparel. These are retro inspired, reminding you of a tee that you have worn for years. Ultra soft, and cut just right for a great form fit. A great product if you like that premium soft jersey fabric, and a tight fit.

But, times change, and rarely, so do I. When American Apparel made a line of neon colors available this season, I found them strangely appealing. Timing was perfect because I've been pushing my mind to be more accepting of colors other than black, white, and gold...and more black. As repeat customers point out, the designs created at Backpage Press deserve more than my safe, go-to color scheme. I have reluctantly agreed, so expanding the shop's color palet became a priority. I've taken my time to explore new colors, and carefully match those new colors, creating striking and bold color combos. Making myself finally depart from the grunge era and my beloved black t shirts seemed to be an impossible task, but I'm happy to say it's been a success. Ironically, the first color's that will be released are that ones that were killed by the Seattle scene that I hold so dearly. \r\n\r\nThis is the first of many new colorways that will be seen at Backpage Press in the near future. So, here marks the brand's departure into a more vibrant and diverse world of color, and a nostalgic trip back into the early '90's. What better way to celebrate a color that I consider a guilty pleasure than by naming it after the notorious early '90's guilty pleasure...\"Saved By The Bell\". \r\n\r\nI heart Kelly Kapowski.\r\n\r\n* Printed on Neon American Apparel 50/50 cotton/poly fine jersey tees. These combines the printing benefits and comfort of cotton, and the lightweight breathability of poly. These tees are my personal favorites.

This is the flagship design for the new collection.\r\n\r\nYears ago, I started Backpage Press on my own and continue to run all aspects of the business solo. I seem to be a natural loner, but one of the great contradictions in my life is I romanticize and respect teams or any unifying idea that brings people together. This  plays heavily into my love of sports, but being a mediocre athlete doesn't keep you on many teams. Sometimes pure effort isn't even enough to keep you on the bench. Thankfully, there are always alternative ways to reach your goals, so long as you're willing to put in some creative effort. \r\n\r\nI posed this question to myself, \"Why not use art to convey these diverse, passionate interests that overwhelm your mind?\" Done right, good art and writing could unify like-minded people around the globe. Hell, there could be thousands of people out there... enough to start a mob. This is where my mentality came from, and where I would find my team.\r\n\r\nEvery design in this shop is created with passionate effort, and that's the only way to make good art. However, each one is made with the customer in mind and how you would want to show your support for the brand. Simply put, I try to make what you and I would want to wear. You are the people who validate these designs. Without you, there is no Backpage Press... it's just me without a team. \r\n\r\nThese shirts are made to look bold so people notice.  Forged with blunt, hard-edged symbolism but conveyed with elegance, the \"Mob Mentality\" line will connect people through shared loves and an appreciation for hard work and craftsmanship.\r\n\r\n*These Mob Mentality tees are printed on premium American Apparel fine jersey tees, with specially mixed pewter grey duel-cured ink, to leave a heavy semi-gloss print. These tees are incredibly soft, comfortable, and flexible, and have all of the great qualities you have come to expect from AA. Be sure to go one size up when ordering American Apparel tees if you wish to have a roomier fit.","options":[{"id":29008931,"name":"3XL Crimson w/Sledgehammer","price":23.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":29008934,"name":"2XL Crimson w/Sledgehammer","price":21.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":29008937,"name":"XL Crimson w/Sledgehammer","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29008940,"name":"LARGE Crimson w/Sledgehammer","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29008943,"name":"MEDIUM Crimson w/Sledgehammer","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29008946,"name":"SMALL Crimson w/Sledgehammer","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44328432,"name":"Small DEEP PURPLE w/SPIKED BAT","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44328435,"name":"Medium DEEP PURPLE w/SPIKED BAT","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44328438,"name":"Large DEEP PURPLE w/SPIKED BAT","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44328447,"name":"XL DEEP PURPLE w/SPIKED BAT","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44328444,"name":"2XL DEEP PURPLE w/SPIKED BAT","price":21.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":44328441,"name":"3XL DEEP PURPLE w/SPIKED BAT","price":23.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":2.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":5.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124918401/-/Mob_Mentality_tees_GROUP.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124918401/-/Mob_Mentality_tees_GROUP.png","width":1000,"height":715},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91089194/-/BP_Mob_Men_RED_FRONT.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91089194/-/BP_Mob_Men_RED_FRONT.png","width":1000,"height":963},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91089182/-/BP_Mad_Men_RED_BACK.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91089182/-/BP_Mad_Men_RED_BACK.png","width":1000,"height":927},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124918692/-/BP_Mob_Men_PURPLE_FRONT.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124918692/-/BP_Mob_Men_PURPLE_FRONT.png","width":1000,"height":960},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124918680/-/BP_Mob_Men_PURPLE_BACK.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124918680/-/BP_Mob_Men_PURPLE_BACK.png","width":1000,"height":928}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3102167,"name":"Backpage Press Line","permalink":"backpage-press-line","url":"/category/backpage-press-line"}]},{"id":3909640,"name":"\"Big Keystone\" tee by Backpage Press","permalink":"backpage-press-big-keystone-gym-class-tee","position":35,"price":24.5,"default_price":24.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/backpage-press-big-keystone-gym-class-tee","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-06-12T19:16:37.000Z","description":"Olde school. \r\n\r\n*This designis printed in custom mixed maroon ink on American Apparel's \"gym class\" tee.

Named after Herb Brooks, legendary coach of the 1980 “Miracle On Ice” US Olympic Hockey team, it can’t be a coincidence that he emulates Herb’s hard-nosed, grinding style and overall work ethic. Brooks has accumulated only 9 goals in 12 seasons, but has laid down more bone-crushing hits than one could count. Accredited with the Alternate Captain “A” on his chest in ’08, Brooks is an intrical part of the Pens defensive rise, and has a stare that makes the faint of heart wet their pants.\r\n\r\nBrooks was born in San Francisco, but matured in the hockey crazed Northeast. Attending Nichols School in Buffalo, Thayer Academy in Massachusetts, and ultimately Boston College, he won the Hockey East post-season championship in ’99 and ’01.  In the 2000 entry draft, the Pens drafted him 18th overall, and soon began his pro career in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton with the baby Pens of the AHL. Wearing the #29, Brooks made his NHL debut in the ’02-’03 season.  He of course changed that number to #44, giving the #29 to the ’03 1st overall pick.\r\n\r\nIn the ’09 playoffs, Alexander Ovechkin attempted to check Orpik. Brooks, staunch as usual, laid Ovie out, making it look like he was the one initiating the hit, as well as making Alex look like the victim of a violent crime.  One of my favorite sports photo’s ever was snapped at just the right time,  and after some artist manipulation, this tee is made in homage. \r\n\r\nYou can check out the hit right here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv3fI6WEyxg&feature=player_embedded\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, Brooks became a Stanley Cup champion, and will surely retire a Penguin. \r\n\r\nThis is the 2011 version of the design originally created in 2009. A few cosmetic changes were made, and the print is several inches bigger, but the refurbished design remains consistent with the original. The new ink used is the Vegas Gold color that the Pens switched to in ’05, replacing the traditional Gold color used in the ’80-’03 Pen’s jerseys, as well as the ink color in my original ’09 print for this design. \r\n\r\n\r\n* This design is printed on Anvil ring spun cotton tees. These tees are incredibly soft, comfortable, and flexible. They have a sliming cut, but not enough that it throws off the sizing. Bottom line, these tees will be among your go-to favorite tees. \r\nFor more detailed information, including sizing, check them out at Anvils website:\r\nhttp://www.anvilknitwear.com/Product-Catalogs/Tees/980\r\n","options":[{"id":30253425,"name":"SMALL","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30253427,"name":"MEDIUM","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30253429,"name":"LARGE","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30253431,"name":"XL","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30253433,"name":"2XL","price":19.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":30253435,"name":"3XL","price":21.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":30253437,"name":"4XL","price":21.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":2.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":5.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94992055/-/BP_Unleash_Hell_FRONT.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94992055/-/BP_Unleash_Hell_FRONT.png","width":1000,"height":963},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94992031/-/BP_Unleash_Hell_BACK.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94992031/-/BP_Unleash_Hell_BACK.png","width":1000,"height":968}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3390885,"name":"Sports","permalink":"sports","url":"/category/sports"}]},{"id":9635179,"name":"\"It's a hockey night in Pittsburgh\" Mike Lange & Civic Arena tribute tee by Backpage Press","permalink":"it-s-a-hockey-night-in-pittsburgh-mike-lange-civic-arena-tribute-tee-by-backpage-press","position":38,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/it-s-a-hockey-night-in-pittsburgh-mike-lange-civic-arena-tribute-tee-by-backpage-press","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-26T05:07:37.000Z","description":"These designs could have easily equaled multiple tees, but during the process, it became apparent that they needed to be combined. Reason being…Mike Lange and The Igloo are synonymous with Pittsburgh hockey. Both have been there since the beginning, both are still apparent in our city, but both are now somewhat in the background. They definitely compliment each other in many ways.\r\n\r\nMike Lange first came to Pittsburgh as the play-by-play broadcaster ’74, seven years after the Pens arrived in the city. The Pens struggled immensely in those early years, and by the end of the 7th season, the team was in bankruptcy, and with no guarantee of a job, Lange moved on to Washington to call soccer games. The Pens obviously survived, and Large subsequently returned in ’76, staying as the enigmatic play-by-play man for Pens radio and TV, until an unpopular move by Fox Sports in 2006. On June 29th, Fox did not exercise the option year on Lange’s contract, and stated that they would like to “go in a new direction”. The move seemed to be centered on internal spite by FSN, because of the shear senselessness of it. Lange was a cornerstone of Pens hockey, and recognized around the league as a lead figure in the world of sports broadcasting, receiving the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award for his outstanding work as an NHL broadcaster in ’01. The Pen’s radio broadcaster, John Steigerwald, took over for Mike on FSN broadcasts. Steigy was gracious in his acceptance of the job, stating, “I’m not going to try to replace him. I think he is irreplaceable.” \r\nLange begins each broadcast by stating, “It’s a hockey night in Pittsburgh”. But more recognizable is his claim to national fame, which are his post-goal expressions, which you see on the back of the shirt. It was insanely hard to pick my favorites from the plethora of cryptic and unique, yet brilliant and hilarious expressions. \r\nMike’s credits also include a major motion picture in ’95, where he appeared in the Pittsburgh/Civic Arena based, Jean-Claude Van Damme movie “Sudden Death”, playing himself. Steigerwald sat along side Mike in the booth, also playing himself. The movie was shot in and around The Igloo during the NHL strike year of ’94.\r\nStrangely, the Van Damme movie might be one of the worst movies I have ever seen, but one of my favorites just because it took place in Pittsburgh. Hell, where else can you see a drug-addled over-hyped action star fight the Pen’s mascot “Iceburgh”. I might add, Iceburgh met its demise in the conveyer dishwasher, which we all will sadly admit, is how most mascots loose their lives.\r\n\r\nThe Igloo seems to be the only name that has been consistent with the building the sits at the base of the Hill District in Pittsburgh. It was coined “The Igloo” by Pittsburghers because of it’s stainless steel domed enclosure. Names, whether they were official or not, included Civic Auditorium Amphitheater, Civic Arena, The Pittsburgh Dome, Allegheny Energy Dome, and Melon Arena. “The Igloo” was almost the official name in ’92, but stayed as simply the nickname. From opening to closing, the building was only known as the “Civic Arena” and “Melon Arena”. Opening on September 19, 1961, and closing on June 26, 2010, the Civic arena was originally built for the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera, and not hockey. The structure’s nickname also inspired the naming of the cities new NHL franchise during the great expansion of 1967. The Penguins played their first game at the Civic Arena on October 11, 1967, loosing to the Canadiens 2-1. At that time, the arena’s capacity was only 12,580, and the most expensive seat was $5.\r\nUniquely, the roof is divided into eight sections. Six of the sections could fold underneath two, in 2½ minutes, making the Civic Arena the world's first major indoor sports stadium with a retractable roof. Before moving to the Consol Energy Center in late 2010, the Pens played in the 3rd smallest arena in the NHL, only in front of Edmonton and Long Island.\r\nOn September 16, 2010, the Allegheny County Sports and Exhibition Authority voted unanimously to demolish the Civic Arena. However, on November 24, 2010, the building's demolition was delayed due to a last-minute nomination as a National Historic Landmark. On January 5, 2011, the Pittsburgh Historic Review Commission voted 5-1 in favor for preliminary approval of the arena's historic nomination status. The vote has paved the way for a formal hearing on the proposed designation on March 2, 2011. This narrative was coincidentally written on March 2nd, but no new information on the possible demo was available.\r\nIt should also be noted that Jean-Claude Van Damme saved the building, and the city of Pittsburgh, from homicidal terrorists in 1995. \r\n\r\nThese two Pittsburgh fixtures are as unique to hockey as they are to Pittsburgh. One of the first memories I have of pro hockey is hearing Mike Lange’s spot on play-by-play, as well as his post-goal expressions. You could also add that watching Mario, as well as back-to-back cups in the early 90’s, was a great way to introduce a young kid to a sport. During a time when the Pirates where unraveling, and the Steelers stunk, it was great to see the best player in the game in Pittsburgh a jersey, and Mike’s voice piped into Sports Center highlights. This all taking place under the steel roof of the Civic, which looked like nothing else that I had ever seen.

You can read more on this unique charity's cause at givethemlight.org. \r\n\r\nOver $350 has already been donated to LIGHT through the sales of this tee. Although meager on the world stage of charity contributions, it's not bad from one guy in a print shop. Every little bit helps..so help us continue to grow that number.\r\n\r\nThis is a Custom design & print made in promotion for Blood Brother, a documentary film that details Rocky Braats life and efforts in India, which won the 2013 Sundance U.S. Grand Jury Prize for US documentaries, as well as the 2013 Sundance Audience award for US documentaries. \r\n\r\nFor more info on the film, visit the official website:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bloodbrotherfilm.com/\r\n\r\nhttp://filmguide.sundance.org/film/13095/blood_brother\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bloodbrotherfilm.com/blog-post/sundance-2013-senior-programmer/\r\n\r\n* To make this tee more affordable, but not sacrifice the popular Alternative Apparel premium version, we will now be printing this design on an Anvil ring spun cotton tee, which is very similar to the color and style, without the contrast stitching of the premium version. This will save you $10, but sacrifice a bit of softness and \"vintage\" feel to the material. Those of you that would still like the Alternative Apparel \"Mickey\" tee (marked with the \"Premium\" tag in the product photos), you will find the specific option below to order it. If you are a lady, the \"Mickey\" style is highly recommended. The Blood Brother \"Mickey\" style tee will still requite a 1 week waiting period because they are custom printed to order.\r\n\r\nPlease read the product descriptions on both style tees, to make sure you are purchasing the one that will fit you the best:\r\n\r\n* The $18 version of this tee is printed on \"Silver Grey\" Anvil ring spun cotton tees.

How about your knees? Maybe you have a bum ankle and an arthritic elbow…cry me a river. I don’t hear Mark Recchi sounding like a sissy, and he’s played a sport on a sheet of ice while battling over-sized opponents with long sticks for the last 23 years. And, while doing that, he’s managed to score over 1500 points. How many points do you have? We all now need to stop our whining. \r\n\r\nPlayers like Mark are inspiring, whether you’re making a funny t shirt or not. You don’t get a moniker like “The Recchin’ Ball” without some hard work, skill, and perseverance. Many fans in Pittsburgh, Philly, and Boston refer to him with such reverence and respect due to the before mentioned qualities, as well as his small stature and hard nose style of forechecking while in the offensive zone.  This respect extends around the league. His attitude, talent, and work ethic has made him a fan favorite in Pittsburgh, Montreal, Philly, Carolina, Pittsburgh again, Atlanta, Tampa, and now, Boston. Mark was picked 67th overall in ’88 by my hometown Pens, and was instrumental in helping Pittsburgh win their first cup in ‘91, as well as his own. God only knows where that franchise would be without players like he, Trottier, Francis, Coffey, and Mario…just to name a few. Now, in Boston, Mark helps shape the talents and lives of young Bruins, just like many of the Pens did for him at age 23. \r\n\r\nI’ll never figure out how pro hockey players do it. I have followed all 4 major sports for most of my life, and I never come across players in the other 3 leagues who just keep coming back for years, and in some cases, decades, and giving more and more back to the sport. Players in the other sports succumb to their own egos, attitudes, lives leading them in different directions, their bodies break down, or the sport just passes them by. But hockey is somehow different. This gracefully brutal sport of hockey strongly rivals football in physicality. However, there are no time outs and excessive commercial breaks like today’s NFL, so one could argue that it is indeed more physical. The NFL does not allow fist-fighting, the players don’t carry possible weapons in their hands, and turf gives a little more than ice when you fall onto it. Each year, the enigma of the multi-decade tenured hockey player just makes me more enamored to the sport than I was previously. It really shows the true passion these players’ posses for the sport they love and grew up playing. We can all learn a few things about growing old with grace, and grit, from people like Billy Guerin, and Mark Recchi.\r\n\r\nOne last thing...Mark Recchi and Tyler Seguin both own this tee. Actually, Recchi has two.\r\n\r\n* This design is printed heather Blue/Grey color premium Tultex 65/45 Poly/Cotton blend tees. Light, soft, breathable, and just plain comfortable.

It is wonderfully cheesy, campy, dramatic, and ridiculous, all the while being completely awesome.

These are the genuine articles that comprise the uniform of a true 90’s east coast ski bum. \r\n\r\nBefore there were moisture wicking, synthetic thermo tops and bottoms, there was cotton…magnificent, frozen cotton. The clothing alternative for a skier back in the late 80’s and early 90’s was pretty slim; puffy, cotton-insulated bib overall snow pants or spongy, synthetic Spyder brand nut-huggers, mainly used by men presenting themselves as ski racers in their local NASTAR competition. You could see skiers miles away, as they swiveled their hips down the slope in dayglow windbreakers. If you chose skiing over the soon-to-be juggernaut snowboarding, you had subjected yourself to a sport that was tragically unhip for most of its existence. The irony? Most thought they looked awesome. Completely awesome.\r\n\r\nBefore the X Games and halfpipe competitions, skiers would pull off Daffys. Glorious, glorious Daffys. Once you mastered that epic move, you could impress the ski lift passengers with your repertoire of Helicopters, Backscratchers, and Spread Eagles. How did a young skier learn these tricks? The same way anyone learns anything…movies. Films such as \"Hot Dog,\" \"Ski School,\" \"Ski Patrol,\" \"Better Off Dead,\" and the holy grail: \"Aspen Extreme.\" Some call them cult classics; I call them staples of life.\r\n\r\nMany enjoyed the cheesy quality of these movies, such as the clichéd tagline of psychotic skiing villain Suicide in \"Ski Patrol,\" who would repeat, “Taste death. Live life.” before embarking on his ridiculous downhill antics. But any avid skier of this era would agree Aspen Extreme reached the paramount of ski movie lore. Co-star Dexter Ructecki not only represented the classic dim-witted loyal sidekick and I-don’t-give-a-damn ski bum attitude, but he also epitomized the day's hot dog ski fashion. A backwards ball cap and goggles became standard after this movie was released in 1993, but what Dex really did was validate what most of us really wanted to do, or were already doing: skiing in jeans.\r\n\r\nWhile alpha male star TJ Burke was bedding all the women, Dex was keeping it real by developing a drug habit and tearing shit up in his 501’s and boot gaiters. Don’t know what gaiters are? Google it. You’ll be wearing them to work tomorrow. \r\n\r\nThose of you who don’t ski or have taken it up since the reshaping of equipment and subsequent rebirth of the sport are surely asking yourself, “Why would anyone want to experience such discomfort, and possible hypothermia, by wearing a heavy cotton product and no ear protection in a sport based on frozen water and gravity?” BECAUSE YOU LOOK FREAKIN’ AWESOME. That’s why.\r\n\r\nOr at least I thought I did.\r\n\r\n\r\n* This design is printed on Vintage Navy Blue, Anvil ring spun cotton tees. These tees are incredibly soft, comfortable, and flexible.

One fall day in ‘89, I was indeed basking in all that glory. Card shows were a different scene back then: the cards weren’t yet overpriced and you could afford to buy boxes and spend all day opening them. The rarities and classics in the glass cases were in abundance and you could annoy the pants off of the vendors asking them countless questions and then still not buy their coveted ’86 Donruss Canseco Rated Rookie (thank god). \r\nDuring this particular card show, I was beginning to focus on hockey cards due to the Pittsburgh Penguins beginning to show a lot of promise. Not knowing much about the league besides Mario, the few star Pens we had and of course your Gretzkys, Hulls, and Orrs, I just poked around trying to absorb as many names as I could so I could start having a hockey conversation. After looking at a few Orr cards, I came across one that I could not get over; a ‘79-‘80 O-Pee-Chee Gerry Cheevers card. There was this Cheevers guy, taking an on-ice break, with the classic style goalie mask (which in my world, Jason Voorhees made famous) propped upon his head. All that I was focused on was the tiny bit of mask that I could see which was covered with hand-drawn “scar marks”.  Always looking to make friends with people who might contain endless amounts of useless knowledge, I asked the man behind the case why this Cheevers had drawn all over his mask?  Was he trying to look like he was in a horror film? Why didn’t he have cool pictures on it like the other goalies? Is he really mean? Would he want to hang out with me?  This slightly disheveled man in a stained Pirates shirt managed to squeeze out a few words of explanation; “No man. He marks his mask with a Sharpie every time a puck hits his face.”\r\n“Fuck that’s cool”, I stated.\r\n\r\nThat card vendor was right. It’s popular hockey lore that Cheevers faked an injury one day in practice after a puck struck him in the mask. Gerry retired to the locker room for a smoke and a beer and was soon caught by Harry Sinden, the Bruin’s head coach, who ordered him back to the ice. As a jab at the goaltender’s embellished injury, the team trainer later painted a stitch mark on Gerry’s then blank white fiberglass mask.  Ever since that day, Cheevers would draw a scar on his mask after being hit in the face by a puck, subsequently creating one of the most recognized masks in history. \r\nRegardless of Cheever’s role as the poster boy for iconic goalie masks, he is one of the best goalies to play the game. This two-time Cup winner holds the record for consecutive undefeated victories with 33.  Cheevers held respect in the locker room with friends and teammates such as Phil Espositio, as well with opponents on the ice.

It is the fore-runner of the NHL's Central Division. Intense rivalries developed between its constituent teams.\r\nJames E. Norris (December 10, 1879 – December 4, 1952) was a Canadian-American businessman, operating companies in the grain and cattle industries, and owner of the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League. He also had significant ownership interests in the Chicago Black Hawks and the New York Rangers. He is often referred to as James Norris Sr., to distinguish him from his son, James D. Norris. Norris is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame, as are his sons James and Bruce Norris.\r\nAs part of his shtick, ESPN's Chris Berman often refers to the National Football League's NFC North division (previously the NFC Central division) as the Norris Division or \"NFC Norris\" since the two divisions included teams from three of the same cities: Chicago, Detroit, and Minneapolis-St. Paul. The Tampa Bay Area was also briefly represented in both divisions simultaneously, during the 1992-93 NHL Season.\r\nThe last team lineup for the Norris Division lasted from 1982-1993. Teams included:\r\n▪\tChicago Blackhawks\r\n▪\tDetroit Red Wings\r\n▪\tMinnesota North Stars\r\n▪\tSt. Louis Blues\r\n▪\tTampa Bay Lightning\r\n▪\tToronto Maple Leafs\r\n\r\n* This design is printed on \"Silver Grey\" Anvil ring spun cotton tees.

Rocky’s proud father Bob, would walk into his neighborhood bar, and when asked how his new son was doing, Bob would reply, “Aw, you should see him, guys, he looks like a little rock sitting in that crib. He's got all these muscles.” From then on out, friends would constantly say, '”Hey Bob, how's that little rock of yours?' So after that, the nickname stuck, even though Rocky admits that he was a “fat baby”. I guess looks are distorted through a proud father’s eyes.\r\nSpeaking of pride, this proud Steelers fan has been racking his brain for close to a year on how he could possibly make a design to celebrate Bob’s kid, Rocky Bleier. Rocky is one of my favorite Steelers ever, for many reasons. He often is overlooked by all types fans that aren’t fanatical Steeler fans, and I felt that this is a travesty. The dilemma I found in designing something for Rocky was the fact that Rocky is not only a 4 time Super Bowl champion with the Black and Gold, but is also a brave, and decorated Viet Nam war veteran. I knew this would be hard to combine such immense worlds, and it would take time and planning, but it was the only way to honor him.\r\n\r\nAfter Rocky’s 1968 rookie season with Steelers, Bleier was drafted into the U.S. Army in December 1968. He volunteered for duty in the Vietnam War and shipped out in May 1969, serving with the 196th Light Infantry Brigade. On August 20, while on patrol in Heip Duc, Bleier was wounded in the left thigh by a rifle bullet when his platoon was ambushed in a rice paddy. While down, an enemy grenade landed nearby, sending shrapnel into his lower right leg. He was later awarded the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star. His rank was Specialist 4.\r\nWhile he was recovering in a hospital in Tokyo, doctors told him that he would not play football again. Soon after, he received a postcard from Steelers owner Art Rooney which just read \"Rock - the team's not doing well. We need you. Art Rooney\". Bleier later said \"When you have somebody take the time and interest to send you a postcard, something that they didn't have to do, you have a special place for those kind of people\".\r\nOne year after being wounded, Bleier reported to Steelers training camp. Upon his return, he couldn't walk without being in pain, and weighed only 180 pounds. He spent two full years trying to regain a spot on the active roster, and was even waived on two occasions. But Bleier never gave up. An offseason training regimen brought Bleier back to 212 pounds in the summer of 1974. From that point in time, he would be in the Steelers' starting lineup. At starting fullback, Rocky would prove to be a great lead blocker for Franco, but also a great rushing fullback. In ’76 Franco and Rocky both rushed for over 1,000 yards. At the time, they were only the second duo in NFL history to complete such as feet.\r\nBleier played in the first four Steeler Super Bowl victories, and caught the touchdown pass from Terry Bradshaw that gave Pittsburgh a lead it would never surrender in Super Bowl XIII.\r\nBleier retired after the 1980 season with 3,865 rushing yards, 136 receptions for 1,294 yards, and 25 touchdowns. At the time of his retirement, he was the Steelers fourth all-time leading rusher.\r\n\r\nNow, after reading that, you can see why I wanted to make something that would explain and honor the many facets of Bleier’s career in the Army and the NFL, and ultimately, what kind of a person he his. Rocky is maid of the true grit and guts. He is a true inspiration, and more should be aware of what he gave to the city of Pittsburgh, and more importantly, to our country.\r\n\r\n* This design is printed on Anvil ring spun cotton tees.

This of course can be both exhilarating and devastating, as in life, or any other sport. But, being a fan of every other sport at one time or another, I have never seen men as genuinely emotional as I do when they win the Stanley Cup.\r\n\r\nThe first Stanley Cup Finals I consciously followed was the ’89 Calgary/Montréal series. I was intrigued because the Olympics were in Calgary the year before, so I kept my eye on the Flames. Then, the Flames won, and I thought it was cool that the host city’s team had won the championship. I now seemed to like the Calgary Flames…it was as simple as that, not much goes into an 11-year-old’s decisions. Meanwhile at home, the Penguins had begun to pull themselves from obscurity, which was winning the NHL a little recognition in baseball and football soaked Western PA. So, I now had my eye on two teams. Then came 1991, the year that sold me on hockey. It began with a goal that would live on in my memory to this day, when Theo Fluery scored in game 6 against Edmonton and slid across nearly 200 feet of ice on his knees. I had never seen anything like it, and frankly, still haven’t. But the Flames would be knocked out of the first round during the next game, so out went the Flames (horrible pun).  So, I turned my attention to the much easier to follow, local Pens. During this time, I have to admit, I guilted myself harshly and often for neglecting such a wonderful team. Once I was really into the sport, I just couldn’t get over it all. The adversity one faced, as well as skill and overall toughness they had to posses was truly admirable. Mario kept scoring unbelievable goals, especially Game 2 of the Finals when he went net to net against Casey. The games even had Hollywood-esk villain/hero scenarios when Ulf cheaply took out Cam’s knee in the Boston series. When all of the theatrics were said and done, an entire city finally became hockey fans…as did a 13-year-old boy. I saw 6’ 5” Mario hoist the Cup higher than it has ever been raised before (as a friend so fondly puts it), and I didn’t know whom I liked better, Mario, or the Cup. Now all Pittsburgh sports owned a championship! I ran outside to tell me Dad this monumental news. I interrupted his conversation, and told him all about it. Unimpressed, and annoyed because of the interruption, he unenthusiastically said “Good for them”.  This is the story of my life…I think everyone is just as enthusiastic as I am about the stuff that I like. But, in hindsight, I don’t blame him. He’s from Cleveland. He probably thought I was putting him down with all that “Championship” talk. \r\n\r\nFast forward to this year, 2011, 20 years after I was formally introduced to Lord Stanley. This is also the year that I would cheat on my Penguins. But hey, I had to…this Bruins team had everything I look for in a hockey team…determination, perseverance, guts, and a cast of characters, with tons of talent. I just couldn’t help myself. The last time I was so surprisingly taken was when I saw Scarlett Johansson in Lost in Translation. She had my attention immediately, and for a brief period, made me forget Jack Bauer’s daughter. Plus, after the roller coaster season the Pens had, I was subconsciously drifting towards something so I didn’t have to end the season of my favorite sport early. Enter: Mark Recchi, Tim Tomas, Brad Marchand, Shawn Thornton, Johnny Boychuck, and Zdeno Chara. I had made designs for several of these guys, and I’m proud to say 3 of them own their tees. It’s definitely a thrill to have someone you respect own something that you made with your own hands.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw the Pens win game 7 in Detroit, I thought that was going to be as excited as I could get as a hockey fan, but this year rivaled that. Seeing how the B’s would handle and simply grit out the playoffs is exactly what a small town kid who’s taken his beatings wants to see out of people. I was so enamored with that team, I find it hard to put into words. I realized that I could be pleased with the Pens in ’09, and the B’s in ’10, because they were two different teams, in two different scenarios, and where both made up with my kind of guys. But, maybe that’s how I rationalized my infidelity. Ahh…I don’t know, to hell with it! How can you be a fan of this sport, and not love what you saw the Bruins do in April, May, and June. Can’t a guy be a hockey Polygamist for Christ’s sake? (Do I get hell points for pairing those words?)\r\n\r\nOne thing that I’m not confused about is that Zdeno Chara is one of the scariest hockey players I have ever come across. Physically imposing in stature, conditioning, skill, and strength, he has most people intimidated even when he isn’t shooting 106 MPH slap shots. Just looking at that menacing, joyless gaze during games is tough enough for me. That’s what makes this picture, and shirt, so special. Look at Big Z; he was just handed the Stanley Cup seconds ago, and is now raising it 7 feet from the ice, officially higher than it’s ever been before. He’s screaming like a joyfully crazed, teary-eyed Wookie, and his expression can be equated to a child celebrating their first 10 Christmas’s all at once. \r\nSeeing Chara and Recchi hoist that Cup…I was immediately taken back to when I was 13. You are actually seeing a person in the midst of one of the best moments of their life. They are humbled by that trophy, and in that moment, are truly happy. No other sport does that for me. Just like my favorite commercial says, “No Words”. \r\n\r\n* This design is printed on Anvil ring spun cotton tees. These tees are incredibly soft, comfortable, and flexible.

Often described as a “throwback player,\" Hines' major appeal is his work ethic, which makes him like everyone else in the Pittsburgh region. Students of the game admire Hines for his willingness and ability to block, while opponents hate him for the viciousness of those same blocks. When Terrell Suggs refuses to even utter your name, you know you're effective in your job. Continuing the everyman theme, he stands only 6 feet, 220 pounds and runs the 40 about as fast as the rest of us. In a league full of posturing and showboating, Hines' smile has charmed a city and set a new standard for player attitude. When you're that passionate and tough, who needs to give dirty looks? His play speaks for itself.\r\n\r\nHines was born in Seoul, South Korea, and moved to Georgia when he was 1. He attended the University of Georgia and played most of his games as a wide receiver, ranking second in Bulldogs history for career receptions and yardage. He also played tailback and is second only to Heisman Trophy winner Herschel Walker in all-purpose yards. Of course, to touch on the popular lore, Hines played QB as well, mostly in his sophomore year.\r\n\r\nHines has smashed nearly every receiving record in Steelers history, emerging as the team's all-time leader in career receptions, career receiving yards, and career receiving touchdowns. And on one of the top two days of my life, Hines won the Super Bowl XL MVP and, in a class move, “Road the Bus to Disneyworld.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after a gut-wrenching playoff loss to New England in ‘04, Hines was involved in a tearful press conference, where he expressed his friendship, as well as the team’s respect, for our beloved Jerome Bettis. Many mocked Hines, marking his show of emotion as weakness. But I couldn’t disagree more. Hines displayed guts, raw passion, and solidarity. That's a big reason why you see Pittsburgh fans in every city in America and why players never want to leave the organization. It's also why Bettis has a ring. If Pittsburgh didn’t already love Hines, that consummated the relationship. He has been the heart and soul of the team, and often our city.

Before you become even more confused, and possibly angry, please continue reading…\r\n\r\nThis shirt was created to pay homage to Jucuzzi Pete; hot tub aficionado, narrator of fan mail, heavy-handed audio editor, hater of “The Ed”, Jerk List listee, drunken irrational email writer, Tom Hanks fan, Feeney punching bag, and “Dave’s of Thunder” show producer.  \r\n\r\nJacuzzi Pete has also been a kind supporter of Backpage Press, and has received jack squat for his efforts. My lack of respect has always been bothersome…he does nice things for me, and my repayment is by making shirts for everyone but him. It is time to make amends, and give credit where credit is due.\r\n\r\nWhile most radio/podcast producers chime in occasionally, if at all, Jacuzzi Pete was always an integral member of the now defunct podcast “Dave’s of Thunder”.  While Pete keeps a level of mystery and mystique by not revealing his true last name, what we do know is that he was given his now famous moniker by neighbor and cast mate Dave Dameshek, who had personally witnessed Pete spending an ungodly amount of time in his jacuzzi, often neglecting family, friends, and overall positive life choices.\r\n\r\nDuring the show’s run, Jacuzzi Pete’s mild and pleasant demeanor was often mistaken for weakness by the “Dave’s of Thunder” cast. Jacuzzi Pete would often be verbally harassed regarding everything from his supposed weight problem to his consistent marital strife. As legend has it (and some archival emails prove) Jacuzzi Pete threw gasoline on this fire by sending cast mate David Feeney a number of drunken emails detailing his stance on random issues, while mindlessly soaking in his beloved hot tube. Said incident ultimately created the “Jucuzzi Thoughts” bit, where Feeney comedically mixed Pete’s inter-most thoughts with the manifested ramblings of an imbecile. Given the controversial nature of Pete’s thoughts in the original emails and text messages, it was impossible to distinguish which Jucuzzi thoughts truly came from Pete’s chlorine soaked mind. Needless to say, “Jucuzzi Thoughts” made national headlines, fueling debate across America. The popularity, or should I say notoriety, reached a fever pitch when Feeney reported that Jacuzzi Pete supposedly gave a whisky salute to the fallen terrorists at ground zero. The public backlash caused great strife and turmoil in Jacuzzi Pete’s life. To make matters worse, Jacuzzi Pete’s family claimed neglect due to his excessive jacuzzi time and countless hours spent at the D o T studio. Clearly, the rigors of producing a juggernaut show such as “Dave’s of Thunder” had taken its toll when Jacuzzi Pete literally ran from the studio, mid show. After some finger pointing, name-calling, and emotional voicemails, Jacuzzi Pete returned to the show. However, the passion and vigor was no longer there. It was clear that the sheer will to produce had been boiled out of him by the 104 degree water he so fondly sat in.  Pete would go on to admit that the only reason he returned to “Dave’s of Thunder” was because Dustin had revoked his free supplies tab At Lifestyle Spas and Jacuzzi’s in Van Nuys, CA. \r\n\r\nAfter relationships were seemingly repaired, Jacuzzi Pete took a back seat at the show, leaving many producing duties to assistant Blaster Girl Katie, or whoever wasn’t named Mike Cioffi. In what seemed to be a backhanded compliment, Pete would explain on-air that his decision to take a lesser role was not due to inner turmoil with the cast, but because he had a “real job”. \r\nRegardless, the Dave’s of Thunder show would go on, but Pete’s absence caused some kind of vergence in the force, leaving it susceptible to “The Man”, whom needlessly cut it down in February 2011. \r\n\r\nThis shirt was made at the request of one man, Jacuzzi Pete, who described the “Feensters Union” tee being made before one of his own as a “real slap in the face” via Twitter. I was lucky enough to have Tim Wadleigh, the fan who supplied the draft for the “Feenster’s Union” tee, supply this one as well. After some fine-tuning by both of us, it’s ready for the legions of D o T fans. Thanks to Tim, and of course, Jacuzzi Pete for helping to make the project possible.\r\n\r\nThat being said, do you think the completion of a 3rd shirt is enough to convince the D o T players that there should be a reunion show? \r\n\r\n\r\n* This design is printed on \"storm grey\" color Anvil ring spun cotton tees.

Dave was the first public supporter of Backpage Press, and I designed this shirt to pay homage to all things Dameshek. The design incorporates the Han Solo edition blaster, the Pittsburgh Steelers hypocycloids, and Star Wars font. Basically everything that makes America great. \r\n \r\nOriginal Shek Republic tee write up, composed January, 2011:\r\n\r\nDave is a comedy writer, sports commentator, and a podcast/radio personality known for his unabashed Pittsburgh homerism and for being the voice of the fan. His TV writing career has included stints with Comedy Central’s “Battlebots,\" “I'm with Busey,\" “Trigger Happy TV,\" and, most notably, “The Man Show.\" Dave also handled many writing duties on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" contributing to the nightly monologues and helping with Jimmy’s NFL pregame show segments.\r\n \r\nKnown as the Ted McGinley of radio, Dave has spun gold all across this great nation, contributing to Indie 103’s “Mighty Morning Show” with Dicky Barrett and the nationally syndicated “Adam Carolla Show,\" not to mention numerous national and regional ESPN radio programs.\r\n \r\nDave’s sports commentary and wit drove “Dave Dameshek’s Sports Contraption” on KDKA-FM in Pittsburgh, creating arguably the greatest radio program in the history of the planet. Dave then returned to Los Angeles and joined the mothership at ESPN Radio 710 LA, hosting “The Dave Dameshek Show\" and introducing popular segments like \"The Jerk List\" and \"Hypothetical Horatio\" to a West Coast audience. Next, Dave launched “Dave Dameshek On Demand,\" a podcast that thrilled and entertained sports fans with assorted hooey and applesauce until “The Man” shut it down in late 2009.\r\n \r\nIn March 2010, Dave began a new comedy/talk-based podcast with friend and fellow comedy writer David Feeney. Broadcast on the Adam Carolla Network, \"Daves of Thunder” amused its legions of BTL monkeys with such glorious bits as \"Daddy's Closet,\" \"Jacuzzi Thoughts,\" and \"Knuckles Goldberg: Jew Boxer.\"  \r\n \r\nAfter the premature demise of \"Daves of Thunder,\" Dave fulfilled a childhood dream and landed a job with the NFL, recording a weekly podcast and appearing on the NFL Network's \"Fantasy Football Live.\" Dave even transformed \"The Jerk List\" into \"The Shame Report,\" creating one of the most popular online video segments at NFL.com.\r\n \r\nDave’s constant support of Backpage Press along with his willingness to wear BP shirts and to talk up their quality have done wonders for the business. And Dave does it all for nothing but a shared love of Pittsburgh, sports, and Star Wars.\r\n \r\nThanks for all you've done, Dave. You're the tops.\r\n \r\n* This design was submitted by member of the Shek Republic, Adam Reeve. Adam was the first ever outside collaborator at Backpage Press.\r\n\r\n* This design is printed on Anvil ringspun cotton tees, that have the same fit (fashion fit), comfort, and style at American Apparel.

Feeney has contributed to the shows “Claude’s Crib”, “Jenny”, “Bette”, “In Case of Emergency”, “According to Jim”, and most notably “Big Wolf on Campus”. \r\nDavid Feeney served not only as talent, but also as one of the main bit writers on Dave's of Thunder. David penned such D o T classics as “Daddy’s Closet” and the popular “Jucuzzi Thoughts”, in which he transcribed and then read Producer Jucuzzi Pete’s often appalling inner most thoughts to the D o T listeners. New Yorkers found it significantly distasteful when J. Pete gave a whiskey salute to a fallen terrorist at ground zero. Shame. \r\nFeeney also cathartically explained to his audience that he repeatedly gave sex motions to his boyhood football pillow through childhood and adolescence. Clearly this show was a form of therapy, and not just to make \"Below-the-Line\" individuals laugh, or even the \"Monkeys\", for that matter.\r\nDuring the run of their cult hit podcast, internal tensions with the crew often boiled over on-air. Show producer J. Pete seemed to have considerable tension with Feeney regarding Feeney’s publication of the before mentioned “Jacuzzi Thoughts”, and actually was driven to “running away” during one of the shows. J. Pete was later contacted, at which time he informed the loyal public that he just “had enough”. Surprisingly, J. Pete came back to the show in due time. Unfortunately, the result was only more hazing.  \r\nDuring taping, Feeney was often unable to control his raging hormones, which would result in sexual comments and innuendos towards any one who was female, or had a vagina. Feeney mainly projected his love towards Assistant Producer Blaster Girl Katie, and even Dave Dameshek’s own mother, Mo Dameshek. The result of this torrid affair with Mo was a duet of Bonnie Tyler's \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\", which the mere thought of gives me chills as I write this. Dameshek's father eventually had to intervene to stop the probable love affair. \r\nAlthough this was a labeled comedy podcast, in reality, it was a soap opera of epic proportions. Tensions in the D o T studio would soon reach the tipping point, and a family therapist was asked to intervene, in attempt to save the fragile structure of the Dave’s of Thunder family. Ultimately, family therapist Cory’s attempts were futile, and his bus was leaving in 10 minutes, so he really couldn't do much else with the group. Cory’s uselessness lead the Family to explode from within, which was reminiscent of Skywalker’s super laser being shot into the core reactor of the original Death Star. However, unlike the Death Star, the D o T family was not blown into pieces, but was in fact split in two factions, calling themselves the “Shek Republic” and the “Feenster’s Union”. Many political pundits have paralleled this event to the split of Korea into North and South.  \r\nWhile the two factions of the family fought for the majority lead, control of bits, condiments, time off, and women, they neglected to keep a watchful eye on “The Man”. As a result, Dave's of Thunder was needlessly cut down by “The Man” in February 2011. \r\n\r\nThis tee was made at the request of the leaders of the Feenster’s Union. Tim Wadleigh, a staunch Feeney supporter, submitted the original artwork. After some consulting with Feeney on some of the details, the finished logo was printed. Thanks to Tim, and Feeney, for making the shirt possible.\r\n\r\n* This design is printed on Anvil ring spun cotton tees. These tees are incredibly soft, comfortable, and flexible.

Dave was the first public supporter of Backpage Press, and I designed this shirt to pay homage to all things Dameshek. The design incorporates the Han Solo edition blaster, the Pittsburgh Steelers hypocycloids, some Star Wars Old Republic/Rebels symbols, and Russian text. Basically everything that makes America great. \r\n \r\nDave is a comedy writer, sports commentator, and a podcast/radio personality known for his unabashed Pittsburgh homerism and for being the voice of the fan. His TV writing career has included stints with Comedy Central’s “Battlebots,\" “I'm with Busey,\" “Trigger Happy TV,\" and, most notably, “The Man Show.\" Dave also handled many writing duties on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" contributing to the nightly monologues and helping with Jimmy’s NFL pregame show segments.\r\n \r\nKnown as the Ted McGinley of radio, Dave has spun gold all across this great nation, contributing to Indie 103’s “Mighty Morning Show” with Dicky Barrett and the nationally syndicated “Adam Carolla Show,\" not to mention numerous national and regional ESPN radio programs.\r\n \r\nDave’s sports commentary and wit drove “Dave Dameshek’s Sports Contraption” on KDKA-FM in Pittsburgh, creating arguably the greatest radio program in the history of the planet. Dave then returned to Los Angeles and joined the mothership at ESPN Radio 710 LA, hosting “The Dave Dameshek Show\" and introducing popular segments like \"The Jerk List\" and \"Hypothetical Horatio\" to a West Coast audience. Next, Dave launched “Dave Dameshek On Demand,\" a podcast that thrilled and entertained sports fans with assorted hooey and applesauce until “The Man” shut it down in late 2009.\r\n \r\nIn March 2010, Dave began a new comedy/talk-based podcast with friend and fellow comedy writer David Feeney. Broadcast on the Adam Carolla Network, \"Daves of Thunder” amused its legions of BTL monkeys with such glorious bits as \"Daddy's Closet,\" \"Jacuzzi Thoughts,\" and \"Knuckles Goldberg: Jew Boxer.\"  \r\n \r\nAfter the premature demise of \"Daves of Thunder,\" Dave fulfilled a childhood dream and landed a job with the NFL, recording a weekly podcast and appearing on the NFL Network's \"Fantasy Football Live.\" Dave even transformed \"The Jerk List\" into \"The Shame Report,\" creating one of the most popular online video segments at NFL.com.\r\n \r\nDave’s constant support of Backpage Press along with his willingness to wear BP shirts and to talk up their quality have done wonders for the business.

You're the tops.\r\n \r\n\r\nThis design is printed on Anvil's premium charcoal heather \"Sustainable\" tee's.

He has a nice head of hair?\r\n\r\nAdam Rank is a writer, stand-up comedian, radio personality and television host. He should list his occupation as “magician” because he was somehow able to fool the NFL into thinking he's talented.\r\n\r\nRank was born and raised in Southern California yet managed to avoid the sun so magnificently that he earned the nickname “Diablo Blanco.” He also earned “O.C.'s Funniest Finalist of 2009, 2010 and 2011” for his stand-up comedy performances. Losing out each year to good judgment.\r\n\r\nAnd if you think his stand-up is bad, he's even less funny when he sits down every week on the NFL Network's “NFL Fantasy Live.” While at the “kid's table,” he reads tweets from other people that were actually able to come up with something interesting to say. Tune in.\r\n\r\nAdam was hired by the NFL in 1995. And he worked so hard with his writings and “Pick Six” columns he was finally rewarded with his television debut in 2010. Fifteen years later. The only slower rise is his metabolism. Have you seen this guy's neck? Neither has he.\r\n\r\nAdam is probably most famous for his work on “The Adam Rank Gridiron Podcast for Kids.” This is when Rank corners athletes into answering questions until they threaten bodily harm. Once again, tune in.\r\n\r\nHis “NFL Fantasy Live” colleague Dave Dameshek describes Adam Rank as having “the perfect face for radio.” That's why he hired him to co-host the “Dave Dameshek Football Program.” Or as Rank calls it, “Adam's Weekly Valentine to the Los Angeles Rams.”\r\n\r\nAdam loves the Los Angeles Rams. If he loved them anymore, he'd drink them. Hate to say Rank is a drunken mess, but Lindsay Lohan is taking notes.\r\n\r\nAnd don't think his love for L.A. sports stop there. Nope, he loves the Lakers, Angels and Kings too. Truthfully, he thinks by going to games in Los Angeles, he'll actually be able to put his name on IMDb. Hey, nobody said loyalty equals intelligence.\r\n\r\nHe's also got horrible taste in music. What do Poison, Motley Crue and Cinderella have in common? They're all funnier than Adam Rank. Hair bands, really? I think Alanis Morrissette has another hit on her hands.\r\n\r\nSo if you like wrestling and “Hot Tub Time Machine” and Lynyrd Skynyrd, well, you've failed at life. But don't worry cause Adam Rank did too. And you can show your support by proudly displaying your “Rank Amateurs” tee.\r\n\r\nShow “America!” you're always drunk and don't care who knows it.\r\n\r\nWritten by Larry Farish\r\n\r\n* This design is printed on \"Independence Red\" Anvil ring spun cotton tees.

I’m assuming this is true for nearly every other sports fan of that era. The first book I ever read was Bo’s autobiography, “Bo Know’s Bo”…well the first “real” book I should say. The book was no literary legend, but it was ghost written by the late great Dich Schaap, and gave the first unabashed and truthful look into Bo’s past. The badass on the field turned out to be a badass child as well. Being 12, and given the fact that I was on the cusp of teenage rebellion, this further endeared him to me. \r\nBo’s entire sporting career lasted less than 10 years, which due to his consistent popularity and iconic status, seems like a lie. A combination of athleticism, marketing, personality, and individualism created a juggernaut. No one could hold a candle to Bo then, and no one has since. Sorry Deion…Bo’s damaged hip is still tougher and more likeable than you.\r\nThere aren’t many images of 90’s sports culture that are more iconic than the one that inspired this print.\r\n\r\nVincent Edward Jackson, nicknamed “Bo” by his family because actions resembled that of a wild boar hog, grew up the third youngest of ten siblings in Bessemer, Alabama. After rushing for over 1,000 yards, hitting 20 homers in 25 games, and earning a state crown in the 100 meter dash his senior year at McAdory High, he went to Auburn University and won the Heisman. \r\n\r\nIn a very public decision, Bo chose to play baseball for the Kansas City Royals, despite being picked first in the 1986 NFL draft by the then lowly Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In a move that destroyed any bit of professional decency and trust, Tampa Bay flew Bo on a private plane, violating NCAA rules, and costing Bo his final season as an Auburn baseball player. The Buccaneer’s next move was to give Bo an ultimatum; choose football over baseball. Bo, who has always expressed that baseball was his first love, called Tampa’s bluff and chose to start out in the minors with the World Series champs rather than dawn the cream sickle uniforms of the laughing stock of the NFL. \r\nCalled up in ’87 after a season with the Memphis Chicks, Bo started out slowly with the Royals. He finally made his MLB breakthrough in ’89 when he famously ran down a fly ball in left center and finished the already stunning athletic achievement by running a gravity-defying half circle up and around the outfield wall. If that wasn’t enough to earn the All Star game MVP, Bo also hit a monstrous 448’ home run on his first plate appearance.\r\n\r\nTampa Bay, who had made a misguided choice by attempting to exert control over someone nicknamed after a wild boar, had to forfeit Jackson’s signing rights after he did not sign by the 1987 draft. Bo was re-entered into the NFL draft, and was picked 183rd by the LA Raiders. Surprisingly, the normally irrational Al Davis supported Jackson’s wish to play baseball and football, signing him to a full-time running back contract that also allowed him to join the Raiders after the baseball season had ended. I imagine it was hard to not negotiate man that ran 40-yard dash in a blistering 4.12 seconds, which is still the fastest verifiable 40-yard dash time ever recorded at any NFL Combine. Bo was more suited for the silver and black uniforms anyway.\r\n\r\nWhen watching the clip of Bo being tackled by the Bengals Kevin Walker in the January 13, 1991 AFC playoff game, it looks like nothing; just a normal hit knocking Bo out of bounds. Little did we know, we were watching the first, and the best two-sport athlete of all time, and sure NFL Hall of Famer’s last football game. I can still remember the devastation I felt as a kid as they replayed the clip on Sportscenter. Sure, we all appreciated Bo’s baseball skills, but we also all knew that his true gift was on the gridiron. George Brett, Bo’s teammate in Kansas City, attended that playoff game. George asked the LA trainer what had happened to Bo. The trainer stated, “Bo says he felt his hip come out of the socket, so he popped it back in, but that’s impossible, no one’s that strong.”\r\n\r\nDuring surgery on the injured hip, it was discovered that Jackson had a genetic disease called avascular necrosis, which decreased blood supply to the head of his left femur, causing the deterioration of the femoral head. This explained why Walker’s simple hit changed football history. Bo’s injury and disease required a hip replacement, subsequently ending his football career. \r\n\r\nWhen he announced soon after his surgery that he would play baseball again, many thought that goal to be unrealistic, especially at the Major League level. \r\n\r\nOn April 10, 1993, Nike ran a full page add in USA Today, simply stating, “Bo Knew”. This was celebrating Bo’s comeback achievement, on his first at bat with his new team, the Chicago White Sox. Bo’s first swing on April 9th, opening day, resulted in a towering homer.\r\nAlthough Bo’s power was still there, his speed was gone. During his year tenure with the White Sox, he had no stolen bases. The California Angels signed Bo as a free agent the following year, which would be his final. Bo retired from professional sports during the MLB strike year of 1995.\r\n\r\nJust as impressive as Bo’s athleticism, was his marketing power. Bo was just as dominant in Tecmo Super Bowl as he was in popular culture. Staring in the “Bo Knows” Nike campaign, which felt like it ran for 10 years, Bo became a household name and created a pop-culture reference that remains relevant and recognizable to this day. His Nike Trainer shoes flew off the shelves in the 90’s, and have remained so sought after that Nike reissued them several years ago. I can speak first hand on this, due to the fact that my obsession with Bo and his merchandise has not tailed off for nearly 20 years. I recently purchased my 4th pair of Bo’s Nike Trainers when they released the “Tecmo Bo” special edition. I had to get them…I’m sure you agree.  It turns out my wife did not agree, and has displayed an obvious lack of taste coupled with vacant respect of history. Turns out the water company’s billing department felt the same way.\r\n\r\nBo now resides in Burr Ridge, Illinois. He has invested in a multi-sports dome, food company, and a community bank and trust. He is an accomplished chef and community spokesman. I was pleased to see his appearance back into the sports culture, and of course merchandising with the Nike “Boom” ad campaign, as well as the ceremonial first pitch at Home Run Derby in 2010.\r\n\r\nAlthough the “Bo Knows” campaign created many different images and ideas over the years, there was still just one image that is burnt into the collective conscious of hardcore sports fans, which is the image on this shirt. In my generation, there are few images that are as iconic as this one.\r\n\r\n* The Bo Knows tee in Black is printed on Anvil ring spun cotton tees. These tees are incredibly soft, comfortable, and flexible. They have a sliming cut, but not enough that it throws off the sizing. Bottom line, these tees will be among your go-to favorite tees. \r\nFor more detailed information, including sizing, check them out at Anvils website:\r\nhttp://www.anvilknitwear.com/Product-Catalogs/Tees/980\r\n\r\n* This Bo Knows tee in Heather Royal Blue is printed on Anvil's premium heather blue \"Sustainable\" tee's.

He could gain insane velocity, while only measuring up to 5’11” and 178 lbs. It was like you knew this guy from high school, yet he was a ridiculous force on the mound. \r\nIn 1989, the Giants were at the top of my list. Then, in 1993, they just plain angered me. My deep loathing for one Barry Bonds made me cross the Giants right off the list, especially in 2002. But now, through years of therapy, I can forgive the team from letting Bonds on the roster, and think of only childhood good times with one Will the Thrill. Now that Baseball has gone back to a game of skill and talent, instead of a game of skill, talent, and chemical enhancement, I felt it was only right to make an original design for “The Franchise”.  I love the team again, and Lincecum is the man. Growing up a Bucco fan and seeing Bonds tank every postseason…who wouldn’t want to see San Fran win it all without the help of the self absorbed pre-Madonna.  Plus, how can’t your root for the Giant’s cast of characters?\r\nOf course all this inspiration has been festering in my head since around, oh say the 1992 NLCS, but thanks to Tim and the newest ESPN Sportscenter commercial, it all came crashing together last week.

Bleached frizzy hair, day-glow colors and obvious drug abuse – what could be more 80s?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only thing more 80s would have been to drop the New Coke swilling, acid washed jeans-clad Warrior into the Nicaraguan forest to join the Freedom Fighters while he used a gun funded from inner-city crack sales. Actually, that was a movie pitched to the studios by the WWF (f-you hippies, it's still the WWF to me) before it decided to go with No Holds Barred.*</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professional wrestling changed in the 80s. Skilled mat technicians were replaced with muscle-bound meatheads with limited skill sets (kind of the opposite of what's happening now). Just look at our champion during that time, Hulk Hogan. His finishing move was a freaking leg drop. You know a finishing move sucks when you practice it on your friend's little brother and it barely dazes him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it was cool to us as little kids. However, as we got older our tastes changed. We started to notice things like Hogan was kind of a (female dog).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hogan cried when Paul Orndorff turned heel (though the pile driver had to hurt). King Kong Bundy broke his ribs to send Hogan to the hospital (though, that was kind of cool how they broke into SuperStars to update us on what was going to happen on Saturday Night's Main Event). And then Andre the Giant made Hogan cry on national TV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We bought Hogan back when Land of the Lost seemed like the most intense show ever, but as our generation became teenagers, we wanted more. We didn't want a sympathetic champion; we wanted an ass-kicker. We wanted the mother (expletive) Warrior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Warrior was all man. (Well, as all man as you can be with tassels on your arms.) His intro music was pure hair metal (and you've likely been stuck in your head since you clicked in). The Warrior charged the ring like people charged life in the 80s, without consequences and again, pumped up drugs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Train, say your prayers and eat your vitamins … bah! The Warriors vitamins were putting a foot in his opponent's ass.\r\n\r\nThe Warrior ended the Honkeytonk Man's Intercontinental title reign and WWF career with a 31-second beat down in WrestleMania III. (Compare the HTM's loss to Daniel Bryan for how to rebound after an embarrassing WM loss.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warrior reached his zenith when he finally put away Hogan in WrestleMania VI. The Warrior ruled the wrestling world. He even managed to retire Randy Savage in WrestleMania VII.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But like the 80s, the star was far too bright. Nobody could sustain his level of intensity for long. There were even rumors of his death, though I believe people were getting him confused with Jon-Erik Hexum. And like the pop from a prop gun, the Warrior was gone as mysteriously as he had arrived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turner's wrestling federation tried to dupe fans into thinking the Renegade was really just a rebranded Warrior. But the Renegade was lame. And let's not talk about the ill-fated OWN (One Warrior Nation … it's nWo backwards – get it?). Although I do believe he killed Brutus Beefcake in one angle, which was kind of cool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it was never the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So with this we salute you Ultimate Warrior. Wear this shirt proudly, and with neon orange and green tassels, of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*Yeah, not really.</p>\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Adam Rank</strong>, the author if this piece, is a stand up comedian and columnist at NFL.com.

Leslie Nielson, born in Regina, Saskatchewan, was originally a dramatic actor of the highest regard, working in a time in Hollywood known as “Television’s Golden Age.”  It wasn’t until the Zucker brother’s cast him in the 1980’s spoof “Airplane!” that Leslie became a true household name. His deadpan delivery was the exact professional style the Zucker’s were looking for. Their new style of sarcastic comedic films wanted to use the classic acting styles of Robert Stack, Lloyd Bridges, and Nielson to lampoon ridiculously over-serious Hollywood films. The subsequent success of Airplane! thrusted the Zucker’s and Nielson into the forefront of brilliant, sarcastic comedy. \r\n\r\nOne of my earliest memories of frustration was in the summer of ’88. My parents came home from a movie night, still in hysterics from a movie that ended an hour ago. I begged them to key me in on what was so damn funny, but the only thing that I was told was that they had just seen a movie called “The Naked Gun”. In typical “parent speaking to a ten year old” fashion, they informed me that, “I was too young to understand.” However frustrating that statement is, in hindsight, they where right. Like many people (both casual viewers and loyal fans) I still am pulling new sexual innuendo’s and random hidden references from that movie. That’s what makes all three movies timeless, but most notably, the first.\r\n\r\n“The Naked Gun” was based on the Zuker’s short-lived 1982 ABC television series “Police Squad!”, which was cancelled after only six episodes. Sergeant Frank Drebin, Detective Lieutenant Police Squad, was the lead role of the TV series, as well as the films that would follow 6 years later. The Zucker’s simply Frankenstiened all of the official police titles to invent Frank’s position in an elite task force of the LAPD called “Police Squad”. Drebin, who inherently means well, is oblivious to the fact that he causes more problems than he solves. His only advocates are Captain Ed Hocken and Detective Nordberg, who’s unflinching loyalty proves to be the only factor that causes Frank’s cases to have a positive outcome. \r\nNote: You might remember OJ Simpson, the actor who played Norberg, from murdering psychopath fame in the early ‘90’s. \r\n\r\nLeslie’s switch to deadpan comedic acting reinvented his career, and brought a lot of joy to my life. “The Naked Gun” is one of my top 5 movies of all time. I felt I needed to make a tee for Frank Drebin that wasn’t tacky. I thought one that was deadpan, just like the character, would do the character, and film, justice. This looks like a standard issue department tee a cop would wear, but when you look close, it’s just plain ridiculous. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* This design is printed on Anvil ring spun cotton tees. These tees are incredibly soft, comfortable, and flexible. They have a sliming cut, but not enough that it throws off the sizing.

Max is a member of the Main Force Patrols (MFP), and is considered the top pursuit man in a futuristic Australia, whose society is beginning to break down. Max is teamed with one of the main characters of “Mad Max” and “The Road Warrior”, an Australian released, limited edition GT351 version of a 1973 Ford XB Falcon Hardtop, or in the movie, “the last of the V8 Interceptors.”\r\n\r\nMax ends up killing the “Nightrider” in the beginning of the original, and less known “Mad Max” movie, which really pisses of the Nightrider’s gang of unruly thugs. Nightrider's motorcycle gang is lead by friends \"Toecutter\" and the sociopath Bubba Zanetti. The gang subsequently terrorizes the nearby towns, and seeks revenge towards Max for Nightrider’s death. \r\nMax, and his partner Jim “Goose” Rains (couldn’t Jerry Bruckheimer have come up with a different, non-sensical nickname for their action/buddy flick “Top Gun”) try to bring down a rapist gang member with some law and order, which is quickly falling out of style. After charges don’t stick to the gang due the their intimidation towards witnesses, Goose beats the tar out of Toecutter’s boy toy Johnny “The Boy” Boyle. Oh Lord, here we go…hell have no fury like the scorn of the Toecutter.\r\nWith ammunition towards Goose, Max, and MFP Captain Fred “Fifi” McPee, the homoerotic, homicidal gang unleashes hell. \r\nThat being said, I can’t help but give my opinion on McPee’s nickname too, which has to have as much intentional irony as the character himself, given “Fifi” looks like German BALCO Kojak meets early 2000’s Emo guy. Nothing like a bald linebacker, in a small baby blue tee, adorned by a scarf, and a handlebar mustache. \r\n\r\nLong Story short, the gang chases down and burns Goose beyond recognition, which makes Max “Slightly Unsettled Max”. Then the bad guys kill Max’s wife and child during vacation, which makes him “Mad Max”.\r\nMax kills the entire gang in a vehicular manslaughter fashion, and drives off into the distance, an emotionless, silent loner. \r\n\r\nWho would really know that this strange, slightly unsettling Australian film would turn into the coolest sequel ever, “Mad Max 2”, or “The Road Warrior”, as it’s more commonly known.\r\n\r\nMany of the worlds citizens, who are not lucky enough to have membership in the exclusive Mad Max cult, think that “The Road Warrior” is the original Mad Max. Ridiculous! If that was the first one, how would we know what Max is mad about?! Some people just don’t use their heads. \r\n\r\n“The Road Warrior” shows an emotionally barren Max traveling the post apocalyptic wastelands of Australia in search gasoline after a worldwide energy crisis. Max’s only companions are his trusty Australian Cattle Dog, and the supercharged V-8 Pursuit Special, the same vehicle he drove off into the distance in the first movie. \r\n\r\nMax’s foes are even more extreme, homoerotic, and completely amusing than the previous Nightrider/Toecutter gang. Lead by “The Humongous”, his second in command “Wez”, and Wez’s boy toy “The Golden Youth”…\r\n\r\n(Pause for laughter)\r\n\r\n…the conflict between Max and the unruly gang is not only because of fallen gang members, but gasoline as well. The Humongous wants to rule the wasteland and have all the gas, so he becomes quite irritated when Max takes up with a small wasteland community fort, which revolves around a small oilrig. Wez has more of a personal vendetta due to the untimely demise of The Golden Youth at the hands of “The Feral Kid” and his razor boomerang. \r\nArmed with a often misfiring sawed off shotgun and clothed in the iconic, wasteland-altered MHP uniform and steel leg brace, Max battles the Humongous gang, whom sport the equally iconic (more on the ridiculous side), S&M/used sports equipment costumes, which they purchased at the post-apocalyptic Adult World/Play It Again Sports.\r\n\r\nI just can’t explain how much I enjoy these movies. They just have everything…muscle cars, great characters, cheesy action, and all of the un-intentional comedy you can stomach. \r\nI just wish that Gibson would have kept his hate filled ramblings to himself until production of Mad Max 4 was over. Who knows if the 4th installment will now ever emerge from pre-production purgatory? \r\n\r\n(Notice no mention of Mad Max 3…it will not be recognized due to the assumption that if you ignore it for over 20 years, it will go away. This assumed law of denial is also currently being applied to The Godfather 3”.)\r\n\r\n* This design is printed on Anvil ring spun cotton tees.

Both served under Cowher as assistants and were considered very Cowher-esque. When dealing with Steelers football, most Pittsburghers don't like change, and Russ or Wiz under the head coach’s headset would have lessened the anxiety for fans and players. \r\n\r\nUnless you were deeply ingrained in NFL culture, you had no idea who Mike Tomlin was. Personally, I couldn’t get my head around it. Most of that confusion dealt with the Rooneys risking the sacred legacy of the Steelers, who have a much-publicized history of choosing quality coaches. In retrospect, shame on me for questioning the Rooneys. I should of known they would be looking out for the Steelers legacy more closely than myself, or anyone else for that matter. \r\n\r\nOnce the buzz settled down, Pittsburghers realized most everyone who had played for or who had worked with Tomlin vouched for his character. However, criticism surrounded his attendance of small William & Mary, which isn't exactly known as an athletic powerhouse. The W&M Tribe was also the last team he played ball for. Then came criticism of his age. When he was a defensive backs coach in Tampa and Minnesota, Tomlin was the same age, and sometimes younger, than the players he coached. This fact would also follow the 34-year-old to Pittsburgh, where Tomlin became the 9th coach in Steelers history to be hired in his 30s, but the only one who hadn’t played pro ball in some way, shape, or form. After 15 years of Cowher, how was this young, un-established guy going to handle or improve a veteran team one year removed from a Super Bowl victory? It was a long offseason waiting to see what this guy was all about. \r\n\r\nWhat we ended up seeing was a well-mannered, intense young man who took full control of the team in the opposite way Cohwer did. Tomlin let the team know he was boss, yet he kept a youthful enthusiasm most Steelers fans had never seen. Speaking for myself, I had only lived through Chuck Noll and Cowher, so when I saw a young man running onto the field to chest bump Hines Ward after a first down catch, it was both alarming and awesome. The players responded well, and Ben Roethlisberger commented on how much he appreciated Tomlin’s non-dictatorial approach. This displayed the rarity of Tomlin’s personality, a leader who was able to effectively control while remaining part of the gang.\r\n\r\nAs we got to know Tomlin, we began to love him. There wasn't much to dislike. He was a good-looking guy who rocked the standard NFL sideline gear like no one’s business. Even his sunglasses were cool. Women began to rave because he looked like actor Omar Epps. The Epps comparison was no coincidence, considering Omar is Mike’s first cousin. Then came the press conferences. Only the certainty of his words outdid the intensity of his face. He spoke like a coach leading his team in the golden era of the NFL, back when they played championship games and not Super Bowls. Tomlin gave one of his most famous post-game press conference quotes after a rough Steelers loss to the Ravens in the ’09 season, stating, \"We will not go gently. We will unleash hell here in December, because we have to. We won't go in the shell. We will go into attack mode, because that is what is required.\" My God. After that one, I was conducting trips to the grocery store with an unheard of intensity. I was also working on a Brooks Orpik design at the time and wasn’t able to come up with a tagline. The Orpik/Ovechkin “Unleash Hell” tee was finished four days after that press conference. \r\n\r\nSo now that we're looking back on the first four years of the Tomlin era, do you not feel even more enamored with the genius of the Rooneys? They picked a guy who no one knew, and now he's the toast of the league. Tomlin’s organizational moves have been as classy as his on-field swagger. He was humble enough not to implement his “Tampa 2” defense and instead let the great Dick LeBeau continue on with Blitzburgh. He retained Bruce Arians when everyone wanted him gone, and now our offense has a high-powered air assault to compliment the classic, bruising running attack. He allowed players to develop their personal styles rather than forcing a fundamental change. He altered the climate and attitude of an already award-winning team and won a Super Bowl.

However, a short recap is always in order...\r\n\r\nThis paragraph taken from the 2010 \"Support Your Local Linebacker\" tee:\r\n\r\n\"About a week before Super Bowl XL, I made the James Harrison “Deebo” design, because he was my favorite player. Joey Porter had coined the nickname during Monday Night Football introductions in 2005. They let players do the player intros instead of the booth guys that year, and Joey made a glorious mockery out of the situation. Joey called James “Deebo” in reference to Tiny Lester’s character in the movie “Friday”. The comparison in attitude seemed to fit like a glove, and James really did look like Deebo…so, as soon as I had the skills to make the tee, I did. And then James ran back an interception for 100 yards in the Super Bowl…the rest is history.\"\r\n\r\nSo why did I make anther Harrison design? Because I can make it better than I have in the past. Each year I wrench away in the shop, sharpening skills and learning new tricks. Each year, I look at my old stuff and think of how much better it could be. So, I've taken my original 6 designs and revamped them. The original \"DEBO\" tee (notice the misspelling) was literally my 3rd Backpage Press tee. When I look at the original, I still love it, but I also want one of my favorite ideas to look as good as it possibility can. By re-working this design, it can it live on, and I can also continue support for my favorite player. \r\n\r\nThis design's improved elements include a large-scale, highly detailed, 2 color print on a  premium ring spun cotton tee in \"Storm Grey\" color...and no misspellings.\r\n\r\n* This design is printed on \"Storm Grey\" Anvil ring spun cotton tees.

So, I am going to go and estimate that I have been a fan of the NFL for the last 26 years. I have seen the game change in good ways, and bad. I’ve heard penalties and terminologies, such as “spearing” and “clipping” fade off into oblivion. I can remember bone crushing highlight videos that came with my yearly subscription to Sports Illustrated, that detailed 60 minutes worth of the most jarring hits caught on film (they were awesome by the way). But never, and I mean never, have I ever been as disgusted with the way this game has been changed, as I am this year. \r\n\r\nAbout a week before Super Bowl XL, I made the James Harrison “Deebo” design, because he was my favorite player. Joey Porter had coined the nickname during Monday Night Football introductions in 2005. They let players do the player intros instead of the booth guys that year, and Joey made a glorious mockery out of the situation. Joey called James “Deebo” in reference to Tiny Lester’s character in the movie “Friday”. The comparison in attitude seemed to fit like a glove, and James really did look like Deebo…so, as soon as I had the skills to make the tee, I did. And then James ran back an interception for 100 yards in the Super Bowl…the rest is history.\r\n\r\nSo the reason for these two paragraphs is to explain two things. I LOVE the NFL and the game of football. And secondly, James Harrison is still my favorite player. He was before he won any Super Bowl, or was awarded NFL Defensive Player of the Year. He won me over in ’02 and ’03 with his special teams play. He was intense, freakishly built, competitive, and passionate, with complete disregard for personal safety (notice I said personal). When I was taught how to play football at 10 years old, the coaches taught us how to square up and tackle with our shoulders. I learned over the years that if I drove into the numbers, and lifted with my legs, the player would leave the ground, and I could slam him to the grass, just like in NFL films from SI. Every year, the coaches went CRAZY. They loved it. Hell, everyone loved it. I loved football. I loved the aggressiveness, the violence, and especially the fact that not everyone wasn’t built for it. So does James…you can kind of tell. He has something to prove, and he is willing to sacrifice his body for it. He loves the game…anyone who was cut by the Baltimore Birdies special teams, and still continued to go for it, LOVES the game.\r\n\r\nSo why, Goodell and your Referee Minions, did you need to find a poster boy for your new rule agenda? Why did you need one at all? And why James? Just make your ridiculous rules, and apply them to EVERYONE. We just celebrated the guy for his tenacity, aggressiveness, and dedication 2 years ago…and now you are going to fine him 4 times for hits that he has been doing for 8 years. Does this have to do with his lack of maturity and bad reputation in high school, or does the obvious chip on his shoulder scare you into thinking what he is actually capable of? I have been watching this game with tactical knowledge for years, and I see hits like that ALL of the time, and I just saw some last week, and nothing was flagged, and no one was fined on Monday. Are you like a child in Elementary school with selective hearing and seeing?? Do you want to haze this guy out of the league for some reason? What is your freaking agenda Rog? Anyone who has played this game has been taught how to tackle in the way I listed above…square up, lower shoulder, drive through the numbers (with your shoulder), wrap your arms, knock the opponent down. One thing that happens with this style is the more than occasionally; your helmet strikes the crown, or side of the facemask of your opponent. This gives you something that all aggressive players of the game want…gashes and paint on your helmet. Do you want the player to be injured? No. Do you want to look and be tough, and send a message to that player and that team? Your damn skippy you do. You wanna know why? Because that’s football. \r\n\r\nDon’t take this game and the alpha male brutality it was founded on away from us.  You CAN protect our present day players from the ills of what Jim McMahon is going through right now in other ways than changing the entire game as we know it. Anyone who has played a game like football, hockey, fell off their bike, or got beaten up outside the bar, knows what a concussion feels like. I’ve had 3…you can kind of tell. They are horrible, and scary. So am I saying that I want Josh Cribbs to get his bell rung and potentionally have his career shortened? Of course not, and no one who supports Harrison would want that. What we are saying is that you CAN’T police these hits, it’s impossible. You can’t demonize a player and make him your poster boy. This is not TMZ dealing with Brittany Spears. Don’t build James up, and tear him down…he was on the damn special teams for 5 years, and he’s been cut 3 times, I would say he is sensitive to criticism. He has also done everything his coaches and family has taught him to do. He plays with passion, aggression, fights through adversity, and he is out there to win for his team, not make sure everyone is OK, and happy with his actions. This is no AYSO soccer. \r\n\r\nJames was born exactly 4 months after me in 1978, about 3 hours from where I’m sitting. I’m sure his coaches told him how to play this game that same that mine did. No coach I ever had said to hurt my opponent…but they weren’t unhappy when they saw a gash in your helmet. \r\n\r\nDon’t take this game away from us…and please, support our local linebacker. We don’t want him to go too.\r\n\r\nPS – Since I just made this the longest description for a t shirt ever, how are a few more sentences full of spiteful ramblings going to hurt…\r\nIs anyone listening to Merril Hoge?? He is childhood hero, and strong proponent to the safety of our players. Please read his book, and understand that a huge reason that he retired from severe concussions after 8 years is because Chuck Knoll ran him up the 1 & 2 hole as a fullback for 6 years. Merril ran north and south, lowered his head, and knocking over defenders. And yes, the fullback is an offensive position.  Maybe Merril and Mike Allstot should be fined for their hits on defenseless middle linebackers, years ago, just so everyone gets the gist of Rog’s new agenda.\r\n\r\n* This design is printed on Anvil ring spun cotton tees.

I was so excited, I had to make a shirt about it.\r\n\r\nOn October 16, 2001, I met with Phil Bourque and Arron Asham. This is the story:\r\n\r\nI emailed Joe Bendel, from 970 ESPN, on 10/18 asking if he could get a tee I made to Asham. Joe told me that my best bet would be to attend a taping of \"Along the Boards\" on 10/21, which Phil Bourque will be hosting with Asham at River’s Casino.\r\nSo, I put aside my nerves, and attended the show last night. We were able to get to the back room of the Wheelhouse at Rivers Casino, 10 minutes before the show started. I went up to Arron and told him that I was a fan of his. I handed him the tee and told him he inspired me to make a design and shirt. He looked surprised, and then smiled, and asked if he could take a look at it. As he opened it, I said, “I know you apologized for this, but I thought it was awesome.”  He took one look at it and started to smile. This was a wonderful reaction, because I was expecting a sullen, tough guy who might just think I am glorifying something that he had to apologize for, or think I was a creepy fan. The only thing that was going wrong at this point was some Miller Lite promotions girl was doing a half-assed job at flirting me into buying her beer. Arron was asking me questions, and this young lady kept interrupting him about contests and shitty beer. (I kept thinking about the irony of someone interrupting such an important conversation for me, as I gave a hockey enforcer a tee I made, which celebrated the beating of a pest). I threw out something about my wife, which made her leave, and I continued talking to Asham.  Arron then looked at Bourque (Ole 2-9er) and said, \"Look at this!\" Ole 2-9er said, “That’s so awesome!” and started analyzing the shirt to a couple crewmembers. I was literally frozen at this point…I had been so nervous, drove down there not even knowing if I would get to talk to Arron, and expecting he and 2-9er to be annoyed with me… my pessimistic mind couldn’t believe such a great thing was happening…2 people, whom I enormously respect, like something I made in the basement.  I was just so happy at that moment. I felt very proud.\r\nMeanwhile, outside of my head, Arron kept thanking me, and telling me how cool the idea was. He seemed flattered. I asked for a picture and Arron immediately complied. I was still shitting bricks, and amusingly, Arron had to give me directions on how to do this picture. He said, “let’s get the shirt in the picture.” Arron grabbed it, I just stood there, and then he said, “You take this side of the tee”. I just said, “Right. Thank you.” \r\nBourque asked me how I made it. I began to tell them the actual printing and design process, at which time the show’s producer came up and thanked me for making the tee, asked if I would be interested in promoting the tee on 970 ESPN, handed me a card, asked me to contact him over the weekend, and told me the show was starting. What are the chances of that happening?!\r\nI watched the show from the front lounge chairs in the little studio area they have in that bar. Most of the people were just hanging out and eating, so it felt like 2-9er and Asham were doing a show for me and about 6 other people. During a couple of the breaks (and as my panic settled), I would go up and talk to Arron a little more.  He was SO genuine and nice. He was very interested wanted to hear what I had to say about t shirts and puck. He asked me about the creation of the tee, I told him the timeline of events, and how much I loved his actions that Thursday. I told him that I spent 9 hours just on the design, that I was proud of his role on the team, and I wanted to get the design perfect in hopes to represent the great things the fans and I thought of him. Arron said it was perfect. He kept smiling when I would bring up the Beagle fight…I could tell that he felt his actions were warranted (including his hand gestures), and he did indeed apologize due to pressure from management, agent, whoever. Bourque kept smirking during this conversation as well. During the show, Bourque mentioned Arron’s role as an enforcer on several different teams, at which point the Ole 2-9er and Asham both looked up at me. That put me on cloud 9.\r\nAt the end of the show, I went and talked to them both once more. Josh, the 970 producer, took a picture of Bourque, Asham, and I with his nice camera. 2-9er told me again that I did a great job, and that he liked my work. Asham reiterated that point, and said he would be wearing the tee around. I told them how much those words meant to me. \r\nI left Rivers and went straight to Primanti’s in the Strip.

As we all now know, Tim has an affiliation to the conservative right wing political movement/group, \"The Tea Party\". Due to this coincidence, this design/tee has taken on a new life, since it's original release in January '11. Although I do support everyone's right for free speech, and do not care about an athletes political views, I feel I must note that this tee was not made in support of any political movement. \r\n\r\nOriginal write up, posted January, 2011:\r\n\r\nThe Bruins faithful have nicknamed goalie Tim Thomas “TT the Bear”, given the Bruins bear logo as well as sharing the name with a very popular underground watering hole for local bands in Central Square, Cambridge MASS. Tim Thomas is the epitome of perseverance; inspiring whether you’re talking about hockey, or just trying to do your job the best you can (and not get fired). TT was once cut from the Bruins, but refused to leave the facility, making everyone aware that they would have to drag him out of the building if the team really wished to take his job. Needless to say, no one drug him out. \r\nTim has constantly defended his job, proving why he should have it. He has won one Vezina, and is one track to win another in ‘11. For years, he toiled around the AHL, IHL, ECHL, HIFK, and several other Euorpean leagues before finally making a lasting mark in the NHL in 2002. Tim has also played the role of a young New England hockey hero during his 4 year tenor at the University of Vermont. He and roommate Marty St. Louis helped the Catamounts to their first Frozen Four appearance in 1996. TT is ranked third in Division I history with 3,950 career saves, and is a two-time NCAA East All-American. \r\nTim ended up being picked 217th by the Nordiques in the ’94 entry draft following his senior year. Who would of thought he also would one day represent the States in the Olympics.\r\n\r\nTim’s conviction, attitude, and work ethic are exactly what the people of Boston, and puck fans in general, love. He has honed his skills in every league imaginable, worked his way to the top, and takes steps to improve himself year after year. He stays humble and hungry like he is certain that his job will be taken away from tomorrow. \r\n\r\nIn an age where goalie helmets are as much of an artistic statement as much as a protection device, TT’s is magnificently simple. Monotone, creative, and visually stunning, the art on this helmet is by far the best in the league. With goalies trying to one up each other with multiple colors and too many concepts, TT’s has the one that stands out the most…and the irony is that the art is black and grey. \r\n\r\nI hope I can do Tim, and the designer of the helmet, justice by this print. It’s been in the works for a while, and there is no better time to release it than the present.\r\n\r\nThis was written the day after the B’s clinched their first Cup appearance since ’90. I wish the team and the city of Boston all the hockey luck in the world and hope the loyal Bruin fans receive the ultimate Boston TT Party they deserve. I would have loved to have seen the B’s and my hometown Pens battle for the Wales Conference title, but that was not meant to be this year. \r\n\r\nThere is no other team, or city, more deserving of the Cup than Boston and no other fanbase more deserving of TT the Bear. \r\n\r\nOne last thing...Timmy owns one of these shirts. The fact that he owns something hand made from the shop makes me incredibly proud. \r\n\r\n* This design is printed on Anvil ring spun cotton tees.

Growing up, there was nothing more awe-inspiring than watching Mario begin to bring glory and respect to the Pittsburgh area in the early ‘90’s…especially when you are busy having your sole trampled by Bubby Brister and Barry Bonds. The Pens were a bright spot in a dark time in Pittsburgh Sports. However, we would soon have a blemish on that magnificent beginning to hockey in the ‘90’s, placed there by one defensive goon, Ulf Samuelsson. \r\n\r\nCam Neely was any hockey fan’s ultimate player. Classy, tough, talented, and aggressive. Neely's success stemmed largely from his hard, accurate shot, quick release, and his willingness to engage in the more physical aspects of the game. At 6 ft 1 in and 215 lb, Neely was as devastating with his body checks and fists, as he was with his goal scoring exploits. He became the archetype of the ultimate power forward and earned the nickname 'Bam-Bam Cam'. Cam became the blueprint general managers looked for in the drafts, representing a combination of toughness and talent. They would say that they needed to find a \"Cam Neely\" type. Neely's intense efforts to come back time and again from his devastating injuries were recognized with his winning of the Masterton Trophy after the 1993–94 season. In ’96, A degenerative hip condition forced Neely into retirement. His #8 jersey has been retired by the Bruins, making him the tenth player to have a number retired by the team. \r\nIf that wasn’t enough to endear him to you, off the ice, Neely overcame deep personal family tragedies, with both his parents dying of cancer. This of course has made him very aware of those whose circumstances are less fortunate than his own. Today, Neely remains active in the Cam Neely Foundation run in conjunction with the New England Medical Center, where patients and their families avail themselves of accommodation at the \"Neely House\" while undergoing cancer treatments.\r\nIn June, 2010, Cam was named team President of the Boston Bruins.\r\n\r\nPersonally speaking (as a Pittsburgh loyalist), I always fell back on Boston sports because the similarities in the fans, work ethic, and pride in their local sports. Historically speaking, there is nothing better to read about than Boston and Pittsburgh sports. I have no qualms’ saying that I love both cities. Although Pats/Steelers games fill me full of spiteful, intense rage, I always love a Bruins/Pens matchup. It was great seeing the two talented teams go head to head, and still is. I might add that both franchises were in a legal battle in 1980 over the usage of the Black and Gold colors (a whole other story…).  \r\n\r\nOn May 11, 1991, during Game 3 of the 1991 Prince of Wales Conference Finals, Neely was checked by Ulf Samuelsson, and injured on the play, and was hit again to the knee in game 6…a blatant \"cheap\" hit by Samuelsson. Pens fan’s saw Samuelsson hand out many of these hits, but this one was different, considering who he had taken the shot at, and the circumstances of Game 3. Compounding the situation was the fact that Neely developed myositis ossificans in the injured area. The injury kept Neely out of all but 22 games of the next two seasons, and he would never play more than 49 games again due to the incredible pain.\r\n\r\nThat being said…Cam, I’m a big fan, and I’m sorry. Hockey Gods, please accept this peace offering. \r\n\r\n* This design is printed on Anvil ring spun cotton tees. These tees are incredibly soft, comfortable, and flexible.

He has a nice head of hair?\r\n\r\nAdam Rank is a writer, stand-up comedian, radio personality and television host. He should list his occupation as “magician” because he was somehow able to fool the NFL into thinking he's talented.\r\n\r\nRank was born and raised in Southern California yet managed to avoid the sun so magnificently that he earned the nickname “Diablo Blanco.” He also earned “O.C.'s Funniest Finalist of 2009, 2010 and 2011” for his stand-up comedy performances. Losing out each year to good judgment.\r\n\r\nAnd if you think his stand-up is bad, he's even less funny when he sits down every week on the NFL Network's “NFL Fantasy Live.” While at the “kid's table,” he reads tweets from other people that were actually able to come up with something interesting to say. Tune in.\r\n\r\nAdam was hired by the NFL in 1995. And he worked so hard with his writings and “Pick Six” columns he was finally rewarded with his television debut in 2010. Fifteen years later. The only slower rise is his metabolism. Have you seen this guy's neck? Neither has he.\r\n\r\nAdam is probably most famous for his work on “The Adam Rank Gridiron Podcast for Kids.” This is when Rank corners athletes into answering questions until they threaten bodily harm. Once again, tune in.\r\n\r\nHis “NFL Fantasy Live” colleague Dave Dameshek describes Adam Rank as having “the perfect face for radio.” That's why he hired him to co-host the “Dave Dameshek Football Program.” Or as Rank calls it, “Adam's Weekly Valentine to the Los Angeles Rams.”\r\n\r\nAdam loves the Los Angeles Rams. If he loved them anymore, he'd drink them. Hate to say Rank is a drunken mess, but Lindsay Lohan is taking notes.\r\n\r\nAnd don't think his love for L.A. sports stop there. Nope, he loves the Lakers, Angels and Kings too. Truthfully, he thinks by going to games in Los Angeles, he'll actually be able to put his name on IMDb. Hey, nobody said loyalty equals intelligence.\r\n\r\nHe's also got horrible taste in music. What do Poison, Motley Crue and Cinderella have in common? They're all funnier than Adam Rank. Hair bands, really? I think Alanis Morrissette has another hit on her hands.\r\n\r\nSo if you like wrestling and “Hot Tub Time Machine” and Lynyrd Skynyrd, well, you've failed at life. But don't worry cause Adam Rank did too. And you can show your support by proudly displaying your “Rank Amateurs” tee.\r\n\r\nShow “America!” you're always drunk and don't care who knows it.\r\n\r\nWritten by Larry Farish\r\n\r\n* Original artwork by founder of LCS Hockey, Mike Dell.

He was a martyr for his craft, and shaped the stand-up world in ways he could of never imagined, while he was performing the art himself. Lenny Bruce, as he was known on stage, fell victim to his opiate addiction in 1966, and I was still 12 years from being born. I know about Lenny Bruce only through the admiration of my idols; Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Howard Stern, Denis Leary, Louis C.K., and even Bill Cosby revere him in the highest respect. As the years push on, and more verbal and moral liberties are taken in modern day media, his legend grows. Lenny was the lone trailblazer, seemingly taking on the right of free speech single-handedly. He pushed the limits of decency, or what the conservative general public felt was decent at the time. He looked at himself as a free-flowing, improvisational jazzman, but instead of a horn instrument, he had his mouth, mind, and satire. He wasn’t afraid of lampooning politician’s and the questionable politics of the time. He loved to poke fun at dark aspects of human nature, and practiced a keen sense of sarcasm. He loved to intertwine impersonations and voices and plain silliness into hard-hitting social commentary. He lived his craft, he believed his cause, and he died a martyr so that we can all have a choice on what was funny, dirty, distasteful, or just plain brilliant. \r\nGod bless you Lenny Bruce. I wish I could of lived through your life, but I will have to settle for the recordings. Thank you for spending the few days you had, battling what seemed to be an unwinnable war, so we could all cope with our lives with a little, honest, laughter. \r\n\r\n* This design is printed on Anvil ring spun cotton tees.

In the real world we call Cadet Zed, Robert \"Bobcat\" Goldthwait. 24 years later Bobcat is writing and producing films, ultimately proving that success is not the absence of failure, and comedic talents often reach their intended peak through trial, tribulation, and perseverance.  \r\nIn 2009, Zed wrote and directed and movie called \"World's Greatest Dad\". The movie is actually pretty funny, and stars Robin WIlliams. But, the important part here is the fact that Bobcat comes up with the best high school mascot ever...Macdonald High School \"Fighting Pugs\". Not only is this mascot hilariously ironic, but I am a pug owner and all around pug fan. So, I just had to take the school logo, twist it to fit Backpage's needs, and print it. So, if you love Zed, Bobcat, pugs, mascots, high schools, funny shit, etc...this shirt's for you.\r\nThank you so much Cadet/Officer Zed.\r\n\r\n* This design is printed on \"New Silver\" Anvil ring spun cotton tees with Navy Blue ink.
