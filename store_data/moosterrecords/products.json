THE UECKERS are an original baseball punk band for 2013, and their songs are brief, to the point and every one a potential hit.\r\n\r\nThe duo consists of J. Uecker and B.Uecker.  The two guitarists, play with such force that their sound has been compared to a hundred howling howitzers going off. The two share singing responsibilities and the drummer's (yet to be named) pulsating playing launches the throbbing sound of the band.\r\n\r\nTHE UECKERS all originate from the north side of Chicago and kids who grew up there became musicians, degenerates or dentists. THE UECKERS are a little of each. Their sound is not unlike the sound of a fast drill on a rear molar.\r\n\r\nWith no budget, no cares and a constant soundtrack(and press release) lifted from THE RAMONES they show their undying love for baseball and punk rock with 14 blistering budget rock tunes that when paired with a cold Old Style will get you through the summer ahead.\r\n\r\nGO CUBBIES!\r\n\r\nK-N-U-C-K!

The Cry! from Portland Oregon bring you two smoldering tracks on their side starting off with the lamentful \"Discotheque\" and capping it off with a blistering rendition of The Boys' \"T.C.P\"! Might we have another \"Alternative Chartbuster\" on our hands? On the flip side are the kinds of songs that paved the way for the rock n roll that we love today. The Connection from Portsmouth, NH has a sound that takes all influences of rock n roll and swirls them around into a dance party that sounds like the Beatles, Ramones and Chesterfield Kings got together for a Sunday gig at CBGB's. The first track a cover of garage rock forefather's The Myddle Class' \"Don't Let Me Sleep Too Long\" shows you what we are working with right out of the gate. The second track is one of my personal favorite tracks called \"She's Gonna Leave You\" and already has reached a very wide audience with plays on \"Little Steven's Underground Garage\". Alot of rock n roll from both ends of the spectrum on one of the best 7\"s that Mooster has released! \r\n\r\nSpecial U.S. only white vinyl and Japan only red vinyl!
