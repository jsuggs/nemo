The new album, true to DIY tradition, was entirely self-produced and is the second release on Dayton, Ohio's Consumer Value Deluxe Recordings.  Consisting of sixteen face-melting tracks, “Good Is Dead” delivers a massive dose of My Latex Brain’s signature brand of sonic brutality.\r\n\r\n     “Since 1999,My Latex Brain has been trafficking in an extreme blend of industrial music and punk rock. \"Good is Dead,\" the new album from Hoops (vocals, keyboards), Chris Corn (bass) and Roger Owsley (drums), is firmly in that wheelhouse but has a higher quotient of melody mixed within the noise.”  - Don Thrasher, Dayton Daily News    \r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n    1 Blunderstacks\r\n    2 Save Your Skin\r\n    3 Off With the Shithead\r\n    4 Letter to the President\r\n    5 Rocketship for Mungo\r\n    6 Star Spangled Meat Suit\r\n    7 Remover Installer\r\n    8 Good Is Dead\r\n    9 Black Pupa\r\n    10 Brownpaper Lightshow\r\n    11 Sad Pill\r\n    12 Back to the Evil\r\n    13 L.A.

It's not to often when you come across a female fronted Rock band that actually Rock the stage with such aggressive behavior. I have seen this band live many of times and have always wandered why they haven't recorded...but the best things come to those who wait. This CD has brought out the absolute best of what AOP can deliver... MIMINARI is a perfect example of how ROCK'nROLL still lives in the hearts of us all and how it will never die. Gretta Smak (vocals/guitar) brings a slight soulful at times...but powerful presence throughout this disc while the rest of the band equally match up the rest of the missing pieces that bring everything together as a unit to make this band come alive.  Powerhouse drums throughout...great guitars...driving bass lines is all that matters to create a great ROCK band and this band has it all. Most noted tracks on this CD have to be (The Drifter) and (AKA) that bring forth their most creative side of how this band does things right. So the next time your thinking about looking for something new from a local band...give these guys a shot and see them live.
