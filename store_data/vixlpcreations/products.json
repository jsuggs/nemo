This is what we hope these earrings combine and depict.\r\n\r\nPENTHESILEA was an Amazonian queen and sister of Hippolyta, Antiope and Melanippe. Penthesilea had killed Hippolyta with a spear when they were hunting deer; this accident caused Penthesilea so much grief that she wished only to die, but, as a warrior and an Amazon, she had to do so honorably and in battle. She therefore was easily convinced to join in the Trojan War, fighting on the side of Troy's defenders.\r\n\r\nHER EARRINGS represent her passion and royal origin (red colour) as well as her advanced ability as a warrior handling a spear (shape).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~Earring hooks are from surgical steel.\r\n~We sent you along rubber ear nuts, so you won't lose your beautiful purchase! :)\r\n~Read our POLICIES before any purchase.\r\n~Item shipped worldwide, registered, from Greece.\r\n\r\n*We are verified by PAYPAL.* ","options":[{"id":9891008,"name":"Default","price":26.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":91,"name":"Cyprus","code":"CY"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":0.8}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27390032/-/PA130013.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27390032/-/PA130013.JPG","width":800,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1679240,"name":"Amazon Feather Earrings","permalink":"amazon-feather-earrings","url":"/category/amazon-feather-earrings"}]}]
