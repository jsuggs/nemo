Its been almost 15 years since Jordan Brand became it own   subsidiary brand under the Nike umbrella in 1998 and relinquished all   uses of the Nike Swoosh or \"Air\" logo. But now in 2013, JB has already   released two models which go back to their roots bearing the logo that   gave birth to the Jumpman. The first was the Air Jordan I (1) Retro High   OG \"Knicks\" edition and this AJIII \"White Cement\" model which features   the \"Nike Air\" logo on the heel counter as well as on the insole and   hangtag. This is a retro of the original 1988 Air Jordan III (3) worn by   MJ during the 1988 NBA Dunk Contest where he dunked from the free-throw   line. If you are a true OG -head or sneakerhead of any sort this pair   has become a must have in your collection.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.preorderjordans2013.com/580775-160-air-jordan-3-retro-88-white-cement-667.html\"><strong>White Cement 3S</strong></a><br/>\r\nItem No:580775-160<br>\r\n  Color:White/Fire Red-Cement Grey-Black<br>\r\n  Released:February 6, 2013</p>","options":[{"id":35441400,"name":"Default","price":119.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110029521/-/201305101717051323390731.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110029521/-/201305101717051323390731.jpg","width":648,"height":648}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5317074,"name":"jordan shoes","permalink":"jordan-shoes","url":"/category/jordan-shoes"}]},{"id":11187663,"name":"308497-089 Air Jordan 4 Bred Black/Cement Grey-Fire Red","permalink":"308497-089-air-jordan-4-bred-black-cement-grey-fire-red","position":2,"price":124.0,"default_price":124.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/308497-089-air-jordan-4-bred-black-cement-grey-fire-red","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-05-16T08:25:40.000Z","description":"<p>This is the <a href=\"http://www.preorderjordans2013.com/308497-089-air-jordan-4-bred-black-cement-grey-fire-red-646.html\"><strong>Air Jordan Bred 4S</strong></a>, making its   triumphant return later this year.

Having a release   date on December   21st, the shoe is dressed in the Jordan Brand's   famous Black / Red   colorway. Built from a combination of patent   leather and nylon mesh,   the high top sneaker sits atop a White midsole   and translucent Red   outsole. This December, Jordan Brand brings us   full circle with the legendary championship-clenching colorway that   capped off the greatest season of all time and started a Christmas   tradition that keeps the memories as fresh as 1996.
