THAT' S HOW LONG IT TAKES TO COMPLETE THESE SOLOS AND SHAKE OFF THESE HANGOVERS.  TAKE HEED...TAKE WEED...TAKE REAL DRUGS!!!!!  PARTY BAT here...I found some technology and set it up in a very nice sounding cave, acoustically that is.  I called up Strawberry but he was already here.  Some time later, KURT COBRAIN took interest, and these PARTY ANTHEMS and BAT SIGNALS were sent across time, through the booze-soaked wires...through a paper cone made of electric drips.  DUDE DILLIGENCE found it very rhythmic and yeah...we fuckin rule.  This LP very clearly marks the mark of the unicorn, bathing in the waterfall of booze we had provided to it.  You drip sensual party sensory sensations from your pocket to your eyelid after literally listening to it one time.  NEVER EVER FORGET.  THE PARTY IS HERE.\r\n\r\nBLACK VINYL = $10\r\nLTD.

He is a nocturnal rock n roll animal. When a keg smashes through that police car windshield and a black figure disappears into the darkness....it was him. When you walk in the door after work and your girlfriend mysteriously has a condom hanging out of her ass...it was him. The signal could come up at any time...and for any reason...interrupting the mysterious character peeing on his own shoes behind a dumpster. â€œFuck...another party situation\" and the bottle drops. In this first installment of party themes, small children can play musical chairs with songs mangled, drunk tunes reminiscent of The Spits, Catatonic Youth, Ramones and Wax Museums, delivered by a masked animal that is simultaneously as cheesy as David Lee Roth and as sexy as David Lee Roth's dick...on weed. Choose your own adventure kids. But homework gets you nowhere. Party Bat is actively searching for the party.
