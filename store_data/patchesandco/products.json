No, not really, of course it's Eduardo. With a mask like this, what else?! He has been laser cut by our friends at Finest Imaginary and etched into 3mm polished cherry veneered wood.\r\nHe measures 5 X 4 centimetres. He is hung on an 18 inch gold plated trace chain.\r\nIn real life he is even more beautiful but only comes out at night.\r\n\r\nALL P&P is included in the price.\r\n\r\nWE have lots more products but seeing as we haven't been selling much on the website recently, decided to downgrade the site for a bit. So please message us about other products you may have previously seen or are interested in. In the meantime we at Patches & Co HQ are wondering what to do next. Which direction to take etc. if you have any good ideas please let us know. Otherwise watch this space!!
