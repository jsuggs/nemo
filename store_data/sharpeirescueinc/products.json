Medium (neck size 30-37.5cm, neck to snout 20cm), \r\n\r\nBetter that the plastic Elizabethan collar, The Comfy Cone is made from nylon fabric laminated onto ½” foam making it soft and yielding while remaining very sturdy and protective, with its solid material your pet will no longer be chasing “ghosts” in their peripheral vision, making them much more relaxed so they can heal quicker. The Comfy Cone can be folded back to allow pets to eat and drink in comfort, or to allow checking of wounds, is water resistant and wipes clean easily. With its reflective binding you will never loose you pet in the dark again and, if you feel The Comfy Cone is a little too plain for your dog you can jazz it up with waterproof markers. \r\n \r\nThe Comfy Cone came into existence when Sabre refused to wear a plastic Elizabethan collar however he needed something to prevent him from getting to his damaged tail, desperate for a better solution his owners made a collar from a foam exercise mat. From these humble beginnings, and with Sabre’s vets advice and encouragement, The Comfy Cone was developed. Once the design was considered ideal it was rigorously tested using some of America’s vets worse Elizabethan collar patients, when The Comfy Cone could stand up to the worst of these dogs without damage it was then produced for all animals to be able to heal in comfort. The Comfy Cone has been well and truly veterinary tested and approved and works in America, now it is available to Australian pets to make their journey back to perfect health much easier.\r\n \r\n****Other sizes available upon request","options":[{"id":11151077,"name":"Comfy Cone - medium","price":39.46,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31852961/-/comfy_cone.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31852961/-/comfy_cone.jpg","width":300,"height":225}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1890225,"name":"Dog products","permalink":"dog-products","url":"/category/dog-products"},{"id":1890289,"name":"Elizabethean collar","permalink":"elizabethean-collar","url":"/category/elizabethean-collar"}]},{"id":3282819,"name":"Pet Life Vet Bed Gold","permalink":"pet-life-vet-bed-gold","position":3,"price":94.99,"default_price":94.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pet-life-vet-bed-gold","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-02-14T06:48:36.000Z","description":"127cm x 76 cm (50\" x 30\")  \r\n\r\nPet Life Bed GoldVetbed Gold, available colours: Blue, White, Red, Grey.

Vetbed is recommended and widely used by UK vets; they find the fabric the safest and most effective ever produced for use in conjunction with veterinary medicine, surgery and general animal welfare. In spite of its luxurious real fur feel, it has tremendous strength and durability because it’s made with double strength polyester. This high density of fibres not only provides extreme comfort for your pet; it also means the bedding retains heat by trapping air, keeping your pet warm and cosy all year round. Vetbed is suitable for whelping & kittening. Older animals are also able to achieve a higher degree of comfort and mobility as the constant warmth is a great advantage to ageing muscles and joints. The unique drainage properties of Vetbed means that if your pet has an “accident” it will drain straight through the bed, leaving the top surface and your pet dry. This bedding is also invaluable for any animal recovering from illness or surgery; it helps reduce pressure & friction and keeps body temperature normal whilst keeping your pet comfortable, thereby reducing the risk of hypothermia. Petlife International was formed in 1993 by a management buy-out of Vetbed (Animal Care) Ltd & Harkers and has become UK’s leading provider of quality pet bedding; they have been at the forefront of providing these products to both professional and domestic pet owners since, they pride themselves on delivering great customer service, coupled with a growing & innovative product range.","options":[{"id":11151003,"name":"Vetbed Gold - 50\"x30\"","price":94.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31852689/-/Vet_bed.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31852689/-/Vet_bed.jpg","width":150,"height":100}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1890225,"name":"Dog products","permalink":"dog-products","url":"/category/dog-products"},{"id":1890287,"name":"Pet bedding","permalink":"pet-bedding","url":"/category/pet-bedding"}]},{"id":3282715,"name":"Slow feed bowl 38cm","permalink":"slow-feed-bowl-38cm","position":4,"price":27.97,"default_price":27.97,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/slow-feed-bowl-38cm","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-02-14T06:19:19.000Z","description":"Dog Dish Flying Saucer Stainless Steel \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLYING SAUCER 38CM \r\n\r\nKeep Mr & Miss Piggy from devouring their meals with this flying saucer dish.
