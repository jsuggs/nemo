It is inclusive and embracing - reminding us that we can maintain separate identities and still beautifully mingle together!\r\n\r\nThough we specifically counted and labeled this crystal kit for the \"Kumihimo with Beads\" video project, you can use the colors in any project you wish (such as spiral rope or any seed bead project).\r\n\r\nThe kumihimo braided bracelet was designed with special intentions in mind: acceptance, gratitude, love, joy, and the ability to \"go with the flow\".\r\n\r\nWear your bracelet with the promise of good things to come! Feel energized, focused, and present in your body. This kit has been made with lots of LOVE!  As YOU make this bracelet, fill it with YOUR intentions so that every time this bracelet is worn, it carries all the love in your heart.\r\n\r\nWith your purchase of this kit, the Kumihimo with Beads downloadable video is our gift to you!
