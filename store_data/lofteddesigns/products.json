The circles are roughly the size of a dime. Lightweight, simple, gorgeous. \r\n\r\nThey go with absolutely everything and can accessorize a business suit, a casual evening ensemble or a group of bridesmaids.\r\n\r\nHere is how they came to be: I recently saw the movie Wanderlust starring Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd. During the film, I kept noticing Aniston's beautifully simple circle earrings. I tried researching the designer behind them so I could purchase a pair for myself, but all I could find was information about Aniston's jewelry designer friend who, as far as I can tell, did not design the earrings. She designed the necklaces and rings seen in the film, but no credit was attributed to the silver circles. \r\n\r\nSo, after Googling every possible word combination and finally running out of ideas, I decided to make a similar pair myself. And I loved wearing them so much, I made a few more pairs to sell in my shop!\r\n\r\nView more photos of these earrings here:\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/107180583/wanderlust-earrings-inspired-by-the-film","options":[{"id":29449634,"name":"Default","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/92516114/-/il_fullxfull.372550767_boex.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/92516114/-/il_fullxfull.372550767_boex.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":99430,"name":"Earrings","permalink":"earrings","url":"/category/earrings"}]},{"id":3622786,"name":"Custom Class Ring - 2013 Graduation Gift","permalink":"custom-class-ring-2011-graduation-gift","position":2,"price":49.0,"default_price":49.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/custom-class-ring-2011-graduation-gift","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-04-19T20:20:46.000Z","description":"Ever wish there was some alternative to the traditional, bulky class rings they sell to students? Well now there is! I will create a unique sterling silver class ring just for you.\r\n\r\nYou choose the band style (thin or thick, wide or skinny) and the finish you prefer (brushed, polished or hammered) and let me know exactly what you'd like it to say. Maybe it's your name or your goofy nickname. Maybe it's the name of your school or simply \"CLASS OF 2013\" (any year is available). Stamp it on the outside and tell the world you graduated, or stamp it on the inside for a more discreet look.\r\n\r\nThe point is your class ring should represent who you are. Not who everyone else is. These rings are available for men and women and can be made in all sizes!\r\n\r\nI sure wish options like this were readily available when I was in high school...maybe I wouldn't have ended up with that chunky thing that sits tarnishing at the bottom of my jewelry box!\r\n\r\nCustom orders will be ready in just two weeks!
