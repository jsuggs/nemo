Their name is a portmanteau of \"ska\" and \"Mephistopheles\", of Goethe's Faust. As their name suggests, their lyrics are often playfully Satanic in nature.\r\nThe band began when New York hardcore band The Shaved Pigs split up, and guitarist Brendan Tween and roommate Mikal Reich decided to start a ska band. After recruiting several friends, including keyboardist Brian \"Underpants\" Martin, the band was formed under the name Skatterbrains. It was changed to Mephiskapheles once the band realized that another band had already taken the name. On January 3, 1991, the band made its first public appearance at a venue in Long Island. After a small lineup shuffle, the band recorded their demo tape titled The DEMOn. The band continued to play live and build a fan base over the next few years.\r\n\r\nTrack listing\r\n\r\nAttack of the Geniuses\r\nBreak Your Ankle Punk\r\nBad Toupee\r\nSatan On the Beach\r\nAliens\r\nSate\r\nDemon Weed\r\nIntroducing the Yellow Passion\r\nFoursome\r\nSnack Pack\r\nPlan B\r\nTurtle Soup\r\nScram\r\n","options":[{"id":51035304,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129701478/-/skapheles.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129701478/-/skapheles.jpg","width":933,"height":939},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129701484/-/mephiskapheles-1380026667.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129701484/-/mephiskapheles-1380026667.jpg","width":600,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":15682788,"name":"Buck'o'nine - Sustain ","permalink":"buck-o-nine-sustain","position":2,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/buck-o-nine-sustain","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-21T01:04:17.000Z","description":"Buck-O-Nine is an American ska punk band which was formed in San Diego in 1991.

Hailing from the wilds of Mid Wales, their line up features former 3 Minute Warning keyboardist/vocalist Chuzz & former Smoke Like A Fish guitarist/vocalist Tran.\r\nThe Cartoon Violence sound is an insanely catchy affair that mixes super bouncy 2 tone ska with distinctly British sounding pop & indie stylings. Their songs capture the classic Brit Pop storytelling vibe of the likes of The Kinks, Madness, Squeeze, The Hotknives & Parklife-era Blur, with each tune lyrically being like a mini kitchen sink drama in its own right! Endless soaring energy, great sing-a-long choruses & wonderful piano melodies are all hallmarks of the band's unique ska sound.\r\n\r\n“Unbelievable! This band is great. Britpop Twotone?! The Beatles meets Madness?! I don't know how to describe it but I love it”\r\n-Tim (Vegas) Mighty Mighty Bosstones\r\n\r\n“From the first chords of the opening track, Vauxhall Nova, you're hooked and wanting more, Jangly pianos, real life lyrics... A CD full of contagious tunes that I bet will go down a storm live. Fingers crossed this lot continue because their potential sounds tremendous”\r\n-Scootering Magazine – Album Of The Month\r\n\r\n“The lyrics are clever and very catchy, the sound quality and musicianship are first rate, Piano is featured prominently and it sounds great Classic UK pop ska!”\r\n-Musical Occupation webzine!

There are undertones of 3MW in the sound, but this CD, particularly in the second half, is a bit darker. This is certainly a very good debut CD, which i have been listening to a hell of a lot”\r\n-TNS Records Zine\r\n\r\n“That's a blinding song you've got there..great stuff..!!”\r\n-(Attic) Mick Clare – Squid/Hotknives\r\n\r\n“I would have spent a bit more time/effort casting the role of Teresa in the Video! hurh hurh, nice tune, liked the piano solo!\"\r\n-(Teresa Video) Mike Barson - Madness\r\n\r\n“This cd has been in constant rotation, when I tell you I also ordered The Aggrolites and I haven't played it yet I think you get the message! Its absolutely bloody unbelievably fantastic. Its probably been produced on a shoestring but the songs are so strong I can't begin to tell you how talented this guy is.\r\n\r\nStrong melodies, story telling lyrics and ska of light and shade and different moods. The ska attack of 3MW is in there as too are the keyboards under pinning everything but there is a more considered approach to how each song is tackled and the result is, well, effective to say the least!\r\n\r\nThere are nine tracks and they are all class but Attic, Do Something About It and Johnny Come Lately are absolutely stunning. So ORDER IT, you'll not be disappointed, its a release that you will play again and again.”\r\n-Simon Flaherty\r\n\r\n“A plethora of potential is located here and if CV attain the quality of these 9 tracks then they are going to earn some incredible praise and appreciation. One of the finds of the year and it will be more than interesting as to what their next release will sound like and what in fact they are like as a 'live' band.

That tune and others from the latest by Montreal's the Planet Smashers is the perfect soundtrack to the most imperfect dance style. On Descent Into The Valley Of…, the Smashers are in tip-top form, serving up sizzling platters of third-wave ska with a little punk thrown in for rebellion's sake (see the wild and crazy \"Food Fight!!!\"). Horns are blaring, vocals are smarmy and the off-time beats are infectious. Yes, those who have an aversion toward ska (and the overuse of exclamation points) may not be entirely impressed with the prospect of listening to this album, but that's where they are so wrong. This is the kind of ska-punk that anyone can listen to: roughnecked Hatebreed fans, teary-eyed emo nerds, D-beat crusty punks and even indie-rock snobs.

D.D, Daim and Ray recruited friend and drummer Sam Shortland and immediatley started writing songs and planning a trip to the recording studio.\r\n\r\nTopnovil played there first show on the 2nd of May 1997 six days after they formed - they played three originals and three covers and since have not looked back. After a few more local shows they had raised enough to record and independently release their debut cd a 7 track EP titled \"Keen as a mule\". The cd began selling slowly but after Topnovil played more shows there popularity in the local scene increased as did cd sales.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1999 drummer Sam Shortland was replaced by Michael Seddon a guitarist and songwriter who, with the help of D.D, became Topnovil's new drummer. With this change came new songs and new directions.\r\n\r\nIn the new year of 1998 Topnovil decided it was time to explore beyond the Wollongong and hunt for exposure in the Sydney market which proved successful and led to tours to Melbourne with Melbourne's successful punk band No Idea. Along with these tour Topnovil were playing alot of local shows and receiving increased exposured from shows such as Kiama's \"Blow out\" festivals. In November 1998 Topnovil had songs \"Scenario\" and \"Wasted\" selected to be on CareFactor?ZeroRekordz compitlation \"This is Punk'o'Clock too\" along side such bands as H-Block 101, Mach Pelican, No Idea and The last hemeroids just to name a few.","options":[{"id":44214234,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124832787/-/toppy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124832787/-/toppy.jpg","width":447,"height":450}],"artists":[{"id":236010,"name":"Topnovil","permalink":"topnovil","url":"/artist/topnovil"}],"categories":[{"id":1602193,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":2687975,"name":"No Idea - Don't know yet","permalink":"no-idea-dont-know-yet","position":12,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/no-idea-dont-know-yet","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-08-06T04:13:12.000Z","description":"No Idea are a three piece punk band from Melbourne, Australia, who have an old school punk ethos and attitude complete with mohawk's, chains, leather jackets and spikes.\r\n\r\n1.NO IDEA \r\n2.FUCK ME OVER \r\n3.NEVER UNDERSTAND \r\n4.DEGRASSI \r\n5.GIMP BOY \r\n6.SEVEN \r\n7.TOO LATE \r\n8.PELICAN HILL \r\n9.PART 2 \r\n10.KLUELESS KLOWNS KLUB \r\n11.CAPTAIN KICKOUT \r\n12.SPIKE IT OR LEAVE IT \r\n13.PSYCHOBILLY DRINKING SONG \r\n14.SUPERZERO \r\n15.BOGANOGRAPHY \r\n16.NIGHTMARE ON WALL ST \r\n17.JUST FUCK OFF! \r\n18.PRIORITIES \r\n19.BELIEVE IN SOMETHING \r\n20.SOCIAL MALNUTRITION \r\n21.TIME TO BAIL \r\n\r\nALL INTERNATIONAL ORDERS WILL BE SENT WITHOUT CASES","options":[{"id":9469413,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/106583685/-/no_idea_dont_know_yet.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/106583685/-/no_idea_dont_know_yet.jpg","width":535,"height":480}],"artists":[{"id":46773,"name":"No Idea","permalink":"no-idea","url":"/artist/no-idea"}],"categories":[{"id":1602193,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":6111111,"name":"Seeling - Unatural","permalink":"seeling-unatural","position":13,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/seeling-unatural","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-05-05T07:35:52.000Z","description":"If you're into mid 90's melodic punk and hard-core, The Descendents, ALL, Bad Religion, Samiam, Unwritten Law etc., then Seeling are for you.

Since Good Luck was released we have been touring non-stop, and every cent we make is put towards gas, rent and what little food we can afford. For a while, I ate by taking people’s leftovers at the restaurants where I worked. Our furniture was taken from people’s trash, we found TV’s on the streets, and I was stealing paper towels, trash bags, toilet paper, soap, pillows - just about every necessity that clubs, colleges and hotels had to offer. Then before we knew it, we didn't even have a home. Two years homeless. We found kids all around us selling out and getting rich from their bands, while we slept on friends’ couches or in our van. The whole situation was completely unbelievable to us. In a time when Punk music is selling out faster then Pop music, or I guess, is Pop music (which goes against everything Punk stands for), it's hard to be in a band and understand how the public likes what it likes, or understand all the fucking politics these \"indie\" labels impose. \"That's just how it goes\", \"That's just how life is\", was the only way we could justify it. There is a formula to music now, and I when I was younger I never would have thought that so may musicians would give up experimenting in song writing just to pump out these Pepsi/Coke songs that have been written 100 times over. So, like you, we had a choice - we could sellout like everyone else and maybe make a buck, or record an album that we liked and continue to be poor.

Three years, and 140 shows later, the tour has gone beyond all expectations, selling over 55,000 tickets in 3 different countries and proving that indeed, ska is not dead. In fact, the tour started out to prove just that.\r\n\r\nAt a time when retail had forgotten the genre and most live venues had only marginal faith, the tour was put together on the simple principal that ska is as valid as it ever was, it just needed to be rebuilt from the grass roots on up.\r\n\r\nTo document and commemorate this success, we proudly present Ska Is Dead: The Compilation CD. Featuring 23 of the most important bands performing in the genre.
