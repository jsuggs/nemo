The thundering nine-track ruckus that is I Versus The Glacier magnifies the signature CLAMFIGHT blend of sludge, thrash, and doom that, according to Doommantia webzine, \"has more than enough groove to break down walls,\" yet ventures into even more expansive and torrentially-infectious territory on the nearly fifty-minute album.\r\n\r\nI Versus The Glacier will see release on January 22nd, 2013 exclusively through New Jersey-based The Maple Forum.\r\n \r\n\r\nCLAMFIGHT consists of Andy Martin on drums and vocals, Sean McKee on lead guitar, Joel Harris on rhythm guitar, and Louis Koble on bass. Self described as \"music for fat dudes and the buxotic women who love them,\" this crew of childhood friends has been playing together in various bands since 1997, existing together as CLAMFIGHT since 2002. Having shared the stage with great local acts including Wizard Eye, Pale Divine, Bitchslicer, Hellblock Six, Maegashira, Rukut, A Day of Pigs, Wally, as well as some more well known national acts including Kings Destroy, Solace, Jucifer, and Iron Man over the years, the band have amassed a legion of fans in the tri-state area and within the diehard doom/sludge community. Their debut, Volume I, was self released in August 2010 and has received favorable press from Doommantia and The Obelisk among others, and was named the #7 album of the year from The Obelisk's top 20 list.\r\n\r\nI vs. the Glacier Track Listing:\r\n1.

Dallas Reed (Stone Axe, Mos Generator). The vinyl single is limited to 300 and features two brand new cuts, “Flower and Song” and “There is a Light,” exploring a rarely-heard psychedelic side of the Port Orchard, Washington, native’s songwriting.\r\n\r\nReed, who is notoriously DIY, played all the instruments on HeavyPink, sang himself, and recorded the material at his own HeavyHead studio. Fans of Stone Axe will be thrilled to discover that although he is working in a different style, the signature elements of Reed’s work remain intact, most pivotally that there’s zero bullshit involved.\r\n\r\nHe explains the project’s origins thusly: “Before Mos Generator took our hiatus in 2009 we were working on an album to be called HeavyPink. When the band shelved the project I decided to pick up the concept and use it as a tool to try different recording and writing techniques. I look at it as an experiment in heavy and beautiful music, like 'Master of Reality' meets 'Pet Sounds,' meets 'Into the Pandemonium' all in one and produced by Phil Spector.”\r\n\r\nForum040 will be out mid-October 2011.","options":[{"id":14940059,"name":"Domestic US","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14940061,"name":"International","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/44696229/-/heavypink-front-cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/44696229/-/heavypink-front-cover.jpg","width":1000,"height":933}],"artists":[{"id":80019,"name":"HeavyPink","permalink":"heavypink","url":"/artist/heavypink"}],"categories":[]},{"id":3803526,"name":"Forum030: Blackwolfgoat, Dronolith","permalink":"forum030-blackwolfgoat-dronolith","position":3,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/forum030-blackwolfgoat-dronolith","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-05-24T06:31:36.000Z","description":"SOLD OUT!\r\n\r\nBLACKWOLFGOAT is a unique, progressive drone project fully performed by Darryl Shepard (Milligram, Hackman, Slapshot).
