On Oneirophrenia, the Seattle experimental metal band opens the doors to a distorted world of instrumental metal, free jazz, thrash, sludge, grindcore, and warped field/street recordings. If listeners weren’t experiencing oneirophrenia before listening to the record, they probably will be after. But don’t worry; though oneirophrenia can be a bit unsettling at first, it always ends up leaving an impression.\r\n \r\nThe album packs all of the music into one seamless 33-minute track, and then breaks that up into 7 shorter songs. The final cut (track 9) is a vocal version of Razor Wire, featuring Year of the Dragon frontman Rodcore Palmer and Dirty Walt Kibby of Fishbone.","options":[{"id":18980511,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58213615/-/oneirophrenia_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58213615/-/oneirophrenia_cover.jpg","width":1000,"height":979}],"artists":[{"id":26811,"name":"UNCLE POOCH","permalink":"uncle-pooch","url":"/artist/uncle-pooch"}],"categories":[{"id":240693,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":280333,"name":"Still Smokin'","permalink":"still-smokin","position":3,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/still-smokin","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-04-17T21:12:17.000Z","description":"Founding member of Ska-Punk-Funk Legends Fishbone unloads raw uncut Westcoast funk.
