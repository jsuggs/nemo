You decide what colors to use and other embellishments.\r\n\r\nThis one is great for all those beautiful buttons out there:)\r\n\r\nThe bag is designed to sit upright on its base. I hate it when my purse tips over:)\r\n\r\nIt is an advanced beginner level pattern...you will use strait needles for the entire project. Some simple seaming is required and I have written a full set of instructions with an illustration on how to get the most professional look possible. There is also a stitch guide provided. AND you can always contact me via email if you need any extra help:)\r\n\r\nThe main model in this listing was knit using random stripes and I just love the results. Each color was knit for 2 rows. I chose to make the side's stripes NOT match the front panels so that you could see how it is put together. It is very simple to make your stripes match up if you wish as shown in my denim blue and brown model.\r\n\r\nThe pattern provides you with easy to follow step by step instructions to create the basic shape. YOU WILL DECIDE ON what color(s) you want to work with and the extra embellishments (for example: stripe details and buttons).\r\n\r\nYou will use size 10.5 needles and 650 yards of worsted weight wool.\r\n\r\nThe U- shaped handles are easy online,  ebay and at most craft stores:)\r\n\r\nBEAUTIFUL !\r\n\r\nMeasures about:\r\n\r\n7\"h (not including the handles) x 11.5\"w x 5\"d\r\n\r\nIf we MUST use the regular mail, the pattern will have black and white pictures.
