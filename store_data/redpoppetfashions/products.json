In folklore, owls represent wisdom and helpfulness, they are also believed to be prophetic. I've always loved owls and couldn't wait to create a piece to honor these beautiful creatures. \r\n\r\nThe bracelet measures 6.5 inches when opened. There are a total of 9 buttons measuring between 7/16 inches to 1 inch. The owl is 1 inch wide and just under 1.5 inches tall.\r\nIn addition to the wise owl, there are 2 brass and black colored bottons, 2 silver and blak floral buttons, 2 gold and black bottons, 1 silver flower button and 1 dark silver with a center rhinstone button.","options":[{"id":40312029,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122035275/-/yes_(2).jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122035275/-/yes_(2).jpg","width":4320,"height":3240}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5882340,"name":"Bracelets","permalink":"bracelets","url":"/category/bracelets"}]},{"id":12670485,"name":"Customizable Silk, Brocade or Pleather (fake leather) Clutch","permalink":"custonizable-silk-brocade-or-pleather-fake-leather-clutch","position":2,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/custonizable-silk-brocade-or-pleather-fake-leather-clutch","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-30T14:43:25.000Z","description":"This is a completely customizable clutch.
