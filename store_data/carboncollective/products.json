Designed for the professional or enthusiast this is a large 200g bar. It is safe for use on painted surfaces and glass and has a medium amount of cut. It is a smooth textured clay and as such is safe to be used regularly and is ideal for removing all kinds of bonded contamination from paint. The main causes of contamination are industrial fallout, brake dust, bug splats, overspray and tree sap. So in summary if you need a clay bar with a little more cut than the dedicated enthusiast clays, but not so heavy it can cause marring on paint then this makes for an excellent choice of detailing clay.","options":[{"id":28064162,"name":"Default","price":8.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87964058/-/3m_dabest_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87964058/-/3m_dabest_2.jpg","width":640,"height":430}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":8946971,"name":"Carbon Collective - Mammoth Wash Mitt","permalink":"carbon-collective-mammoth-wash-mitt","position":2,"price":15.99,"default_price":15.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/carbon-collective-mammoth-wash-mitt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-15T00:38:57.000Z","description":"\r\nThe Gentle Giant.\r\n\r\nThis super large wash mitt soaks up over 1 Litre of water & suds, soft on your paint it glides effortlessly lifting dirt and dust into its long fibres away from your car's paint.\r\n\r\nMade from the softest Merano wool.\r\n\r\nBest used with a large bucket as it has a big thirst for water.","options":[{"id":28062902,"name":"Default","price":15.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.3,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87960572/-/Mammoth_1__1_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87960572/-/Mammoth_1__1_.jpg","width":800,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":8947184,"name":"Carbon Collective - iPhone 4/4s Carbon Fibre Phone Case","permalink":"carbon-collective-iphone-4-4s-carbon-fibre-phone-case","position":3,"price":15.99,"default_price":15.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/carbon-collective-iphone-4-4s-carbon-fibre-phone-case","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-15T00:54:30.000Z","description":"Genuine Carbon Fibre IPhone Case, tailored to fit IPhone 4/4s.
