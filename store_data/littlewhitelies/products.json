For this one-off anniversary edition we've stripped away all the usual features and reviews content, assigning 50 guest contributors a year between 1964 and 2013. They were then tasked with choosing a film from that year and finally a single frame from that film. Where each contributor went next was totally up to them. To accompany each entry, 50 bespoke illustrations were also commissioned, comprising a wide array of seriously awesome design talent. Entries include:\r\n\r\n-Rian Johnson, director of Looper, on his Scorsese screen epiphany.\r\n\r\n-France's Mia Hansen-Løve finds the essence of cinema in a modern Japanese love story.\r\n\r\n-Lukas Moodysson lauds a Romanian New Wave classic.\r\n\r\n-Norway's Joachim Trier invites his favourite director, Arnaud Desplechin, for a cup of coffee.\r\n\r\n-Chinese luminary Jia Zhang-ke says why '80s dance movie, Breakin', made him the man he is today.\r\n\r\nPlus, read about David Lynch's last great movie, a love letter to Faye Dunaway, the faded London in Michael Tuchner's Villain and the ghost of Three Men and a Baby.\r\n\r\nUK postage & handling is £2 (+ £1 for each additional issue), £4.50 for EU addresses (+ £1 for each additional issue) and £6.90 for the Rest of the World (+ £2.75 for
