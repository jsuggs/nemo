Mondays 5:30-6:25pm\r\n\r\nThis workshop will really give you the tools you need to handle a dance rehearsal for musical theatre – even if you have two left feet! Our Broadway Dance Intensive Workshop is designed as an opportunity for ALL AGES. The instructor will cover numerous disciplines of dance with a musical theatre focus. Each day will include sessions focused on preparing non-dancers for musical theatre rehearsals. This dance intensive will provide actors and singers with a set of skills necessary to land a spot in an ensemble and improve on knowledge for those singers/actors who have not taken regular dance classes. If you can’t help but sing to the songs of Broadway and you want to be cast in musicals, this is the workshop for you to learn to dance!\r\n﻿\r\nLOCATION: Trinity United Church Gymnasium (461 Park Avenue, Newmarket) \r\n﻿\r\nParticipants fee: $125","options":[{"id":28261952,"name":"Default","price":125.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111850422/-/danceworkshop.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111850422/-/danceworkshop.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4433990,"name":"dance","permalink":"dance","url":"/category/dance"}]}]
