No bull or long winded explanations or waffle designed to impress! It took us years to find a simple method that WORKS, but it really is as SIMPLE as this:\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUND VERY FAMILIAR?\r\n\r\n - I only overstayed my Pay & Display ticket by a few minutes.\r\n - I only stopped on a yellow line for 5 minutes to unload.\r\n - I got a ticket in the post but don't remember a thing about it.\r\n - I didn't see any warning signs, parked and then got a ticket.\r\n - I thought you could park there in the evening, weekend or Bank Holiday.\r\n - I went to get change for the meter and came back to a ticket on my windscreen.\r\n - I bought a ticket, but it fell off my windscreen/dashboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENEFITS: Kill that ticket/PCN.\r\n\r\nGet results quickly & easily (can be used more than once) for a one off fee of ONLY £17.00\r\n\r\nRemember parking tickets range from £50-60 and can double to £100-120 if not paid within 14-28 days.\r\n\r\nThis method is not unlawful and simply requires a short confirmation of the truth that does not involve taking up a Legal argument or long winded correspondence: One letter has killed it dead!\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO PROCEED: Very Simple... and it 100% WORKS!\r\n\r\n\r\nSimply click on the 'buy' link on our homepage, then add a copy of the letter to basket and follow the payment instructions.\r\n\r\nOnce paid (17.00) you will receive a return e-mail with full instructions and the 2 template letters. \r\n\r\nPrepare letter as instructed and post to authority concerned pronto. (eg. City Council.)
