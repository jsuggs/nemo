I mean, are you going to take her word for it…? ;)\r\n\r\n\r\nI'M NOT A SNICKERDOODLE! is a very…misunderstood cookie. It's not a Snickerdoodle. It kind of resembles one, but that is the only thing it has in common with it. The biggest difference is that there is no cinnamon in the cookie. None at all. Instead, it incorporates brown sugar, creamy butter, and real vanilla beans, creating a crisp exterior and soft interior, with caramel overtones. \r\n\r\nIt also has these little sugar sprinkle crystals on top. I like those. They're pretty.

We know there's a stigma with anything Gluten-free or Vegan. But I'm telling you, these are good. Really good. These cookies are the result of 6 months of baking experimentation. Why did Rogue Bakery create them? To jump on the Vegan/Gluten-free bandwagon? Hell no. The only reason is because someone I care about could not have any Rogue Bakery cookies because of her allergies. [Her name is Susan, and here are shameless plugs to her blog (http://www.imageswritten.biz/) and Twitter (http://twitter.com/susellwrites)] Honestly, if these didn't sell at all, it wouldn't matter, because they were made exclusively for Susan. Awwww. :)\r\n\r\nThe Cookies\r\n\r\nChocolate Liberator: A cookie that gives you the best of both worlds. It's a rich and dark chocolate crinkle-like cookie with one difference: it doesn't get rock hard. I know, sometimes you want things to be rock hard. But this one stays soft and chewy. Also, it tastes and looks just like a normal cookie, so guests won't know what it really is…?\r\n\r\nAncho Chili Peanut Butter: The main ingredient is Columbus's own Krema Nut Company natural creamy peanut butter…laced with freshly ground roasted ancho chili peppers. But as with all Rogue Bakery cookies, there's more to it than that. A hint of lime and coriander hit your palette long before you feel the mild burn of the peppers. You'll recognize this cookie out of a line-up: it's branded with an X on top.\r\n\r\nYou'll get 6 of each cookie. 6 + 6 = 12, and that's a dozen!","options":[{"id":9637059,"name":"Columbus delivery on Sat April 2nd","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10458979,"name":"Cleveland delivery on Fri April 1st","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29108299/-/xmas2010_CWB.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29108299/-/xmas2010_CWB.jpg","width":792,"height":612}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1572256,"name":"Cookies!","permalink":"cookies","url":"/category/cookies"}]}]
