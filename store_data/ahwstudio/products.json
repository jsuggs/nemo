all intact!\r\n\r\n- Roughly from the late 1800's to the 1920-30's\r\n\r\n- Elaborate polishing on each piece, with individual styling \r\n\r\n- Please refer to SECOND image for code - H.1; E.1; W.1, and opt in the drop-down menu for specific piece!\r\n\r\n\r\n- H.1 is cut very organically, with three distinctive 'bridges' along the left-side - these structures were very typical for antique pocket watches. The (porcelain) dial side is styled with italicised Arabic numerals. Also is an recessed circular portion, for the center-second hand. This piece measures approx. 28mm diameter\r\n\r\n- E.1 has a particular 'swirling' polish atop the two main cogs, named 'Sunburst polishing', which gives the piece a multi-dimensional surface, and urges the user to rotate the mechanism in varying angles, to catch light. Manufacture is Elgin, from Illinois. The dial-side is printed with Arabic numerals, and an outer ring of seconds, in red. This piece measures approx. 29mm diameter\r\n\r\n- W.1's unique look is the 'three-quarter plating' that covers said amount of the mechanism, mainly for shock-protection. As this 'sandwiches' the internal cog-work it creates a 'masked' effect, and thus allows a canvas for a myriad of polishing and engraving opportunities. It's polished with a 'Geneva Stripes' - the wave-like polishing (purely for aesthetics) created by watchmakers, for higher-grade mechanisms. The dial-side is adorned with a classical condensed Roman numerals, with an outer seconds-ring in red. This piece measures approx. 29mm\r\n\r\nAny further questions about each, or any of the above pieces, please feel free to email @ ahwstudio@gmail.com \r\n ","options":[{"id":23929123,"name":"H.1","price":190.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23929125,"name":"E.1","price":190.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23929127,"name":"W.1","price":190.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.9,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":8.9,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74357785/-/_DSC3586.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74357785/-/_DSC3586.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74357705/-/_DSC3571.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74357705/-/_DSC3571.jpg","width":1000,"height":620},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74358209/-/_DSC3574.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74358209/-/_DSC3574.jpg","width":1000,"height":663},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74553493/-/_DSC3581.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74553493/-/_DSC3581.jpg","width":1000,"height":666},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74579137/-/_DSC3575.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74579137/-/_DSC3575.jpg","width":1000,"height":568}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1862737,"name":"Industrial-Steampunk Jewellery","permalink":"industrial-steampunk-jewellery","url":"/category/industrial-steampunk-jewellery"},{"id":1865957,"name":"Collections","permalink":"collections","url":"/category/collections"},{"id":1857641,"name":"INDUSTRIAL :: RAW AESTHETIC","permalink":"industrial-raw-aesthetic","url":"/category/industrial-raw-aesthetic"}]},{"id":13398348,"name":"Glass Art-Links - Peck 'n' Peek Cufflinks","permalink":"glass-art-links-peck-n-peek-cufflinks","position":35,"price":30.0,"default_price":30.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/glass-art-links-peck-n-peek-cufflinks","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-06T11:52:17.000Z","description":"This quirky set features the face of operatic soprano Lina Cavalieri, as a motif by Fornasetti, cropped, and set under a glass dome.
