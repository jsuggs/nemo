Watching the coverage on television and the internet made me want to do something that would benefit the relief efforts in Japan.\r\n\r\nI designed this card to show how the devastating events in Japan have broken hearts. Thousands of people have been impacted by these disasters but we can come together to begin the process of mending those broken hearts.\r\n\r\nThe entire sale price (excluding shipping and handling fees) will be donated to the American Red Cross for relief efforts in Japan. I am donating my time, talent, energy and the materials used to create this card.\r\n\r\nLet's help make a difference for those who have been directly impacted by these events. Order a card, or two, today. Share with a friend and urge them to do the same.\r\n\r\nORDER TODAY. Quantities may be limited.\r\n\r\nPayments are processed through PayPal.
