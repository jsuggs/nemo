A slew of free projects were recorded early in their career in the Central District and West neighborhoods of Seattle. These sessions presented a film noir/rap combination, a take on Outkast’s ATLiens, and four separate releases that steadily built them a fanbase in Seattle, California, and New York. In 2009 the group signed with label Members Only, and on the verge of releasing SeaCal partnered with Ford for a four month promotional campaign.\r\n\r\nLate 2010 saw Amazon.com place SOTA’s “Hey Hey” in the top 100 songs of the year, and their record reached #1 Hip-Hop on indie radio staple KEXP in Seattle. The group’s next release Altered State, coming in May 2011, has garnered attention with the release of nightlife single “I Think I Love You” and the gritty follow-up “Alive.” A marked departure from the sunny complexion of their debut, the project was produced entirely by group member Parker and successfully blends electronic pop, hip-hop and dub elements to dramatic effect.\r\n\r\nFresh off their first tour and performance at SXSW 2011--the group has begun working on a full length project for release in early 2012, and filling dates for another tour through California by way of the Northwest.","options":[{"id":14189409,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/42162077/-/IMG_3222.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/42162077/-/IMG_3222.jpg","width":720,"height":480}],"artists":[{"id":78289,"name":"State of the Artist","permalink":"state-of-the-artist","url":"/artist/state-of-the-artist"}],"categories":[{"id":2350429,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":4311361,"name":"THEESatisfaction & Champagne Champagne - Magnetic Blackness b/w Bird Lives!","permalink":"thee-satisfaction-x-champagne-champagne-magnetic-blackness","position":5,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/thee-satisfaction-x-champagne-champagne-magnetic-blackness","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-08-24T07:16:31.000Z","description":"Limited edition, hand numbered (x) of 500, available exclusively through Members Only.","options":[{"id":14189681,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/42162453/-/IMG_3245.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/42162453/-/IMG_3245.jpg","width":720,"height":480}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2389399,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]}]
