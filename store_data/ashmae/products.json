My son and I spend many hours discussing, looking at, sounding out, and getting excited about animals. \r\n\r\nOne morning, as Remy sat in his highchair, I showed him some of my new  paintings.  He studied them, and held his little face close to the paper, and then he smiled and clapped.  I remembered why I love making art, especially for kids.  I love the idea of happy paintings that encourage imagination, surrounding our kiddos as they grow up.

You can print an 8x10 at Costco for $1.50, and purchase an Ikea frame anywhere from $2-$10 (this is the way I would suggest printing), and you're set to go for gifts for any occasion.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you purchase this item, three PDF files and three jpeg files, along with printing instructions, will be sent in a zip file to your email (this may take a few minutes to go through).  Your purchase comes with a 16x20 (prints at Costco for $6), an 8x10 (prints for $1.50), and a 5x7 (prints for .39 at Costco). \r\n\r\nWhile I don't recommend a home printer, most any print or photo shop should be able to print what you need.  Costco and Staples have both worked as excellent options for me.  \r\n\r\nPrint as many copies as you'd like for your own personal use. \r\n\r\nHowever, please don't forward the download to others, and don't sell the printed product under any circumstances (both of these things are dishonest and illegal).  \r\n\r\nPlease email with any questions or concerns.  I would love to see where these temple prints end up.
