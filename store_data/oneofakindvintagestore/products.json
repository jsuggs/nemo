Saint Lauren Riva Gauche Berry Suit Featuring Blouse With \r\nBow Fastening And High Waisted Wide Leg Pants.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeriod: 1980s\r\n\r\nCondition: Near Perfect/Mint\r\n\r\nSizing: 44\r\n\r\nFabric: 100% Laine\r\n\r\nOrigin: Paris, France\r\n\r\nCare: Dry Clean Only\r\n\r\nYves Saint Laurent was born August 1, 1935 in Olan, Algeria. Considered a fashion designer prodigy, his first big break came early at the age of 17 when he won a contest for a cocktail dress design sponsored by the International Wool Secretariat. A year later he was introduced to Christian Dior who was so impressed with his exceptional talent that he hired him immediately. At the age of 21, Yves Saint Laurent was named the head of the House of Dior when Christian Dior died in 1957.\r\n\r\nIn 1960 he was drafted into the French Army during the Algerian War of Independence. Due to the stress of army life, he suffered from a nervous breakdown and was admitted into a French mental hospital, where he underwent psychiatric treatment, including electroshock therapy.\r\n\r\nLater however, in 1962 Yves Saint Laurent opened his own fashion house, YSL, with his close friend and business partner Pierre Berge. In 1966 they also created the Rive Gauche boutiques for women.\r\n\r\nYves Saint Laurent is best know for revolutionizing the fashion industry by empowering and transforming women. He gave them the idea of wearing men’s clothing such as pants and suit jackets, and yet remaining feminine, sexy and elegant. The beatnik look, safari jackets, tight pants and tall boots, and the classic tuxedo suit for women were also some of the fashion trends that YSL made popular in the 1960’s-70’s. The Smoking Jacket of 1966 remains his trademark item and was updated yearly until he retired.\r\n\r\nA pioneer in his day, he was the first to popularize ready-to-wear fashion and also the first designer to include black models in his runway shows. Pierre Berge, Yves Saint Laurent’s close friend and business partner of many years has said that Chanel gave women freedom and Yves Saint Laurent gave them power.\r\n","options":[{"id":43240053,"name":"Default","price":1200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124130409/-/ysl-2piece-berry.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124130409/-/ysl-2piece-berry.jpg","width":2988,"height":2988},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124130958/-/Yves_Saint_Laure_50f96b09901c8.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124130958/-/Yves_Saint_Laure_50f96b09901c8.jpg","width":1400,"height":2100},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124131177/-/YSLBACK.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124131177/-/YSLBACK.jpg","width":1400,"height":2100}],"artists":[{"id":232434,"name":"Yves

From 1959 he began designing under the name Jean Varon. Bates' work as Jean Varon in the 1960s was particularly modernistic. He designed dresses with bare midriffs, sheer panels, and very short hemlines, and as early as 1962 was designing high-fashion plastic garments. In 1965, one of his dresses with a mesh midriff was chosen as the Dress of the Year and donated to the Fashion Museum, Bath, which in 2006 held a major retrospective show of his work.","options":[{"id":42821445,"name":"Default","price":1800.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123843255/-/Jean_Varon_50801easquare8.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123843255/-/Jean_Varon_50801easquare8.jpg","width":1156,"height":1156},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123843282/-/Jean_Varon_50801eafaaf48.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123843282/-/Jean_Varon_50801eafaaf48.jpg","width":1400,"height":2100},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123843312/-/jeanvar00nprey.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123843312/-/jeanvar00nprey.jpg","width":1400,"height":2100},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123843345/-/jeanvar-nback.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123843345/-/jeanvar-nback.jpg","width":1400,"height":2100},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123843420/-/jeanvar0nsleeve.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123843420/-/jeanvar0nsleeve.jpg","width":1400,"height":2100}],"artists":[{"id":231015,"name":"Jean Varon","permalink":"jean-varon","url":"/artist/jean-varon"}],"categories":[{"id":6134400,"name":"Dresses","permalink":"dresses","url":"/category/dresses"}]},{"id":13381866,"name":"Jean Paul Gaultier Bodycon Dress  ","permalink":"jean-paul-gaultier-bodycon-dress","position":71,"price":2300.0,"default_price":2300.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/jean-paul-gaultier-bodycon-dress","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-05T17:55:53.000Z","description":"Bodycon woollen evening dress with unique cut out detail.\r\n\r\nPeriod: 1980s\r\n\r\nCondition: Near Perfect/Mint\r\n\r\nSizing: Size 8 - 10\r\n\r\nFabric: 100% Wool\r\n\r\nOrigin: France\r\n\r\nCare: Dry Clean Only","options":[{"id":42819342,"name":"Default","price":2300.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123841764/-/Jean_Paul_Gaulti_50f996920b636square.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123841764/-/Jean_Paul_Gaulti_50f996920b636square.jpg","width":1394,"height":1394},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123841689/-/Jean_Paul_Gaulti_50f996920b636.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123841689/-/Jean_Paul_Gaulti_50f996920b636.jpg","width":1400,"height":2100},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123841701/-/jpgside.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123841701/-/jpgside.jpg","width":1400,"height":2100},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123841725/-/jpgback.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123841725/-/jpgback.jpg","width":1400,"height":2100}],"artists":[{"id":231012,"name":"Jean Paul Gaultier","permalink":"jean-paul-gaultier","url":"/artist/jean-paul-gaultier"}],"categories":[{"id":6134400,"name":"Dresses","permalink":"dresses","url":"/category/dresses"}]},{"id":13381212,"name":"Harry Algo Paris Embellished Evening Dress","permalink":"harry-algo-paris-embellished-evening-dress","position":72,"price":6500.0,"default_price":6500.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/harry-algo-paris-embellished-evening-dress","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-05T17:27:20.000Z","description":"Couture floral floor length evening gown with heavy gradient embellishment made exclusively for the French Room in Harrods.

He and his eponymous company are synonymous with geometric prints in a kaleidoscope of colours.The first clothes designed by Pucci were for the Reed College skiing team. But his designs came to wider attention in 1947, when he was on leave in Zermatt, Switzerland. Skiwear that he had designed for a female friend was photographed by Toni Frissell, a photographer working for Harper's Bazaar. Frissell's editor asked Pucci to design skiwear for a story on European Winter Fashion, which ran in the winter 1948 issue of the Bazaar. Although there had been some experiments with stretch fabrics in Europe before the war, Pucci's sleek designs caused a sensation, and he received several offers from American manufacturers to produce them. Instead he left the Air Force and set up a haute couture house in the fashionable resort of Canzone del Mare on the Isle of Capri. Initially he used his knowledge of stretch fabrics to produce a swimwear line in 1949, but soon moved onto other items such as brightly coloured, boldly patterned silk scarves, he then progressed the designs to blouses and then a popular line of wrinkle-free printed silk dresses. Marilyn Monroe was buried in one of his dresses, and his designs were worn by everyone from Sophia Loren to Jackie Kennedy and latter day pop icons such as Madonna in the early 1990s.","options":[{"id":42816351,"name":"Default","price":25000.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123839037/-/pucisquare.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123839037/-/pucisquare.jpg","width":1298,"height":1298},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123839070/-/_MG_0351.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123839070/-/_MG_0351.jpg","width":1400,"height":2100},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123839100/-/pucci-22.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123839100/-/pucci-22.jpg","width":1400,"height":2100},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123839124/-/_MG_0358.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123839124/-/_MG_0358.jpg","width":1400,"height":2100},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123839148/-/_MG_0364.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123839148/-/_MG_0364.jpg","width":1400,"height":2100}],"artists":[{"id":230994,"name":"Pucci","permalink":"pucci","url":"/artist/pucci"}],"categories":[{"id":6134508,"name":"Suits","permalink":"suits","url":"/category/suits"}]},{"id":13376739,"name":"Victorian Veiled Cape","permalink":"victorian-veiled-cape","position":75,"price":5500.0,"default_price":5500.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/victorian-veiled-cape","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-05T12:40:12.000Z","description":"Victorian veiled cape in velvet and lace decorated with gold leaf religious symbols and mythological creatures.\r\n\r\nPeriod: Victorian\r\n\r\nCondition: Near Perfect/Mint\r\n\r\nSizing: UK 8-10\r\n\r\nFabric: Velvet and Lace\r\n\r\nOrigin: United Kingdom\r\n\r\nCare: Dry Clean Only","options":[{"id":42800535,"name":"Default","price":5500.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123828957/-/veildcape.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123828957/-/veildcape.jpg","width":1400,"height":1400},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123828984/-/Custom_Made_50cc8fb5e08d8.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123828984/-/Custom_Made_50cc8fb5e08d8.jpg","width":1400,"height":2100},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123829020/-/product.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123829020/-/product.jpeg","width":1400,"height":2100},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123829155/-/jgdhfgfs.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123829155/-/jgdhfgfs.jpg","width":1400,"height":2100}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6134400,"name":"Dresses","permalink":"dresses","url":"/category/dresses"}]},{"id":13376535,"name":"Embellished Evening Dress","permalink":"embellished-evening-dress","position":76,"price":3600.0,"default_price":3600.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/embellished-evening-dress","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-05T12:27:32.000Z","description":"Embellished evening dress with a bat wing sleeve.

couture evening gown was designed by John Galliano for Christian Dior.

Born in Gibraltar, he grew up in London and launched his own label before becoming chief designer of France's haute couture flagship, Christian Dior, in Paris. John Galliano has created the most spectacular fashion shows of our time. Since his 1984 degree collection, Les Incroyables, which metamorphosed his London art school into a French Revolutionary street scene, he has transported his privileged audiences to more exotic and sartorially blessed places than they could possibly have imagined or experienced.\r\n\r\nWhether he chooses to transform the Opéra Garnier in Paris into a party thrown by the Venetian socialite, Marchesa Luisa Casati, or the none-too salubrious platforms of Gare d’Austerlitz into a Moroccan souk - complete with guest appearance from a couture-clad Princess Pocohontas - Galliano never fails to convince. This despite the fact that his references come from a dizzying array of rarely connected times, people and places. But then, John Galliano’s life has been rather richer than most – more often than not, the vivid colour in his shows have been experienced at source first hand.\r\n","options":[{"id":42796386,"name":"Default","price":6200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123825633/-/Christian_Dior_5square0ca34fb7c2b6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123825633/-/Christian_Dior_5square0ca34fb7c2b6.jpg","width":1217,"height":1217},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123825648/-/Christian_Dior_50ca34fb7c2b6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123825648/-/Christian_Dior_50ca34fb7c2b6.jpg","width":1400,"height":2100},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123825693/-/cdside.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123825693/-/cdside.jpg","width":1400,"height":2100},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123825750/-/_MG_1949.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123825750/-/_MG_1949.jpg","width":1400,"height":2100}],"artists":[{"id":229038,"name":"Christian Dior","permalink":"christian-dior","url":"/artist/christian-dior"}],"categories":[{"id":6134400,"name":"Dresses","permalink":"dresses","url":"/category/dresses"}]},{"id":13375086,"name":"AnnaCat Maxi Dress","permalink":"annacat-maxi-dress","position":80,"price":3200.0,"default_price":3200.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/annacat-maxi-dress","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-05T10:26:22.000Z","description":"Collared full length maxi dress with puff sleeves and ribbon fastening around waist tying as a bow on the back with beautiful pleating detail covering bodice.\r\n\r\nPeriod: 1970s\r\n\r\nCondition: Near Perfect/Mint\r\n\r\nSizing: UK 8/10\r\n\r\nFabric: Seersucker\r\n\r\nOrigin: United Kingdom\r\n\r\nCare: Dry Clean Only\r\n\r\nDespite having been referred to as \"the Biba of The Brompton Road\", Annacat is not the most well known of British boutiques, to many a vintage enthusiast's dismay.\r\n\r\nIt's existence is the conclusion to the joint efforts of friends Jane Lyle and Maggie Keswick who together inaugured in 1965 the boutique \"Annacat\" at 270 Brompton Rd, Kensington.\r\n\r\nAlongside clothes of their brand were several other designer items. and their clothes could often be seen in the British editions of Vogue.","options":[{"id":42795816,"name":"Default","price":3200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123824733/-/Anna_Cat_509e9d66621c6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123824733/-/Anna_Cat_509e9d66621c6.jpg","width":1109,"height":1109},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123825435/-/Anna_Cat_509e9d66621c6-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123825435/-/Anna_Cat_509e9d66621c6-1.jpg","width":1400,"height":2100},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123825447/-/35467890.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123825447/-/35467890.jpg","width":1400,"height":2100},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123825477/-/5467890-210-21.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123825477/-/5467890-210-21.jpg","width":1400,"height":2100}],"artists":[{"id":230937,"name":"AnnaCat","permalink":"annacat","url":"/artist/annacat"}],"categories":[{"id":6134400,"name":"Dresses","permalink":"dresses","url":"/category/dresses"}]},{"id":13336719,"name":"Chanel Cashmere Dress","permalink":"chanel-cashmere-dress","position":81,"price":3200.0,"default_price":3200.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/chanel-cashmere-dress","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-03T16:39:12.000Z","description":"Vintage form fitted cashmere dress lined with silk featuring attached classic Chanel tweed cardigan. \r\n\r\n*Styled with a 1980s Chanel gold tone metal chain waist belt also available in store.\r\n\r\nPeriod: Late 60s\r\n\r\nCondition: Near Perfect/Mint\r\n\r\nSizing: Fr 38\r\n\r\nFabric: Dress 100% Cashmere - Lining 100% Silk - Attached Cardigan 70% Pure Laine 14% Viscose 10% Cotton 6% Nylon\r\n\r\nOrigin: France\r\n\r\nCare: Dry Clean Only\r\n\r\n\r\nDesigner Coco Chanel gave the world the little black dress, Chanel No. 5 perfume, and the revolutionary notion that style could be both classic and casual.
