What is considered a strength in one type of ministry may well be a liability in another, depending on the social context in which the church operates. Not everything in this manual may apply to your situation, but I believe there are some general principles that can serve churches and leaders who desire to “press toward the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.”\r\n\r\nThis manual makes some basic assumptions about local church health.\r\n1.\tA healthy church is a growing church. We realize that there are many dimensions of growth and that numbers alone cannot take the measure of all that a church contributes to its members and its community. But it is natural for healthy, living things to grow.\r\n2.\tA healthy church is a transforming church. It is a place where lives are transformed through the love of the body and the power of the Holy Spirit as an everyday order of business.\r\n3.\tA healthy church is a happy church. It produces and maintains a climate of joy, goodwill, excitement, brotherhood, and love.\r\n\r\nIt takes a deep and comprehensive analysis, coupled with Holy Spirit-given insight, in order to identify root problems and re-direct a church’s priorities. My hope is that this manual will assist in building hundreds of healthier churches to the glory of God!\r\n","options":[{"id":9475581,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25936082/-/VCI_ChurchHealthCover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25936082/-/VCI_ChurchHealthCover.jpg","width":773,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":304753,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":2689245,"name":"Managing Your Church with Excellence//Manual","permalink":"managing-your-church-with-excellence-manual","position":65,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/managing-your-church-with-excellence-manual","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-08-07T02:10:30.000Z","description":"Each of the ten chapters explores a key component of effective management.  The reader is provided with both descriptive and prescriptive insights into chapter topics through three format features:  Discussion Modules, Situation Reviews, and Action Plans.  These provide a meaningful structure for organizational insight, problem diagnosis, identification and evaluation of action alternatives, goal-setting, and implementation.\r\n\r\nTwo critical processes drive churches: the strategic process, which focuses on defining the goals and purposes of a church, and the operational process, which focuses on developing the programs and procedures of a church. Simply put, strategy is about doing the right things while operation is about doing things right. This manual is not so much about what we are called to do as churches, but about how well we do it. Our business as church leaders is to be passionately occupied with doing the right things and doing them with excellence!","options":[{"id":9475621,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25936122/-/Managing_your_church_w_excellence_cvr.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25936122/-/Managing_your_church_w_excellence_cvr.jpg","width":773,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":304753,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":2689249,"name":"Mentoring:  The Missing Key In The Equipping Of The Saints ","permalink":"mentoring-the-missing-key-in-the-equipping-of-the-saints","position":66,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mentoring-the-missing-key-in-the-equipping-of-the-saints","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-08-07T02:12:04.000Z","description":"This teaching on Mentoring is basically drawn from and based on the book of I Timothy in the Bible. The book of I Timothy is written to Timothy, who was being actively Mentored by the Apostle Paul, but if you look at it a little deeper, it is actually written to four different groups of people which make up four different levels of leadership in the Church. \r\n\r\nEach level has its own set of “Mentoring Benchmarks”: character\r\nqualities, responsibilities and requirements of that Leadership Level. As a person masters the current Leadership Level they are on by mastering the Benchmarks of that level, they are ready to be promoted to the next Leadership Level. \r\n\r\nIn its essence, Mentoring is about determining exactly what Leadership Level a person is currently on, what Leadership Level they feel called to, and what Benchmarks they need\r\nto master in order to move to the next. In summary, here are the 4 Leadership Levels.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":9475628,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25936234/-/Mentoring_Cvr.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25936234/-/Mentoring_Cvr.jpg","width":773,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":304753,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":2635532,"name":"The Husband and Wife Ministry Team//Book","permalink":"the-husband-and-wife-ministry-team-book","position":67,"price":2.5,"default_price":2.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-husband-and-wife-ministry-team-book","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-06-29T19:14:48.000Z","description":"Does God have a special and unique purpose for every couple?
