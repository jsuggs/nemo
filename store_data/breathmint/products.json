Genres are referenced directly with music performed using their original style and instrumentation, often contrasted with Cock E.S.P.'s usual harsh electronic fare.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the core Cock E.S.P. membership -- Emil Hagstrom, Matt Bacon, Jason Wade (FAGGOT), Nicole Rode (Rape Door), heterosexual hair stylist Scott Burns and Jamaican dominatrix Paige Flash -- this album features dozens of special guest musicians including: John Vance (Eclectic Ensemble, WRONG), V/Vm, Andy Ortmann, Smell & Quim, Blowfly, Newton, Dreamland Faces, Weasel Walter, Leslie Keffer, Origami Bøe, Costes, Suffering Bastard, Twodeadsluts Onegoodfuck, Disthroned Agony, Page 27, Jiblit Dupree, Naomi Elizabeth, S/M, Dental Work, Head Molt and RU-486 as well as members of Harry Pussy, White Mice, Wasteoid, the Nihilist Spasm Band, the Stooges, No Doctors, Ovo, Abiku, Rusted Shit, Pain Teens, Ghostband, Angry Feminists, Thunderbolt Pagoda, Gash Blood and Harsh Reality.\r\n\r\nCD in 5x7 card package. Cassette features 36 minutes of bonus alternate/extended mixes. Co-released by Breathmint, Little Mafia, and SunShip Records/E.F.
