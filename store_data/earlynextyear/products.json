Each song has it&#8217;s own feel, message, and tone and the band has mastered the concept of singing a sad song in a not so sad way. From the bouncy sunshine feeling of &#8220;East Coast&#8221; to the dark but bittersweet closer &#8220;Beautiful Distraction&#8221;, the songs take form in much different ways, but are still presented in their own catchy powerpop style.\n\n\tTracklisting:\n\n\t1. East Coast\n2. Girl Like Her\n3. Information\n4. Window\n5. Completely\n6. Through My Eyes\n7.
