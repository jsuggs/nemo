In the background is a city, which represents social norms, and in the front is a masked kid. He's the \"rebel\" or the person who stands on the outside looking in. \r\n\r\nA quote from Jim Morrison, the lead singer of The Doors, is also featured on the design; \"The most loving parents and relatives commit murder with smiles on their faces, they force us to destroy the person we really are; a subtle kind of murder.\" It may not be family, it may be friends, teachers, or co-workers, but the end result is the same. We've all felt the pressures to change ourselves to \"fit in\" at one point or another. You can stay true to who YOU are or you can choose death, metaphorically. Red pill or blue.","options":[{"id":12078734,"name":"Black","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12078736,"name":"White","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35135698/-/ktatee.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35135698/-/ktatee.jpg","width":600,"height":685}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1983902,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":3492300,"name":"Peace Of Mind Tee","permalink":"peace-of-mind-tee","position":2,"price":22.0,"default_price":22.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/peace-of-mind-tee","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-03-27T07:02:17.000Z","description":"No stress.
