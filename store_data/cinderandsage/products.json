This piece features a unique, authentic Canadian copper penny. As pennies are now out of circulation in Canada, this is also a special Canadian keepsake piece. \r\nKeep a piece of Canadian history with you, and support our Canadian athletes this February! \r\n\r\n$25 from EVERY “Lucky Penny” necklace purchased will go directly to help support our Canadian Olympic athletes.\r\n\r\nA brass disk etched with the word “LOVE” hangs with an authentic Canadian penny and a small brass Canadian maple leaf charm. The penny and maple leaf hang on separate ring than the love disk, allowing them to not sit directly on top of one another. This way, a bit of the brass colored love disk peaks out from behind the penny. The 2 pendants are then connected by the jump ring to assure they always stay together and hang perfectly around your neck. \r\n\r\nThe penny and love disk are the same size, measuring 18mm across. The small golden maple leaf measures 10mm x 10mm.\r\nThe charms hang on a long (33”) bronze chain, adorned with our signature bronze leaf etched with our C&S logo. Like all of our necklaces, there are no clasps to bother with – just slip it on over your head.\r\n\r\n** Please remember that all pennies vary in color due to their age – your necklace may include a slightly darker penny, or a slightly shinier penny. They are all unique and beautiful. Sorry, no requests for specific years or colors. **\r\n\r\nThank you for supporting our Canadian Olympic athletes in their pursuit of gold this February!\r\n\r\n- SOCHI 2014 -","options":[{"id":50961300,"name":"Default","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.25,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.25,"amount_with_others":0.25}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129656283/-/Lucky_Penny_1.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129656283/-/Lucky_Penny_1.JPG","width":2896,"height":1944},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129656502/-/Lucky_Penny_2.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129656502/-/Lucky_Penny_2.JPG","width":2896,"height":1944},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129656409/-/DSC_0866.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129656409/-/DSC_0866.JPG","width":2896,"height":1944},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129656433/-/Group_Shot.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129656433/-/Group_Shot.JPG","width":2896,"height":1944}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6947343,"name":"\"Strong & Free\" Olympic Fundraiser","permalink":"strong-free-olympic-fundraiser","url":"/category/strong-free-olympic-fundraiser"},{"id":3759693,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]},{"id":15665013,"name":"\"Canada Love\" Necklace - CDN Olympic Fundraiser!","permalink":"canada-love-necklace-cdn-olympic-fundraiser","position":2,"price":45.0,"default_price":45.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/canada-love-necklace-cdn-olympic-fundraiser","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-19T22:22:06.000Z","description":"“Canada Love” Necklace – “Strong & Free” Olympic Fundraiser \r\n\r\nShow your love for Canada during the upcoming Olympic Winter Games in Sochi, Russia with this limited edition necklace!

This one is super unique and looks great in any hair color.\r\n\r\nThese super popular hair combs always look great! And YES - they will stay in your hair! :) As long as these are put in correctly, they will hold your hair really well, no matter what hair type you have. We promise. \r\n \r\nIn total, this comb measures 85mm x 48mm.\r\n\r\nThe trick to really make them stay in, is going against the way your hair is going. Pull the section of hair back and hold it with one hand, then push the hair comb forward (so the teeth of the comb are going towards your face). It’ll lock in that way and stay really well. You can also comb you hair back with the comb, then push it forwards (towards your face). Even if your hair is up and you want to use one, just always make sure you’re going against the way that the hair is going. As long as they are in correctly, they will feel super secure and look great all day!

The locket can open and photos can be placed inside. It hangs on a long (33\") bronze chain. All of C&S's long chains do not have clasps, since you slip them over your head anyways! No more worrying about the clasp showing. \r\n\r\nThe locket measures 46x38mm and may contain some age spots which just adds to the character and beauty of the locket. All of these lockets are done by hand and made to order, so your locket will appear not completely identical to the one shown, but very similar.\r\n","options":[{"id":32529757,"name":"\"Rocky Mountains\" Gold Enriched","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32529760,"name":"\"This Old Barn\" Gold Enriched","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.25,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.25,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.25,"amount_with_others":0.25}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102107500/-/DSC_0313.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102107500/-/DSC_0313.JPG","width":1000,"height":676},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102107368/-/DSC_0311.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102107368/-/DSC_0311.JPG","width":1000,"height":696},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102107548/-/DSC_0314.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102107548/-/DSC_0314.JPG","width":1000,"height":671},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102107440/-/DSC_0312.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102107440/-/DSC_0312.JPG","width":1000,"height":650}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3759693,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"},{"id":3760141,"name":"One-of-a-kind Vintage Lockets","permalink":"one-of-a-kind-vintage-lockets","url":"/category/one-of-a-kind-vintage-lockets"},{"id":5005210,"name":"Spring 2013 Collection","permalink":"spring-2013-collection","url":"/category/spring-2013-collection"}]},{"id":10387930,"name":"“Fire Starter” Bottle Necklace","permalink":"fire-starter-bottle-necklace","position":39,"price":40.0,"default_price":40.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fire-starter-bottle-necklace","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-06T20:19:13.000Z","description":"In case of emergency – Break glass!\r\n\r\nBe safe at all times....

Pull the section of hair back and hold it with one hand, then push the hair comb forward (so the teeth of the comb are going towards your face). It’ll lock in that way and stay really well. You can also comb you hair back with the comb, then push it forwards (towards your face).

Large patina bird with a smaller brass bird ontop. These lovely birds hang on a long (33\") bronze chain. All of C&S's long chains do not have clasps, since you slip them over your head anyways! No more worrying about the clasp showing. \r\n\r\nThe larger bird measures 60mm long and 27mm wide\r\n\r\nPatina is a process of coating brass or copper with various types of chemicals to make it look aged and antique. All items that have gone through the patina process are original and unique. Colors will be similar to the one pictured, but will vary since all are one of a kind.\r\n\r\nNow also available with a large brass bird and small silver bird.
