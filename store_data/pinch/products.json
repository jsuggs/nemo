Her collection includes dinnerware, bottle vases, planters, cookware, teapots, mugs, tumblers and ramekins in a variety of colors. Her handmade stoneware pieces are wheel thrown, slab built, slip cast or made combining these methods. Her matte glazes are dipped and poured before being oxidation-fired to a durable stoneware temperature. Judy says of her work, \"All of my designs have evolved from simple respect for form, and the unending ability of clay to respond to my abilities to create forms I find pleasing.\"\r\n\r\nThe largest ramekin measures 9 1/2\" length x 7\" width x 2\" h. All are oven safe for baking, and great for serving olives, fruit, crackers, dips, whatever you like!\r\n\r\n** ORDERS PLACED BY 12/13/2013 WILL ARRIVE BY 12/24/2013 **","options":[{"id":45497169,"name":"Default","price":156.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125662122/-/67ea2a9c7551612e6dc7eabeec00734e.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125662122/-/67ea2a9c7551612e6dc7eabeec00734e.jpg","width":736,"height":552}],"artists":[{"id":205302,"name":"Judy Jackson","permalink":"judy-jackson","url":"/artist/judy-jackson"}],"categories":[{"id":2163490,"name":"Ceramics","permalink":"ceramics","url":"/category/ceramics"}]},{"id":15247614,"name":"Cardinal Bird Print on Wood by The Mincing Mockinbird","permalink":"cardinal-bird-print-on-wood-by-the-mincing-mockinbird","position":2,"price":81.0,"default_price":81.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cardinal-bird-print-on-wood-by-the-mincing-mockinbird","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-01T19:49:19.000Z","description":"Based in La Crescenta, California, The Mincing Mockingbird's impeccably painted images are at once realistic and surrealist.

Over the years Carla worked with several glass artists, including collaboration on a line of glass jewelry. Finding her creative outlet in jewelry design, she founded Carla Caruso Jewelry in 2001. Totally self-taught, Carla's handmade jewelry retains a sculptural quality paired with a natural yet modern-minimalist aesthetic. Her collection has evolved over the years but the essence remains the same: handmade jewelry that wears beautifully.\r\n\r\nThis round signet ring is made in sterling silver with a matte finish and measures 3/8\" in diameter.  Wear it unadorned or with a hand-engraved initial. <i>Available in whole- and half-sizes from 4-8, please allow approximately 4 weeks for sizing and engraving.</i>","options":[{"id":26706780,"name":"without engraving","price":130.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26706783,"name":"with hand-engraved initial","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/83566725/-/C24_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/83566725/-/C24_1.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/83566749/-/C24_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/83566749/-/C24_2.jpg","width":800,"height":598},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/83566761/-/C55.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/83566761/-/C55.jpg","width":800,"height":564}],"artists":[{"id":160542,"name":"Carla Caruso","permalink":"carla-caruso","url":"/artist/carla-caruso"}],"categories":[{"id":2163500,"name":"Jewelry","permalink":"jewelry","url":"/category/jewelry"}]},{"id":4777695,"name":"Gold-Copper-Berrry Dappled Leaf Mobile by Moon-Lily Silk Mobiles","permalink":"dappled-leaf-mobile-by-moon-lily-silk-mobiles","position":128,"price":225.0,"default_price":225.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dappled-leaf-mobile-by-moon-lily-silk-mobiles","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-04T22:57:22.000Z","description":"Jan Carson began Moon-Lily Silk Mobiles in 1999.

With a love for the stylized periods of the 1920's-1960's, Jody's appreciation of all things vintage eventually developed into a colorful, witty and wearable line of jewelry. Because of the availability of her authentic components, Joli Jewelry only offers limited edition pieces.\r\n\r\nJoli Jewelry is handmade in Brooklyn, NY using vintage glass, original plastics like celluloid and Bakelite, old metal findings, old French enamels and mother of pearl pieces. Found items such as buttons, buckles, trimming, perfume bottle top crystals, purse openers, fans and furniture handles as well as new semi-precious, glass and metal components are incorporated.
