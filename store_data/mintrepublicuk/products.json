The cushions blend contemporary design with a vintage twist and will add a cool, industrial vibe to any living space.</p>\r\n<p>Our original designs are individually hand screen printed to order using eco-friendly water-based inks and are printed on 100% brushed cotton cushions, which are made in the UK. \r\n\r\nThe cushion can be purchased with an optional plump luxury duck feather inner pad to provide maximum comfort for lounging and relaxing at home.</p>\r\n<p>The modern heritage colour palette of slate grey, leaf green, burgundy wine and teal blue will add a pop of colour to enliven any room.
