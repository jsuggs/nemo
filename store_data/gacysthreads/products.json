To the Death\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nThis is the sound of an energetic and committed band coming up with all the goods. Just listen to that blast at the end of ‘To The Death’. It’s packed with enthusiasm and fire.\r\n\r\nSo give them a chance and pick this up, most especially if you’re not even generally into this style (or rather, think you’re not into this style - in reality it’s pure metal). There’s a blistering set of tunes in here that’ll satisfy even the most jaded. In fact maybe that’s who should hear it the most. Absolutely brilliant - and an unorthodox, chance-taking, exciting album of the month.\r\n\r\n4.6 / 5 - Earl Grey ::: 15/11/11 \r\nhttp://www.metalireland.com/2011/11/16/gacys-threads-the-ignorance-of-purity/","options":[{"id":16102629,"name":"Default","price":2.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116255598/-/cd.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116255598/-/cd.jpg","width":800,"height":541}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":159699,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
