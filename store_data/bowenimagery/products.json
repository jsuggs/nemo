Several large prints were produced and shown around Tampa Bay but all the while I was not feeling settled about producing a \"graphite drawing\" that was actually half digital. \r\n\r\nI decided to take on recreating the entire symmetrical piece by hand. It began by recreating the already completed left-side, then flipping the image (in my mind) and painstakingly creating the 3rd rendering, but in reverse.
