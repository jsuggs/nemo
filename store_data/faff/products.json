Please contact me for a custom listing.</strong>\n\n\tPrefer a mirror or a magnet with the same design? Please contact me and I will create a different listing for you.\n\n\tCupcake Creatures:\n\n\tWhere did the idea come from? Well I created these little creatures while I was at my mum’s house in Aslackby, England this past Christmas. Aslackby in my opinion is the cake capital of the world and every house you visit always has multiple handmade desserts for you to try. The first cupcake creature I made was a duck cake. The idea of combining two of my favorite things was just so fabulous I had to share it with all of you. I have now created a turtle, armadillo, snail, walrus, elephant, toadstool, camel, whale, frog, goat, cow, duck, chick, octopus, hippo, goldfish and starfish. I am sure there will be more to come.\n\n\tCupcake Creatures are drawn in my sketchbook when I have a lot of time on my hands… like when I am stuck at the airport for 12 hours, when I can’t sleep at night, or when my husband is watching every football game on Sunday. I scan them into my computer and digitally color them in like a coloring book in my graphics software. I print the images at home using photo quality inks and premium paper and cut them out by hand. I use my muscles and my Tecre button machine to make them into mirrors, magnets, and pins.\n\n\tHandmade by Eve\n2008\n\n","options":[{"id":328330,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.35,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/138564/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/138564/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":74766,"name":"1.75\" Buttons","permalink":"1-75-buttons","url":"/category/1-75-buttons"}]},{"id":67818,"name":"Yellow Chick Pocket Mirror","permalink":"yellow-chick-pocket-mirror","position":2,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/yellow-chick-pocket-mirror","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-01-19T05:39:51.000Z","description":"Peep!
