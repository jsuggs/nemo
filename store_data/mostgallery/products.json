It is the way these 'Trees' have been manifested and how they have been integrated into each setting which interests me and what this project concerns itself with. Often they appear somewhat alien, clunky and at odds with the environments they inhabit. Unsurprisingly and in most instances, these trees have appeared for commercial purposes - helping attract the passing trade - rather than to act as a symbol for Christmas. It is this motivation that has invariably led to the friction that can be found. Any symbol or icon that is taken out of its original context for reasons different to what it is originally intended for, will gather new meaning, adopt new connotations and become something else.\r\n\r\n<b>Biography</b>\r\nBorn in 1981 in Bangkok, Miti Ruangkritya studied photography in London. His work has been featured in Le Monde, British Journal of Photography, RearView Mirror and Le Journal de la Photographie among other publications.

The trigger to his passion dates back to a decade ago, when he was just 21 years old. Sitting in the college library he stumbled upon a book that portrayed the life of an ancient Japanese people living in mountainous ranges, only 30 years ago. The tribe was described as being quite apart from the Japanese society as we know it today. The book left a deep impression that marked him for life...\r\nThis 56-page memory is richly overflowing with the recollections of Hajime's 5 years spent living, between 2007 and 2011, with that very tribe, the MATAGI.\r\n\r\n<b>Biography of the artist</b>\r\nHajime Kimura is a Japanese photographer born in 1982. \r\nHis first long-term project “MATAGI” focused on Japanese ancient tribe in Nigata prefecture for 5 years was published in 2012.

The spirit of ancestor Lao Tzu also lies there.We have long been accustomed to accepting all kinds of changes, but we shall not forget the traces and eternity of time.\r\nI hope Ash won’t only lay eyes on the world of representation, and duplicate images that the eye can see; rather it will attempt to experience the value of each element in the nature and to observe their turnover and eternity in time.\"\r\nMuGe\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.mostartists.com/features/muge-ash/\">More about the series</a>\r\n\r\n<b>Biography of the artist</b>\r\nMuGe (木 格) was born and grew up in Chongqing, China, in 1979.
