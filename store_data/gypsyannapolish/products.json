There are four girls and one boy, Luke, or as we taught our youngest sister to call him since her birth, Luka. The story behind this one is set in Spring of 2012. My husband (Mr. Gypsyanna?) and I took my two youngest sisters to the zoo. While watching the elephants, the zookeeper told the crowd, \"And that big guy over there is the only male in our herd.\" My youngest sister, who was 5 at the time, turns to me and said, \"Just like Luka! He's the only male in <i>our</i> herd!\"\r\n\r\nIf you love something a little different than your typical indie glitter, this polish is for you! It is a great metallic that is perfect in two coats, but you could get away with just one if you're short on time.

Let me explain...\r\nFor my entire life my favorite color has been green. Bright green at that. So every year for Christmas and my birthday, my family members (and Santa!) have given me gifts that reflect my favorite color. For a period of about 12 years I received every Tinkerbell coffee mug Disney had to offer. My friends and family's rationale was that she was the only Disney \"princess\" who had a green theme. While I love all things Disney, and I also liked Tinkerbell quite a bit, by the time I was 18 my collection of over 25 Tinkerbell coffee mugs was getting out of hand (especially considering I had just moved into a tiny college dorm room)! So I had to sit down with my family and have an intervention of the Tinkerbell kind. I gently let them know how much I appreciated the mugs, and their kind gifts, but that I just could not house any more Tinkerbell items!\r\nThey took it pretty well, and I only occasionally receive Tinkerbell gifts these days!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a neon green and neon yellow glitter topper in a clear base. The yellow glitter glows bright in a blacklight! Also there is some spectrafliar holographic goodness packed into the clear base. While this polish could be worn directly on the nail, it really comes to life over dark colors!

Here is her story:\r\n\"Both of my grandfathers (I've only known one due to cancer taking my dad's dad a year after they married) had bright blue-gray eyes with flecks of green as do I and my son Levi. Long before my grandfathers met they both always called their eye color 'Hawaiian Sunset Blue'. My eye color is the one remaining connection to the grandfather who I've always felt has watched over me, and now watches over his first great grandson as well. My name for a polish would be: Hawaiian Sunset Blue.\"\r\n\r\nThis polish is as unique and loveable as the story behind it. With a metallic base of bright blue and grey it is a polish that can be worn without any other adornment.

I was not living at home by this time, but received many dark photos from various members of my family simply stating, \"Still waiting for the grunions....\" In the end I don't think the grunions even came that night, but the excitement of getting to stay out late at the beach, and seeing a bunch of people lined up on the wet sand waiting for the grunions really stuck with my siblings and we all still talk about it!\r\n\r\nThis is a blue jelly with amazing sparkle.

But apparently it is also a quote I said as a child, because I was a crazy. But even more crazy, is that, with out any prior knowledge, my little sister ALSO SAID THIS QUOTE when she was about three years old. The story goes, back when I was in high school, I had photos of all my friends on my binder (I know, right?). Included in these photos was a boy we shall call Bambi. My little sister decided Bambi was her boyfriend (I don't know that she had really ever met him) and would steal the photo of him out of my binder all the time! My dad finally got a little weirded out that his three year old had a 17 year old \"boyfriend\" and told her to stop stealing the photo. She responded with tears in her eyes, \"but Daddy, I love him!\" \r\n\r\nThis is a great glitter bomb topper.
