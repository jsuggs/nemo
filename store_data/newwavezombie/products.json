Bleu is spending the night as well â€“ alas, she has already spirited off into the night and up into a tree outside Mr. Bishop's window (and has been there for the last two hours). Erin lays about nonchalantly in her lingerie, painting her nails. Clover won't allow this ridiculousness to keep going on...at least not tonight.

Some yahoo pulled the fire alarm, so the kids are herded like cattle to go stand on the football field in orderly lines until the all-clear is given. But hey, at least they're out of class, right? That's Bleu's feeling, anyway. Unfortunately for Clover, that means the possibility of seeing Monkeyboy and Victor on the field, and worse, the idea of facing them after she planted a kiss on Monkeyboy at the bowlin' alley, a la GREASE 2 the night before, just to make Victor feel jealous and/or stupid (hopefully both). Not her best moment, it was pretty gross, hence gargling the BREF FRESHNA. It looks like Victor was affected, at least. Alan meanwhile glares at Bleu, who is oblivious as usual.\r\n\r\nPublished by Oni Press, 2004.\r\n\r\n*Additional images of page available upon request","options":[{"id":41940783,"name":"Default","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":20.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123224844/-/BMPM4_Page5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123224844/-/BMPM4_Page5.jpg","width":3000,"height":4727}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6051567,"name":"Orignal Art","permalink":"orignal-art","url":"/category/orignal-art"}]},{"id":13126509,"name":"Scooter Girl #5 Page 7","permalink":"scooter-girl-5-page-7","position":4,"price":150.0,"default_price":150.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/scooter-girl-5-page-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-23T06:03:17.000Z","description":"11x17\" ink on bristol. \r\n\r\nMargaret takes Ashton to his DJ gig in record time, nearly mowing down several people and neighborhood pets (is that the rear end of Fat Freddy's Cat?) in the process.
