They came up with this lyric swap to the famous \"I Love Rock 'N Roll\" song by Joan Jett, which we quite often rock out to. You should have heard their rolling laughter when they discovered the cleverness of their word swap and that it actually worked with the song! Of course dime and jukebox mean nothing to a 5 and a 3 year old...but straw and juicebox sure do! \r\n\r\nPerfect print for the little rocker in your life! Or juicebox addict..whatever. Comes in an array of colors too. Hand drawn in Illustrator.\r\n\r\nHave a specific color combo in mind that you don't see? Contact me! For just $10 more I will be happy to create a custom color combo for you. \r\n\r\n{Details}\r\n:: 11 x 17 inches\r\n:: Printed with an Epson 1400 using archival inks\r\n:: Printed on Ultra Premium Presentation Matte Photo Paper for Epson\r\n:: Frame and Matte not included\r\n\r\n{Note}\r\n:: Print ships FLAT and will be carefully packaged in a recycled kraft sturdy mailer.\r\n:: Print ships Parcel Post because of it's size.
