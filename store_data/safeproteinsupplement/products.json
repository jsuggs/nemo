ManFeed Pro is the healthy alternative to chemical laden supplements, isolates and other body building and weight gain products that hurt your body as much as they help.\r\n\r\nManFeed Pro is built on three natural products, Rice, Soy and Chia. Our proprietary combination of these products is proven to produce real results through muscle mass gain and fat loss. These core ingredients are so powerful that nutritionists are calling them Super Foods. \r\n\r\nChia Seeds are one of the richest sources of Omega-3 acids anywhere. They are also a good source of fiber, protein, calcium, phosphorus and zinc. Chia has also been proven to assist in the digestive system breaking down carbohydrates into sugars. The research also found that Chia is great for athletes. The high hydrophilic nature of Chia allows the seeds to absorb ten times their weight in water meaning that Chia can help your body stay hydrated in the driest of situations.\r\n\r\nSoy protein is the only commonly consumed plant protein that is nutritionally complete, meaning it contains all of the essential amino acids in sufficient quantities to help meet the body’s requirements. Many nutritional authorities including the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) considers soy protein to be equal in quality to animal protein. Packed with protein, carbohydrates and healthy fats, soy provides your body with the energy it needs. Soy also contributes to cardiovascular health and as been found to help in the prevention of cancer and osteoporosis.\r\n\r\nWhite rice has numerous health benefits, such as providing instant energy, aiding good bowel movement and providing the body an essential source of vitamin B. The National Heart Association studies have shown that vitamin B is a key to keeping a healthy heart and nervous system. White rice is also a natural tonic, has diuretic properties, is free from cholesterol and has anti-inflammatory properties. Also white rice contributes to healthy hair, nails, skin, bone growth and even helps the immune system.\r\n\r\nManFeed Pro has proven to produce real results for many professional and collegiate athletes, including recent Super Bowl Champion Paul Kruger, who has just signed with the Cleveland Browns.  It can do the same for you, helping you build muscle mass while maintaining the nutrition needed for your rigorous lifestyle. \r\n\r\nThere are 32 Grams of Protein Per Serving of ManFeed Pro, with 0 Trans Fat!  Each unit (tub/bottle) has 20 servings.  It is \"College Ratio Compliant\".\r\n\r\nNotice: Use of this product is not intended to be a sole source of nutrition.  It should be used as a calorie replacement or supplement, but NOT as a sole source of one's dietary intake.\r\n\r\nThis item ships from the Salt Lake City, Utah metro area.
