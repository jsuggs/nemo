The main focal points are a large piece of an oversized clam shell and a vertebra from a smooth dogfish shark.  La Petite Sirene is finished with a strong, sterling silver Bali-style toggle clasp.  \r\n\r\nThe turquoise used in this necklace is one of the oldest known gem materials, favored by both the Native Americans and Egyptians for it’s good fortune and healing properties.  The greenish-blue stone, now known as turquoise, acquired it’s name when it was imported to Europe, hundreds of years ago, by Levantine traders, more commonly referred to as Turks. Turquoise is the official birth stone for the month of December, as adopted by the American National Association of Jewelers in 1912, and the planetary stone for Aquarius, Taurus and Sagittarius.\r\n\r\nLa Petite Sirene necklace is a gorgeous piece of jewelry that looks amazing with just a tee shirt and jeans, and is even better as an accoutrement spicing up an outfit for a special event. This piece commands attention and queries about it's gorgeous appearance. Luckily, you now know the story behind it!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe central clam shell pendant is 3.75 inches  wide by 2.75 inches long.  The vertebra measures 1.5 inches in diameter with a height of 1 inch.  The marbled turquoise beads are .75 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe necklace weighs 10.7 oz. as a whole and measures 18.5 inches in length.\r\n\r\nAll materials used to create this couture design were either found, ethically traded\\/purchased, or made by hand. The organic pieces of this particular necklace have been thoroughly cleaned and left untreated\\varnished as to keep their natural beauty in it's original condition.\r\n\r\n-Nickel free.\r\n\r\n*****FREE SHIPPING on all U.S. orders over $125 & all International orders over $150 USD.*****\r\n\r\n\r\n-Comes wrapped in signature All Things Esque packaging with it's own jewelry bag for safe storing. \r\n\r\n-LUXE Collection | to learn more about all of our collections, please visit http://www.allthingsesque.com/collection.html","options":[{"id":33060646,"name":"Default","price":260.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103731076/-/IMG_9892.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103731076/-/IMG_9892.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109803873/-/IMG_0656.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109803873/-/IMG_0656.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103731112/-/IMG_9894.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103731112/-/IMG_9894.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103731052/-/IMG_9888.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103731052/-/IMG_9888.jpg","width":800,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5073340,"name":"Womens","permalink":"womens","url":"/category/womens"},{"id":5067421,"name":"Ocean Safari | Summer 13","permalink":"ocean-safari-summer-13","url":"/category/ocean-safari-summer-13"},{"id":5067397,"name":"LUXE Collection","permalink":"luxe-collection","url":"/category/luxe-collection"},{"id":4521851,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]},{"id":10551904,"name":"Sirene Bracelet - LUXE","permalink":"siren-bracelet-luxe","position":14,"price":52.0,"default_price":52.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/siren-bracelet-luxe","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-15T06:52:34.000Z","description":"Fun, bright and completely one of a kind!

This necklace earns compliments for it’s organic beauty and will more than likely obtain queries regarding it's unique splendor.  Not to fret, though, as you now know the history behind this stately piece!\r\n\r\nThe spiral marine shell fossil was found along Isla de Cabuya , in Costa Rica, which is a small cemetery island, a few hundred meters off the coast of the Nicoyan Peninsula. In pre-Columbian times Cabuya Island was used as a burial ground and is infrequently voyaged, as it is only accessible by either boat or by trekking across a rather rocky sea base, at low tide. The five smaller stones, on the necklace, were found near Coos Bay and Cap Perpetua, along the coast of Oregon.  All of the found organic stones have been left untreated, as to retain their natural beauty.\r\n\r\nThe topaz stones used in this necklace derive their name from the Sanskrit word tapas, meaning fire.  Topaz is a talisman for the sign of Sagittarius and the suggested anniversary gemstone for the 4th, 19th or 23rd year of marriage.  During the Middle Ages topaz was thought to heal both physical and mental disorders and prevent death.  The Greeks believed it had power to increase strength and to make its wearer invisible while the Romans believed it had power to improve eyesight. The Egyptians wore it as an amulet to protect them from injury. \r\n\r\nSmoky quartz is nature's stone of endurance. If you need a extra boost, carry a smokey quartz gemstone with you. It promotes personal pride and joy in living, creativity in business, and it opens the path for perception and learning.  Smokey Quartz commonly known as a grounding stone that transmutes negative energies and facilitates your ability to heal from illness and get things done in the practical world.\r\n\r\n-The necklace, is strung with smoky quartz, topaz, moonstone, and a patterned, silver, chain link strand.  The main focal pice of this necklace is a piece from a fossilized spiral marine shell from Central America.  The five complimentary stones are organic rock from the Pacific Northwest.  The Starry Night Necklace is finished with a hammered, silver toggle clasp. \r\n\r\n-The fossilized spiral marine shell pendant is 3.75 inches (9.5 cm.) long.  \r\nThe necklace, as a whole, measures 19 inches (48.25 cm) in length. \r\nThis weight of this necklace is surprising light for all of the stones it has, weighing a mere 6.65 ounces (188 gm.) \r\n\r\n\r\nAll materials used to create this couture design were either found, ethically traded\\/purchased, or made by hand. The organic pieces of this particular necklace have been thoroughly cleaned and left untreated\\/varnished as to keep their natural beauty in it's original condition.\r\n\r\n-Nickel free.\r\n\r\n*****FREE SHIPPING on all U.S. orders over $125 & all International orders over $150 USD.*****\r\n\r\n-Comes wrapped in signature All Things Esque packaging with it's own jewelry bag for safe storing. \r\n\r\n-LUXE Collection -only one of these! | to learn more about all of our collections, please visit http://www.allthingsesque.com/collection.html","options":[{"id":33041929,"name":"Default","price":240.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103669528/-/IMG_3107.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103669528/-/IMG_3107.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103669564/-/IMG_3109.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103669564/-/IMG_3109.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103669588/-/IMG_3111.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103669588/-/IMG_3111.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103669609/-/IMG_0332.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103669609/-/IMG_0332.jpg","width":799,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109805157/-/IMG_0631.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109805157/-/IMG_0631.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5073340,"name":"Womens","permalink":"womens","url":"/category/womens"},{"id":5067421,"name":"Ocean Safari | Summer 13","permalink":"ocean-safari-summer-13","url":"/category/ocean-safari-summer-13"},{"id":5067397,"name":"LUXE Collection","permalink":"luxe-collection","url":"/category/luxe-collection"},{"id":4521851,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]},{"id":10545673,"name":"Citrine Beach Necklace - LUXE","permalink":"citrine-beach-necklace-luxe","position":61,"price":280.0,"default_price":280.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/citrine-beach-necklace-luxe","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-14T23:31:33.000Z","description":"This one of a kind necklace is lightweight, fun to wear, and it has a vibrant personality with it's ever changing chain movements, which makes Citrine Beach Necklace new, every time you put it on!\r\n\r\n-Made with a gorgeously colored shell (pending on the light it shows hues of golden yellow, off white, silver and so much more) found in South Carolina.

They are fun and have a calming bit of color as well as sparkle and danger (gasp!). \r\n\r\nBlue lace agate is one of the rarest and most popular of the agates.\r\n\r\nThis is a calming, uplifting stone. The blue color strengthens and encourages peace. It can be used wherever there is a build up of painful or irritated energy.\r\n\r\nWear or carry blue lace agate for peace and happiness. Place it in your hand when you feel the need to de-stress. If you find yourself in stressful situations at work or home, simply gaze at it for relief....no joke.\r\n\r\nAs for the bullets? Well they add the perfect juxtaposition! The bullet cartridge used in this bracelet was designed by Georg Luger and introduced in 1902 by the German weapons manufacturer Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken (DWM) for their Luger semi-automatic pistol. Today it is still known as the world's most popular and widely used military handgun cartridge, in addition to being used by over 60% of police in the U.S.\r\n\r\nAt All Things Esque we thought we'd use the often-thought-of-as-negative bullet and turn it into a thing of beauty and mellow it a bit with some peace offering agate. So far, it has done just that and it's quickly become a designer favorite as a result!\r\n________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n-The earrings made with a stainless steel, 9mm Luger bullet shells, silver chain, faceted blue lace agate, and finished with sterling silver ear posts. \r\n\r\n-measure 2.75-inches long\r\n\r\n-Nickel free.\r\n\r\n*****FREE SHIPPING on all U.S. orders over $125 & all International orders over $150 USD.*****\r\n\r\n-Comes wrapped in signature All Things Esque packaging with it's own jewelry bag for safe storing.","options":[{"id":40839924,"name":"Default","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122402373/-/DSCN0067_2_2_4.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122402373/-/DSCN0067_2_2_4.JPG","width":981,"height":982},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122402418/-/IMG_8592.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122402418/-/IMG_8592.jpg","width":3082,"height":3082}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5073340,"name":"Womens","permalink":"womens","url":"/category/womens"},{"id":5067418,"name":"CITY Heritage Collection","permalink":"city-heritage-collection","url":"/category/city-heritage-collection"},{"id":4521854,"name":"Earrings","permalink":"earrings","url":"/category/earrings"}]},{"id":12815433,"name":"Night Moves Bullet Bracelet","permalink":"night-moves-bullet-bracelet","position":71,"price":48.0,"default_price":48.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/night-moves-bullet-bracelet","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-06T20:37:51.000Z","description":"Owning a piece from All Things Esque's City Collection is owning a piece of history!

Miami shootout, at which point the F.B.I. started the process of testing 9mm and .45 ACP ammunition in preparation to replace its standard issue revolver with a semi-automatic pistol. \r\n\r\nThe Winchester .40 S&W was developed from the ground up as a law enforcement cartridge designed to duplicate performance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's reduced-velocity 10mm Auto cartridge. This bullet style debuted on January 17, 1990 and has been used since then by law enforcement agencies throughout the United States. \r\n______________________________________________\r\n-Each cufflink measures 0.45-inches across\r\n\r\n-nickel free\r\n\r\n*****FREE SHIPPING on all U.S. orders over $125 & all International orders over $150 USD.*****\r\n\r\n-Comes wrapped in signature All Things Esque packaging with it's own jewelry bag for safe storing. \r\n\r\n-Le MALE Collection | to learn more about all of our collections, please visit http://www.allthingsesque.com/collection.html","options":[{"id":33072943,"name":"Default","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103777132/-/IMG_0983.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103777132/-/IMG_0983.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103777144/-/IMG_0998.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103777144/-/IMG_0998.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103777048/-/IMG_9253.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103777048/-/IMG_9253.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103777108/-/IMG_8365.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103777108/-/IMG_8365.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5073343,"name":"Mens","permalink":"mens","url":"/category/mens"},{"id":5067421,"name":"Ocean Safari | Summer 13","permalink":"ocean-safari-summer-13","url":"/category/ocean-safari-summer-13"},{"id":5067391,"name":"Le MALE","permalink":"le-male","url":"/category/le-male"},{"id":5067394,"name":"Cufflinks","permalink":"cufflinks","url":"/category/cufflinks"}]}]
