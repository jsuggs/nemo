I truly believe that Art can never be mistaken, and with this being said, I successfully expressed myself within this shirt you are now reading about. The fluorescent pink drips on this shirt symbolizes all of your mistakes, But you must realize that all of your mistakes created a masterpiece. You are truly a work of Art. The florescent drips also glow in the dark. \r\n\r\nRecognized Buyers:\r\n\r\n1. Pedro Ruberte\r\n2. Cachee Livingston \r\n3. Jude Sainjour\r\n4. Brandyne Lacklane\r\n5. Miguel Scharer\r\n6.

The moral of this story? Everyone makes mistakes, some people constantly make mistakes, sometimes even the same mistakes over and over. Mistakes are made to be recognized and to stop your movement, You also must realize that even though your mistake may pause you in your tracks stopping might be the right thing to do. Remember right is always right even when its wrong its right, the real mistake is not stopping and going left.  \r\n","options":[{"id":1124397,"name":"Default","price":37.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1965917/-/TimeIsTime.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1965917/-/TimeIsTime.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":217511,"name":"Frenchy York Portfolio","permalink":"frenchy-york-portfolio","url":"/category/frenchy-york-portfolio"}]},{"id":267550,"name":"LoveGame","permalink":"lovegame","position":4,"price":35.0,"default_price":35.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lovegame","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-03-31T09:56:23.000Z","description":"Demi Cardella Perspective On Life:\r\n\r\nThe Meaning Of This Shirt:\r\n\r\nI believe that love is real. I am in love, I will admit that true love is hard to find but once you find it, it is and will be the most amazing thing that will ever happen to you. People often say that true love is no fun, Well that's because they are not trying to make it exciting. I want to play a game, a game that you and your partner will remember forever. Within this design I expressed myself successfully. The rules to this game involve one partner (preferably the masculine partner) giving this item to his/her mate and telling him or her \"I love you and I am forever yours and you are forever mine.\" Every time your partner wears this shirt you must stop what ever you're doing within the time frame of 12pm to 9pm and hold both of his or her hands and tell them that you love them with all your heart and kiss them. (preferably for more than 3 seconds, but don't try to count because its hard to count and kiss at the same time, I tried it).","options":[{"id":1128677,"name":"Default","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1978769/-/300.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1978769/-/300.JPG","width":250,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":217512,"name":"Demi Cardella Portfolio","permalink":"demi-cardella-portfolio","url":"/category/demi-cardella-portfolio"}]},{"id":267502,"name":"CC x GM (Collab)","permalink":"cc-x-gm-collab","position":5,"price":80.0,"default_price":80.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cc-x-gm-collab","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-03-31T09:07:03.000Z","description":"CanadianConfidential x General Made Perspective on Life:\r\n\r\nThe Meaning Of This Shirt:\r\n\r\nSometimes you just have to recognize those who are built for success, Hence the expression \"Real recognizes real\".
