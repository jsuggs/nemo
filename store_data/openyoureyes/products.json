Vocalist James Corbi has the affable yelp down pat, and his lyrics are as universal as any band with a teenage audience could hope for. Just out on Rochester’s small Open Your Eyes label, the First Things First EP is over before we know it, a jittery collection of high–flying choruses and crescendos. Considering their next two shows after this one are at—no kidding—a roller rink and a bowling alley, these dudes definitely know how to have fun. - Philadelphia Weekly\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n1.
