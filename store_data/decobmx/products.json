My spies will tell you, “Slick-ISH Cables in the front Bro.” Thanks Spies…\r\n\r\nBlack anodized ends\r\n\r\n55″ length\r\n\r\nWeight: 3.5 oz.\r\n\r\nColors: Black, White, Gray, Red\r\n\r\nIntended for front brake use or mild rear brakes. Doing a million bar spins is never good for any cable. They invented the rotor or the new style, no brakes (which I figured out meant no cables). Do the math.\r\nMORE PICS GO HERE: http://decobmx.com/2009/06/test-2/\r\n\r\nINFO CHAD@DECOBMX.COM","options":[{"id":30204029,"name":"BLACK","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30204031,"name":"WHITE","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30204033,"name":"GRAY","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":37253412,"name":"RED","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":42105834,"name":"PURPLE","price":6.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94877047/-/Slick-ish-cables.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94877047/-/Slick-ish-cables.jpg","width":700,"height":465},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121375404/-/DECO_BRAKE_CABLE_RED.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121375404/-/DECO_BRAKE_CABLE_RED.jpg","width":363,"height":383}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":907321,"name":"BIKE PARTS","permalink":"bike-parts","url":"/category/bike-parts"}]},{"id":13184430,"name":"PEGS","permalink":"pegs","position":20,"price":16.99,"default_price":16.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pegs","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-26T19:51:33.000Z","description":"ACTION BARS PEGS\r\nYou don’t want to piss off the man, specially when his bike has no ACTION BARS.
