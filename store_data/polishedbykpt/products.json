Many times love ends in tearful memories, loneliness, and lost souls that know not of where to go forward.  And just when you have moved on, a song, a sight, or a sound and those nostalgic memories come rushing back to remind you love is not always easy, but so is loneliness.  The Unrequited duo set expresses this theme with all purple thermal nail polishes featuring a deep violet to a fair lilac flakes in a black base called Ophelia’s Love and Nostalgia a duo-chrome with satin finish that shifts to a plum (at different angle you can spot green & grey) color to a subtle opal pink-purple. Ophelia’s Love represents a delicate, yet passionate soul, while Nostalgia conveys sadness and unwanted memories. Both Ophelia’s Love and Nostalgia undergo a dramatic transformation from a dark purple color to a light pink purple with a hint of green hue signify there is always a rosier side to life. \r\n\r\n*Disclaimer: Extended exposure of thermal polishes to heat or places of high temperature will decrease the shelf-life and integrity of the thermal polishes.

SMARD1 is a neuromuscular disease that leads to the progressive deterioration of motor function. Unfortunately, at the current moment, the disease is incurable and its biology is not completely deciphered. Inspired by Nate and his story, I am excited to release two nail polishes in his honor: Glowing Smardy and Bleu Cruiser. More importantly, 50% of sales from these two nail polishes will be donated to DCipher Group Foundation – <a href=\"http://smardypants.blogspot.com/\">Nate Green</a>.\r\n\r\nGlowing Smardy (glow in the dark and filled with different shades of blue and glitter shapes and sizes) is a polish that absorbs regular light from a standard household light bulb and glows in the dark. It also glows under black or UV light. Glowing Smardy represents hope in a dark place. While Bleu Cruiser (fluorescent royal blue with micro glass flakes which also glow under UV and black light) represents Nate’s courageous spirit as he cruises in his battle against SMARD. Of all the nail polishes I have created, I am especially proud of these two polishes because they carry with them a special purpose.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, you might wonder if it’s such a rare disease, then how did I find out about SMARDY? Nate’s aunt is my co-worker and told me about the condition. I hope you will join me in sending your love to Nate. I have received so much love and support from all of you and this is my way of paying it forward to a strong-will soul like Nate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSwatches by\r\n <a href=\"http://www.makeupwithdrawal.com/l\">makeupwithdrawal</a> \r\n<a href=\"http://madamluck.blogspot.com/\">madamluck</a> ","options":[{"id":39741951,"name":"full size duo","price":16.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39741954,"name":"Bleu Cruiser","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":39741957,"name":"Glowing Smardy","price":10.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":41105919,"name":"Wear Smardy polish bobby pin (pair)","price":10.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121634262/-/1070105_587004374675522_2033429305_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121634262/-/1070105_587004374675522_2033429305_n.jpg","width":612,"height":612},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122021448/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122021448/-/image.jpg","width":2542,"height":2615},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121867695/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121867695/-/image.jpg","width":960,"height":960},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121867737/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121867737/-/image.jpg","width":960,"height":960},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121867752/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121867752/-/image.jpg","width":960,"height":960}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3508543,"name":"Glitter/Crelly","permalink":"glitter-crelly","url":"/category/glitter-crelly"},{"id":4499416,"name":"Neon/Glow","permalink":"neon-glow","url":"/category/neon-glow"}]},{"id":12473457,"name":"Color Therapy","permalink":"color-therapy","position":37,"price":9.0,"default_price":9.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/color-therapy","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-07-20T05:50:11.000Z","description":"A fun bold neon pink and green glitter with tiny shifting opalescent and blue glitter topper in a clear base that also glow under UV and black light.
