This poster is 18x23 inches on our house sheet and is purple, black, gray, translucent golden metallic, and a light blue to dark blue split fountain background.  The split fountain is very random on this print so each one is quite different and has a painted and distressed quality to it.

How do I know this?  His glasses are made of venetian blinds and that shit is 80’s as hell. Plus it is so tacky that only a robot with no sense of style would put them on.  AND, his name reminds me of the Will Smith box-office blunder Wild Wild West which had a giant robot spider thing in it.  Now I am thinking of Kool Moe Dee.  Damn it, Kanye… Damn it!  Oh yeah, we made a poster for his glow in the dark tour which is totally freakin’ rad.  Peep it, kid!  6 colors (Glow in the dark ink, fluorescent blue, pink, green, purple, clear varnish) on iridescent blue cardstock.
