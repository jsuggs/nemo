They are the same species that have made the island of Ni'ihau so famous. My work has been mistaken for Ni'ihau originals because I learned my traditional sewing techniques from a Ni'ihau Aunty. \r\n\r\nKulapepeiao kipona kahelelani, mixed kahelelani sewn pikake style together with a globe of lava, topped with a puka and hung on sterling silver ear wires. The shells measure one and three eighths inch. \r\n\r\nMany hours have been spent gathering, sorting, piercing and sewing the tiny shells. Kahelelani measure one eighth of an inch. You are witnessing the natural beauty of these shells as nothing has been used to enhance them. The beautiful pink color and shiny luster is created by ke Akua (God) together with the sea.\r\n\r\nCustom orders are always welcome. I have additional pairs like these on display at a local gallery, let me know if you need more. Each pair is slightly different.
