In one episode, she puts an Italian spin on the one-dish meal and creates a “meaty” Roasted Eggplant Cannelloni, another classic dinner with a delicious twist, then finishes off the meal with her very special Tofu Cannoli*. In the other episode, Toni puts a new twist on a worldwide favorite, to create a Vegetarian Beefy Lasagna that’s out of this world. Then she pairs it with Insalata Pomodoro (tomato salad) and a light, authentic Italian-style Garlic Bread.\r\n\r\n*Cannoli shells may contain dairy, so check the label if you’re vegan.\r\nAll other recipes have vegan or vegetarian substitutes.\r\n","options":[{"id":9113044,"name":"Default","price":12.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/24756599/-/screener_dvd300_copy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/24756599/-/screener_dvd300_copy.jpg","width":300,"height":280}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
