We are so ready to shed our winter coats and boots and feel the sand between our toes.  We can’t wait to get our first glimpse of the cabin without all the snow covering its roof and decks.  Are we too early to hear the call of the loons as they come back again this year to our little lake?  Will the wild trillium still be blooming?  As we approach the turn-off to the road leading to the cabin we are all thinking about the fun we will be having there in the summer and are excited to be able to get out of the car and get that first breath of cabin-fresh air!  At last!  We are at the road leading down to the cabin.  It is a rough two rutted gravel road, with a center strip of grasses, weeds and flowers all reaching for the sunlight.  It is a steep and winding road down which we have to drive slowly, as we listen to the tires make their gravel popping noises and listen to the grasses rub the underside of the car in a hushing brush of sounds.  These are the first sounds of the cabin in the spring!\r\nThe thin stripes of these towels, made of 100 percent fine imported linen, evoke the impression of the gravel and grass road that leads down to our cabin.  These textiles are skillfully handwoven on a 16 harness floor loom with fine craftsmanship.  Each towel is a wonderful piece of art for your spa, bath, or kitchen to be used in your everyday living.\r\n","options":[{"id":24548634,"name":"Default","price":80.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.5,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76354776/-/Vavaveve_CSII_Hand_Towel_in_Cabin_Road_in_New_Leaf_-_Hanging_from_tab_917x1012_.jpgIMG_2698.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76354776/-/Vavaveve_CSII_Hand_Towel_in_Cabin_Road_in_New_Leaf_-_Hanging_from_tab_917x1012_.jpgIMG_2698.jpg","width":906,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76354884/-/Vavaveve_CSII_Hand_Towel_in_Cabin_Road_in_New_Leaf_-_Hanging_from_tab_Detail_738x811_.jpgIMG_2698.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76354884/-/Vavaveve_CSII_Hand_Towel_in_Cabin_Road_in_New_Leaf_-_Hanging_from_tab_Detail_738x811_.jpgIMG_2698.jpg","width":738,"height":811}],"artists":[{"id":148569,"name":"cabin road","permalink":"cabin-road","url":"/artist/cabin-road"},{"id":200988,"name":"new leaf","permalink":"new-leaf","url":"/artist/new-leaf"}],"categories":[{"id":3892581,"name":"hand towels","permalink":"hand-towels","url":"/category/hand-towels"}]},{"id":7967859,"name":"Cabin Series II - Hand Towel - Snowflake in Slate with Dreamsicle","permalink":"cabin-series-ii-snowflake-hand-towel-in-slate-with-dreamsicle","position":5,"price":80.0,"default_price":80.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cabin-series-ii-snowflake-hand-towel-in-slate-with-dreamsicle","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-13T06:12:07.000Z","description":"WOVEN BY HAND ON OLD WOODEN FLOOR LOOMS\r\nbelgian and lithuanian linen\r\n24\" wide x 24\" long\r\ndesign:  snowflake\r\ncolor:  slate withdreamsicle\r\n\r\nthe cabin series  –  SNOWFLAKE DESIGN story . . . \r\n\r\nThis past Christmas, as with every Christmas, we made the journey to our cabin to spend the whole holiday as a family, cozy in our warm little cabin.

A walk through the forest seems as though one is walking through a woods composed of telephone poles, so tall and straight are the aspen trees! The canopy of leaves, so high up, seems like glittering clouds of green and silver, fluttering wildly as if to get the attention of the sun.  These fluttering Aspen leaves are the inspiration for the Aspen Design!\r\n\r\nThese 24” x24” hand towels are inspired by those fluttering Aspen leaves.  The 10 harness complex twill structure captures and reflects light in a delightful shimmer of cascading linen.  They are 100 percent imported linen, personally handwoven on a floor loom.
