Each numeral, aside from the quarter hour markers (which remain in their traditional positions), is arrayed at the top and bottom of the watch face, trailing horizontal lines that meet with the Elliptica's hands to easily indicate the time.\r\n\r\nThe Movado Elliptica's stainless steel case is curved to fit the wrist, and is shaped like a comma when viewed from the side. Chronograph models are also available and are equally distinctive-the chronograph buttons are uniquely positioned at ten, twelve and two o'clock, instead of on the right side of the watch, where they are commonly found. The Movado Elliptica is available with highly-polished stainless steel bracelets or elegant alligator straps, and is protected with scratch-resistant sapphire crystal. This unique Movado creation sports either precision Swiss-quartz movement, or Swiss automatic movement that winds from the natural pendulum motion of your arm.\r\n\r\n<u>FEATURES:</u>\r\n-Shape:  Rectangular\r\n-Finish: Polished and Brushed\r\n-Material: Stainless Steel\r\n-Width: 25 mm without crown\r\n-Thickness: 11 mm\r\n-Case Length with Lugs: 38 mm\r\n-Hands: Silver Tone Hands\r\n-Markers: Arabic Numerals\r\n\r\nBEZEL\r\n-Material: Stainless Steel\r\n\r\nMOVEMENT\r\n-Type: Mechanical Automatic (Self-Winding)\r\n-Country Of Origin: Made in Switzerland\r\n\r\nBAND\r\n-Type: Strap\r\n-Material: Alligator Leather\r\n-Color: Black\r\n-Width: 18 mm\r\n-Length: 8.5 inches\r\n-Clasp: Pin Buckle\r\n\r\nNote: The box shows some signs of handling\r\n\r\nPlease email us any questions or concerns!\r\n\r\nWM046","options":[{"id":25946247,"name":"Default","price":624.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/80944089/-/Movado_WM046_pic8.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/80944089/-/Movado_WM046_pic8.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/80944041/-/Movado_WM046_pic1.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/80944041/-/Movado_WM046_pic1.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/80944077/-/Movado_WM046_pic4.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/80944077/-/Movado_WM046_pic4.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/80944053/-/Movado_WM046_pic2.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/80944053/-/Movado_WM046_pic2.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/80944137/-/Movado_WM046_pic12.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/80944137/-/Movado_WM046_pic12.JPG","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[{"id":148872,"name":"MOVADO","permalink":"movado","url":"/artist/movado"}],"categories":[{"id":3885618,"name":"Watches","permalink":"watches","url":"/category/watches"},{"id":3885621,"name":"Watches - Men","permalink":"watches-men","url":"/category/watches-men"},{"id":3885624,"name":"Watches - Women","permalink":"watches-women","url":"/category/watches-women"}]},{"id":8080917,"name":"Concord Impresario Women White Dial Watch 0308742 ","permalink":"concord-impresario-women-white-dial-watch-0308742","position":10,"price":829.99,"default_price":829.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/concord-impresario-women-white-dial-watch-0308742","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-19T20:02:11.000Z","description":"<b><font color=\"navy\">Concord Impresario Women White Dial Watch 0308742 </font></b>\r\nCondition: New in the box \r\n\r\nHandcrafted by Swiss watchmakers, this Concord Impresario women's watch combines classic design and the finest materials into an elegant timepiece.\r\n\r\nThis stainless steel watch with coin edge features a textured white dial with Roman numerals at 6, 9, and 12; a date display rests at 3.
