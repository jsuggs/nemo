He was inspired by a trip to the reptile house at London Zoo. In real life little blue frogs are pretty poisonous so you might not really want one as a pet. Much better to buy this print instead!\r\n\r\nThis is a high quality giclee print on thick 255gsm stock. Both inks and paper are archival quality and are fade resistant for 70-80 years. The print is signed and is a limited edition of 50.\r\n\r\nThe print is A5 (210x148 mm) plus a 25mm white border so that it's a nice dinky size and easy to frame. Aristophanes and Constantine would make a lovely set if you are looking for a pair of prints. \r\n\r\nThe print is sold unframed to keep p&p prices down and to allow you to frame it as you want.\r\n\r\nI've done my best to photograph the print accurately but the colors that you see on your screen may vary slightly from the actual printed colors (possibly looking a little lighter on screen).\r\n\r\nCopyright 2011 HelloWilson.","options":[{"id":11326766,"name":"Default","price":21.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/48041913/-/il_fullxfull-5.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/48041913/-/il_fullxfull-5.jpeg","width":570,"height":392}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1547389,"name":"Giclee print","permalink":"giclee-print","url":"/category/giclee-print"}]},{"id":3327991,"name":"Chameleon limited edition print.
