Originally produced February 1991 as untitled studio working tapes over two hours in length.  Unlike the Yeast Culture vinyl that's out there (earlier records predating these sessions), this material is free form studio experimentation with a whole lot of odd tapes of all kinds what we recorded during 1987-early 91.  The sounds are from the earliest years, done much in a collective experimental spirit with no precise goal.  The mixdown glues these together in a way that's a pastiche of primitive recordings, mostly at playback speeds unlike the original material. Sounds vary from an almost power electronics intensity in parts to progressing collages with tinny rhythms, or tiny voices and background electronics.  It's the juxtaposition of the different styles that forms the abstraction.\r\nNone of these long tracks have been released before now.  These tapes are a good sample of the wackiness or intensity of Incubator circa 1990, during the time that we had the retail shop and mail order operating on a daily basis.  The 7\" single by Yeast Culture in the Circusirus compilation was made originally from these same tapes by several levels of extreme processing  Roughly 2.5 hours of studio material here, had been reduced to merely 4 minutes of compressed sound in Circusirus.  Now the full expanded sounds may be heard here.

During our days, while she was studying at the Kathmandu Association For The Deaf, I was roaming the streets and villages of the Kathmandu Valley in search of sounds and music. While kickin' round the tourist district of Thamel picking up cassettes, I met a family of Snake Charmers from Haryana, India. An old man probably in his 70s or 80s, his 2 grandsons, and one of the grandson's sons. They asked if I wanted to see a show....I said Hell YES!! They gave me a show...a KILLER show... we're talkin' 3 fuckin' king cobras dancing at once, while a giant boa chilled at the side and few other random lil' snake dudes are wigglin' around here and there. I became obsessed. I had met my new best friends... Though the kind of best friends you have to pay to hang out with. They were hustlers, yes.. But that's their job... The money was well worth the shows. I spent about 3-4 days a week for the next 2 months, recording their music and their snake shows on mini-disc and videotape. I drank a lot of chiyaa with them, smoked a lot of cigarettes and bidis. They taught me how to make reeds out of bamboo, and I traded them some clothes for a snake charming horn. They call them Beens, they are also known as Pungis. These guys were the best. At the end of April they left Kathmandu, heading to Pokhara, after that it was time for them to head back home with their earnings. Man...I missed them. This is the best of the best of the recordings I made of them. There are some classic Bollywood tracks, a Nepali folk song, and a 19- minute drone journey into the head of the King Cobra.

Contains a 28 minute bonus track.\r\n\r\nBelow is a review of the original LP:\r\n\r\n\"With only tape loops, metal, and horns (and sometimes, it seems, metal on horns) the two side long pieces, 'Chain Shot' and 'Execution Dock' respectively, explore the ugly underbelly of noise before just scraping right through and aiming for the insides. In a genre that has quickly turned into a broad and often inaccurate description of a certain breed of every-man experimental music, Dilloway sticks to the old-fashioned definition of noise, doing battle with the materials in front of him as he continues the construction of his impressive body of work.\r\n\r\nDilloway, a former member of noise-titans Wolf Eyes, has recently been releasing solo work that explores much more abstract and thoughtful terrain than his previous group's onslaughts. 'Chain Shot' is more a sound collage than anything, and while it is a heaping glob of muddled debris, it is also a highly controlled one. Looping samples on top of samples, Dilloway builds a slowly encroaching beast before slowly disintegrating it, bone by bone. This is some highly textural and immediately emotive soundscape work.\r\n\r\n'Execution Dock' begins with a repeating loop of what sounds like the beginning and the end syllables of some nut's conversation with a lamppost. In the distance sounds a pained song of sorts, like a rodent's death cry, or maybe its birth one. I'm guessing maybe this is the horn, though it would be tough to be certain about much of anything here. Delayed creaks and groans float in and around as the vocal sample dissipates, leaving you sloshing through the mud puddle only to realize that its a tar pit the size of La Brea.\"---HENRY SMITH, http://earconditionednightmare.blogspot.com ","options":[{"id":27108870,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84990801/-/HN207_0.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84990801/-/HN207_0.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":159075,"name":"AARON DILLOWAY","permalink":"aaron-dilloway","url":"/artist/aaron-dilloway"}],"categories":[{"id":4159731,"name":"HANSON RECORDS","permalink":"hanson-records","url":"/category/hanson-records"},{"id":4159638,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":8438925,"name":"AARON DILLOWAY - Door With No Handle CASSETTE","permalink":"aaron-dilloway-door-with-no-handle-cassette","position":27,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/aaron-dilloway-door-with-no-handle-cassette","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-08T14:09:06.000Z","description":"\"A major oxide wobbble as the Michigan master of magnetic tape hiss finally delivers some dementia for the Monk.

Originally released on LP by SILENT RECORDS in 1986, this digipak CD edition has been remastered by Warn Defever from the original master reels, and includes the full COMPLETE ALBUM as two of the tracks had to be shortened to fit on the original LP issue. Available to order NOW!\r\n\r\n'Back during my Bachelor of Fine Arts, one of my fellow students was a woman who was eventually obsessed with the idea, systems, and eventual remnants of ‘process’. One of her key pieces involved hundreds of raw eggs which she carefully emptied, cracked open, and systematically peeled the delicate membranes from inside of the eggs. She carefully laid out the hundreds of membranes as they assembled in a giant area to the side of the studio. I swear that she didn’t even have some grandiose idea for the membranes as the peeling and assemblage system(s) evolved into something that was simply beyond any eventuality and initial idea for the piling skins of the eviscerated eggs. The deconstruction and conception behind the act of pulling apart the eggs into a vast collection of grimy, translucent membrane piles suggested something so much more than even a final constructed piece. Watching her as she realized that the true crux behind the piece was the process alone was astounding as the membranes were laid to rest to represent an almost sudden and powerful eventuality that acted as a piled testament to ‘process’. The harsh sound works of THE HATERS over artist GX Jupitter-Larsen’s long and established career also powerfully bring to mind the idea of process. Most of THE HATERS’ works are ideologies behind something being destroyed or manipulated; the amplified and sometimes distorted sounds of the processes representing a document that exemplifies the acts carried out upon the objects, machines, or otherwise. The act of recording the processes alone is evidence of an eventuality (to possibly be edited further) in the form of a possible final piece of vinyl, cassette, or CD, but the tendencies of THE HATERS’ material also intend the listener to experience the process of the audio lines as they were primarily constructed in the recording area. There is no doubt that GX appreciates the totemic quality of his personal objects’ physical aftermath, that is sometimes documented with video or photographs, but the powerful beauty of a THE HATERS audio piece is the experience for the listener that acts ALSO as a final document of sound that represent clearly the certain idea and sometimes violent act. THE HATERS’ celebrated early work “In the Shade of Fire” acts a document collection for the listener that also reflects THE HATERS strong textural aesthetic through object manipulation and recording that defines GX’s place in the world of ‘harsh noise’. Listening your way through the material is a studied and defined testament to different representational fragments of heavy sound and source manipulation. The tracks Glsam and Diti are explosive introductory and side concluding / framing pieces that highlight and pronounce the breaking and crashing down of material, all gelled with bass driven strikes whose trails deteriorate into hints of cascading dirty and dark ‘Americanoise’ distortion. Bebas powers through a heavier dynamic with conscious falling apart of source material, but in abstracted waves that suggest the material being rebuilt just to simply fall and crash apart again with a sense of powerful futility. Thuch enhances the textural elements of the explosions and crashing as the sharpness of the strikes are slightly ‘rounded’ at the edges to expose an almost ‘gurgling’ texture that moves and slaps with vicious perplexity. Taisic represents a very early ‘Americanoise’ study of hiss manipulation that is accented with minimalist scraping that bring to mind the force of process on top of the white noise line. Cassas is the album’s meditated example of sharp shot-driven violence; articulated and seemingly layered for optimum cutting and breaking which bring forth sound dynamism from very physical deterioration. Fire 5 is an amazing example of a highly textural ‘wall’ of sound that, to the contemporary fan of gritty and dirty crunch waves, is a primary early example of powerful crackle lines that focus on the inner dynamism of the sound itself. All of the material discussed above is made up of elements of physicality and process, but the tracks Iny 1 and Iny 2 act, for the listener, as the ‘notes’ for the ideology of process and falling apart as they act as a more minimal, subtle, and exacting study of the scraping, scuffing, and hands on work of the artist as he manipulates the deteriorating materials. In essence, Iny 2 is an amazing concluding track that reminds the listener of the core focus and ideology behind THE HATERS’ exemplification of grating sound via concept driven manipulation of tangible sources, the process, the aftermath, and the eventual recording that reflects all of the above sound qualities.'\r\n\r\n---- Sam McKinlay","options":[{"id":27109407,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84992277/-/HN206_0.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84992277/-/HN206_0.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":162594,"name":"THE HATERS","permalink":"the-haters","url":"/artist/the-haters"}],"categories":[{"id":4159731,"name":"HANSON RECORDS","permalink":"hanson-records","url":"/category/hanson-records"},{"id":4159638,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":8438889,"name":"SKIN GRAFT - Dystrophy CD","permalink":"skin-graft-dystrophy-cd","position":37,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/skin-graft-dystrophy-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-08T14:02:18.000Z","description":"Debut CD release for Cleveland's SKIN GRAFT.
