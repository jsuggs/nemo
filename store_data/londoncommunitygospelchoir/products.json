He was born into poverty and a life without hope but found his future fulfilled through his calling to music. Bazil left the Caribbean and came to England at 9. A difficult relationship with his stepfather led to his leaving home at age 13 and moving in with his pastor who suggested he take up music. She prayed and laid hands on him and by the end of the evening he could play the piano. Within a fortnight he was performing in public. \r\n\r\nTo this day, Bazil still can't read music and plays purely by instinct. He has worked with most of the greats - from Daman Albarn (Blur) to Beverly Knight - and the book carries some impressive endorsements.\r\n\r\n\r\nGet your copy of Bazil Meade's book at the special LCGC price of only £7.49 (RRP £9.99)\r\n\r\nAuthor: Bazil Meade\r\nFormat: Paperback\r\nISBN: 9781854249982\r\nPublished: 23 September 2011\r\nPublisher: Monarch Books","options":[{"id":18016417,"name":"Default","price":7.49,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54967063/-/Bazil_book.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54967063/-/Bazil_book.jpg","width":651,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":109163,"name":"London Community Gospel Choir","permalink":"london-community-gospel-choir","url":"/artist/london-community-gospel-choir"},{"id":109167,"name":"Bazil Meade","permalink":"bazil-meade","url":"/artist/bazil-meade"}],"categories":[{"id":2961557,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":5598899,"name":"Bazil Meade: A Boy, A Journey, A Dream","permalink":"bazil-meade-a-boy-a-journey-a-dream","position":2,"price":7.49,"default_price":7.49,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bazil-meade-a-boy-a-journey-a-dream","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-03-02T17:55:38.000Z","description":"After the successful release of Bazil Meade's new book \"A Boy, A Journey, A Dream\", Bazil went into the studio and recorded acoustic versions the songs which he used for the chapter title of the book.
