quality giclee prints available at: www.society6.com/orlandosanchezart\r\n\r\nI had a great time putting together the video for this drawing and watching the changes that went on for 9 hours. Usually your working on a piece and once you commit to a change your memory of what it used to look like before is pretty bad. I think there were a couple points where it was finished but I wanted to continue pushing my self to really get the expression and feeling across very well. The cherry on top was of course the song from Little Dragon “Ritual Union” giving it a strong feeling that comes across. Which is not only about the painting and the process but being the artist being inspired be Loli and my own personal experiences. \r\n\r\nThe feeling I had after it was complete was a sense of letting go of your own consciousness. A feeling of transcendence that every one goes through right before going to sleep. That one moment that you feel yourself slipping from one reality into another. Your memory of color shifts into these warm and cools, and at times only black and white. I find a deep connection with this painting that I enjoy. It is beautiful:) ","options":[{"id":35173950,"name":"Default","price":250.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":30.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109941885/-/LOLI120.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109941885/-/LOLI120.jpg","width":1000,"height":768},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109941855/-/FACE.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109941855/-/FACE.jpg","width":1000,"height":708},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109942995/-/loli_final_012_copy.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109942995/-/loli_final_012_copy.JPG","width":1000,"height":708}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":10797030,"name":"\"Loli study #1\" Original Artwork ","permalink":"loli-study-1-original-artwork","position":21,"price":1500.0,"default_price":1500.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/loli-study-1-original-artwork","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-26T23:51:33.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/65980246?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ff0179&amp;autoplay=1\" width=\"270\" height=\"149\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nOriginal Artwork in the private collection of Sean Kibbe\r\nNupastels, charcoal, and black ink\r\non 18 inches by 24 inches Neenah 80lb paper\r\n\r\nLoli is one of three models that I recently did a photo shoot with that will inspire several studies.
