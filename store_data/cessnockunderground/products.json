This is the pummeling debut EP from SECTARIAN VIOLENCE, an intercontinental straight edge hardcore punk band comprised of members of bands from the US (COKE BUST), the UK (NEVER AGAIN), and Sweden (STAY HUNGRY). Fast, raw, pissed off hardcore drawing influences from 80's hardcore like THE ABUSED, LIFES BLOOD, NEGATIVE APPROACH, or early AGNOSTIC FRONT, with a contemporary take on the genre similar to more recent bands like VIOLENT MINDS or DEAD STOP. Raging fast parts combined with hard hitting breakdowns, all of which are executed with desperation and urgency of those classic 80's bands. Lyrically the topics cover a range of social and political issues, both globally and locally, seething with the frustration and anger that makes hardcore and punk still relevant in 2012","options":[{"id":18607705,"name":"Default","price":3.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/56946223/-/grave051_sv_120px.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/56946223/-/grave051_sv_120px.jpg","width":120,"height":120}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2580427,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"}]},{"id":5178297,"name":"SLUGZ  -  SUIT AND TIE","permalink":"slugz-suit-and-tie","position":2,"price":3.4,"default_price":3.4,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/slugz-suit-and-tie","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-01-03T19:11:32.000Z","description":"\"Debut 7\" from this new and young garage punk band from Richmond / Charlottesville, Virginia. Sam from Southside Stranglers / Got Myself zine is the driving force behind this band, so you know they know what's up. As for the music, it's raw, trashy garage that eases right up to the border of being hardcore. The closest comparison I can think of is the Retainers, but they are at times even more melodic than that band, approaching near-Carbonas levels of killer songwriting. I hear they have another EP on the way as well and I can't wait to hear that one too. Definitely a keeper here.\" (Daniel Lupton)","options":[{"id":16802831,"name":"Default","price":3.4,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.3,"amount_with_others":0.3,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50850505/-/images__12_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50850505/-/images__12_.jpg","width":222,"height":227}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2580427,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"}]},{"id":5178221,"name":"YOUNG REPUBLICANS    -  SABOTAGE YOUR COOKOUT EP","permalink":"young-republicans-sabotage-your-cookout-ep","position":3,"price":3.4,"default_price":3.4,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/young-republicans-sabotage-your-cookout-ep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-01-03T23:58:41.000Z","description":"Finally found after going missing for nearly 25 years, the Young Republicans demo cassette is certainly one of the most elusive and infamous artifacts in the history of hardcore and is truly a special item. Some have claimed that it never existed while others have referred to it as a \"holy grail\" item. Recorded in ’83 and only given to a handful of close friends, ¾ of the band would later go on to form the initial lineup of the influential group YOUTH OF TODAY. This 9 song EP captures the absolute essence of spirited hardcore under the shroud of Reagan: snot-nosed teens going faster MPH while standing in opposition to teachers, parents, rednecks, & suburbia. Highly catchy & classic sounding, this could easily be considered the crucial missing NYHC or CT 7” EP from 1983.\r\n\r\nALSO COMES WITH DOWNLOAD CARD ONLY A FEW AVAILABLE SO BE QUICK ON THIS ONE IT REALLY IS WORTH IT","options":[{"id":16802623,"name":"Default","price":3.4,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.3,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50849473/-/images__11_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50849473/-/images__11_.jpg","width":225,"height":225}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2580427,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"}]},{"id":4841657,"name":"DIVORCE LOVE ATTACK","permalink":"divorce-love-attack","position":4,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/divorce-love-attack","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-14T03:30:51.000Z","description":" ‘Love Attack’ is a brash, in your face musical attack.
