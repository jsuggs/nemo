The instrumental \"Theme (Dugong Sing-Along)\" will certainly get your heart pumping while their bombastic cover of the legendary Big Boys' \"Which Way To Go\" will literally draw blood. Literally. \r\n\r\nThis is a SUPER limited edition split 7\" and these three songs will never be available anywhere else EVER!

More polished than the prior project, and with the addition of Eddie Zepeda, Alfonso Robles, and Jose Medina; the band has no hints of being inlanders with their jangly guitars and swoon-worthy vocals. Quickly collecting a fan base by playing shows in the Bay Area with like-minded musicians, Surf Club gains comparisons to all the cliches – but they break molds with an infectious stand-out creativity.
