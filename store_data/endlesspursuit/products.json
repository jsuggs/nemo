MS, or Multiple Sclerosis, is the leading cause of neurological disability among young adults worldwide. It has the highest rates of depression among all disabilities, above that of cancer, substance withdrawals, and epilepsy. Multiple Sclerosis robs people of emotional strength, mental stability, spiritual wellness, and physical endurance.\r\n\r\n25 years later, Linda is a mom of Endless Pursuit Founder, Ry Thompson. EP is one of the first nationwide faith organizations to directly combat Multiple Sclerosis. She serves as an Honorary Board Member, a constant advisor to the entire team. Ry Thompson has had MS since 2006.\r\n\r\nStopping the journey there would only be at the beginning. November of 2013 Linda was diagnosed with Colon Cancer. Now facing chemo and a long recovery process, bills are piling up and finances are hard to grasp. Join us as we gather around our beloved Linda. Always full of joy and a smile when called Lindabug from her little niece, we thought it fitting to name a bracelet after this pillar of God.\r\n\r\nLinda impacts thousands around the globe that live with Multiple Sclerosis and is a local leader in the PNW. She has resided in a small Washington state town for the past 24 years and works at a local doctor's clinic. Happily married with two adult children.\r\n\r\nAll profit from this bracelet goes to Linda as a blessing to help her in her bills and time of need. Blue represents the color of Colon Cancer and orange represents the color of Multiple Sclerosis awareness.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nParacord or 550 cord is one of the most important things that you'd like to have in an emergency situation.
