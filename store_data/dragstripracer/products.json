This hour long documentary shows our path of discovery of the history of this bike, it's builder, it's over two decades of El Mirage and Bonneville Salt Flats race history, and it's return to glory on the Salt. \r\n\r\nSous-titré en français\r\n日本語字幕 \r\n\r\n\"In the 1960s and 1970s, legions of speed freaks blasted down the drag strips and dry lakes of Southern California on their two-wheeled tickets to thrills. Legions more campaigned machines at the famed Bonneville Salt Flats during the same time. What happened to these motorcycles? The vast majority of them have disappeared into the mists of time, disassembled and used for restoring soulless stockers or simply forgotten in old sheds and barns. Once in awhile one turns up and gets sold to a museum or carefully displayed in some motorcycle shop owner’s office. Rarely if ever again do these machines return to their beloved battleground: the Dry Lake or Salt Flat. \r\n\r\nThe Return of the Nitro Express is the story of one bike that did not get filed away and retired. Thanks to two present day cowboy speed junkies who eschew modern technology and dance with dangerous old motorcycles, the Salt Ghost will be reborn…or will it? Watch as Wes and Tyler bring the Nitro Express back to where it all began, to the dry and hot Bonneville Salt Flats where legends are born in blood, sweat and gears!\" \r\n\r\nThis Region 0 DVD and will play world-wide, USA, Australia, Europe, Japan OK! 60 minutes run time.","options":[{"id":13880971,"name":"Default","price":27.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41119101/-/large_1690_salt-ghost-return-of-the-nitro-express-dvd-cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41119101/-/large_1690_salt-ghost-return-of-the-nitro-express-dvd-cover.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41119133/-/large_1690_salt-ghost-return-of-the-nitro-express-dvd-back-cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41119133/-/large_1690_salt-ghost-return-of-the-nitro-express-dvd-back-cover.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41119155/-/large_1690_salt-ghost-return-of-the-nitro-express-dvd-photo-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41119155/-/large_1690_salt-ghost-return-of-the-nitro-express-dvd-photo-1.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41119173/-/large_1690_salt-ghost-return-of-the-nitro-express-dvd-photo-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41119173/-/large_1690_salt-ghost-return-of-the-nitro-express-dvd-photo-2.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41119189/-/large_1690_salt-ghost-return-of-the-nitro-express-dvd-photo-3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41119189/-/large_1690_salt-ghost-return-of-the-nitro-express-dvd-photo-3.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1014091,"name":"DVD's","permalink":"dvd-s","url":"/category/dvd-s"}]},{"id":5809341,"name":"El Diablo Run: A Mexican Motorcycle Adventure DVD","permalink":"el-diablo-run-a-mexican-motorcycle-adventure-dvd","position":42,"price":27.0,"default_price":27.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/el-diablo-run-a-mexican-motorcycle-adventure-dvd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-03-29T14:28:42.000Z","description":"Ever wonder what happens when a few hundred bike riders with an insatiable taste for fire, beer and mayhem ride hand-built choppers across twisty, pitted tarmac from SoCal to Baja and back?
