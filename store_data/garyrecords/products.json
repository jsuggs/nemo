They are also the coolest fucking band that most people I know have never heard. What isn’t shrouded in myth and legend about these Taiwanese rock’n’rollers is their extraordinary ability to genre-bend effectively. Jon Du, Tseng Kuo Hung, and Luo Zun Long are the lyrical and auditory equivalent of Rain Man with a musical Lego set. Their sound manages to simultaneously morph between King Khan and the Shrines, Television, and Wire, while maintaining a level of constructive variance that might convince you they hadn’t actually ever listened to any of their musical forebears.\r\n\r\nWHITE LODGE (QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA)\r\nPsychedelic space wizards White Lodge hail from a land where “Twin Peaks” references fall flat. Their name can be traced to a historically imposing mansion in Kangaroo Point, Brisbane that has been in existence at least since the early 1900’s. Much like their name, White Lodge’s music has an old soul; early rock n’ roll and soul influences are evident in the doo-wop vocalizations while fast paced garage-surf hangs loose over reverb-heavy vocals. Quick timing changes and short, hook-heavy tracks keep things from seeming formulaic. These young men have definitely been doing their homework. White Lodge would be equally at home slamming whiskey shots out of a friend’s navel as they would be playing the slow-dance at the garage-surf dance hall.

Deistic comparisons aside, out of the derth of fantastic Philadelphia bands, Shape Breaker has something unique going on. The brain-child of Pat Hickey has one constant element: fuzz. The remaining elements shapeshift depending on the varying degrees of oscillating lead guitar, Amishly simplistic (not a bad thing) drum beats, and vocal tracks that blend so seamlessly into the riffs that you would think that Nikolai Tesla invented a new kind of auto-tune. \r\n\r\nFUCK MOUNTAIN (DUBLIN, IRELAND)\r\nA sonic ice-cream rolling down a 75-degree incline. If your mirror conception of Dublin is limited to Guinness and A Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man, prepare to be shattered. These veteran slashers earned their bones in Crowd Control and Exploding Birds but were undoubtedly psychically channelling Chicago’s Dastard and Dinosaur Jr. and doing some lines of Bleach-era Nirvana and Huey Lewis and the News in creating this project. This is not a band for rain sounds and pedicures, but pop a good local stout beer and get in the basement or your bathtub. This rampaging tornado of sound will make every day feel like Friday at 4:45 PM.\r\n \r\nP.S.
