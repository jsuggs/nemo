I even have tutorials out there. There are missing elements that you cannot get from either of these media and they are direct feedback and insightful explanation.  It’s also significantly more fun with two.\r\n\r\nImportant: basic spinning skills are a must with this class..... you should be able to spin a single. You must also be able to video chat on skype for this class.\r\n\r\nFantastic Features:\r\n\r\n- after purchase  I will email you with questionnaire  so I can tailor a plan for your personal needs or you can download it here.\r\n\r\n- a 60 minute online lesson with me over Skype, at your convenience\r\n\r\n- personal one-on-one instruction with a former teacher who has spent years learning about fibers and teaching spinning to people from age 2 to 92.\r\n\r\n- follow up to make sure you are doing as well as you would like\r\n\r\n- freedom to e-mail me at anytime with questions, I answer all e-mail within 24 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":23356313,"name":"Default","price":29.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72454007/-/il_570xN_306060307.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72454007/-/il_570xN_306060307.jpg","width":570,"height":427},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72454113/-/il_570xN_234541822.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72454113/-/il_570xN_234541822.jpg","width":570,"height":427},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72454159/-/il_570xN_259420439-300x224.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72454159/-/il_570xN_259420439-300x224.jpg","width":300,"height":224},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72455357/-/022.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72455357/-/022.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72455733/-/103.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72455733/-/103.JPG","width":1000,"height":563}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3718947,"name":"Tailor-Made Training","permalink":"tailor-made-training","url":"/category/tailor-made-training"},{"id":6237282,"name":"Everything Except Clubs","permalink":"everything-except-clubs","url":"/category/everything-except-clubs"}]},{"id":7380021,"name":"Gaia Yarn","permalink":"gaia-yarn","position":128,"price":29.99,"default_price":29.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/gaia-yarn","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-28T03:34:47.000Z","description":"I took a bump of Brandi's Basic Blend and spun it up.

I love this colorway, it's lofty, fibery goodness. I put a few pics of the finished yarn from this colorway because photographing this fiber was really difficult and all the colors come out in the yarn pictures better.\r\n\r\nThis fiber will felt beautifully. It is suitable for most projects including spinning. Fiber is not superwash and needs special care. Handwash in tepid water and lay flat to dry\r\n\r\nWe are a small farm in rural Maine. I was able to bring my love of animals and fiber together. Most of the animals are rescues. I've found them thru word of mouth and ads. I work with my local shelters to provide foster and permanent homes for these animals. My philosophy is \"We have engineered many of our domesticated species that they cannot live without us, therefore we are responsible for them.\"\r\n\r\nI will do custom orders of fiber blends and colors.

Then to actually implement this ability was another thing entirely. I wish to save you from the frustration experience I had when learning this skill. Plying can be the most fun of spinning wool.\r\n\r\n\r\nBenefits of andean plying:\r\n\r\n- you need no extra equipment, your spindle and singles are all that you need\r\n- you will never deal with leftover yarns as the yarn is all plied\r\n- you can make a nicely balanced 2-ply with this method\r\n- you can make plied yarn is stronger than a single\r\n- you can andean ply with either a wheel or spindle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy should I take this class:  I agree that YouTube and DVD’s are a great way to learn a new hobby.
