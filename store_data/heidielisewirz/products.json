I grew up on the Central Coast of California, in the mountains, our relationship was in someways that of, the Heidi and Grandfather of Swiss lore.  We were insperable, spending hours tending to the cattle that lived in the mountains, and were as illusive as deer.  In the summer of 1991 my Grandfather, Donald Wirz, was diagnosed with cancer.  Over the next two years of his treatment, our laughter filled treks through the mountains became more somber, and infrequent.  We began spotting a huge, male deer on our outings.  He would only appear when my Grandfather was in company.  Upon his death in 1993, he was never seen running through the trees again.  My father and I found his remains a few years later, in a high mountain canyon..this is an homage to the greatest man, and his silent animal companion.\r\n\r\nPrinted on high quality 100% archival rag paper.","options":[{"id":16054423,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/48454737/-/wirzheidisugarmaidenhighres.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/48454737/-/wirzheidisugarmaidenhighres.jpg","width":790,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":66048,"name":"Heidi Elise Wirz","permalink":"heidi-elise-wirz","url":"/artist/heidi-elise-wirz"}],"categories":[{"id":1790661,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":4936525,"name":"St. Genevieve","permalink":"st-genevieve","position":2,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/st-genevieve","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-11-25T21:39:45.000Z","description":"In loving memory of Martha Genevieve Wirz, this painting was completed August 2011 and will be on display at Upper Playground PDX December 1st- January 29th 2012.

C was young, talented, smart, and courageous.  His eyes were wide with curiosity, and his ability for painting and climbing made him a terrific painting partner.

One was dark haired, olive skinned, funny and calm.  She told stories that were as involved as they were painfully funny.  Her meals were prepared with love and care.  The other was fair haired and pale skinned.  She could not speak, was nervous, and hyperactive.  Her diagnosis was unclear until the girls were nearing their first decade of life.  She was Autistic, and no one at the time knew quite what to do for her education, but she was loved none the less by the whole family.  Joan didn't know who she was, and there was a good chunk of her that did not care.  She was a mix of the two, and dreamed of all that was uncertain and undiscovered in the world. \r\n\r\n-truth ","options":[{"id":12750180,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37204428/-/wirzheidibaltlyzackjoanofark.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37204428/-/wirzheidibaltlyzackjoanofark.jpg","width":600,"height":800}],"artists":[{"id":66048,"name":"Heidi Elise Wirz","permalink":"heidi-elise-wirz","url":"/artist/heidi-elise-wirz"}],"categories":[{"id":1790661,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":3816998,"name":"Until the Bandages Come Off","permalink":"until-the-bandages-come-off","position":5,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/until-the-bandages-come-off","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-05-26T10:14:23.000Z","description":"\r\n  He said he'd stick around till the bandages came off, but just until then.\r\n      \r\n","options":[{"id":12750024,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37204268/-/wirzheiditillthebandagescomeoff.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37204268/-/wirzheiditillthebandagescomeoff.jpg","width":600,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1790661,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]}]
