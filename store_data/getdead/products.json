So I decided to sell a few on here for £3 only! There's 20 on here, perhaps more will go on depending on how well these sell.\r\n\r\nEverything thats sold on here, and all the money from it goes straight to the POA boys, so you're helping a good cause! As soon as I start selling, all proceeds go to the band and not in my pocket.","options":[{"id":1253430,"name":"Default","price":3.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":143492,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":351118,"name":"Deaf Havana","permalink":"deaf-havana","position":2,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/deaf-havana","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-07-22T14:26:31.000Z","description":"Get Dead!
