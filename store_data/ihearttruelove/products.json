The artwork is so detailed and perfect it makes me cring and its done by the amazing David Schiesser. The sound is superb and you will be amazed on the quality of this recording.\r\n\r\nBoth bands have released very good debuts in the first half of 2012 and now they put out a new four-song split. Aldo Raine combines screamo/hardcore with dreamy post-rock touch from Düsseldorf, Germany and Nous Étions play post-metal and sludge influenced screamo from Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The mood of the record is quite ethereal and a little darker than their previous songs and the sound of the split is dynamic and properly heavy, I think. Excellent stuff for Fans of Amber, Sed Non Satiata, Le pre ou je suis mort, etc.!\r\n\r\nListen and Download for free here:\r\nhttp://aldorainedoom.bandcamp.com/album/split-w-nous-tions\r\n","options":[{"id":46461864,"name":"Default","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":184,"name":"Poland","code":"PL"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":8.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126340248/-/36470-8ac327f9275b464e99fc8baf2325442c.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126340248/-/36470-8ac327f9275b464e99fc8baf2325442c.jpeg","width":1024,"height":1024}],"artists":[{"id":242793,"name":"Aldo Raine","permalink":"aldo-raine","url":"/artist/aldo-raine"},{"id":242796,"name":"Nous Étions","permalink":"nous-etions","url":"/artist/nous-etions"}],"categories":[{"id":1641822,"name":"records","permalink":"records","url":"/category/records"}]},{"id":13924974,"name":"FJORT - TOTE BAG lim. 30","permalink":"fjort-tote-bag-lim-30","position":4,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fjort-tote-bag-lim-30","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-02T13:33:24.000Z","description":"Exclusively done for the repress.

Listeners describe the music with lines as \"Melodic and beautiful, even in the rougher moments\", \"The most emotional anthem in the screamo scene\" and \"Inexpressible atmosphere, excellent catchy melodies plus brilliant vocals make it a true masterpiece\".\r\n\r\nThe five guys started out 2008 in a small town called Jönköping and just one year later their name was international known. In the summer of 2009 \"Tokyo Jupiter Records\" released Trachimbrod's four piece demo named \"Eclarion\", and later that year the full lenght EP \"Eating People is Easy\" was available by the same label.\r\n\r\nThis summer will though be the band's big break out! The earlier namned japanese label \"Tokyo Jupiter Records\" will on the 6th of June release the first full lenght album \"A Collection of Hidden Sketches\" on CD. On the 20th of July the tracks will be given out on both vinyl and cassette. \"Truelove Entertainment\" from Germany and the russian \"Sad Songs Records\" stand behind these. With this coming the band also will be doing their first european tour, with start on the 20th of July.\r\n\r\nWith \"A Collection of Hidden Sketches\" Trachimbrod shows a new, more dirty sound. The earlier instrumental, postrock influenced tunes are exchanged with harder, more desperate onced focused on the vocals. Although, the music still contains it's unique melodies and explosions. Trachimbrod comes with surprises and will never leave a listener untouched.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n1. Us Without Self Control\r\n2. Salvation\r\n3. Through Walls, Floors And More\r\n4. Mediocrity\r\n5. Lost In Direction With A Dead Eye\r\n6. No More Peaceful Mind\r\n7. Don't Trust Experts\r\n8. Growth\r\n9.

This medium gives the sound the spectrum it deserves. Don't miss out on this as it is strictly limited to 300 copies.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nIt is with great pride we bring you \"Floating Veins\", the debut album of Syndrome, the lastest moniker under which Mathieu Vandekerckhove (Amenra, Kingdom, Sembler Deah) operates. Opposed to the emotional and violent outpour that Amenra delivers, Syndrome explores the very boundaries of introspective music. Prepare to be taken on a narrative musical journey through five acts each painting a different picture but trancending into one dramatic moment where everything seems to fall into place perfectly. While the ambient soundscapes and the erie droning riffs are the blood, the apocalyptic drums and beats are the pulse. The tides stow the listener right into the roaring heart of Syndrome. Until it stops.\r\n\r\nLAST COPIES!\r\n\r\nTRUELOVE ENTERTAINMENT: \r\nhttp://ihearttruelove.com/ \r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/IHeartTruelove\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ihearttruelove\r\nhttp://ihearttruelove.bandcamp.com/\r\nhttp://ihearttruelove.bigcartel.com/\r\n","options":[{"id":9669762,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":184,"name":"Poland","code":"PL"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":8.5},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":241,"name":"Zimbabwe","code":"ZW"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/51561821/-/IMG_3692.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/51561821/-/IMG_3692.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":101083,"name":"Syndrome","permalink":"syndrome","url":"/artist/syndrome"}],"categories":[{"id":1641822,"name":"records","permalink":"records","url":"/category/records"}]},{"id":9011945,"name":"OUR CEASING VOICE - THAT DAY LAST NOVEMBER 12\" LP","permalink":"our-ceasing-voice-the-day-last-november-12-lp","position":13,"price":13.0,"default_price":13.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/our-ceasing-voice-the-day-last-november-12-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-18T17:55:49.000Z","description":"Yeah!

Come Across Trachimbrod from Sweden. CD includes 9 tracks + 2 exclusive bonus remixes by Pmtoyou and Woodchucker. CD designed by Studio Weiss.\r\n\r\nTrachimbrod (former Come Across Trachimbrod) is a swedish screamo/postrock band who despite of it's young age all ready has reached thousands of ears around the world. Listeners describe the music with lines as \"Melodic and beautiful, even in the rougher moments\", \"The most emotional anthem in the screamo scene\" and \"Inexpressible atmosphere, excellent catchy melodies plus brilliant vocals make it a true masterpiece\".\r\n\r\nThe five guys started out 2008 in a small town called Jönköping and just one year later their name was international known. In the summer of 2009 \"Tokyo Jupiter Records\" released Trachimbrod's four piece demo named \"Eclarion\", and later that year the full lenght EP \"Eating People is Easy\" was available by the same label.\r\n\r\nThis summer will though be the band's big break out! The earlier namned japanese label \"Tokyo Jupiter Records\" will on the 6th of June release the first full lenght album \"A Collection of Hidden Sketches\" on CD. On the 20th of July the tracks will be given out on both vinyl and cassette. \"Truelove Entertainment\" from Germany and the russian \"Sad Songs Records\" stand behind these. With this coming the band also will be doing their first european tour, with start on the 20th of July.\r\n\r\nWith \"A Collection of Hidden Sketches\" Trachimbrod shows a new, more dirty sound. The earlier instrumental, postrock influenced tunes are exchanged with harder, more desperate onced focused on the vocals. Although, the music still contains it's unique melodies and explosions. Trachimbrod comes with surprises and will never leave a listener untouched.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n1. Us Without Self Control\r\n2. Salvation\r\n3. Through Walls, Floors And More\r\n4. Mediocrity\r\n5.
