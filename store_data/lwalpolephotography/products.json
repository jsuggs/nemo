This is the one that everyone seems to love (who doesn't want a Splitty?) With a split screen camper costing £12k up it's a bit indulgent but you can have this photo on your wall from just £10 - it's a start! \r\n\r\nThe image is printed on premium glossy photo paper using professional quality Epsom inks - the result is a print that's as rich and vibrant as the on screen version. The print is then mounted (properly, by a professional mounter/framer - not a cheap pre-cut jobbie) and wrapped in a clear plastic film to keep it safe. I'd recommend adding your own frame, but can happily be popped onto the shelf as is. \r\n\r\nThe image is available as A4 and A3, but as I print all the images my self there's no reason you can't have a different size - drop me a message (louiswalpole@gmail.com) to discuss.","options":[{"id":26929035,"name":"A4 Mounted Print","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26929038,"name":"A3 Mounted Print","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84348237/-/RATTY_CAMPER_A.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84348237/-/RATTY_CAMPER_A.jpg","width":1000,"height":661}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":8574855,"name":"Ratty Camper Greetings Card.","permalink":"ratty-camper-greetings-card","position":3,"price":2.9,"default_price":2.9,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ratty-camper-greetings-card","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-16T17:01:10.000Z","description":"As one of my most popular images, this seemed to be one of the obvious choices for a greetings card - something a bit different for a car enthusiast!
