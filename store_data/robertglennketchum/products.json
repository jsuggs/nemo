Whether depicting the rugged grandeur of the American countryside or the mournful beauty of virgin wilderness violated by progress, his landscapes reject sentimentality. Instead, they document his deep respect and compassion for our irreplaceable natural resources.\r\n\r\nWith a preface by Robert Redford and an essay by distinguished ecologist and author John Perlin, The Legacy of Wildness is a work of great innovation and integrity.\r\n\r\nKetchum's series of photographs in this book include \"Winters: 1970-1980\" - black and white photographs of white-on-white environments and \"Order from Chaos\" - large-size photographs in brilliant colours. \"Planetary Graffiti\" and \"Stoned Immaculate\" complete the cycle, the former consisting of black-and-white aerial photographs made with experimental Polaroid film that produces instant black-and-white slide positives, and the latter an abstract body of work entirely in colour. \"The Sundance Suite\" concentrates on political concerns like the air quality on the Salt Lake Basin. Finally, there are a small group of photographs on silk resulting from Ketchum's repeated visits to China.\r\n\r\n* Hardcover: 120 pages\r\n* Publisher: Aperture; illustrated edition edition (31 Jan 1994)\r\n* Language English\r\n* ISBN-10: 0893814989\r\n* ISBN-13: 978-0893814984\r\n* Product Dimensions: 33.9 x 30.5 x 1.7 cm\r\n","options":[{"id":9773018,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26983591/-/rk_cover_09.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26983591/-/rk_cover_09.jpg","width":902,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26995088/-/705_437_flat_800.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26995088/-/705_437_flat_800.jpg","width":640,"height":502},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26995112/-/705_438_flat_800.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26995112/-/705_438_flat_800.jpg","width":640,"height":498},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27246607/-/705_330_flat_800.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27246607/-/705_330_flat_800.jpg","width":640,"height":503},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27246623/-/705_441_flat_800.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27246623/-/705_441_flat_800.jpg","width":640,"height":503}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1622575,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":1671936,"name":"Books-Hardcover RGK","permalink":"books-hardcover-rgk","url":"/category/books-hardcover-rgk"}]},{"id":4951877,"name":"Jewelry, 'Peace to Earth' Bracelet","permalink":"jewelry-peace-to-earth-bracelet","position":9,"price":198.0,"default_price":198.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/jewelry-peace-to-earth-bracelet","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-28T09:09:40.000Z","description":"Recycled glass beads from Indonesia harmonize beautifully with turquoise, California Opal, and bone in this casual bracelet.

Ketchum, hired to chronicle the 23-day expedition from Alaska, through Canada and the Northwest Territories to Greenland, produced stunning results; an on-board helicopter enabled him to photograph the terrain as no Arctic image maker before.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, European explorers sought in vain for an Arctic shortcut to the riches of the Orient. Ships and men vanished. The Franklin Expedition of 1845 is the most famous failure. The Northwest Passage was not successfully traversed until the 1903^-6 expedition of Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. Ketchum, a great naturalist photographer, and nine others set off on a yacht in 1994, which eventually became (with the aid, on one occasion, of an ice-breaking ship) the fifty-sixth vessel to cross the Northwest Passage. The photography (aerial, island, and yacht shots) transports its viewers to a new and strange world that causes the adventuring heart to beat erratically. In the world's quest for minerals, oil, and gas reserves, in its misuse of the Arctic as a dumping ground, this powerful and majestic region is threatened, and at the close of the book, Ketchum the environmentalist makes those facts known. Yet charting this once mystic realm, in this fashion, is ironic--a siren's song to those watchful for the next frontier to develop.\r\n\r\n* Hardcover: 96 pages\r\n* Publisher: Aperture; 1st edition (November 25, 1996)\r\n* Language: English\r\n* ISBN-10: 0893816760\r\n* ISBN-13: 978-0893816766\r\n* Product Dimensions: 7 x 4.2 x 1.4 inches\r\n* Shipping Weight: 11.2 ounces","options":[{"id":9773980,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26987308/-/rk_cover_05.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26987308/-/rk_cover_05.jpg","width":1000,"height":834},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26995176/-/ketchum1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26995176/-/ketchum1.jpg","width":550,"height":403},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26995183/-/ketchum7.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26995183/-/ketchum7.jpg","width":550,"height":400},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27246655/-/ketchum2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27246655/-/ketchum2.jpg","width":425,"height":585},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27246651/-/ketchum6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27246651/-/ketchum6.jpg","width":550,"height":429}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1622575,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":1671936,"name":"Books-Hardcover RGK","permalink":"books-hardcover-rgk","url":"/category/books-hardcover-rgk"}]},{"id":3034181,"name":"Jewelry, 'Tree-of-Life' Bracelet","permalink":"tree-of-life-bracelet","position":11,"price":165.0,"default_price":165.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tree-of-life-bracelet","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-12-16T07:42:09.000Z","description":"A sterling silver Tree-of-Life charm dangles from Turquoise beads in this unique bracelet.

A full one-third of all U.S. land-- including parks, beaches, forests, off-shore oil-deposits, and mountains-- is owned and managed by the federal government, whose stewardship is intended to renew and maintain this vast national treasure. Due to clashing intra-agency goals and the ever-changing policies of rotating administrations, the federal government has long been negligent in enforcing the mandate of sustainable development of these lands. Caught in the middle of a bureaucratic snarl, our national trust is at risk of substantial environmental deterioration such as overgrazing, loss of topsoil, deforestation, contamination of soil and water, and failure to restore developed areas already sacrificed for their resources.\r\n\r\nStunning color photographs evoke the endangered elegance of the American landscape, from views of toxic brooks weaving through a forest floor to rustic barns set in the hills Overlooked in America makes a strong case for drastic changes in federal land management before our irreplaceable legacy is lost forever. Published to coincide with a traveling exhibit of Robert Glenn Ketchum's eloquent photographs, the book includes a preface by Mr. Ketchum and an essay by Charles Callison, of the National Resources Defense Council, on the achievements and shortcomings of federal land management.\r\n\r\n\"Robert Glenn Ketchum is one of those rare, gifted individuals able and willing to devote his talents to the betterment of life on Earth. Overlooked in America is a stunning volume that stands both as a work of art and a searing indictment of the way the federal government has failed to protect the public's natural heritage.\"--Frederic P. Sutherland, President, Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund\r\n\r\n\"Overlooked in America presents nature photography that conveys the inspiration of our national heritage simultaneously with its desecration. Words complement image, offering more than information, almost as a call to act...Like an illuminated manuscript in reverse, Overlooked in America uses words to amplify beautifully composed pictures.\"--Greg Goldin, L.A. Week\r\n\r\n\"Detail, perception, and sensitivity of whole surroundings. The combination of these qualities lives in Ketchum's work.

The Wood-Tikchik State Park, a vast wilderness, is home to moose, grizzly bears, eagles, salmon, and one of the largest species of rainbow trout in the world. Accessible only by boat, plane, or on foot, these wild lands are nevertheless vulnerable to commercial exploitation. Ketchum's stunning images immerse viewers in the extraordinary detail, color, and scale that defines this relatively unknown world of tundra and boreal forests, offering readers the unique experience of understanding the need to preserve this special ecosystem. In his accompanying essay, Bill Sherwonit provides an excellent account of the historical use of the park and makes a compelling case for protecting one of North America's most important watersheds from fragmentation and unnecessary development. \"For several decades, Ketchum has followed the trail of Ansel Adams and Eliot Porter, focusing on threatened areas of our planet . . . .

Widely exhibited, Porter set the standard for color landscape photography. But he was also a passionate ambassador for environmental causes: in 1962, the Sierra Club's publication of his book \"In Wildness is the Preservation of the World\" set him on a lifelong path. His artistic vision in service of environmental activism inspired generations of photographers, and Robert Glenn Ketchum counts himself among them.\r\n\r\nKetchum is recognized as one of the leading contemporary photographers of the American landscape. Like Porter, Ketchum creates portraits and publications of ecologically significant places. The images in Regarding the Land reveal how Ketchum has honored Porter's pioneering use of color and graphic composition, but moved beyond Porter's careful description of place. Ketchum presents landscapes as ideas that can be shaped, even defined, by the imagination. An essay by John Rohrbach, senior curator of photographs at the Amon Carter Museum of Fort Worth, Texas, illuminates the development of these two artists. Rohrbach reveals how Ketchum has expanded upon Porter's visual vocabulary, both with his photographs and with magnificently embroidered translations produced by China's renowned Suzhou Embroidery Research Institute.\r\n\r\n· 88 color and duotone reproductions of works from a major exhibition organized by the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth, Texas\r\n· Both photographers are celebrated for creating art for environmental activism\r\n· Includes an introductory essay by John Rohrbach, senior curator of photographs at the Carter, and closing remarks by Robert Glenn Ketchum\r\n· Includes chronologies of both artists along with lists of their publications and major exhibitions\r\n\r\n    * Format: Hardcover, 111pp\r\n    * ISBN-13: 9780883601006\r\n    * ISBN: 0883601001\r\n    * Pub.

With his artist's eye for color, texture, and extraordinary detail, Ketchum's large and powerful images capture the immense richness of this magnificently wild country.\r\n\r\nFramed between some of Alaska's most spectacular mountain ranges and the northern Pacific, here lies the spawning ground of the world's largest population of sockeye salmon. It is also one of the last productive wild fisheries remaining on earth, providing bountiful harvests for a host of dependent creatures-from whales to grizzlies to fishermen.\r\n\r\nCo-author Bruce Hampton provides an engaging and comprehensive essay on the life history of sockeye salmon, the region's commercial and sport fisheries, and their crucial importance to the region's environment and the people who depend on salmon for survival. Greg Syverson's intimate photographs of fish and their aquatic habitat further illuminate the text.\r\n\r\n* Hardcover: 128 pages\r\n* Publisher: Aperture; 1 edition (September 1, 2001)\r\n* Language: English\r\n* ISBN-10: 0893819670\r\n* ISBN-13: 978-0893819675\r\n* Product Dimensions: 13.3 x 12.3 x 0.7 inches\r\n* Shipping Weight: 3.5 pounds\r\n","options":[{"id":9618653,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26453815/-/rk_cover_10.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26453815/-/rk_cover_10.jpg","width":1000,"height":917},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26995048/-/705-558_640.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26995048/-/705-558_640.jpg","width":373,"height":512},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26995060/-/705-276_640.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26995060/-/705-276_640.jpg","width":640,"height":469},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27246579/-/705-108_640.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27246579/-/705-108_640.jpg","width":640,"height":468},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27246587/-/705-472_640.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27246587/-/705-472_640.jpg","width":640,"height":467}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1622575,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":1671936,"name":"Books-Hardcover RGK","permalink":"books-hardcover-rgk","url":"/category/books-hardcover-rgk"}]},{"id":3109533,"name":"Jewelry, 'Vintage Typewriter' Necklace","permalink":"typewriter-necklace","position":23,"price":285.0,"default_price":285.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/typewriter-necklace","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-01-08T11:52:06.000Z","description":"Antique vintage typewriter keys are accented with semi-precious stones in this limited-edition necklace.

A stunningly beautiful book of photographs and essays in celebration of the Wind River area of Wyoming, the book features the work of regional and internationally renowned photographers, including Henry Holdsworth, Robert Ketchum, Tom Mangelsen, David Muench, Fred Pflughoft, and Jeff Vanuga.\r\n\r\nAlthough primarily a book of photographic images, Gretel Ehrlich, whose Solace of Open Spaces has become a classic, has written an overview essay. It is also interspersed with seven thematic essays written by people recognized for their contributions to literature as well as their many years of experience in the area: Meredith Taylor on wildlife and resources, C.L. Rawlins on the mountain ranges, Tucker Smith on the artistic legacy, Erik Molvar on the Red Desert, Dennis Sun Rhodes on the Native American legacy, Florence Rose Shepard on the historical context, and Ronald Frost on the geology of the area.\r\n\r\nIn addition, some of the writers and photographers, along with others who live in and care deeply about the area, have written testimonial statements expressing their love and concern for the future of this important and threatened natural environment.\r\n\r\nREVIEWS\r\n\r\n\"The best writing and photography in the book are not ponderous studies of the majestic mountains, but rather capture the Winds as dynamic environments that do not exist apart from life but in conjunction with it.\" Pinedale Roundup - October 5, 2006\r\n\r\n\"From wildlife, to craggy peaks, to gorgeous lakes, to Red Desert austerity, to wide-angle vistas, every picture is evocative and inspiring...
