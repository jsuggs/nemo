We know them as good guys making cool stuff, with a total disregard for narrow scene politics, crossing all borders to do their thing. We like.

Collectors who love the downtempo vibe in Aaron Spectre's out-of-print Lost Tracks LP will rejoice that these records are once again available.\r\n\r\nReleased shortly after Spectre's relocation to Berlin, The Ocean EP represents a milestone in the personal odyssey of a young musician following his dreams. Each of the four tracks is recognizably Aaron Spectre: his strange but hallmark blend of darkness and optimism, densely layered soundscapes punctuated with airy, ethereal spaces, precision beats, drones, and oddly catchy bits and pieces.  Long-time collaborator Aarktica (Jon DeRosa) adds his soulful vocal talents and sweet-but-melancholy tunes for remix. A perfect soundtrack to set the stage for chilling out and philosophizing.  \r\n\r\n\"The Wrong Fuel\" and \"Ocean (Aaron Spectre Remix)\" appear on Lost Tracks.\r\n\r\nMOONB001 12\"\r\nHigh Quality 160g Audiophile Vinyl\r\nMastered at D&M Berlin\r\n\r\nAarktica - Ocean (Aaron Spectre remix)\r\nAaron Spectre - The Wrong Fuel\r\nAaron Spectre - Sheknows\r\nAarktica & Aaron Spectre - Alceria","options":[{"id":4481921,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":6.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/11948251/-/moonbunny-square2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/11948251/-/moonbunny-square2.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":758211,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":1207451,"name":"Animosity & Drumcorps - Altered Beast / (Cupcake)","permalink":"animosity-drumcorps-altered-beast-cupcake","position":5,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/animosity-drumcorps-altered-beast-cupcake","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-01-13T06:43:10.000Z","description":"LIMITED QUANTITIES.
