They are made of an almost indestructible synthetic suede that cannot be bitten off, will not shrink and is easily colored with a permanent marker pen. Most importantly, they produce a frisky, fish-attracting tail action when fished!\r\n\r\nThe secret to the tails frantic movement is the unique design and method of attaching the tail to the hook. Instead of tying in the tail on one side of the hook like similar products, the Frantic Tail has a unique “flap” design that is used to create a “hinge” effect that positions the tail directly behind the hook shank in a balanced way. This hinge acts like a spring and generates movement from the tail with very little effort by the angler.  In addition, the hinge provides a strong, stiff connection point for the tail which virtually eliminates any fouling.\r\n\r\nMedium for hook sizes #4, #2, #1\r\nLarge for hook sizes #1, 1/0, 2/0\r\n\r\n8 Tials per pack in Medium\r\n6 Tails per pack in Large\r\n\r\nPerfect for making the CK Baitfish!","options":[{"id":26858433,"name":"Black-Medium","price":3.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26858436,"name":"Black-large","price":3.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26858439,"name":"White-Medium","price":3.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26858442,"name":"White-Large","price":3.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26858445,"name":"Chartreuse-Medium","price":3.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26858448,"name":"Chartreuse-Large","price":3.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.95,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84102321/-/Frantic_Tails_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84102321/-/Frantic_Tails_2.jpg","width":576,"height":576},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84102369/-/Frantic_Tails.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84102369/-/Frantic_Tails.jpg","width":576,"height":576}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1757505,"name":"Eyes, Heads, Rubber Legs","permalink":"eyes-heads-rubber-legs","url":"/category/eyes-heads-rubber-legs"},{"id":1771421,"name":"Threads, Wire, Dubbing and Other Stuff","permalink":"threads-wire-dubbing-and-other-stuff","url":"/category/threads-wire-dubbing-and-other-stuff"},{"id":212852,"name":"Popper Heads, Cutters and Foam","permalink":"popper-heads-cutters-and-foam","url":"/category/popper-heads-cutters-and-foam"}]},{"id":8550225,"name":"Living Eyes ","permalink":"living-eyes","position":29,"price":3.75,"default_price":3.75,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/living-eyes","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-14T14:56:34.000Z","description":"Living Eyes are the next generation of 3D fish eyes for fly tying.\r\n\r\nUsing the latest in photo-realistic holographic technology, We have developed the most realistic range of 3D fish-eyes for fly tying on the planet at a very compelling price point.

After a few seasons of our guides beating up the prototypes we have the finished product in hand.  I feel this is the finest Smallmouth Bass line ever made.  The line is designed for casters.  It is very accurate for picking apart a shoreline and carrying a ton of line in the air.  I also am excited about the super hard coating for fishing it in warm climates.  Let's face it, hot weather=great smallmouth fishing.  Old lines turn into a puddle in the heat.\r\n\r\nRIO's Description:\r\n\r\nRIO's Smallmouth Bass line has been designed for the specific demands of the smallmouth fly fisher; featuring a unique taper design that loads a rod at close range, a medium length powerful front taper that is ideal for casting smallmouth flies and a long back taper to smooth out the casting loop and keep the line stable on long shots.  A very unique handling section at the back of the head gives anglers increased mending ability and line control at range.  It is the perfect line for smallmouth bass when accurate presentations are important.  A hard coating over a medium stiff core results in a fly line that will not wilt in the heat, while RIO's XS Technology keeps the line super slick for fast long casts.  The line also features RIO's Dual Tone that allows anglers to easily find the line's loading area.  A welded loop in both ends makes it very easy and fast to rig.  \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":9722081,"name":"WF-6-F Bronze/Biege","price":74.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9722082,"name":"WF-7-F Bronze/Biege","price":74.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9722083,"name":"WF-8-F Bronze/Biege","price":74.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.95,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84974121/-/Rio_Smallmout_bass_line_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84974121/-/Rio_Smallmout_bass_line_2.jpg","width":432,"height":432},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84974133/-/smallmouth_bass_line_close_up.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84974133/-/smallmouth_bass_line_close_up.jpg","width":240,"height":240},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26832029/-/Smallmouth_Bass_Lines_Spec_photo_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26832029/-/Smallmouth_Bass_Lines_Spec_photo_1.jpg","width":576,"height":576}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":209878,"name":"Fly Lines","permalink":"fly-lines","url":"/category/fly-lines"},{"id":212340,"name":"Smallmouthflyshop.com accessories","permalink":"smallmouthflyshop-com-accessories","url":"/category/smallmouthflyshop-com-accessories"}]},{"id":1750151,"name":"Geezus Lizard","permalink":"geezus-lizard","position":53,"price":6.5,"default_price":6.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/geezus-lizard","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-02-26T18:57:11.000Z","description":"WOW!

SaltH2O’s unique layer interface and proprietary resin also combine for maximum strength—even in high heat environments—and significantly less weight.\r\n\r\nThis increased strength comes in handy when you need to lean on powerful saltwater bruisers.

The CLA (sizes 4-7) have a larger sized drag knob, handle and spool cap, but most importantly, they have a STRONGER DRAG SYSTEM. To ensure smooth performance with fast-running fish, the four larger sized CLA reels have also been equipped with oil-impregnated bushings for improved spool rotation. The frame and spool have been reinforced to eliminate flexing when battling the \"big boys.\" With a wide range of sizes available, the CLA series is appropriate for any fishing application. And because of its great size, dependability, drag performance and affordable price, the CLA (sizes 4-7) have become one of the most popular Spey series on the market today.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAME/SPOOL MATERIAL 6061-T6 proprietary aluminum alloy\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":1027626,"name":"Black #3 5-7 weight line","price":210.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":1027629,"name":"Black #4 7-9 weight line","price":250.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":1027632,"name":"Black #5 8-10 weight line","price":269.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.95,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29124325/-/Ross_CLA_Reel.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29124325/-/Ross_CLA_Reel.jpg","width":576,"height":576}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":209851,"name":"Fly Reels","permalink":"fly-reels","url":"/category/fly-reels"}]},{"id":3009019,"name":"Ross Evolution LT","permalink":"ross-evolution-lt","position":92,"price":320.0,"default_price":320.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ross-evolution-lt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-12-10T19:28:07.000Z","description":"This is one of the finest reels we have ever used.\r\n\r\nThe Evolution® LT is unquestionably one of the lightest fly reels ever produced.

Its micro textured surface traps air to provide superior shootability and floatation while eliminating line flash and vastly reducing friction. All of this comes with the added benefit of increased durability allowing the line to last up to twice as long.

There is a learning curve involved when dealing with any new material. Foam is no different. A drill press, if one is available, will let you get the maximum utilization from a given block of foam. A hand drill should be run at top speed, or at least 1,000 RPM to cut a plug. \r\n  \r\n     To start with, I recommend dipping the cutter in soapy water before attempting to cut a plug. Liquid dish soap, and a 35 mm film canister work very well for this purpose. The soapy water reduces the friction involved, which can cause twisting. Be sure the cutters do not come in contact with hard surfaces, such as wood or metal. Place the block to be cut on a soft surface, such as another block of foam, or over a hole, such as utilized with a drill press.  To remove a plug from the cutters, a round wooden toothpick works well. \r\n","options":[{"id":1042219,"name":"Default","price":44.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.95,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1761647/-/Bug_Kit.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1761647/-/Bug_Kit.jpg","width":432,"height":432}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":212852,"name":"Popper Heads, Cutters and Foam","permalink":"popper-heads-cutters-and-foam","url":"/category/popper-heads-cutters-and-foam"}]},{"id":243521,"name":"Standard Foam Blocks","permalink":"standard-foam-blocks","position":143,"price":2.75,"default_price":2.75,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/standard-foam-blocks","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-02-24T23:18:12.000Z","description":"This is our standard foam for forming block heads or for use with our popper cutters.  \r\n\r\nBlock Dimensions\r\n1.6*2*4","options":[{"id":1042288,"name":"Black","price":2.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":1042312,"name":"Chartreuse","price":2.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":1042311,"name":"Orange","price":2.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":1042310,"name":"Damsel Blue","price":2.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":1042309,"name":"Red","price":2.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":1042308,"name":"Tan","price":2.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":1042307,"name":"Yellow","price":2.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":1042306,"name":"White","price":2.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":1042305,"name":"Gray","price":2.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":1042313,"name":"Pink","price":2.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.95,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1761727/-/Standard_Foam_Block.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1761727/-/Standard_Foam_Block.jpg","width":432,"height":432},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1761891/-/Steve_Cutters.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1761891/-/Steve_Cutters.jpg","width":432,"height":432},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1761895/-/Cutter_instructions.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1761895/-/Cutter_instructions.jpg","width":632,"height":542},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1761899/-/Block_Head.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1761899/-/Block_Head.jpg","width":432,"height":432}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":212852,"name":"Popper Heads, Cutters and Foam","permalink":"popper-heads-cutters-and-foam","url":"/category/popper-heads-cutters-and-foam"}]},{"id":243532,"name":"Super Dense Foam Block","permalink":"super-dense-foam-block","position":144,"price":3.75,"default_price":3.75,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/super-dense-foam-block","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-02-24T23:28:52.000Z","description":"This stuff is tuff!
