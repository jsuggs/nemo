Handcrafted in small open top fermenters and aged one year in French oak barrels. This wine offers up intense aromas of blackberry, ripe plum and sweet toasty oak. The flavors are delicate yet rich with cassis, blackcherry caramel, vanilla and spice. The rich fruit is perfectly framed by the oak and the soft lingering texture on the palate adds to the sensory experience.\r\n\r\nIt's a fantastically balanced wine, and we endorse and recommend it enthusiastically!\r\n\r\nDBLR is produced by Trish's winemaker brother-in-law, and you can find more information (including how to order it) by clicking on the image below. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://dnawineco.bigcartel.com\"><img src=\"http://www.wreckingballcoffee.com/misc/01_76310F.jpg\"></a>\r\n\r\nTo order, click the image above, NOT the \"Add to Cart\" below.\r\n","options":[{"id":41166531,"name":"Default","price":18.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122641317/-/final_sq.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122641317/-/final_sq.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122641314/-/dblr1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122641314/-/dblr1.jpg","width":526,"height":526}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":12751137,"name":"Kalita Pelican Pot 1L","permalink":"pelican-pot-1l","position":4,"price":74.95,"default_price":74.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pelican-pot-1l","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-03T05:47:14.000Z","description":"<img src=\"http://www.wreckingballcoffee.com/images/kalita_sm.jpg\"><br>Just added to our North American distribution list!\r\n\r\nThe Pelican Pot is a 1.0 liter pourover drip pot with a unique style.
