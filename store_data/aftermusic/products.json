From John Giorno's Poetry Sytems and Richard Kostelanetz to Brion Gysin and most importantly William S. Burroughs, especially his record on Industrial Records. Working with voices, reducing them, erasing, finding new meanings along the process. On his new CD he returns to the story of Faust, the man who sold his soul to the devil for all knowing knowledge, but of comes to regret that. 'FaustNotFaust' should be seen as a 'noise-opera'. Unlike say Burroughs, Lunde uses musical elements along his voice material, and makes it indeed to an opera like work. Orchestral bits, computer bits (mostly time stretching() as well as the usual methods from Lunde of re-recording voice material with the cheapest technology available. Perhaps its not easy to see much difference with his previous work on th\r\nis\r\nsubject, nor as a whole in his recent work, but it's quite a fine release - again. As a fan, you can't go wrong here.\r\nThe DVDR shows us studio and live work carried out with this material, but then with found footage, cut-up and flickering images. Bits from films, which don't mean much to me, but perhaps I don't see enough films (Richard Burton playing Faust, F.W. Murneau), which are treated with rudimentary effects. Lots of skulls, lots of images of the ockult. Nicer, perhaps, is the recording of a live concert, so we can see how Lunde performs this in concert, sitting behind a table armed with cassette players, tv screens around, beamer projection, and a metal statue of an animal - most likely the devil, I should think. This opera doesn't know any arias or theatrics, but is more alike an Robert Ashley one, rather that Richard Wagner. A nice added bonus, this DVDR.

I had heard of Hands To, and when I saw the Hands To / Eric Lunde split in the new bin, I gave it a whirl. As others have rightfully said before, when Lunde’s voice comes in--\"your unguarded breath\" it was a moment of commanding, spine tingling confusion. His work reminds me of Z'EV's uns project in how he permutates language and utilizes his \"reduplicative strategies\" to simultaneously bury and uncover audio. This disc is, for these ears, \"classic\" Lunde; tape cassette manipulation, modulation, and endless reduplications and permutations. If you like Lunde, this will be a welcome chapter in his ongoing audio explorations. If you aren't familiar with Lunde, I'd say imagine audio that has spices of Chop Shop, EVP, and John Duncan mixed into a batter of barren lands and be prepared to go on a rather unusual, and unequivocally individual, journey.  \r\n","options":[{"id":29177372,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":8.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91650254/-/cip_Animal.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91650254/-/cip_Animal.jpeg","width":1000,"height":969}],"artists":[{"id":164129,"name":"Eric Lunde","permalink":"eric-lunde","url":"/artist/eric-lunde"}],"categories":[{"id":1585107,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":8741693,"name":"Jeph Jerman: For Henry F.

The analogue electronics, no doubt just one synthesizer, plays at times nasty, piercing stuff, but also pulse -like material (like a very reduced Pan Sonic).  INCLUDES COPY OF CDR \"OOTHEKA\".\r\n","options":[{"id":27605243,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":10.0},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86454689/-/tmw_22_aspahlt.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86454689/-/tmw_22_aspahlt.jpeg","width":1000,"height":691}],"artists":[{"id":164129,"name":"Eric Lunde","permalink":"eric-lunde","url":"/artist/eric-lunde"}],"categories":[{"id":1593313,"name":"Vinyl Recordings","permalink":"vinyl-recordings","url":"/category/vinyl-recordings"}]},{"id":7208019,"name":"Compact Disc North Beach Jazz ","permalink":"compact-disc-north-beach-jazz","position":16,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/compact-disc-north-beach-jazz","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-11T00:13:19.000Z","description":"North Beach Jazz released as limited CD ","options":[{"id":22831633,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70699269/-/On_CD_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70699269/-/On_CD_.jpg","width":1000,"height":967},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70699351/-/grass_photo_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70699351/-/grass_photo_.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[{"id":58390,"name":"Steve Mackay","permalink":"steve-mackay","url":"/artist/steve-mackay"}],"categories":[{"id":1585107,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":8792471,"name":"Eric Lunde- How Close one is to the center of the earth ... compact disc ","permalink":"eric-lunde-how-close-one-is-to-the-center-of-the-earth-compact-disc","position":17,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/eric-lunde-how-close-one-is-to-the-center-of-the-earth-compact-disc","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-04T22:45:02.000Z","description":"60 minutes of measured, calculated and free form electronic and tape noise on Compact Disc ","options":[{"id":27605666,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86456213/-/tmw25_how_close.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86456213/-/tmw25_how_close.jpeg","width":1000,"height":867}],"artists":[{"id":164129,"name":"Eric Lunde","permalink":"eric-lunde","url":"/artist/eric-lunde"}],"categories":[{"id":1585107,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":8792426,"name":"XEDH / IMBERMON  ANEKKYY Compact Disc ","permalink":"xedh-imbermon-anekkyy-compact-disc","position":18,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/xedh-imbermon-anekkyy-compact-disc","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-04T22:41:30.000Z","description":" Sound artist Miguel A.

Independent Music Review:\r\n\r\n\"WOW.... This is one Hell of a Jekyll and Hyde album.\"\r\n\r\nThis vinyl album see's the latest works by Boy Dirt Car and Andy Gallagher. Two very different sounding artists that you would not think of putting together, but strangely work amazingly well on this release.  \r\n\r\nBoy Dirt Car's side \"Treacherous Young Witches\" is an unnerving yet deeply satisfying 20 plus minute piece of Electro noise/alternative work, that would be an amazing soundtrack to a Sam Raimi, David Cronenberg, Guillermo Del Toro, Lucio Fulci or Ed Wood film. A really refreshing piece of work that will set your \"Horror\" imagination wild. We look forward to hearing more soon. 4 *'s outta 5.\r\n \r\nAndy Gallagher's side of the vinyl opens with the instantly memorable \"I Should've Stayed In Bed Today\" and features Mike Watt (Minutemen/Stooges) on bass. We guarantee it's a song that'll stick in your mind for the rest of your day. \"Calm Before The Storm\" and \"If Only I Could\" are straight out rockers that will be instant crowd pleasers. The closing track \"The Warmth Of Your Love\" is an acoustic track filled with Organ swells, soft harmonica and has the sound of a fire place throughout the whole track that really sets a definite mood for this well written love song.  4*'s outta 5.\r\n\r\nSplit LP featuring 1st International rock artist joining the After Music \r\nRecordings Scottish Andy Gallagher \r\nLimited pressing of 300 \r\nOriginal artwork from Josh Mead and Astrid Young (Neil Young’s sister) \r\n“Boy Dirt Car has got the drift again, Boy Dirt Car revived…” with \r\nTreacherous Young Witches: a textural affair of layers with echoing & \r\ntwisting noises, guitar undercurrents and the like, interrupted by razor’d- \r\nelectro-noise eroding the music away. Enter “Louis’s Bounce” a bounce- \r\nheavy, clanking rhythm-bed, with touches of marimba, fused with found \r\nsounds and spoken tantrums. 20 minutes… organic as a kitten and as \r\npossessed as the Oracles mono-toned pronouncements. \r\nThe ﬂip features Andy Gallagher enlisting the help of Mike Watt \r\n(MINUTEMEN), Mike Hoffman, Steve Summers and Graham Brown. \r\nThe instantly memorable opener “Should’ve stayed in bed” is \r\nreminiscent of a melancholy Grant Hart that wont leave your memory \r\nanytime soon. This 4- song effort then merges into tracks touching Andy \r\nGallagher’s inﬂuences DINOSAUR JR, SEBADOH, NEIL YOUNG and \r\nSailor Jerry. A great testament to why Andy Gallagher has opened for \r\nDinosaur Jr. \r\n","options":[{"id":9864334,"name":"Default","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29501857/-/AG_cover_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29501857/-/AG_cover_.jpg","width":728,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29501889/-/BDC_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29501889/-/BDC_cover.jpg","width":728,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43697893/-/photo.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43697893/-/photo.JPG","width":478,"height":640}],"artists":[{"id":45393,"name":"Andy Gallager+Boy Dirt Car Split L.P.","permalink":"andy-gallager-boy-dirt-car-split-l-p","url":"/artist/andy-gallager-boy-dirt-car-split-l-p"}],"categories":[{"id":1593313,"name":"Vinyl Recordings","permalink":"vinyl-recordings","url":"/category/vinyl-recordings"}]},{"id":3514252,"name":"Steve Mackay -The Prisoner w/ Iggy Pop on vocal   7\"  vinyl ","permalink":"steve-mackay-the-prisoner-7-vinyl","position":27,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/steve-mackay-the-prisoner-7-vinyl","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-03-31T01:56:01.000Z","description":" \"The Prisoner \"  7\" is available at   After Music Recordings \r\n The good news that Mackay has put together a solo album.

Much more unsettling than the rock \r\ndrones offered on 'Spoken Answer To A Silent Question', with a \r\nlarge role played by the vocals of Darren Brown (we remember his \r\nindustrial music poetry project Impact Test very well). No careful \r\nconstructed ambient industrial patterns this time but two sides of \r\nmayhem. Hardly composed \r\nas such, but instead it seems thrown on the magnetic tape, splicing \r\nunrelated parts together. While the cover lists individual tracks, the \r\nwhole thing comes across as a long track, for some convenience (?) \r\nsake given a bunch of titles. The mayhem doesn't constitute of just \r\npure noise, or pure feedback, but, on the other hand its a great \r\ncollage of sound snippets, instrument abuse and electro-acoustic \r\nrumble taking to an extreme. Excellent noise stuff. Two different \r\napproaches - the previous CD and this LP - but both with a great \r\nquality.

Something about the alternating\r\nblack and white of noise bursts and nothingness is key (just\r\nas compelling as the black and white art work). Some modulated\r\nIugula Thor screamgasm on “Miles Traveled/Earth Beneath” is\r\ncontrasted with sampled strings climbing your spine. Then into\r\nsome burrowing bass and vox humana humdrone. This release has\r\na lot of “vocals”, not entirely dehumanized and power-electronified\r\nones either. “The Notion of Progress Accepted as Myth” has these\r\ngreat digitally sputtered ones, “Collapse at a Distance” has a\r\nmournful, faroff foreign lament over sad gut-string twang before\r\nblowing off some serious steam samplage. The closing track has\r\nthese sort of war whoops run through distortion and reverb and\r\nthen battling some sort of arcade video game, and ultimately\r\nthe game wins. Like I said, spectacular in the sense that this\r\nhas so much for the ears, it overflows into your eyes. Hope to\r\nhear more and turn more folks on to this Milwaukee squakee\r\ntalkie!\r\n-Thurston Hunger\r\nCheck out : http://experimentalmilwaukee.com/peterjwoods\r\n\r\nMilwaukee based-conceptual artist Peter J. Woods believes: “ Music has the wonderful ability to speak to both intellect & instinct.” \r\n“In respect for the vinyl medium I think it’s great that artists have the ability to force people into specific listening environments. So to have a full length out on After Music Recordings is just flat out awesome.”\r\n\r\n“Songs for Nothing” develops a central sound as in guitar drone, a feedback device, starting with an image/concept to develop the piece around. Scathing, abruptly unapologetic harsh noise.\r\n  ============ \r\n  VITAL WEEKLY \r\n  ============ \r\n  number   771 \r\n  ------------ \r\n  week      10 \r\n  ------------ \r\nPETER J. WOODS - SONGS FOR NOTHING \r\n(LP by After Music Recordings) \r\nAfter Music Recordings 'is a family run micro record label \r\nbased in Minneapolis' and we primarily know them from \r\nreleasing music by the revived Boy Dirt Car. I never heard of \r\nPeter J. Woods, I think, who believes that 'has the wonderful \r\nability to speak to both intellect and instinct'. His music is \r\nguitar based and pieces usually start with an image, although \r\nnone are forthcoming with the album. The press text reads \r\nabout 'scathing, abruptly unapologetic harsh noise', but its \r\nnot. At least not all the way in and out. There is something of \r\nthat Boy Dirt Car kind of noise approach here. Yes, its loud, \r\nyes, it has some harsh noise, but Woods breaks things up in \r\nsilence too. Or they start out very low but then start build up \r\nin a massive way. More a collage like approach then \r\nnecessarily something that is just a wall of noise sound. Just \r\nas I like it, probably. Taking the best of noise, and then \r\nmoving it into the land of electro-acoustic, musique concrete \r\nand such like to create \r\n four \r\nmovements of intense music, with lots of great dynamics. \r\nEnergetic, mean, aggressive and with lots of great power.

Boy \r\nDirt Car revived, but here he is present with two different \r\noutfits. Somewhere between 2007 and 2009 he played as \r\nTexar, with himself on electronics and Richard McCollum on \r\nguitars and theremin and played some concerts in the \r\nMidwest of the USA, yet 'more recently disappeared'. The \r\nmusic is all improvised and shows traces of Boy Dirt Car: the \r\ngritty dirty sound of feedback like guitars, taped voices and \r\nquite obscure electronics. A pretty lo-fi recording seems to \r\nbe doing the rest. A somewhat sketchy affair when it comes \r\nto improvisation, exploding into bouts of noise towards the \r\nend. \r\nBrown is also part of a collective led by Jarrod Olman from \r\nSpain called Maria Askatu. In this 'collage' they have \r\nrecordings from the Basque homeland and Amsterdam. Here \r\ntoo we find a Boy Dirt Car influence, but also Brown's solo \r\nwork: organ like sounds, rumbling of metallic sounds, water \r\nsounds, and mumbling voices. Perhaps constructed as part \r\nof some ritual? Quite a mysterious piece of music, I'd say. A \r\ncollage indeed. This side I enjoyed more than the somewhat \r\ndislocated Texar side, but throughout a pretty enjoyable \r\nrecord. Crude music by and for crude people.

Milwaukee's Boy Dirt Car were their good city's preeminent punk-noise-industrial outfit who roamed the state and country from roughly 1981 'til 1989. Formed by the disgruntled duo of Eric Lunde and Darren Brown after being inspired by a local cacophonous Glen Branca gig, they decided to gather a group of fellow miscreants from the Milwaukee punk scene with a mission to create a truly inspired, ungodly, riot-inducing racket. Roping in, amongst others, Dan Kubinski and Keith Brammer from local hardcore kings, Die Kreuzen, they formed Boy Dirt Car. With a sound approximating some sort of bizarre stew of Throbbing Gristle, early Sonic Youth, Birthday Party, AMM and Einsterzunde Neubauten, they set about documenting themselves through a slew of self-released cassettes. Playing the circuit with everyone from Fred Frith to Flipper to Shockabilly to Screamin' Jay Hawkins(!), BDC caught the ear of noise aficionado, Ron Lessard, of the famed RRR label out of Massachusetts, who released the 1986 split LP with fellow Milwaukee space-rockers, F/i. Winning praise from the hipsters and running through a few pressings for its troubles, the band went and did it again in 1987 with their debut full-length, Winter. Both of these have been out-of-print for almost 15 years and never been given the CD treatment, until now. So why bother with Boy Dirt Car? For the simple reason that they are one of the great missing links in '80s U.S. punk-noise underground culture. Listening to the CD is like revisiting a time in history that really drew a line in the sand: are you with us or not? It was a time when \"getting in the van\" was all a \"challenging band\" could do to survive; a time when Whitehouse and Black Flag were one and the same; a time when \"industrial\" meant more than some New Romantic reject churning out z-grade speed-metal riffs with a drum machine. It's all part of a link to a puzzle, and Boy Dirt Car, as obscure as they may seem, were truly one of those great links that need reinvestigating. \"...Boy Dirt (Car) share a member w/Die Kreuzen, are all pals w/Steve Albini and are often referred to as America's Einstug. That's not the most accurate thing in the world, but they are damage of an industrial nature and they don't suck.
