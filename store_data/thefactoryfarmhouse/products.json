Since these walls were always one to three feet short of the floor or ceiling, the open space was sealed off with chicken wire, hence the name “cage hotels.” Heat, lighting, ventilation, and sanitary conditions were abysmal and owners could pack as many as 200 men on a floor.\r\n\r\nThis shirt was inspired by the only unique aspect SRO's had to offer...The interesting signage that hung outside the
