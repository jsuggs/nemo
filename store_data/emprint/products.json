This was one of my charges back in 2007 - baby Clover. I bottle-fed her for many weeks and she was pretty sure I was her mama, following me around everywhere until we had a cow who could adopt her. This print is from a photograph I took of her, in the evening, after feeding her a bottle. I love the details on this print - the texture of the grass and even her long long little eyelashes.

I took a photograph of one such swarm of blackbirds, in the tree outside my kitchen window, in the Fall of 2007. I transfered the photograph to a plate and then letterpress printed each card by hand. I chose an autumnal tan color for the paper and paired it with blue envelopes, to invoke the brilliant blue skies of Fall-time. They turned out really lovely.
