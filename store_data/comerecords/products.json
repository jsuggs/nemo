The heavy metallic clanging from side a finds its way back into side b in a somewhat more melodic form before erupting into static. Pitch-bent and effected recordings of music, spoken dialogue, and children find their way into the performance but their origins are so deeply muddled it's really hard to guess where they came from. Their use picks up heavily in the last ten minutes of the tape along with the first unaffected vocals of the whole recording. It ends with more of the dry acoustic guitar/microphone feedback elements and a minute of moaning the words \"rose hip\" like a person afflicted with some sort of degenerative mental condition.' - HighBias.org","options":[{"id":12878956,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.75,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37638198/-/herniaforcomfort.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37638198/-/herniaforcomfort.jpg","width":744,"height":376}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1404771,"name":"Cassette","permalink":"cassette","url":"/category/cassette"}]},{"id":3860746,"name":"HERNIA 'Dusty Shank' & BALJ split Cassette","permalink":"hernia-dusty-shank-balj-split-cassette","position":2,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/hernia-dusty-shank-balj-split-cassette","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-06-03T22:43:20.000Z","description":"LIMITED TO 100 COPIES\r\nDuration: 60 minutes\r\nIncludes full color artwork, insert & COME RECORDS sticker.\r\n\r\nHERNIA is Anonymous Bosch & The Brutal Poodle of BRUTAL POODLE.\r\nBALJ is Anonymous Bosch & Johnny Leftist of BRUTAL POODLE.\r\n\r\nAssembled/Recorded at Naut Flats in Landers, CA USA.\r\n","options":[{"id":12878734,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.75,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37637830/-/P1040312.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37637830/-/P1040312.jpg","width":800,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":67360,"name":"HERNIA/BALJ","permalink":"hernia-balj","url":"/artist/hernia-balj"}],"categories":[{"id":1404771,"name":"Cassette","permalink":"cassette","url":"/category/cassette"}]},{"id":3856714,"name":"COME RECORDS T-SHIRTS","permalink":"come-records-t-shirts","position":3,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/come-records-t-shirts","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-06-03T04:54:44.000Z","description":"Beautifully Stunning T-shirts just in time for summer 2011!\r\nVery limited sizes, please inquire about availability via email: frugalfilms@hotmail.com\r\nWhite, Red or Yellow Shirts with Black Printing.\r\nSee photo of shirts at: comerecords.com\r\n","options":[{"id":12867626,"name":"contact Emmy at: frugalfilms@hotmail.com for available sizes before ordering","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12867634,"name":"for shipping outside the USA and Alaska or Hawaii, please inquire","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12867662,"name":"please see comerecords.com for photos and colors of shirts","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[],"artists":[{"id":67250,"name":"COME RECORDS","permalink":"come-records","url":"/artist/come-records"}],"categories":[{"id":1404571,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":3846736,"name":"THE ACIDIC JEWS 'Clean Rigs' Cassette","permalink":"the-acidic-jews-clean-rigs-cassette","position":4,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-acidic-jews-clean-rigs-cassette","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-06-01T14:12:18.000Z","description":"LIMITED TO 100 COPIES\r\nDuration: 60 minutes\r\nIncludes full cover artwork, 2 inserts and a COME RECORDS sticker.\r\n\r\nTHE ACIDIC JEWS are/is/was Emmy (The Volcano) Collins on everything.\r\n\r\n'Listening to this is sort of like slowly sliding down a very long, very steep, very twisty slide clogged with cat corpses into a pool of Boiling napalm...this may be 2009's best noise record' -
