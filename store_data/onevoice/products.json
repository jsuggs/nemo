Know someone who is struggling to be one?\r\nDid you know that 1 in 3 girls and 1 in 6 boys are sexually abused by the age of 18? Nicole Bromley suffered the silent shame of childhood sexual abuse for many years until she realized that the silence had to be broken for healing to begin. If you were ever told to \"HUSH,\" then you've been there, too.\r\nThe words of Nicole's new book, HUSH, are fuel for healthy relationships.\r\n\r\nThey reveal how intimacy can trigger issues from the past and how to overcome those barriers to love. As Nicole writes, \"Sexual abuse isn't about sex. It's about power and control. Don't let your abuser wield this power any longer. You deserve to be believed. You deserve to heal.\"\r\n\r\nCome to the Source of all comfort. You don't have to suffer alone or in silence. May the silence be broken.\r\n\r\nGet your own autographed copy of Nicole's first book here!","options":[{"id":9202231,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25019095/-/Hush.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25019095/-/Hush.jpg","width":500,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1550370,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":2597714,"name":"autographed copy of Breathe","permalink":"breathe","position":4,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/breathe","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-06-02T02:22:46.000Z","description":"Breathe: Finding Freedom to Thrive in Relationships after Childhood Sexual Abuse (Moody Publishers, 2009) by Nicole Braddock Bromley.\r\n \r\nA least one out of every three women and one out of every six men have experienced some form of sexual abuse.  Regardless of the circumstances of the violation, every survivor can attest that it will impact relationships with parents, friends, spouses, children, and God. Sexual abuse survivors are often left feeling isolated and without anyone to trust.  But it does not have to be this way.\r\n \r\nNicole Braddock Bromley understands the fears and anxieties victims face as they seek to build healthy relationships after sexual abuse.  As a survivor herself, Nicole offers readers the power and hope necessary to share their story, build intimacy, and develop healthy communication in all their relationships.\r\n\r\nBreathe also serves as a helpful tool for those in relationship with an abuse survivor by providing guidance, confidence, and encouragement as they seek to help and support.\r\n\r\n\"Breathe is to Hush as fulfillment is to a promise. Nicoles experience, wisdom, compassion and insight uniquely qualify her to console, encourage and challenge victims of sexual abuse in their ongoing healing. She also masterfully addresses those who help, offering information and advice. Each chapter is cohesively written with an account of a person from the Bible, an explanation of difficulties inherent in that particular element of recovery or support, narrative examples from people Nicole has encountered in her ministry and a life letter written by someone other than Nicole, addressing the reader from his or her perspective  friend, mother, husband, fellow victim. Every reader will leave the book with clearer understanding of and commitment to the circle of inspiration God intended for those who have been victimized by childhood sexual abuse. Breaking the silence begins the healing. Thriving relationships are the next step and the reward of Gods promise to dry every tear and bind every wound.\"\r\nBreathe helps us take that step.\r\n- Edee Schulze, Ph.D.,Vice President for Student Life, Bethel University\r\n\r\nNicole is a wise soul who has not only survived, but also triumphed over the far too prevalent offense of sexual abuse. A perfect companion to her book Hush, Breathe is a must-have resource not only for survivors, but also for everyone in their circle of inspiration and healing. Youth Pastors, friends, mentors, family members and survivors alike will benefit from its straightforward counsel centered on Gods foundation of truth.\r\n-Allie Marie Smith, founder of Wonderfully Made & author of HEAL: Healthy Eating & Abundant Living\r\n\r\nGet your own autographed copy of Nicole's latest book Breathe here!","options":[{"id":9202227,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25019067/-/Breathe-Cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25019067/-/Breathe-Cover.jpg","width":500,"height":773}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1550370,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":2991299,"name":"Make a Donation","permalink":"inspirational-watercolor-by-nicole-bromley-s-mother-cindy-stiverson","position":5,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/inspirational-watercolor-by-nicole-bromley-s-mother-cindy-stiverson","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-12-07T19:07:03.000Z","description":"Any donation you make helps us continue in the work we are already doing and fund new projects. \r\n\r\nThank you for your support and generosity today! \r\n\r\nYou are a world-changer!\r\n\r\nYOU ARE PART OF THE SOLUTION!","options":[{"id":28204712,"name":"$10","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28204526,"name":"$25","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":28204529,"name":"$50","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":28204532,"name":"$100","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":28204535,"name":"$250","price":250.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":28204538,"name":"$500","price":500.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":28204541,"name":"$1000","price":1000.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":29658776,"name":"$2,500","price":2500.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":29658779,"name":"$5,000","price":5000.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":29658782,"name":"$10,000","price":10000.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90302942/-/184713_10151644653517542_1217352545_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90302942/-/184713_10151644653517542_1217352545_n.jpg","width":960,"height":638}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
