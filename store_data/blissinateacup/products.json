Remind your favourite book-lover how much you love them with a wink.\r\n\r\nAn image of an open eye is printed on one side of each bookmark. Flip it over and find a winking eye. Bookmarks can further have a few words or monogram printed on them for no further cost.\r\n\r\nThe bookmarks are made from laminating 2 different wood veneers together and then coated with a durable finish, to make sure your bookmark and it's image are long lasting. In keeping with our desire to recycle as much as possible, our veneer is usually off cuts, scraps or taken from furniture we have found. If you would like a specific wood to be used in your bookmark, please convo us to see if it is available.
