The combination of natural materials and clean uncluttered lines are unsurpassed by the later versions which use cheaper materials/construction.\r\n\r\nThe clever part of its design, is the angled rattan cane back element, its intention is that during the day it can be used for pillow/blanket storage and at night you simply lift the hinged mechanism and the back raises and shuts flat to reveal all the mattress for sleeping.\r\n\r\nThis piece comes with an interesting provenance. The sofa/daybed which along with other interesting period items I am listing for sale, comes from the deceased estate of the British 'Brutalist' architect Rodney Gordon. He is most famous for the Michael Faraday Memorial in the center of the Elephant & Castle roundabout.\r\nHe also designed the Trinity Centre, Gateshead, which became known to a wider audience as the carpark from whose roof mobster Jack Carter (Michael Caine) threw the corrupt councillor Cliff Brumby (Bryan Mosley) in the 1971 cult film Get Carter. Loved and loathed, but never unnoticed, Gordon's audacious designs marked him out as a seminal figure in English brutalist architecture.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful and rare piece has been lovingly and sympathetically restored by an incredible team of craftsman/women over the last three months. The list of work done includes : the teak elements stripped and re-polished, the beech/pine frame stripped and re-polished (thank you Max) the rattan cane replaced (each piece woven by hand, which is an incredibly difficult job to do, again thank you Francis for all your hard work) the original wire underframe mattress cleaned and re-sprung then covered, top mattress re-foamed (to pass fire regulations) then recovered in a gorgeous 100% wool tartan/plaid (cost £65 per metre plus upholstery fee, thanks Ian) all original hardware kept and re-used including hinges, screws etc, \r\n\r\nMeasurements: length 200 cm, depth 86 cm, seat height 40 cm, mattress size 193 cm x 86 cm\r\n\r\nTo summarise : when the sofa/daybed first came into our possession it was in pretty poor condition. unfortunately it had been neglected over the years, the frame had various marks/scuffs, the cane had perished and the mattress was thread bare. \r\n\r\nWe looked upon it as a labour of love, just like restoring an old house or classic car. we quickly realised that it was going to take lots of time and money to put it back into as near its original factory condition. But we wanted to see the project through and save a classic piece of Danish mid-centry design from the scrap heap, after all this was designed by one of the 20th centuries leading furniture makers and I'd like to think we've succeeded and done a good job.\r\n\r\nWe are offering it for sale at a buy it now price of £1650 or best offer, which I think is a fair price considering the time, effort and money that's been invested in it. And also the fact that you're buying a piece of furniture design history, for the comparable price of  a new sofa from the likes of Conran or Heals etc.\r\n\r\nAny Questions please message me at dad-design@hotmail.co.uk or 07940458890, viewing is available most times/days.

Charles Eames fiberglass shell chair in lemon yellow for Herman Miller (USA) circa 1960.\r\n\r\nThis is a third generation Herman Miller shell, with small shocks raised on a nickel plated 'H' base, it has the three dot raised marking to the underside denoting it to be produced between 1953-1965.\r\n\r\nThe shell is a wonderful pale lemon yellow in colour, showing strong fiber content and a good translucency.\r\n\r\nThis piece along with other interesting period items comes from the deceased estate of the British 'Brutalist' architect Rodney Gordon, who is famous for the Michael Faraday Memorial in the center of the Elephant & Castle roundabout.\r\nHe also designed the Trinity Centre, Gateshead, which became known to a wider audience as the carpark from whose roof mobster Jack Carter (Michael Caine) threw the corrupt councillor Cliff Brumby (Bryan Mosley) in the 1971 cult film Get Carter. Loved and loathed, but never unnoticed, Gordon's audacious designs marked him out as a seminal figure in English brutalist architecture.\r\n\r\nCondition : the shell is in great order, the fibers are strong, and the colour even. There are two small marks to one arm front edge, some small dot marks, and a slight bleed through on one of the front shocks. There are no splits/holes/repairs present. The base is original to the chair (unlike many offered on todays market) and as stated has the matt nickel finish, this has a lovely patina. the small black feet caps are worn, with two missing. These can be purchased from Graham Mancha (who is a nice guy and has everything Eames available)\r\nTo conclude this is a super original vintage piece, in a great colour and in good order, backed up with excellent provenance.","options":[{"id":23900441,"name":"Default","price":595.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74269905/-/IMG_4794.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74269905/-/IMG_4794.jpg","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74269913/-/IMG_4795.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74269913/-/IMG_4795.JPG","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74269861/-/IMG_4793.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74269861/-/IMG_4793.jpg","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74269961/-/IMG_4798.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74269961/-/IMG_4798.JPG","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74270033/-/IMG_4804.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74270033/-/IMG_4804.jpg","width":667,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1582498,"name":"Furniture","permalink":"furniture","url":"/category/furniture"}]},{"id":13523850,"name":"Lovely

Abramovitz was a South African born architect and industrial designer who studied at the Royal College of Art in London. \r\n\r\nThe desk light's form projects a remarkable forward-looking, minimalist aesthetic for a 1961 design. After deliberating with the company a few changes were made and this model the mark 11 was produced circa 1963.\r\n\r\nThe lamp won a coveted Design Centre Award in 1966 and was included in the landmark exhibition 'Design Since 1945' held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1983-1984.\r\n\r\nHe subsequently designed furniture for Knoll and Hille.\r\n \r\nAnother copy of this lamp is held in the collection of the Museum of Modern art in New York\r\n \r\nThe lamp is in excellent working order with minimal wear/marking.\r\n \r\nMeasures : 20 x 27 1/2 x 3 5/8\" or (50.8 x 69.8 x 9.2 cm).

(obviously grinding of some sort) and to be honest I know nothing about silver.\r\n\r\nTo be honest I can't get the thing to open to check whats inside it!....it turns as to grind something, but I can't get it to open and I'm afraid to apply too much force in case I damage it.\r\n\r\nIf any kind soul recognizes this particular model and feels generous enough to offer some info it would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nAs you can see from the photographs its very modern/contemporary and stylish in its design which you can put down to Georg Jensen's son Soren was primarily a sculptor and therefore interested in form etc.\r\n\r\nIt has a full set of marks to the underside which includes : Georg Jensen, Denmark, Sterling, Dessin, and SGJ initials.\r\n\r\nMeasurements : 8.25 cm in height

Kjaerholm first designed this model in 1955 and it was produced by the Danish company E.Kold.Christensen, production moved to Fritz Hansen (Denmark) in 1982.\r\n\r\nAlthough this piece has a lovely age and patina to both the steel and slate, I cannot find the E.Kold. Christensen mark to the frame. Therefore I estimate it to be a Fritz Hansen version produced circa 1982.\r\n\r\nProvenance : This piece along with other interesting period items ( set of 'PK 71' tables (marked E.Kold sold) Eames Shell chair, Hans Wegner sofa-bed, Bertoia chair) that are offered for sale came from the deceased estate of the British 'Brutalist' architect Rodney Gordon, who is famous for the Michael Faraday Memorial in the center of the Elephant & Castle roundabout.\r\nHe was also part of the architectural practice who designed the Trinity Centre, Gateshead, which became known to a wider audience as the carpark from whose roof mobster Jack Carter (Michael Caine) threw the corrupt councillor Cliff Brumby (Bryan Mosley) in the 1971 cult film Get Carter. Loved and loathed, but never unnoticed, Gordon's audacious designs marked him out as a seminal figure in English brutalist architecture.\r\n\r\nCondition : the satin brushed stainless steel frame is structurally excellent, there are no breaks or re-welds. Unfortunately the finish on the steel has over time corroded and pitted in places. This is mainly confined to the top frame section which the slate sits on (so cannot be seen) and on all four of the frame uprights (see images). The original machine head screws are all present and correct. The slate top is original (not a replacement) it has a few areas of wear to the edges the largest being approx 10cm x 3 cm (see images) again no cracks or repairs present, shows a nice patina and originality.\r\n\r\nMeasurements : 80 cm x 80 cm (top) x 32 cm in height\r\n\r\nThese early examples are quite hard to find and offer character and charm, along with the provenance I think this piece is highly desirable and a good investment for the future.
