From this date onwards it is in full strength until August 20th and is then for seven days gradually losing its strength on account of becoming overlapped by the \"cusp\" of the incoming sign Virgo. \r\n\r\nThe Fire sign in these people is enthusiastic, energetic, and optimistic. Representatives of signs are happy, lucky people. Fixed people are stable. They don't like much change. Status quo suits them fine. They will stick to things and get them done. \r\n\r\nPeople born in this period always aim to get above the common herd of humanity, and they themselves in turn are naturally attracted to strong personalities – in fact, they will forgive any fault in the people they like so long as they have individuality and purpose. They are usually generous, kind, and openhearted, they find it hard to believe ill of others. If injured, they strike back quickly, but they also forgive easily and never hold a grudge. The bright side of Leo is very bright indeed, \"sunny side up\" they are very much attuned to the life giving properties of our Sun itself. The typical Leo is flamboyant and generous with tremendous charm and a magnanimous spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Sun is the single most important planet, because it represents a LEO's ego and individuality. It shows their ambitions and deepest character traits, where they have the ability to shine. \r\n\r\nSuch people represent what might be termed the heartforce of humanity. They are overflowing with sympathy, and are generally generous to a fault. \r\n\r\nThey are usually lucky in money matters, often having money given to them from unthought-of sources; but they crave love above all, and this is the one thing they seldom get. \r\n\r\nSuch people have the power to inspire others, and as leaders like Napoleon, born in this Sign. They have an ability to lead their men through fire or death.\r\n\r\nPeople who were born in this period usually have an extremely independent spirit; they detest control or being dictated to. They have great tenacity of purpose and will power and if once they put their mind on some plan, purpose or position, they usually reach their goal in spite of every difficulty or obstacle. \r\n\r\nThough full of ambition and enthusiasm, Leo has to admit to a lazy streak and, given the opportunity, will take the easy way out, especially when a situation offers little fun or glory. This is something lazy, luxurious Leo needs to watch. \r\n\r\nThese people are usually very patient and long-suffering, but if once roused, they know no fear and do not even know when they meet defeat, or acknowledge it when they do. \r\n\r\nAs a rule, people born in this period feel isolated and lonely in life, and if not actively employed in some work or purpose they become melancholy and despondent.\r\n\r\nThe Leo is proud, expressive and optimistic with a need for adoration and respect from those they love.\r\n\r\n**Print is available on high glossy vivid photo paper at\r\n11x17 in\r\n13x20 in\r\n22x34 in\r\n28x40 in","options":[{"id":33806337,"name":"11x17","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":33806340,"name":"13x20","price":34.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":33806343,"name":"22x34","price":54.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":33806346,"name":"28x40","price":74.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/105947169/-/lion_sq.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/105947169/-/lion_sq.jpg","width":576,"height":576},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/105947181/-/lionkaleido.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/105947181/-/lionkaleido.jpg","width":647,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/105947211/-/printsize.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/105947211/-/printsize.jpg","width":700,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5005990,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":10525945,"name":"\"Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) Viewing\" Poster Print","permalink":"aurora-borealis-northern-lights-viewing-poster-print","position":7,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/aurora-borealis-northern-lights-viewing-poster-print","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-13T17:48:16.000Z","description":"This is a Gonz Art original signed digital print in a part of a series called \"Look to the Sky\" containing different astronomical events that are happening throughout the year.\r\n\r\nComes on high quality photo glossy paper.\r\n\r\nSizes available are:\r\n11x17\r\n13x20\r\n22x34\r\n28x40\r\n\r\nNorthern lights are coming to the East Coast of the U.S. and can be seen the late evening of Saturday, April 13.\r\n\r\nAccuweather reports that a solar flare left the sun at 2 a.m. Thursday morning and that the radiation will reach earth Saturday evening around 8 p.m., creating ribbons of color across the sky above the northeastern corner of the U.S.\r\n\r\nAccording to Accuweather, the northern lights this Saturday will be most spectacular over areas in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio and South Jersey.\r\n\r\nThe aurora borealis (the Northern Lights) have always fascinated mankind, and people even travel thousands of miles just to see the brilliant light shows in the earth's atmosphere. The auroras, both surrounding the north magnetic pole (aurora borealis) occur when highly charged electrons from the solar wind interact with elements in the earth's atmosphere. Solar winds stream away from the sun at speeds of about 1 million miles per hour. When they reach the earth, some 40 hours after leaving the sun, they follow the lines of magnetic force generated by the earth's core and flow through the magnetosphere, a teardrop-shaped area of highly charged electrical and magnetic fields.\r\n\r\n­As the electrons enter the earth's upper atmosphere, they will encounter atoms of oxygen and nitrogen at altitudes from 20 to 200 miles above the earth's surface. The color of the aurora depends on which atom is struck, and the altitude of the meeting.\r\n\r\n    Green - oxygen, up to 150 miles in altitude\r\n    Red - oxygen, above 150 miles in altitude\r\n    Blue - nitrogen, up to 60 miles in altitude\r\n    Purple/violet - nitrogen, above 60 miles in altitude\r\n\r\nAll of the magnetic and electrical forces react with one another in constantly shifting combinations. These shifts and flows can be seen as the auroras \"dance,\" moving along with the atmospheric currents that can reach 20,000,000 amperes at 50,000 volts. (In contrast, the circuit breakers in your home will disengage when current flow exceeds 15-30 amperes at 120 volts.)\r\n\r\nThe auroras generally occur along the \"auroral ovals,\" which center on the magnetic poles (not the geographic poles) and roughly correspond with the Arctic and Antarctic circles. There are times, though, when the lights are farther south, usually when there are a lot of sunspots. Sunspot activity follows an 11-year cycle.

Binoculars are also a huge help.\r\n\r\nA half hour after sunset, start scanning the horizon where the Sun's glow is strongest. Mercury should already be visible as a faint pinprick of light through binoculars, and it's likely to become more prominent as the sky grows darker.\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of the month, you should also be able to see Mars near Mercury, as shown in our chart. But you might need binoculars, because Mars is about one-tenth as bright as Mercury. Mars and Mercury are spectacularly close on February 7th and 8th.\r\n\r\nYou may see an extremely thin crescent Moon to the lower right of the planets on February 10th. And a thicker but still delicate Moon floats above them on the 11th.\r\n\r\nMercury is at its highest from the 11th through the 21st. During this period it's still well above the horizon an hour after sunset, when the sky is growing dark even in the west. However, it fades significantly, from magnitude -0.9 on the 11th to +0.5 on the 21st.\r\n\r\nAfter that, Mercury fades rapidly and appears nearly 1° lower each evening, soon disappearing from naked-eye view. However, this is also the period when it becomes most interesting through a telescope, becoming a long, thin crescent as it starts to come between Earth and the Sun.\r\n\r\nFollowing Mercury with a telescope through an entire apparition is surprisingly rewarding. The key is to catch it as early as possible, while it's relatively high above the horizon. A bright sky is no obstacle to telescopic viewing; in fact it tames Mercury's otherwise overwhelming brilliance.\r\n**information from http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/highlights/Mercury-in-February-2013-189234341.html**\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said that Mercury, the planet of communication goes retrograde three times a year for three weeks. During this time, we often feel mentally wobbly, forgetful, and introverted. This can be a great time for renewal and self-reflection if we are posted with the Mercury retrograde dates each year.","options":[{"id":32582998,"name":"11x17","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32583001,"name":"13x20","price":34.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":32583004,"name":"22x34","price":54.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":32583007,"name":"28x40","price":74.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102329308/-/mercury_sq1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102329308/-/mercury_sq1.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102758404/-/mercury1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102758404/-/mercury1.jpg","width":1000,"height":647},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102664432/-/printsize.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102664432/-/printsize.jpg","width":700,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5005990,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":10403797,"name":"\"Very Close Moon/Jupiter Conjunction\" Poster Print","permalink":"very-close-moon-jupiter-conjunction-poster-print","position":11,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/very-close-moon-jupiter-conjunction-poster-print","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-07T20:52:45.000Z","description":"This is a Gonz Art original signed digital print in a part of a series called \"Look to the Sky\" containing different astronomical events that are happening throughout the year.\r\n\r\nComes on high quality photo glossy paper.\r\n\r\nSizes available are: \r\n11x17 \r\n13x20 \r\n22x34 \r\n28x40\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 21 — Very Close Moon/Jupiter Conjunction\r\n\r\nA waxing gibbous moon (78% illuminated) will pass within less than a degree to the south of Jupiter high in the evening sky.

around.\r\nI have a house where I can go\r\nWhen there's too many people around me;\r\nI can sit and watch all the people\r\nDown below goin' by me;\r\nHalfway down the stair is a stair\r\nWhere I sit and think around you and me;\r\nBut I wonder will the sun still see all the people goin' by.\r\nWill the moon still hang in the sky when I die,\r\nWhen I die, when I'm high, when I die?\r\nIf you were a cloud and you sailed up there,\r\nYou'd sail on water as blue as air,\r\nYou'd see me here in the fields and say,\r\n\"Doesn't the sky look green today?\"\r\n\r\n-Jefferson
