While it looks like the scarf was made from 3 different colored skeins of yarn, it is actually a continuous strand of yarn which was dyed in such a way that it would form perfect stripes (or chunks) of color. This color reminds me of a calm day at beach in the winter.\r\nThis scarf is pretty thin. The yarn is thin and was knitted on large needles. So, the stitches are very big and the scarf is very stretchy. It measures about 45 in long.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-via=\"WKKnitWorks\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a>\r\n<script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script>","options":[{"id":18650083,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/57081631/-/scarf.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/57081631/-/scarf.png","width":430,"height":233}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3056011,"name":"Scarves","permalink":"scarves","url":"/category/scarves"}]},{"id":5813831,"name":"Slippers Baby","permalink":"slippers-baby","position":2,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/slippers-baby","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-03-30T01:03:00.000Z","description":"These cute, but simple, baby slippers are completely hand-knit. Made of 100% cotton yarn, they are soft and cool in the summer and soft and warm in cooler weather.\r\n\r\nAvailable in 2 color styles: Pink, purple, and white variegated.  Blue variegated.\r\nSize: 3-6 months\r\nDimensions: 4in toe to heel, 2.5in side to side at widest part, 1.25in high\r\nMaterials: 100% cotton yarn\r\n\r\nDue to the slippers being 100% cotton, shrinking can be expected, especially with the first washing. However, to minimize shrinking the first time YOU wash it, the slippers have been pre-washed. The size you get is the size they stay. So while they could shrink some, the slippers will stay the same general size.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting Wonderfully Knit.
