An officer picked up the puppy and arrived at the shelter around closing time with this girl. We gave her fluids and nutrical, and a wonderful volunteer took her home. She rushed Xena to her vet & by that time, the little miracle had already perked up. If an owner can be located, cruelty charges will be pursued. In any case, Xena is now safe and we hope that she continues to improve with TLC.\r\n\r\nXena was adopted 03/25/2013.

Ginger is the winner of our “aMUSE Your Pet with Dean Russo” portrait contest from May 2013. She is an eight year old pit bull with a rough past. She was one of Michael Vick’s Bad News Kennel, which forced over 70 dogs, mainly pit bulls, to participate in dog fights. In 2007, an investigation put a stop to the illegal fighting, and the rescued dogs were placed in shelters throughout the country in hopes that they would finally receive the home they deserved. Three rescued pits were sent to the SPCA for Monterey County, CA, and it was there that Stacy found Ginger.\r\n\r\n“When she first came into my home in November 2007, she was very timid and overwhelmed by life,” said Stacy. “It looks a lot of time, patience and love but eventually she started coming out of her shell and showing off her beautiful happy smile!” Ginger needed a warm, peaceful and loving home to recover from her past, and in time, she’s become the happiest pup around. Just look at her smile!\r\n\r\nDimensions:\r\n\r\n8\"X10\" or 11\"x14\" print from the original artwork.\r\n\r\nFramed or Unframed?\r\n\r\nComes unframed.

Everyday Justice joined Heather at work where she was surrounded by tons of affection. Justice stole everyone’s heart.\r\n \r\nWhen Justice was 6-months-old she became sick with the parvovirus. The veterinarians gave her blood transfusions and felt they had done all that they could do. She only had a 30% chance of survival.  She would not eat, lift her head, or respond to touch. But, as soon as Justice heard Heather’s voice, she lit up, started wagging her tail and immediately and came looking for love.\r\n\r\nThat was 10 years ago. Justice is doing wonderfully now. She still loves to be active, living for her ball and a chance to swim. Her eyes show her soul: full of love, commitment, curiosity, goodness, understanding and a deep sense of \"knowing\". She has given \"Justice\" to her breed. Heather could not feel more blessed that they found each other.\r\n\r\nFiesta was once placed in a high kill shelter in West Virginia. Thanks to a wonderful community volunteers, she now has a forever home.

Although she had never had a young pit bull before, Stacy rushed to get him, and from that day, her life was forever changed. “He is the reason I got into pit bull rescue,” says Stacy, “…and the reason I am a healthier person today.” Tux has a loving and gentle personality, but he’s never afraid to show his goofy side. His warmth and love helped ease Honey Bear into the family, as she came from a terrible situation.\r\nHoney Bear was about 8 years old when Stacy adopted her; she was flown from a bad shelter in LA to Stacy’s home in Chicago. Honey Bear went through extensive rehab, multiple surgeries, physical therapy and hydro therapy to regain her health. Honey Bear had come from a fighting ring and was used as the breeding dog, meaning she was forced to breed every time she was in heat. She was also beaten, starved, and had her teeth pulled out. Stacy gave Honey Bear the best treatment possible, both physically and emotionally. At first, Honey Bear was very aggressive toward Tux, but in time she and Tux became best friends. Despite the horrors of her past, Honey Bear loved people, and loved visiting nursing homes and children. Last September, Honey Bear became sick and passed away, but she was not alone; she was surrounded by her devoted family, Stacy and Tux.\r\n\r\nPrivate Commission Piece completed 2012.\r\n\r\nCustom Prints Dimension:\r\n\r\nImage: 16.00\" x 12.75\"\r\nOverall: 18.00\" x 14.75\"\r\n\r\nImage: 24.00\" x 19.25\"\r\nOverall: 26.00\" x 21.25\"\r\n\r\nFramed or Unframed?\r\n\r\nComes unframed.

Rooster was in very bad shape when he left the shelter and it was believed he would not make it through the week. Rooster's family would soon learn that he had one of the worst heartworm infestations (and symptoms) seen in a living animal by the veterinary staff at The University of Florida Small Animal Hospital; Stage IV. Rooster lost his battle with heartworms and cancer and crossed the Rainbow Bridge on October 27, 2012, which was also National Pit bull Awareness Day.\r\n\r\nIn memory of Rooster and bringing awareness to heartwarm disease, Dean Russo Art will be donation $2.00USD for every “Rooster” print sold through our website to Rooster to the Rescue, Inc. non-for-profit organization. \r\n\r\nWhat is heartworm disease?\r\n\r\nHeartworm disease is a serious and potentially fatal condition caused by parasitic worms living in the arteries of the lungs and occasionally in the right side of the heart. \r\nSpread by mosquitoes, this disease is completely preventable with the use of quick and simple pills, topical treatments or by injection. Heartworm disease has been diagnosed in cats and dogsin all 50 states.  \r\n\r\nHeartworm prevention?\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of options for preventing heartworm infection, including daily and monthly tablets and chewable, monthly topical and a six-month inject-able product. \r\nThese products are extremely effective and when administered properly on a timely schedule, heartworm infection can be prevented. Heartworms are easily prevented but treatment for thedisease is much more difficult.  There is no treatment for heartworms in cats.\r\n\r\nDimensions:\r\n\r\n11\"x14\" print from the original artwork.\r\n\r\nFramed or Unframed?\r\n\r\nComes unframed.
