The end font used is usually in font size 6 - so I would recommend maximum 1 1/2 lines of text as on an A4 sheet - this creates a good flow of the words once they are repeated.\r\n\r\nIf you have a poem - this can also be done but the words will not be repeated to the edge of the heart or circle shape - instead the poem will just read once as it is.\r\n\r\nYou can also choose the colour of canvas and the colour of the ribbon rose-buds - you can tailor make the canvas to tie in with any room - so it will co-ordinate perfectly in its new home.\r\n\r\nJust contact us to discuss any specific requirements.\r\n\r\nYou can choose your colour of ribbon rose-bud flowers from the options when you place your order.\r\n\r\nAfter we have received your order we will contact you find out what colour you would like the canvas painted AND whether you would like a heart shape or a circle shape.\r\n\r\nDimensions:\r\n12.5 x 12.5 x 4cm.","options":[{"id":29234033,"name":"1. deep mulberry flowers","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29234036,"name":"2. bright pink flowers","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29234039,"name":"3. red flowers","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29234042,"name":"4. bright blue flowers","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29234045,"name":"5. aqua blue flowers","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29234048,"name":"6. mauve purple flowers","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29234051,"name":"7. dusky peach flowers","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29234054,"name":"8. pale pink flowers","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29234057,"name":"9. lilac flowers","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29234060,"name":"10. black flowers","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29234072,"name":"11. all white flowers","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29234069,"name":"12. cream flowers","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29234066,"name":"13. white (green leaves) flowers not shown","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29234063,"name":"14. your choice of flower colour","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91830050/-/group_mothers_day_web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91830050/-/group_mothers_day_web.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91830794/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91830794/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91830098/-/aqua_blue_close_up_web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91830098/-/aqua_blue_close_up_web.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91830206/-/mocha_close_up_web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91830206/-/mocha_close_up_web.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98404039/-/flowers_for_canvases.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98404039/-/flowers_for_canvases.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2816819,"name":"Canvas Picture","permalink":"canvas-picture","url":"/category/canvas-picture"}]},{"id":9062084,"name":"Personalised Wedding Heart Favour Canvas","permalink":"personalised-wedding-heart-favour-canvas","position":13,"price":4.5,"default_price":4.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/personalised-wedding-heart-favour-canvas","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-21T22:00:05.000Z","description":"Like us on www.facebook.com/ellaandjoe\r\n\r\nDiscounts available for large quantities - just contact us to discuss.\r\n\r\nThese are hand-made personalised wedding favour canvases ideal for your wedding table and as a keepsake for you and your guests.\r\n\r\nThese mini canvas favours are perfect for placing at each guest’s place setting at the wedding breakfast, they can be stood up, or could also be propped against the napkin, or wine glass for example.\r\n\r\nThey are all hand-made to order and are truly unique.

We can paint the canvas any colour and / or use different coloured ribbon rose buds to co-ordinate with your wedding.\r\n\r\nOr, if you like this canvas, but would prefer it smaller or larger, please contact us to discuss.\r\n\r\nThese are made to order, so it is possible to make changes and amends to suit you.\r\n\r\nDimensions:\r\nSMALL - 12.5 x 12.5 x 3.7cm (as pictured)\r\nMEDIUM - 20 x 20 x 3.7cm","options":[{"id":19801939,"name":"Small (as pictured) 12.5x12.5x3.7cm","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32345164,"name":"Medium 20x20x3.7cm","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.95,"amount_with_others":6.95}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60939503/-/07.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60939503/-/07.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60939575/-/09.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60939575/-/09.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87593462/-/photo__8_.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87593462/-/photo__8_.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2816819,"name":"Canvas Picture","permalink":"canvas-picture","url":"/category/canvas-picture"},{"id":2816825,"name":"Wedding","permalink":"wedding","url":"/category/wedding"}]},{"id":8942969,"name":"Personalised Love Canvas Keepsake","permalink":"personalised-valentines-canvas-gift","position":18,"price":7.5,"default_price":7.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/personalised-valentines-canvas-gift","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-14T20:52:30.000Z","description":"Like us on www.facebook.com/ellaandjoe\r\n\r\nPersonalised handmade mini valentines canvas with a beaded heart and lace design.\r\n\r\nEach canvas comes in it's own organza bag.\r\n\r\nThese mini valentines canvas gifts are a unique gift to give to your loved one and can be kept as a keepsake.\r\n\r\nThey are handmade and you can truly personalise them with your own special words.\r\n\r\nThey are beautifully finished and come in an organza bag so are perfect to give a special gift to that special person in your life.\r\n\r\nEach mini canvas is hand painted either white or black.\r\n\r\nThe black canvas has a red beaded heart and a white lace effect design.
