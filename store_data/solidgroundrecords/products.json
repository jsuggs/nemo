(North Philly) in 1967, moved to The logan section of Philadelphia in 1980, where he first witnessed hip hop at its finest. We’re talking 2 Turntables and a microphone. Well known Dj’s like Disco Rat, Disco Poo Sex Machine, would be off the hook with performances, with rappers, and rap groups. His study of the rap game had him rapping at the early age of 13 sounding just as good as the older rappers. In 1983 he met Ronald Potts known then as Mc Rockwell (aka) Poison Ladd at Olney Highschool in Philadelphia where the challenge each other  to take there skills to the next level. Shortly after,  they met Wayne Rhoads know then as Big which they later named Extortionist B (aka) Beats In General  and they formed a group (Boys Of Doom) they produced a sound that still today is ringing in the public ear. They were considered one of the hottest groups in philly at that time, but still no shine in 1984. In 1987 the Boys Of Doom had to part due to Mc Googly’s  incarceration which he did  a 2 year sentence. His incarceration helped him perfect his rap skills,  Mc Googly returned to the group B.O.D. in 1989 and recorded several  solo songs  but violated his parole and returned right back to prison until 1992. By then B.O.D. was no more, and Ronald Potts, & Wayne Rhoads became Poison Ladd S.L.R. – Beats In General., so Mc Googly moved on as a solo artist recording various hip hop songs throughout the 90’s. We hope you enjoy the many lost treasures of Mc Googly, One of the illest Mc’s of philly.","options":[{"id":13120156,"name":"Default","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":14.95,"amount_with_others":18.95},{"amount_alone":5.95,"amount_with_others":8.95,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38479398/-/Ghetto_Soldiers__Front_Cover__600x600_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38479398/-/Ghetto_Soldiers__Front_Cover__600x600_.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2189392,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":3947212,"name":"BLACK PUSSY / RED WAGON","permalink":"black-pussy-red-wagon","position":4,"price":35.0,"default_price":35.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/black-pussy-red-wagon","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-06-18T19:07:03.000Z","description":"another classic  unreleased 12” single, Black Pussy 1994 / Red Wagon 1993 & bonus verse Yo - Yo - Yo! “Black Pussy ” is Poison Ladd view of the explicit encounters of a promiscuous black woman.
