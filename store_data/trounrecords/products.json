This title will be released on January 28, 2014.)\r\n\r\nTroun Records is pleased to announce a new cassette-only release from Magic Hero vs. Rock People, Mystery of Revival.\r\n\r\nDonny Lang has been making vintage-sounding 'Thrift Shop Psych-Pop' since 2007 with his group of revolving minstrels, Magic Hero vs. Rock People. The Magic Hero sound relies heavily on a unique sort of lo-fi vision -- through the soundscape of late '60s-early '70s soft-psych, calling to mind long-lost would-be outsider classics.\r\n\r\nMystery of Revival is a compilation featuring songs culled from all of the group's albums: Oak of the Golden Dream, Secret Enemies, Magic Hero vs. Rock People, Begin Thee Again, Odd Zen Ends, and Great Gondolas Calling, along with previously unreleased outtakes.\r\n\r\nThese recordings were made in an old-fashioned manner: tapes, tubes, transformers, and transistors. The original 1/4\" 2-track and mono masters were used for this collection. This is a limited pressing of 100 tapes.\r\n\r\nSide One: 1 I Live in a World / 2 Treat It Like Your First / 3 Black Magic / 4 Astro-Turf / 5 Letters in the Sun / 6 A Grand Stop in the Best Direction / 7 Only Road You're Gonna Find / 8 He's Gone / 9 Begin Thee Again (Movements) / 10 Oklahoma Rain -- Side Two: 1 It All Depends On Everything / 2 Hole in Time / 3 You Must Stand On Your Own / 4 1978 / 5 Who Are the People in Your Neighborhood? / 6 Contraband / 7 Pretty As Can Be / 8 Beware the Young / 9 A Season in Time / 10 You Must Stand On Your Own (Reprise)\r\n\r\n(vintage-style cassette)","options":[{"id":46144812,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127613208/-/final_cover_CASS_front.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127613208/-/final_cover_CASS_front.jpg","width":760,"height":1196}],"artists":[{"id":106261,"name":"Magic Hero vs. Rock People","permalink":"magic-hero-vs-rock-people","url":"/artist/magic-hero-vs-rock-people"}],"categories":[{"id":6641631,"name":"Cassette","permalink":"cassette","url":"/category/cassette"}]},{"id":5475645,"name":"Secret Enemies 7\" vinyl EP","permalink":"secret-enemies-7-vinyl-ep","position":2,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/secret-enemies-7-vinyl-ep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-15T13:05:54.000Z","description":"Secret Enemies by Magic Hero Vs Rock People - \r\n\r\n\"Unearthing an unissued 1967 Harry Nilsson demo that was originally penned for the Monkees via scholarly research and then recording it as if the past 45 years has not happened is a most wonderful Shindig!-worthy endeavor. Magic Hero vs. Rock People deliver Nilsson's unknown 'I Live In A World' with a performance and production that capture every nuance you would have heard from the maverick himself. Of the remaining four tracks on this seven-inch maxi-EP/mini-LP, '1978' could have been on 'Ariel Ballet', stating the huge influence Harry has on these guys. It's eccentricity and story telling lyricism is a joy.\r\n\r\nElsewhere Magic Hero are redolant of a quirky small town American college band of the period. 'Question of Treason' has a garage band doing The Doors and Strawberry Alarm Clock thing going on -- its slightly off vocals and wobbly, tremeloed guitars adding an incredible air of authenticity.\" -- Jon Mojo Mills, Shindig!
