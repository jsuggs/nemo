Each coin is suspended from a fine chain.  You may choose between copper,silver or gold chain.  All earring hooks are .925 sterling silver.  I like the muted colors with this design the best, but you can choose any color of bead you like, message me for the latest selection.  The design was created for tribal style belydance but work well for everyday too.  They show up nicely through longer hair because of the unique suspension on chain.
