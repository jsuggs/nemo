Certainly the nuts and bolts specifics are offered up here in big, grand, exhaustively detailed fashion, but it's the gem-like quality of the hardware that impresses. These gorgeous baubles and trinkets are stunning to look at and lovingly catalogued in a book that's both a surprisingly informative academic history and the closest a guy can get to a jewelry store catalogue without feeling stupid. The text and archival photography are perfectly complemented by a nice, deservedly oversized format.\" \r\n\r\nProduct Description\r\nThe officially licensed, complete illustrated history of the company and its lures. Rapala lures are now sold in 140 countries and are responsible for more world-record fish than any other lure. It is the dominant company in a hugely popular sport. \"Rapala: Legendary Fishing Lures\" provides a definitive and meticulous record of the development of the unique Rapala lure range, from the 1930's Original \"Wounded Minnow\" carved by Lauri Rapala from pine bark and wrapped with foil to the \"Super Shad Raps\" of today. Leading anglers like Larry Dahlberg, Jan Eggers and Constant Guigo offer commentary on and appreciations of the company's fishing gear. Full of fascinating stories and anecdotes - including the surprising role Marilyn Monroe played in the company's growth - and illustrated from personal, company and historical archives, the book offers detailed product history, record charts and performance information. Created in celebration of what would have been the 100th birthday year of company founder Lauri Rapala, this detailed official history was written with the full cooperation of the family and key associates from around the world. As the best resource on this premier brand, it is a must-have for any fishing enthusiast. \r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nJohn Mitchell resides in Newton Abbot, Devon, UK ","options":[{"id":19660255,"name":"Default","price":18.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60552879/-/RAPALA_BOOK.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60552879/-/RAPALA_BOOK.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3215357,"name":"Rapala Books","permalink":"rapala-books","url":"/category/rapala-books"}]},{"id":6166333,"name":"Rapala Super Shad Rap SSR14 BRP","permalink":"rapala-super-shad-rap-ssr14-brp","position":14,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rapala-super-shad-rap-ssr14-brp","status":"sold-out","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-05-11T20:40:15.000Z","description":"BROWN PERCH\r\nSWIMMING DEPTH 5-9'\r\nPROF.NAGE: 1,5-2,7M\r\n14CM 5-1/2\" \r\n45G 1-5/8OZ\r\n\r\nYear after year, the Super Shad Rap® delivers, with trophy fish taken worldwide from the glacial lakes of Canada to the murky waters of the Amazon.
