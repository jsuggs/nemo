Since 2000 the grounds have been ever evolving as Andrea Zittel's test site for designs for living, where all aspects of day-to-day living—home furniture, clothing, and food all become the sites of investigation in an ongoing endeavor to better understand human nature and the social construction of needs.\r\n\r\nLOGISTICS\r\n\r\nWinter 2013: December 21, 2013, 1 - 3 pm \r\nSpring 2014: April 5, 2014, 1 - 3 pm \r\nSummer 2014: June 21, 2014, 5 - 7 pm \r\nAutumn 2014: October 4, 2014, 1 - 3 pm \r\nWinter 2014: December 20, 2014, 1–3 pm\r\n\r\nTours are approximately 2 hours and are limited to 12 people.\r\n\r\nVisitors meet at the HDTS HQ, located at 6470 Veterans Way in downtown Joshua Tree (just off of Highway 62/29 Palms Highway, one block west of Park Blvd—right around the corner from Pie for the People). The group will depart promptly for A-Z West from the HDTS HQ.\r\n\r\nReservations are made on a first-come-first-served basis, upon payment.
