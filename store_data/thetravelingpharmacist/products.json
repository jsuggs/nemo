Body euphoria, tingling in extremities and CNS. I enjoy encapsulating 5-10 drops and taking capsule orally. Do not ingest essential oils undiluted without a capsule.\r\n\r\nBlack Pepper - Anti-inflammatory, analgesic. Clinical trials have shown components found in black pepper (ie. piperine) can increase the absorption levels of other nutrients (ie. curcumin from turmeric). This oil can be applied topically for pain, diluted into beverages for consumption and vaporized for health/wellness. Super adaptable oil, euphoric with clarity.\r\n\r\nCedar, Atlas - Considering all possible fragrances, if I had a daily scent to WEAR - this would be it!

Very effective, strong euphoria when vaporized. Great for tea, drinks and shared!\r\n\r\nFrankincense - Said to speed body's healing processes and lab studies show that components found in frankincense may support cancer cell apoptosis. Calming, balancing and clarity of the mind. This oil is phenomenal vaporized in conjunction with myrrh. Highly anti-inflammatory.\r\n\r\nLavender - Great for burns, apply undiluted for sunburns. Calms the nervous system, a few drops in a capsule taken internally and make sleep come easier.\r\n\r\nLitsea Cubeba - Also known as tropical verbana, this essential oil provides a sweet treat - I can imagine how yummy Litsea cold cocktails would taste consumed on the playa! Imagine a sweet coconut-like lime beverage on ice... uplifting to the mood ~ tasty flavoring agent!\r\n\r\nMyrrh - This sweet resin oil softens the mind/body/spirit - I use this oil to thicken other lotions/salves and speed their rejuvenation properties. Synergistic with frankincense oil, phenomenal to vaporize alone or in conjunction with frankincense. \"Grounding yet Expansive\" \r\n\r\nOregano or Thyme - High levels of thymol/carvacrol. Very anti-microbial, nice anti-spasmodic. Taken internally during times of infection, or make a hot tea. Do not put on skin without professional supervision, will burn! These oils (esp. oregano) can affect normal gut flora - only take when feeling ill! VERY HARSH when vaporized, I don't recommend this to anyone... (though I have personally found it to be effective for respiratory infections).\r\n\r\nPalo Santo - Literally means sacred wood. Palo Santo is used in ceremonies to clear the energy of a space. Vaporized enhances mood and clarity of mind with soft liquorice notes. Great on top of chocolate (one drop on 1/4 - 1/2 a chocolate bar is plenty), one drop in 8 ounces of hot water for a purifying tea... ENJOY! \r\n\r\nPeppermint - Uplifting, digestive aid, mind-stimulating. Applied topically for headaches, may be abortive.\r\n\r\nRavensara - Crucial for highly dusty area - Use 1 drop in a vaporizer as needed.

This oil is very attractive worn on the body, placed on third eye. Focusing, clarifying, mixes well with cedar atlas, blood orange (see Cosmic Orgasm). Stupendous vaporized!\r\n\r\nTulsi (Holy Basil) - Grown in India - said no negative energy exists in this plant's auric field. Attracts more positive energy & experiences into your life!

IMPORTANT: Upon receipt, transfer Mouthwash from the plastic bottle into a glass bottle - before entering the playa (excessive heat conditions)! \r\n\r\nOrders must be received by Friday, August 16th to be shipped, ready and received for Burning Man! \r\n\r\nNote: a designer box for your oils IS NOT INCLUDED & must be sourced separately if desired!\r\n\r\n<b><u>DETAILED SUMMARY LIST</b></u>\r\n\r\nBitter Orange - Mood enhancing, natural drink flavoring agent. Body euphoria, tingling in extremities and CNS. I enjoy encapsulating 5-10 drops and taking capsule orally. Do not ingest essential oils undiluted without a capsule.\r\n\r\nBlack Pepper - Anti-inflammatory, analgesic. Clinical trials have shown components found in black pepper (ie. piperine) can increase the absorption levels of other nutrients (ie. curcumin from turmeric). This oil can be applied topically for pain, diluted into beverages for consumption and vaporized for health/wellness. Super adaptable oil, euphoric with clarity.\r\n\r\nCedar, Atlas - Considering all possible fragrances, if I had a daily scent to WEAR - this would be it! Soft, buttery, creamy - a gentle masculine energy, almost feminine in nature. Grounding when vaporized, excellent when mixed with citrus in the Essential VAAAPP. A nice addition to bring back to center during difficult experiences (emotionally).\r\n \r\nClary Sage - Reduces cramps, clearly euphoric, calms mood, applied topically or internal ingested for PMS symptoms. Very effective, strong euphoria when vaporized. Great for tea, drinks and shared!\r\n\r\nFrankincense - Said to speed body's healing processes and lab studies show that components found in frankincense may support cancer cell apoptosis. Calming, balancing and clarity of the mind. This oil is phenomenal vaporized in conjunction with myrrh. Highly anti-inflammatory.\r\n\r\nLavender - Great for burns, apply undiluted for sunburns. Calms the nervous system, a few drops in a capsule taken internally and make sleep come easier.\r\n\r\nLitsea Cubeba - Also known as tropical verbana, this essential oil provides a sweet treat - I can imagine how yummy Litsea cold cocktails would taste consumed on the playa! Imagine a sweet coconut-like lime beverage on ice... uplifting to the mood ~ tasty flavoring agent!\r\n\r\nMyrrh - This sweet resin oil softens the mind/body/spirit - I use this oil to thicken other lotions/salves and speed their rejuvenation properties. Synergistic with frankincense oil, phenomenal to vaporize alone or in conjunction with frankincense. \"Grounding yet Expansive\" \r\n\r\nOregano or Thyme - High levels of thymol/carvacrol. Very anti-microbial, nice anti-spasmodic. Taken internally during times of infection, or make a hot tea. Do not put on skin without professional supervision, will burn! These oils (esp. oregano) can affect normal gut flora - only take when feeling ill! VERY HARSH when vaporized, I don't recommend this to anyone... (though I have personally found it to be effective for respiratory infections).\r\n\r\nPalo Santo - Literally means sacred wood. Palo Santo is used in ceremonies to clear the energy of a space. Vaporized enhances mood and clarity of mind with soft liquorice notes. Great on top of chocolate (one drop on 1/4 - 1/2 a chocolate bar is plenty), one drop in 8 ounces of hot water for a purifying tea... ENJOY! \r\n\r\nPeppermint - Uplifting, digestive aid, mind-stimulating. Applied topically for headaches, may be abortive.\r\n\r\nRavensara - Crucial for highly dusty area - Use 1 drop in a vaporizer as needed. Similar to a natural \"Vicks Vapor Rub\", great for colds, flus. Apply on topically to speed the recovery of a herpes outbreak (source unverified?, practical experience has been observed).\r\n\r\nRosemary - Apply on temples with brief 5 second massage for alertness AND may abort headaches. Infuse 1 drop into 8-16 ounces of water, great for hydration - add in some himayalan salt/electrolytes.\r\n\r\nRoyal Sandalwood - High vibrational, simply regal Hawaiian Sandalwood. This oil is very attractive worn on the body, placed on third eye. Focusing, clarifying, mixes well with cedar atlas, blood orange (see Cosmic Orgasm). Stupendous vaporized!\r\n\r\nTulsi (Holy Basil) - Grown in India - said no negative energy exists in this plant's auric field. Attracts more positive energy & experiences into your life! Phenomenal when vaporized, mood enhancing when infused into hot water for tea (1-2 drops in 8-16 ounces of water - let sit for 5 minutes while stirring before drinking)\r\n\r\nYlang-Ylang (Extra, #2 or Complete) - Sweet, sexy. Great for: opening up the heart, jealousy issues, moderate aphrodisiac properties (effective at 4 drops in a capsule OR 1-2 drops each day for several days). Wonderful in drinks (8-16 ounces of water/drop), can be worn slightly diluted (feminine). \r\n\r\nHimayalan Salt Rock - Lick as needed for electrolytes. Some individuals report that water tastes sweet directly after licking salt if they are dehydrated or deficient in electrolytes.\r\n\r\nEssential VAAAPP Vaporizer - Dynamic tool for ingesting various nutritional supplements using the inhalation pathway - oils, concentrates, powders, plant materials are all viable options for use with the Essential VAAAPP!\r\n\r\n\r\n<u>For the Playa, relevant essential oils infused into vaporizer</u>\r\n\r\nBitter Orange - \"Tingly Warm\"\r\nBlack Pepper - \"focusing euphoric\"\r\nBlood Orange - \"Uplifting\"\r\nCedar, Atlas - \"Grounding\"\r\nClary Sage - \"Clearly Euphoric\"\r\nFrankincense + Myrrh \"Third-Eye activating or Grounding yet Expansive\"\r\nLavender - \"relax\" - pleasant flavor, calms nervous system down, relaxes muscles\r\nLitsea Cubeba \"tropical refreshing\"\r\nPalo Santo \"vibration enhancing\"\r\nPink-Pepper \"Powerfully Headchanging\"\r\nRavensara - \"opens up the lungs\" - absolutely crucial, assists the respiratory pathway\r\nRose-Geranium \"Compassion/Forgiveness\"\r\nRosemary - \"mind-stimulating\" \r\nRoyal Sandalwood \"WOW!\"\r\nTulsi - \"positive smiles\"\r\nVetiver \"grounding roots\"\r\nYlang Ylang - \"sexy\" - sweet, exotic - very warming and inviting for play","options":[{"id":41358399,"name":"Default","price":444.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":18.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122782047/-/P1070288.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122782047/-/P1070288.JPG","width":3000,"height":4000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5841948,"name":"Survival Kits","permalink":"survival-kits","url":"/category/survival-kits"}]},{"id":11558874,"name":"Essential Oil Wizardry Playshop Admission Ticket","permalink":"essential-oil-wizardry-playshop-ticket","position":33,"price":147.0,"default_price":147.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/essential-oil-wizardry-playshop-ticket","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-04T00:22:40.000Z","description":"Admission for 1 Essential Oil Wizardry (EOW) Experience\r\n\r\nEach gathering takes place in a unique city to serve local communities with empowerment of wellness using essential oils.

Bright, zesty, and cheery flavor ~\r\n<b>\r\n- Digestive balance (constipation, diarrhea, heartburn)\r\n- Anti-fungal (topical use): NOTE, avoid applying undiluted lotions or wearing citrus oils for prolonged periods of sun exposure – serious potential phototoxicity [sunburn] \r\n- Stimulant (relaxation also possible)\r\n- Anti-septic\r\n- Mood enhancement\r\n- Weight loss (paradoxical appetite stimulation possible)\r\n- Fatigue\r\n</b><u>\r\nDr. Nick Notes</u>\r\n\r\nCitrus aurantium tree is native to tropical Asia and East Africa although is grown in Mediterranean regions, and parts of the US. Citrus aurantium is processed to produce three lovely essential oils, each resulting from different parts of the tree. Bitter orange oil is typically produced using a cold-press method using the peels of the bitter orange. Petigrain oil is produced using the twigs and leaves of the bitter orange tree, while Neroli oil is produced from the blossom of the bitter orange.\r\n\r\nAlso known as sour orange or zhi shi, bitter orange has been used in Chinese medicine as a digestive aid as well as a stimulant, decongestant, and bronchodilator in other alternative medicine practices. Topically applied, it has also been used as an anti-fungal agent for ring worm, jock itch, or athlete’s foot. \r\n\r\nI enjoy using bitter orange oil as a cocktail spritzer, in huge kales or salad (single drop application).  The uplifting, smiley properties are rather awesome while having applications in the social setting at larger doses.  Personally I enjoy about 5-10 drops taken internally in a capsule for social lubrication for the warm, fuzzy experience bitter orange oil produces.  The comparison frequently is likened to a light-to-moderate dose of an entactogen without a crash.  The dose stated may be higher than necessary and I am unsure of this dose’s safety for other individuals, especially with regular usage.  The author is not recommending this usage for others but personally appreciates this application when timing aligns.\r\n\r\nSome successful reports for clinical applications have included suppression of appetite for patients with desire to lose weight.  This oil can be used for mood elevation and should not be used when driving.  Never apply this or other citrus oils before entering sunlight as an elevated risk for phototoxicity exists.  Wait at least 2 hours before stepping into the sun for prolonged exposure.  \r\n\r\nSimple uplifting citrus fragrance, add to spray bottle as an anti-microbial room freshener.   \r\n</b><u>\r\nHow to Use</u>\r\n\r\nUse aromatically in room diffuser or diluted in a spray bottle.  \r\n\r\nNever apply topically undiluted, may cause irritation in some individuals. Stay out of sunlight or risk burn! \r\n\r\nNice additive in food/drink at appropriate dilutions.  Never use more than one or two drops.  \r\n\r\nDelicious vaporized in an Essential VAAAPP at 1 drop using standardized oil vaporization technique for approximately 3-5 seconds. \r\n\r\nNotes: Organic\r\nOrigin: Egypt\r\nVolume: 10ml\r\n\r\nTerpenes (major >90%): d-limonene, myrcene, pinene, ocimene, p-cymene.

Comparing all of my cedar oils, this has to be my favorite. This viscous oil carries a full spectrum of information which spells out a sweet masculine scent with smooth grounding base notes of very elevated qualities.  \r\n\r\nTo use this oil, I take one drop and apply it neat on my neck & chest and rub it around my aura.  Sometimes I place a drop in between my third eye before a meditation or grounding intention.\r\nVaporized, the oil is very calming, grounding yet expansive.  The fragrance of this provides sensual aphrodisiac properties, think \"Making Love\".\r\n\r\nSome of my favorite oil combinations with cedar include Royal Sandalwood & Blood Orange - the combination of these three oils in a VAAAPP vaporizer are a REMARKABLE entry to heaven.  \r\n\r\nIn Peru, a room full of individuals including myself passed around the trio combination for a half hour each taking about 1 minute through an tasty etheric experience which could be compared to a aromatic orgasm.  It's something a person must experience to really understand, I felt in AWE of the beauty of the moment(s).\r\n\r\nI've used this oil directly on warts and it seems to work on safely & easily dissolving them over 1-2 weeks - I am inconsistent with my application, but I imagine that if I used the oil 2-3 times daily for four weeks, I would permanent remove any warts I have on my foot.  \r\n\r\nOne source recommends to avoid use of this oil in pregnancy.  Quite interesting that the Egyptians included cedarwood in the embalming process.  \r\n\r\n<u>How to Use</u> \r\nMay apply neat or combine with carrier oils.  Topical use can cause irritation in some individuals and it is HIGHLY recommended to skin test your compatibility of cedar oil use before using this oil topically. Wonderful oil to appreciate in a vaporizer, very relaxing!

Why? The fragrance is pleasant, playful and inviting for opportunity. Rubbed into a carrier oil and applied to the skin, a warm tingling sensation may be experienced.  I find that this fuzzy-warmth is intensified through dancing & heating the body ~ Stop dancing, tingling subsides. Love this oil as a social lubricant!\r\n\r\nAbsolutely wonderful as an playful odorizer or spicy fragrance on the body. Diluted in carrier oil, Nutmeg is great for rubbing onto sore muscles, arthritic joints or physical areas of stuck energy. \r\n\r\nLet me be very clear, I strongly discourage any internal ingestion of nutmeg oil due its hepatotoxic effects.  While in Peru, I met a traveler who had successfully battled liver cancer who laid it's possible infliction due to intentional consumption of high dose nutmeg in his teenage years. Not for vaporization or internal consumption - see detailed WARNING below. \r\n\r\n<u>How to Use</u> \r\nRecommended for use with a trained practitioner or under a physician's care. DILUTE appropriately before topical application and take care in sensitive individuals - do a small skin test to assure an irritation-free experience. Internal ingestion is not recommended as dose of toxicity for nutmeg oil is undetermined.\r\n\r\n<b>WARNINGS:</b> Myristicin and elemicin (both found in Nutmeg oil) are strong anti-cholinergic agents which pose danger in high amounts. Fabled reports of intentional ingestion of 20+ grams of nutmeg can lead to hallucinations, dry mouth, excitation and confusion with bloodshot eyes and dampered memory. When high doses are ingested, the effects can take several hours for onset and can last several days.  Nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, dizziness and anxiety are other symptoms of nutmeg poisoning.  \r\n\r\nThink of intentional ingestion of high doses of nutmeg to be equivalent to a liver toxic multiple day Datura nightmare. I stay away from internal ingestion of nutmeg oil and strongly suggest you do the same! \r\n\r\n~ Be Blessed ~\r\n\r\nNotes: Organic\r\nOrigin: Sri Lanka\r\nVolume: 10 mL\r\n\r\nTerpenes: trimyristin, myristicin, elemicin, eugenol, safrole.

Two years ago, during winter my health was declining for approximately 1.5 weeks until wheezing & loss of breath was quite apparent around the clock and determined it was time - I NEEDED to see a doctor for antibiotics.  Hopeless, I experimented with a vaporizer during a self-diagnosed third consecutive year of pneumonia using 1 drop of oil of oregano. After vaporizing 1 drop of oregano oil three times on day 1 and twice on day 2, my respiratory system felt about 85-90% of baseline at the end of the 2nd day. This experience enlightened me to the dynamic creativity involved in medicine & healing.\r\n\r\nLet me be very clear, I don't recommend anyone inhale oregano or take it internally undiluted as it is a strong irritant due to its high concentration of phenolic groups. I coughed up nasty gunk from deep in my lungs for up to 5 minutes and getting the temperature \"correct\" can be a challenge (warmer = more irritating). After the coughing spell came a wave of peace & clarity.\r\n\r\nSince then, I use oil of oregano vaporized at the onset of flu/cold symptoms, sore throats or 1 drop diluted in hot water as a tea for food poisoning/upset stomach which generally self-corrects in 1-3 hours when I take it quickly after onset. Recently I've been told that women take oregano tea for their cramps during menses though I haven't had direct experience with that suggestion.  \r\n\r\nThis is an anti-infective powerhouse with high quantity & quality of research information demonstrating it's effectiveness - check it out on Pubmed yourself & be blessed :-)\r\n\r\n</b><u>\r\nHow to Use</u>\r\n\r\nNOTE: Avoid with strong liver disease and do not use undiluted!\r\n\r\nOregano should ALWAYS be diluted in appropriate concentrations as it is too potent for all membranes/skin both internal/external without dilution. Some patients dilute this into lotions or oils for topical fungal infections. \r\n\r\nTo drink, use about 8-16 ounce of hot water, mix 1 drop of oregano oil, stir for about 3 minutes before smelling potent fumes (irritating) and enjoy!\r\n\r\nI won't recommend vaporizing this for others as it's a strong irritant, though it has been quite effective systemically through this mechanism for me, after the coughing spell.\r\n\r\nNotes: Organic\r\nOrigin: Greece, Morocco, Hungary\r\nVolume: 5-10 mL\r\n\r\nTerpenes: Carvacrol, gamma-terpinene, p-cymene, myrcene, a-pinene, B-caryophyllene, Thymol \r\n\r\n~ Be Blessed ~\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/duke/\r\n\r\nSchmidt, E., J.

Ravensara aromatica is antiviral, and provides a clear euphoria making it a perfect tool for combatting respiratory congestion or preparing the body for aerobic exercise. \r\n\r\n<b>\r\n- Anti-viral\r\n- Congestion\r\n- Enhances massage oils\r\n- Respiratory expansion\r\n- Steam baths (+++ Experience)\r\n</b>\r\n<u>\r\nDr. Nick Notes</u>\r\n\r\nRavensara aromatica is described as a natural mentholatum \r\nproduct without any of the petroleum additives.  This EO has true anti-viral properties in addition to true bronchodilatory effects.  Through practical experience, case reports state increased ease of breathing for conditions including asthma & COPD – this is NOT a cure, but perhaps another tool to utilize concurrently amongst other respiratory treatment options.\r\n\r\nRavensara is said to have anti-viral properties. Topically applied directly onto cold sores or herpes simplex, healing speed may increase. May dilute into carrier oil for an aromatic massage oil, great for massages during flu season.  Enjoy adding this to massage oil for a eucalyptus-like tingle – apply to chest, neck & lymph during times of colds/flus.\r\n\r\nPhenomenal to use with an Essential VAAAPP – my favorite usage of Ravensara.  One heated inhalation opens up the lungs and eases respiration.  Can make disposable vaporizer using certain coffee cups w/ lids - fill with hot water and add several drops of ravensara.    \r\n\r\n~ RavINTsara vs. Ravensara? ~\r\n\r\nRavensara aromatica, an evergreen member of the lauraceae family, is native to Madagascar and has an interesting and controversial taxonomic history. Often confused (even by prominent aromatherapists) as being synonymous with Ravintsara, it’s now appears they are two distinct entities. \r\n\r\nRavintsara is not native to Madagascar and is a non-camphor producing chemotype of a Chinese tree named Cinnamonum camphora that was introduced to Madagascar in the 19th century. Ravintsara has been hypothesized to have lost its ability to produce camphor due to the tropical Madagascan climate.  While Ravintsara is high in 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol), Ravensara aromatica contains very little 1,8-cineole.

Inhale deeply for 10 minutes three times daily to ease breathing.\r\n\r\nVAAAPP appropriately anytime you feel the need for ease of breathing.  OR try making a water vaporizer using a coffee cup/lid with hot water [see YouTube Essential Oil Wizardry video for instruction on making your own disposable essential oil vaporizer].\r\n\r\nDilute in carrier oil for a topical massage to knock down colds and ease aching bodies. Try gentle massage over the front and back sides of the thorax region similar to applied areas of a vapor rub.  \r\n\r\nDilute appropriately in occlusive carrier such as cool temperature coconut oil or beeswax. Apply liberally and frequently to cold sore to hasten healing. Unknown whether this oil may be used once or twice daily as prophylactic chapstick/lip balm – try it and let us know if you have any benefits PREVENTING new cold sores with regular use!\r\n\r\nTry applying on shingles or chicken pox directly; applied neat or diluted in carrier oil.\r\n\r\nNotes: Wildcrafted\r\nOrigin: Madagascar\r\nVolume: 5 mL\r\n\r\nMonoterpenes: Alpha-Pinene, Sabinene, Myrcene, Limonene, 1,8-cineole (minor) & azulene [Iso-ledene]\r\n\r\n~ Be Blessed ~\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nJuliani HR, Kapteyn J, Jones D, Koroch AR, Wang M, Charles D, Simon JE.

During my alchemical studies with Paul & Micah, creators of \"Al-Kemi\" Spagyrics we did extensive work with multiple layers of rosemary extractions and I found the therapeutic properties to be quite pronounced.\r\n\r\nAppreciated for its internal & external properties, rosemary is one oil I use frequently.  Stimulates the mood, clarifies the mind, promotes digestion and eliminates flatulence. Vaporized internally, the lungs open, freshen and mind becomes calm and clear. Some individuals with asthma have reported increased ease in their breathing patterns from vaporizing rosemary.\r\n\r\nInfused into water or drinks at 1-2 drops/8-16 ounces is a refreshing drink which feels highly hydrating. One drop of oil rubbed into the temples may have abortive qualities for some headaches.  Great for stimulating circulation as a rubifacent and a great additive to oral care products for its anti-microbial properties.  \r\n\r\nInternet sources claim rosemary oil can stimulate hair follicles though I cannot personally attest to this claim - may be interesting to experiment if I was losing my hair or having it thin.\r\n\r\nScience points to the therapeutic opportunities from Rosemary oil - \r\nTherapeutic Advances in Psychopharmacology published an article about a small open label study suggesting that rosemary can boost cognitive performance (memory, focus/concentration) with its elevated levels of 1,8-cineole in March 2012. Students may find a benefit by breathing in this oil during before studying or during a test :-)\r\n\r\nRosemary oil carries cooling tonic effects and diluted in carrier oil can provide a moisturizing scrub or wash to the face with an enlivening tingle. Apply to sore muscles or stiff joints with the same oil for some possible relief.\r\n\r\nRosemary anyone?\r\n\r\n<u>How to Use</u> \r\nInfuse 1-2 drops in 16 ounces of water or carbonated water for a hydrating drink.  Add to a carrier oil (up to 15 drops/ounce) for a massage oil to sore joints, muscles. Rub diluted oil onto chest for respiratory challenges or onto stomach in clockwise direction with massage during digestive issues. Excellent vaporized at low temperatures, irritating at higher temperatures. Inhale in mornings to increase awareness and stimulate mood.\r\nApply one drop \"neat\" to temples during headache for possible abortive properties.\r\n\r\n~ Be Blessed ~\r\n\r\nNotes: Organic \r\nOrigin: South Africa\r\nVolume: 10 mL\r\n\r\nTerpenes: \r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/759506\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/duke/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ageless.co.za/herb-rosemary.htm\r\n\r\n* These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Upon traveling to Peru, I used this oil frequently when eating food from street vendors and for adapting to altitude sickness. Thyme is said to assist with high altitudes, perhaps by increasing oxygen absorption into the brain. \r\n\r\nAmazingly enough when I traveled to Peru, I had virtually no noticeable differences when I flew from Lima (sea-level - 5,000 feet) to Cusco (~11,000 feet) which I attribute to multiple variables: lion's mane, cordyceps, reishi, coca tea on the plane & ingestion of thyme daily. My lack of physiological differences between the two locations was utterly astounding.\r\n\r\nThyme is quite powerful due to it's high concentration of phenolic groups and comparative to oregano - several studies have analyzed use of thyme oil for preserving food (see links below). Vaporized, red thyme is rather harsh (similar to oregano, though powerful!) and combines well with oregano. I've found Thyme linalol to be quite smooth and effective for cough & cold, helping to expel gunk and clear the infestion.\r\n\r\nWhen I took 1-2 drops in 16 ounces of water at the onset (w/in 30 minues) of abdominal cramps (due to food poisoning), my health improved completely within about 2 hours.  Using red thyme, 1 drop in 16 ounces of hot water while stirring and waiting 5 minutes before drinking (or smelling!) works wonders as a smooth medicinal drink.\r\n</b><u>\r\nHow to Use</u>\r\nThyme is quite powerful. Thyme linalool is smooth enough for vaporization and mixes well into water at dilutions of 1 drop/cup (8 ounces). Take care with the red thyme, it's considerably spicy and can irritate the mucosa if used at inappropriate concentrations!\r\n\r\nHome vaporizing: 1-3 drops of thyme in a small hot of boiling water. Close eyes and softly inhale the steam vapors.\r\n\r\nConsult a physician or aromatherapist before considering to use internally!\r\n\r\nNotes: See Options Below\r\nOrigin: Varies, See Below\r\nVolume: Options Below\r\n\r\nTerpenes: 1,8-cineole, B-caryophyllene, car-3-ene, carvacrol, coumarin, gamma-terpinene, limonene, linalool, p-cymene, thymol\r\n\r\n~ Be Blessed ~\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ars-grin.gov/duke/\r\n\r\n\"Letters in Applied Microbiology\"; Antibacterial Activity of Selected Plant Essential Oils Against Escherichia coli 0157:H7; Burt, SA and Reinders, RD; Vol. 36(3), 2003\r\n\r\n\"Food and Chemical Toxicology\"; Enhanced bactericidal activity of enterocin AS-48 in combination with essential oils, natural bioactive compounds and chemical preservatives against Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat salad.; Antonio CM et. al; September 2009\r\n\r\n\r\n* These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Soft energy with a mild warming & sweet nectar appeal. Ylang-Ylang oil is great for meditation, relaxation, opening up the heart and said to settle jealousy issues. Commonly, I receive pleasurable responses to this oil both immediately and after reports with time - one of my quickest moving products!\r\n\r\nA powerful aphrodisiac: I find that when I drink 1-2 drops of ylang ylang oil infused into 16 ounces of water for 2-3 days, my sex drive increases about 50%.\r\n\r\nThe flavor creates a phenomenal soda when added to carbonated water and infuses well into water (\"Horny Water\") at appropriate dilutions. Vaporized, the oil excites calmly and tantalizes taste buds. Strong fragrance and may be overpowering to sensitive individuals.\r\n \r\nThis is a fractionally distilled oil which means the distillation is fragmented by different times for the extraction process - \"Extra, 1, 2, 3, 4 and Complete\". \"Extra\" carries most of the light & \"fluffy\" aromatic compounds, as it's the first portion of the flower released with lower volatization points - followed by 1, 2, 3, 4. \"Complete\" is a recombination of all the individual fractions to give a delicious full-spectrum representation of the oil. \"2\" is the third fraction separated and carries a slightly more mild balance of the aromatics compared to \"Extra\".\r\n\r\nMy personal favorite is Ylang Ylang \"Extra\", followed by \"Complete\", then \"2\" - \"2\" tends to be my best seller, perhaps since its the most mild & gentle or for the lower expense.

This is the highest quality D-Limonene on the market, ABOVE FOOD GRADE STANDARDS (>95%). This will be shipped in small bottles with droppers to easily add into water for home-friendly cleaners OR to drop into capsules. \r\n\r\n<b>\r\nClinical studies have evaluated safety and efficacy with D-Limonene have evaluated anti-tumor properties, treatment of GERD - check out www.Pubmed.gov for more research! \r\n</b><u>\r\nDr. Nick Notes</u>\r\nD-Limonene is a VERY interesting compound to work with, both internally and externally. I will not be providing much information on using it internally, but the information is definitely out there. My first experience with D-Limonene was about 5 mL (~4 grams D-Limonene) shared in a large pot of miso soup. My partner in bliss that night was informed of the presence of D-Limonene, and not told of what the therapeutic effects were. \r\n\r\nAfter eating dinner, she commented on how great she felt. Next we both simulanteous spoke about how CLEAR we were... coincidence? D-Limonene is awesome - it's found in many OTC acne problems. I take small diluted amounts and rub it onto blemishes. Note that D-Limonene may be an irritant for sensitive individuals and I'm not recommending it's use topically. I will share that I have seen it shift bad acne into about 40-50% clear overnight when applied in small amounts undiluted.\r\n\r\nUsing undiluted internally will irritate the mucosa and is not recommended. When using, I tend to put 1+ mL into capsules and take them internally: I find my mood increases, digestive processes speed up and life seems brighter. Phenomenal stuff!\r\n</b><u>\r\nHow to Use</u>\r\nSkin-irritant, do not touch.\r\n\r\nDirections for Best Results:\r\n\r\nFor all-purpose cleaning applications, mix 2-3 fl. oz of \"High Purity\" D-Limonene with 13-14 oz water in a 16 oz glass spray bottle. Once mixed with water, separation is natural. Always shake well before applying. \r\n\r\nFor heavy stains and residue removal, use neat if necessary. Test all surfaces on hidden area before applying at full strength. Do not use on natural or synthetic rubbers or plastics.
