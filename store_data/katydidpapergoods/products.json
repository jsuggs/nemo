Regardless of what it is called, the content and illustrations appear to be the same, and this is just an alternative version of the widely sought, much coveted, must-own book for fans of illustrator, Charley Harper. \r\n\r\nInside, the book is in pretty good condition, with just a few marks and what could be expected in terms of fading and aging. The pages are still firmly in place. The price reflects that the book no longer has a dust jacket and the exterior is faded and a bit shabby. \r\n\r\nPublished by Paul Hamlyn Ltd for Golden Pleasure Books Ltd, by arrangement with Golden Press Inc., 1963 (second impression)\r\n\r\nFoil stamped cloth hardcover, measures 330 x 260mm\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":10103180,"name":"Default","price":105.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":20.0},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/48859335/-/Biology3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/48859335/-/Biology3.jpg","width":700,"height":700},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/48859599/-/Biology4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/48859599/-/Biology4.jpg","width":700,"height":700},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/48859355/-/Biology5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/48859355/-/Biology5.jpg","width":700,"height":700},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/48859375/-/Biology6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/48859375/-/Biology6.jpg","width":700,"height":700},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/48859399/-/Biology7.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/48859399/-/Biology7.jpg","width":700,"height":700}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1104801,"name":"NEW","permalink":"new","url":"/category/new"},{"id":1303631,"name":"READING","permalink":"reading","url":"/category/reading"},{"id":1126621,"name":"Vintage","permalink":"vintage","url":"/category/vintage"}]},{"id":5086827,"name":"STARBURST TAG & TWINE SETS by Katydid","permalink":"starburst-tag-twine-sets-by-katydid","position":36,"price":7.5,"default_price":7.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/starburst-tag-twine-sets-by-katydid","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-12-15T13:31:00.000Z","description":"These pick 'n mix sets include cute little tags handmade by Katydid out of card offcuts and the edges from starburst labels (sold in packs <a href=\"http://emporium.katydid.co.nz/product/starburst-labels\"> available here</a>).
