OF THE SEWERS and INTO YOUR HOMES!\r\nCannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dweller\r\nor as I call it; \"Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dripper\"\r\n\r\nC.H.U.D (1984)\r\n\"There are monsters lurking beneath the streets; beings that were once human, but have been mutated by radioactive, chemical toxic waste into hideous, flesh-eatingcreatures that prey on the homeless who live in the underground. Given the recent drop in the underground transient population, the creatures have resorted to coming to the surface of the city, through sewer manholes in order to feed on the living\"\r\n<b>\r\nI've always wanted to do a proper tribute  for this movie, and also giving the monster the respect it deserves by capturing the viciousness of what is known to lurk in the sewers! I watched this movie as a kid, and it never scared me, but I have always been fascinated by the idea of half human / half mutant monsters living under the streets, peaking through sewer drains, and snatching people down into their toxic world. THAT idea is terrifying.
