Simply fill with water, open the panels and recline in the sun. At intervals, check if the water is at the desired temperature. The longer you leave it, the hotter it will get. Steam will escape from the lid valve. \r\n\r\nThe Sunrocket is safe to use – the outside does not get hot and can be used in areas where there is a fire ban.  \r\n\r\nOnce water is hot, you can use it immediately to drink, cook, clean or rehydrate food.
