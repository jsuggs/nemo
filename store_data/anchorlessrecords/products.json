Albums that influenced you when you were a teenager? The ones that you ended up reading all the lyrics, and then, your life was suddenly meaning something different because of them? These albums that made you feel like leaving home and protest against everything that pissed you off? If there is a ton of albums in the world that fit this profile, there is not a whole lot from Québec. One of these albums is without hesitation The Art Of Arrogance. From the motorbike noises to Bush's speech, this album pushed us off our boundaries so many times. The art of arrogance, we saw it like a way of life that we were already cherishing, but in the form of a music album, it was pretty much summing all our bad moments and the anger that we had against conformists and politicians. It's been already 10 years since the album came out and it is still an excellent one to start a wild night in Montreal. Perhaps we can now rephrase... Montreal can bleed again! All that to say, we are really happy to announce the repressing of one of the most cult album coming out of the punk rock Quebec scene. In collaboration with Housebreaker (Canada), Anchorless Records (USA) and Flix Records (Europe), a repress of 500 vinyls will see the day on December 10th.\r\n\r\nWE HAVE LIMITED NUMBERS AND EXCLUSIVE BROWN VINYL","options":[{"id":48048246,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":13.99,"amount_with_others":13.99,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.99,"amount_with_others":3.99,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":21.99,"amount_with_others":21.99}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127518987/-/The-Sainte-Catherines-The-Art-of-Arrogance-10-Year-Anniversary.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127518987/-/The-Sainte-Catherines-The-Art-of-Arrogance-10-Year-Anniversary.png","width":1800,"height":1800}],"artists":[{"id":45041,"name":"The Sainte Catherines","permalink":"the-sainte-catherines","url":"/artist/the-sainte-catherines"}],"categories":[{"id":1646135,"name":"PRE SALE","permalink":"pre-sale","url":"/category/pre-sale"},{"id":495971,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":13499070,"name":" ALR:024 CHUMPED - ST  CDep/12\" COLOR VINYL!!!","permalink":"alr-024-chumped-st-cdep-12-color-vinyl","position":2,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/alr-024-chumped-st-cdep-12-color-vinyl","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-11T15:51:12.000Z","description":"DEBUT 12\" EP from Brooklyn's Chumped.

This leaves you sitting there on a cold leather couch in your underwear playing wii, bowling, drinking stale MGD, and wondering where the hell your friends are. Dude…you got chumped. CHUMPED is a female-fronted indie-punk band comprised of four friends from Brooklyn, NY who like to drink and write songs about feelings. Drawing influence from the power pop structure and slacker sensibility of SUPERCHUNK, the poetic substance of JAWBREAKER, along with the urgency and energy of RVIVR, they write songs that are emotive, powerful and catchy as hell. CHUMPED’s Self-Titled EP is the culmination of formative heartbreaks, quarter-life crises, and an acute penchant for being young and dumb. They really look forward to playing a show near you sometime maybe, they guess.","options":[{"id":43249983,"name":"LP","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43249986,"name":"CD","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.99,"amount_with_others":6.99,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.99,"amount_with_others":1.99,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.99,"amount_with_others":19.99}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124139115/-/CHUMPEDCOVER_for_ILD.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124139115/-/CHUMPEDCOVER_for_ILD.jpg","width":1554,"height":1554},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125981727/-/IMG-20131016-00347.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125981727/-/IMG-20131016-00347.jpg","width":2592,"height":1944}],"artists":[{"id":232470,"name":"Chumped","permalink":"chumped","url":"/artist/chumped"}],"categories":[{"id":1646135,"name":"PRE SALE","permalink":"pre-sale","url":"/category/pre-sale"},{"id":495971,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":13498725,"name":"ALR:023 TEEN AGERS - \"I HATE IT\"  CD/LP COLOR VINYL!!!","permalink":"alr-023-teen-agers-i-hate-it-cd-lp-color-vinyl","position":3,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/alr-023-teen-agers-i-hate-it-cd-lp-color-vinyl","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-11T15:34:35.000Z","description":"PRE-SALE IS LIVE FOLKS!!!!FOR THE DEBUT LP FROM ORLANDO'S TEEN AGERS.

Anchorless Records to donate all profits to The Syrentha Savio Endowment (SSE) Non-Profit Organization providing financial assistance to underprivileged breast cancer patients. Boasting a lineup of punk and alternative rock's most indie minded artists, proudly wearing their hearts on their sleeves while effortlessly blending Punk Rock with Americana, this new homage to the spirit of Johnny Cash is good for the soul and for our communities. Anchorless Records will be donating all the profits of All Aboard: A Tribute To Johnny Cash to the Syrentha Savio Endowment (SSE), a non-profit organization that provides financial assistance to underprivileged women who cannot afford the expense of fighting breast cancer. Features debut solo performances from Russ Rankin (former front man of seminal punk band Good Riddance), Joe McMahon of Smoke or Fire, and Ben Nichols of Lucero. The tribute also boasts The Bouncing Souls and MXPX, both of whom are Warped Tour mainstays and fixtures in the Punk community. The range of songs chosen include Johnny Cash's first single (The Flatliner's covering \"Cry, Cry, Cry\") and travels through a long and unparalleled career to the last single released by the Man in Black, \"God's Gonna Cut You Down\" performed by The Gaslight Anthem. It is our hope that through this record we are able to introduce a new generation of music fans to the songs and importance of Johnny Cash via their favorite artists. The liner notes include quotes from each artist, expressing their feelings on the impact Johnny Cash has had on them both musically and personally.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n1.
