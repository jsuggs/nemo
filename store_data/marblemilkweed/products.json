We've received so many requests to keep this serum in stock year round...after all, Spring is a state of mind!\r\n\r\nThis serum is formulated with organic jojoba oil, organic sweet almond, and organic cold-pressed evening primrose oil as its base. \r\n\r\nJojoba is one of the most nourishing oils for the skin, and one of the most easily absorbed. It's composition is very closely related to the oils our skin naturally produces. \r\n\r\nSweet almond oil is rich in fatty acids and is a wonderful skin-softener. Evening primrose oil has anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and is greatly soothing to the skin. \r\n\r\nThe serum is enriched with botanicals like chamomile, neroli, organic geranium and wild carrot oils that nourish the skin and provide aromatherapy benefits. \r\n\r\nNeroli is known for its calming and mood-lifting properties, chamomile soothes and geranium brings cheer. Vitamin E is a natural antioxidant - ours comes from a non-GMO source, and it is added to the blend to protect the integrity of the other oils. \r\n\r\nUse a dab of this serum on the face, especially under the eyes before going to bed, to reap its regenerative properties while you sleep. Or use it on the neck and hands anytime as a moisturizer.\r\n\r\n{one 1/2 ounce glass dropper bottle of spring tonic serum}\r\n\r\ningredients:\r\norganic jojoba oil, organic sweet almond oil, organic evening primrose oil, german chamomile essential oil, neroli essential oil, organic geranium essential oil, wild carrot seed oil, non-GMO vitamin e\r\n\r\nAll Marble & Milkweed products are made by hand and with love in New York City!\r\n","options":[{"id":39152163,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121711368/-/2oz_vcso.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121711368/-/2oz_vcso.jpg","width":1768,"height":2210}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3347119,"name":"skin care","permalink":"skin-care","url":"/category/skin-care"},{"id":3347171,"name":"skin care - serums","permalink":"skin-care-serums","url":"/category/skin-care-serums"}]},{"id":6245205,"name":"rose & chamomile facial scrub - 5.5 oz","permalink":"rose-chamomile-facial-scrub","position":15,"price":28.0,"default_price":28.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rose-chamomile-facial-scrub","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-05-21T18:00:23.000Z","description":"Our marvelous signature facial scrub. Organic oats and organic pink rose petals exfoliate gently in a base of raw local honey, while organic sesame and rosehip seed oils nourish and protect. This scrub is especially good for sensitive and \"wise\" skin because of the addition of rose otto and german chamomile essential oils, which soothe and promote elasticity, while also lending their gentle fragrance to the blend. \r\n\r\nRosehip seed oil is very healing, and contains high levels of vitamin A, which promotes skin cell regeneration and is often used for healing skin stressed by time and the elements. Sesame oil contains vitamin E, and has been a favorite ingredient in Ayurvedic skin care for thousands of years. \r\n\r\nThe raw honey base makes this scrub very thick. To use, dip a clean spoon into the jar and take out the amount you need, massage between the palms to warm and soften, adding a small amount of warm water, if necessary to form a cleansing paste. Smooth the scrub on using a circular motion and rinse gently with warm water. Try to avoid getting water into the jar, as it contains no preservatives.

Oats are soothing and cooling to the skin, reducing redness and quelling irritation, while rose & chamomile tone, calm and balance the skin, and provide the most gentle exfoliation. They also lend our cleansing grains their delicate floral scent. \r\n\r\nMilk is naturally full of Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs), which help the skin naturally let go of dead skin cells, and it is replete with nourishing proteins.\r\n\r\nRhassoul clay from Morocco is universally admired for its cleansing properties. Impressively absorptive & detoxifying, it's a wonderful treatment for troubled skin. Its use improves elasticity & texture and the clay's mineral content (silica, magnesium, potassium and calcium) feeds the skin.\r\n\r\nTo use: Always dip into your grains with a clean, dry spoon to extend their lifespan. Add a tiny bit of water to a small spoonful of cleansing grains in your palm to make a paste. Massage onto wet skin, then rinse with warm water. To use as a masque, simply mix as directed, massage onto skin and leave on for desired time, perhaps 15-20 minutes. Rinse with warm water. To use in conjunction with our Rose & Chamomile Facial Tonic, substitute the tonic for water when mixing the grains. Or simply use the tonic after you've rinsed the grains off to finish your treatment.\r\n\r\nOur cleansing grains are finely textured enough for everyday use and full of soothing botanicals, but as with any product that's new to you, try a small patch test first to ensure its compatibility with your skin.\r\n\r\n{one 1 oz jar of cleansing grains}\r\n\r\ningredients: \r\norganic oats, organic rose petals, organic chamomile flowers, Rhassoul clay, organic milk powder\r\n\r\nAll Marble & Milkweed products are made by hand and with love, in New York City!","options":[{"id":39016155,"name":"Default","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121887651/-/rose___chamomile_cleansing_grains_1oz_vsco_for_big_cartel.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121887651/-/rose___chamomile_cleansing_grains_1oz_vsco_for_big_cartel.jpg","width":1024,"height":1280}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3347119,"name":"skin care","permalink":"skin-care","url":"/category/skin-care"},{"id":3347141,"name":"skin care - rose & chamomile collection","permalink":"skin-care-rose-chamomile-collection","url":"/category/skin-care-rose-chamomile-collection"}]},{"id":8239599,"name":"13.5 oz double-wall glass teapot","permalink":"13-5-oz-double-wall-glass-teapot","position":19,"price":48.0,"default_price":48.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/13-5-oz-double-wall-glass-teapot","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-27T20:59:57.000Z","description":"This exquisite handblown glass teapot comes to us from the Five Mountains Tea Company in San Francisco.

Oats are soothing and cooling to the skin, reducing redness and quelling irritation, while rose & chamomile tone, calm and balance the skin, and provide the most gentle exfoliation. They also lend our cleansing grains their delicate floral scent. \r\n\r\nMilk is naturally full of Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs), which help the skin naturally let go of dead skin cells, and it is replete with nourishing proteins.\r\n\r\nRhassoul clay from Morocco is universally admired for its cleansing properties. Impressively absorptive & detoxifying, it's a wonderful treatment for troubled skin. Its use improves elasticity & texture and the clay's mineral content (silica, magnesium, potassium and calcium) feeds the skin.\r\n\r\nTo use: Always dip into your grains with a clean, dry spoon to extend their lifespan. Add a tiny bit of water to a small spoonful of cleansing grains in your palm to make a paste. Massage onto wet skin, then rinse with warm water. To use as a masque, simply mix as directed, massage onto skin and leave on for desired time, perhaps 15-20 minutes. Rinse with warm water. To use in conjunction with our Rose & Chamomile Facial Tonic, substitute the tonic for water when mixing the grains. Or simply use the tonic after you've rinsed the grains off to finish your treatment.\r\n\r\nOur cleansing grains are finely textured enough for everyday use and full of soothing botanicals, but as with any product that's new to you, try a small patch test first to ensure its compatibility with your skin.\r\n\r\n{one 2 oz jar of cleansing grains}\r\n\r\ningredients: \r\norganic oats, organic rose petals, organic chamomile flowers, Rhassoul clay, organic milk powder\r\n\r\nAll Marble & Milkweed products are made by hand and with love, in New York City!","options":[{"id":20230319,"name":"Default","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.75,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":6.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124621827/-/r_c_cleansing_grains_2oz_(large)_vsco.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124621827/-/r_c_cleansing_grains_2oz_(large)_vsco.jpg","width":1024,"height":1280},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/62360631/-/IMG_1806.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/62360631/-/IMG_1806.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3347119,"name":"skin care","permalink":"skin-care","url":"/category/skin-care"},{"id":3347141,"name":"skin care - rose & chamomile collection","permalink":"skin-care-rose-chamomile-collection","url":"/category/skin-care-rose-chamomile-collection"}]},{"id":7258931,"name":"tea sampler","permalink":"tea-sampler","position":29,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tea-sampler","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-16T02:46:33.000Z","description":"A lovely way to try our tea blends, our sampler includes 4 single-cup packets. \r\n\r\nChoose 4 blends: \r\n\r\n// Rose & Chamomile White Tea \r\n\r\n// Green Glow Elixir \r\n\r\n// Modern Chai No. 1\r\n \r\n// Modern Chai No. 2\r\n\r\n// Fleurs + Cacao \r\n\r\n// Spring Tonic Tea\r\n\r\n// Camellia Blossom\r\n\r\n// Forest Tea \r\n\r\nPlease specify which 4 blends you'd like in the notes box when completing your order.\r\n\r\nAll Marble & Milkweed products are made by hand and with love, in New York City!","options":[{"id":22984853,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129452007/-/tea_sampler_for_bg_cartel.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129452007/-/tea_sampler_for_bg_cartel.jpg","width":337,"height":422}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3347121,"name":"tea","permalink":"tea","url":"/category/tea"}]},{"id":7079255,"name":"rose & chamomile facial tonic - 4 oz","permalink":"rose-chamomile-facial-tonic","position":30,"price":28.0,"default_price":28.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rose-chamomile-facial-tonic","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-28T01:51:54.000Z","description":"An astonishingly simple blend of exquisitely pure ingredients, our Tonic is based on wildcrafted witch hazel, distilled in small batches by Wild Root Botanicals in Bellingham, WA. Organic Bulgarian rose & organic chamomile hydrosols complete the blend, infusing it with their healing properties and a divine floral fragrance.\r\n\r\nWitch hazel is richly nourishing ingredient for the skin and has astringent, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antibacterial, and antifungal properties, which make it an excellent choice for all skin types. It refreshes and tones and is wonderful for cleansing and balancing oily skin.\r\n\r\nOrganic Rose hydrosol is the result of the steam distillation process, which yields both the precious rose essential oil and the hydrosol. It's an excellent regulator of oil production while helping to balance the pH of the skin. It also smells utterly marvelous! Organic Chamomile hydrosol is a powerful anti-inflammatory with cooling & soothing properties. It does wonders for sensitive skin.\r\n\r\nto use:\r\nSweep a small amount of Facial Tonic on a cotton puff across the skin after cleansing, or to remove make-up. Can also be used at any time during the day to renew and refresh. \r\n\r\nBecause hydrosols are extraordinarily delicate & powerful plant essences, we do recommend that you store this tonic in the fridge, or at least a cool spot below 75F.

It's best used after removing any make-up.\r\n\r\nTo use: Massage a small amount of cleansing nectar into damp skin, then rinse with warm water.\r\n\r\n{one 2 fl.oz. glass bottle of cleansing nectar}\r\n\r\ningredients: raw local honey, organic vegetable glycerine, organic essential oil of rose otto, organic essential oil of german chamomile\r\n\r\nAll Marble & Milkweed products are made by hand and with love, in New York City!\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":39012303,"name":"Default","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.75,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121877472/-/rose___chamomile_cleansing_nectar_2oz_vsco_for_big_cartel.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121877472/-/rose___chamomile_cleansing_nectar_2oz_vsco_for_big_cartel.jpg","width":1024,"height":1280}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3347119,"name":"skin care","permalink":"skin-care","url":"/category/skin-care"},{"id":3347141,"name":"skin care - rose & chamomile collection","permalink":"skin-care-rose-chamomile-collection","url":"/category/skin-care-rose-chamomile-collection"}]},{"id":7258899,"name":"rose & chamomile mini facial set","permalink":"rose-chamomile-mini-facial-set","position":59,"price":24.0,"default_price":24.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rose-chamomile-mini-facial-set","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-16T02:41:10.000Z","description":"Our mini facial set is the perfect companion for a few days away.
