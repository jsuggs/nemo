In January 2012 Isaac suffered a cardiac arrest at basketball practice and was sent from Salem to OHSU Doernbecher Children’s Hospital, where doctors discovered a previously undetected abnormality that is one of the most common causes for heart attacks in young people.\r\n\r\nAfter recovering from open-heart surgery, Isaac was invited by OHSU Doernbecher to be part of the 2012 Freestyle program. During his rehabilitation from surgery, he began sketching designs for an Air Jordan V Retro, highlighting his interests and experiences. He also became well enough to don his jersey and watch his basketball team from the bleachers, occasionally getting to shoot around during breaks in the game. Then in April 2012, 12-year-old Isaac tragically suffered a second heart attack, and did not survive.\r\n\r\nDeeply saddened by his tragic passing but inspired by his passion and spirit, Nike and OHSU Doernbecher invited Isaac’s family to work together to finish the design that Isaac had started. Using Isaac’s original sketches as a guide and some more his parents found, they created a design reflecting Isaac’s vision and incorporating design elements that represented the things that mattered most to him in his life:\r\n\r\nIsaac’s jersey numbers, 9 for baseball on the upper of the left shoe and 31 for basketball on the right.\r\nThe inside of the tongue features Isaac’s initials, and the dates of his birth and passing.\r\nSeveral parts of the shoe glow in the dark, including the eyelets, lace toggle, outsole, Nike Air unit and quarter panels.\r\nThe upper features the words of a poem in black light ink that Isaac wrote just a day before he passed away. Some of the words include: “My team. My family. We are brothers forever. No matter what.”\r\nEach pair includes a flashlight to complete the glow-in-the-dark effect, inspired by Isaac’s love of video games.\r\n\r\n“We’ve been honored to work with Isaac’s family and thank them for their courage to complete the project in the name of their son and to support the much-needed fundraising efforts for Doernbecher,” said Michael Doherty, Nike’s Global Creative Presentation Director and member of the Doernbecher Foundation Board of Directors.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Doherty and his then-teenage son proposed the idea of the Doernbecher Freestyle Program as a creative way to raise awareness and funds for the children’s hospital, while empowering its young patients through design.\r\n\r\nLimited quantities of the Doernbecher Air Jordan V Retro will be sold on nike.com and at Nike retail locations across the country beginning  with all proceeds from sales of the shoes benefiting OHSU Doernbecher. To date, the program has raised more than $6 million to help expand pioneering research, support clinical care, purchase state-of-the-art equipment, recruit new experts and help cover the cost of care for families most in need.\r\n\r\nThe Doernbecher Freestyle Project partners Nike designers and developers with patients from OHSU Doernbecher Children’s Hospital who have battled serious illness to create shoes that reflect their unique personalities and experiences.

For the last five years, the Doernbecher x Air Jordan has been the undisputed standout of the bunch, with last year’s Superman-inspired Air Jordan IV being one of the more coveted sneaker releases of the year. This year, Jordan Brand has selected the Air Jordan IX – currently one of the trending Air Jordan models amidst the “Kilroy Pack” and other highlight releases; designed by Oswaldo Jimenez, the Air Jordan IX Doernbecher features a distinct feather detail that is derived from Oswaldo’s nickname of “Pollito”, which translates to “Chicken Little”. This is also the first-ever Air Jordan IX to feature a translucent outsole. \r\n\r\n\r\nAIR JORDAN IX After leading the Chicago Bulls to three straight NBA Championships, Michael Jordan retired from pro basketball to pursue his dream of playing baseball. MJ signed a contract with minor league baseball's Birmingham Barons in February of 1994. He wore number 45 and played outfield for the White Sox affiliate.\r\n\r\nStill, the Air Jordan basketball shoe line moved forward. Tinker Hatfield once again designed the AJ IX, with a graphic design assist by Mark Smith. And although MJ never wore the original Air Jordan IX on the basketball court, the shoes could be seen on the Michael Jordan statue outside the United Center in Chicago. (Jordan wore the Air Jordan IX baseball cleats during his brief minor league baseball stint in 1994.) \r\n\r\nAlthough Michael Jordan never wore the original Air Jordan IX in an NBA game, Penny Hardaway, Kendall Gill, BJ Armstrong and Mitch Richmond each wore exclusive versions during the 1993-1994 NBA season. High-schooler LeBron James wore a white/green/gold St. Vincent St. Mary's version of the IX during his 2003 high school senior year. \r\n\r\nThe upper of the AJ IX was constructed of leather, nubuck and mesh. The nubuck area wrapped around the toe and contained reflective sparkles in three out of the four original color styles. The inner booty sock liner carried over from the previous two Air Jordans. A one-pull lacing system — a new innovation at the time — was introduced with the AJ IX. \r\n\r\nA polyurethane midsole in a tooth-like design sat atop the rubber outsole. A molded plastic globe graphic with a Jumpman logo appeared on the back of the IX. The sole of the shoes featured words in different languages, symbolizing Michael Jordan going global. \r\n\r\nMJ retired from baseball on March 10, 1995 and planned a return to the NBA. Air Jordan fans around the world couldn't wait to see the latest Air Jordan design.","options":[{"id":26174292,"name":"Size 9","price":699.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":90.0,"amount_with_others":20.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81729021/-/doernbecher-air-jordan-9-release-date.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81729021/-/doernbecher-air-jordan-9-release-date.jpg","width":570,"height":425},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95909193/-/580892_170_A.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95909193/-/580892_170_A.jpg","width":620,"height":382},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81728997/-/000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000_original.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81728997/-/000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000_original.jpg","width":570,"height":425},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81729057/-/doernbecher-air-jordan-ix-gallery.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81729057/-/doernbecher-air-jordan-ix-gallery.jpg","width":900,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4936774,"name":"Sneakers","permalink":"sneakers","url":"/category/sneakers"}]},{"id":13536186,"name":"Nike Air Max 95 Doernbecher Armstrong","permalink":"nike-air-max-95-doernbecher","position":3,"price":299.99,"default_price":299.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nike-air-max-95-doernbecher","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-13T04:11:01.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":43385433,"name":"Size 8.5","price":299.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":90.0,"amount_with_others":20.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124231704/-/nike-doernbecher-2007-retro-air-max-95-by-mike-armstrong-01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124231704/-/nike-doernbecher-2007-retro-air-max-95-by-mike-armstrong-01.jpg","width":570,"height":450},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124231839/-/nike-doernbecher-2007-retro-air-max-95-by-mike-armstrong-03-570x465.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124231839/-/nike-doernbecher-2007-retro-air-max-95-by-mike-armstrong-03-570x465.jpg","width":570,"height":465},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124231713/-/nike-doernbecher-2007-retro-air-max-95-by-mike-armstrong-05-570x480.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124231713/-/nike-doernbecher-2007-retro-air-max-95-by-mike-armstrong-05-570x480.jpg","width":570,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124231716/-/nike-doernbecher-2007-retro-air-max-95-by-mike-armstrong-06-570x435.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124231716/-/nike-doernbecher-2007-retro-air-max-95-by-mike-armstrong-06-570x435.jpg","width":570,"height":435},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124231707/-/nike-doernbecher-2007-retro-air-max-95-by-mike-armstrong-02-570x429.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124231707/-/nike-doernbecher-2007-retro-air-max-95-by-mike-armstrong-02-570x429.jpg","width":570,"height":429}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4936774,"name":"Sneakers","permalink":"sneakers","url":"/category/sneakers"}]},{"id":10626136,"name":"Supreme The Misfits Crimson Ghost Tee","permalink":"supreme-the-misfits-crimson-ghost-tee","position":4,"price":59.99,"default_price":59.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/supreme-the-misfits-crimson-ghost-tee","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-18T15:58:46.000Z","description":"Supreme/The Misfits®\r\n\r\nFounded in 1977 in Lodi, New Jersey by singer and songwriter Glenn Danzig; The Misfits® are an American rock band often recognized as the founders of the horror punk subgenre, blending punk rock and other musical influences with horror film themes and imagery.

Misfits®\r\n\r\nFounded in 1977 in Lodi, New Jersey by singer and songwriter Glenn Danzig; The Misfits® are an American rock band often recognized as the founders of the horror punk subgenre, blending punk rock and other musical influences with horror film themes and imagery. They released the \"Horror Business\" single in June 1979, the cover of which featured a skeletal figure inspired by a poster for the 1946 film serial The Crimson Ghost. The skeletal figure became a mascot for the band. \r\n\r\nThe Misfits® disbanded in 1983 and Danzig went on to form Samhain and then the eponymously-named Danzig. Several albums of reissued and previously unreleased material were issued after the group's dissolution, and their music became influential to punk rock, heavy metal, and alternative rock music of the late 1990s and early 2000s.","options":[{"id":33303064,"name":"Size M Black","price":59.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":33303067,"name":"Size M

His creativity and innovative thinking continued on several levels with the design of the Air Jordan V. The shoe featured an asymmetrical collar and the cut of the shoe was higher than the previous two Air Jordans. The V still had the sculpted midsole, but included a new pattern inspired by a World War II fighter plane. \r\n\r\nThe visible air unit carried over from the III and IV, as did the use of mesh from the AJ IV. The outsole of the V was made of translucent rubber while very thin, clear rubber adorned the side panel of the upper and the lower part of the tongue. \r\n\r\nCertain colorways of the AJ V used reflective 3M material on the tongue — a nice innovation to the Jordan line. On every Jordan V, an \"AIR JORDAN\" patch was stitched on the inside of the tongue. \r\n\r\nAnother first was the Grape Purple /Emerald colorway that had never been seen on a basketball shoe. \r\n\r\nThe heel of the AJ V was built with strong ankle support. The heel featured a stitched \"NIKE AIR\" logo with a Swoosh underneath. Lace locks were included with the Air Jordan V for added lockdown. \r\n\r\nThe V continued the great success of the Air Jordan line and came at a good time as Michael Jordan was hitting his stride in the NBA.\r\n\r\nJordan Brand has re-released the Air Jordan V in multiple colorways, including the original Grape, Fire Red and Black/Silver colorways as well as the White/Royal/Maze color inspired by Jordan's high school alma mater, Laney High.\r\n\r\nWhile rocking the Air Jordan V in 1990, Michael Jordan made his sixth straight All-Star game appearance, won his fourth straight league scoring title and was named to the All-NBA First Team and All-Defensive First Team. Although the Bulls lost to the Pistons in the 1990 Conference Finals, Jordan was on the verge of one of the NBA's greatest dynasties — and driving the footwear industry to new heights.","options":[{"id":36759663,"name":"Size 8","price":214.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28537703,"name":"Size 8.5","price":259.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":45.0,"amount_with_others":25.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89484317/-/air-jordan-v-5-fire-red-release-date-info-600x400.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89484317/-/air-jordan-v-5-fire-red-release-date-info-600x400.jpg","width":600,"height":400},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89484254/-/air-jordan-5-gs-White-Fire-Red-Black-02.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89484254/-/air-jordan-5-gs-White-Fire-Red-Black-02.jpg","width":540,"height":387},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89484266/-/air-jordan-5-gs-White-Fire-Red-Black-03.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89484266/-/air-jordan-5-gs-White-Fire-Red-Black-03.jpg","width":540,"height":387},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89484278/-/air-jordan-5-gs-White-Fire-Red-Black-05.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89484278/-/air-jordan-5-gs-White-Fire-Red-Black-05.jpg","width":540,"height":387},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89484386/-/air-jordan-5-gs-White-Fire-Red-Black-01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89484386/-/air-jordan-5-gs-White-Fire-Red-Black-01.jpg","width":600,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4936774,"name":"Sneakers","permalink":"sneakers","url":"/category/sneakers"}]},{"id":7229757,"name":"Air Jordan 6 \"Olympic\"","permalink":"air-jordan-6-olympic","position":24,"price":260.0,"default_price":260.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/air-jordan-6-olympic","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-12T23:43:32.000Z","description":"White/Midnight Navy-Vrsty Red\r\n#384664 130\r\nRelease Date: July,7,2012\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Kixland","options":[{"id":22895629,"name":"Size 8.5","price":260.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71122873/-/air-jordan-6-olympic-2012-384664-130.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71122873/-/air-jordan-6-olympic-2012-384664-130.jpg","width":700,"height":440},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71122893/-/air-jordan-vi-6-olympic-3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71122893/-/air-jordan-vi-6-olympic-3.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71122979/-/air-jordan-vi-6-olympic-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71122979/-/air-jordan-vi-6-olympic-2.jpg","width":800,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4936774,"name":"Sneakers","permalink":"sneakers","url":"/category/sneakers"}]},{"id":11816208,"name":"Air Jordan 7 \"Raptors\"","permalink":"air-jordan-7-raptors","position":25,"price":190.0,"default_price":190.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/air-jordan-7-raptors","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-16T03:03:33.000Z","description":"Black/Tr Rd-Drk Chrcl-Clb Prpl\r\n#304775 018\r\nRelease Date: Sep 2012\r\n\r\nAIR JORDAN VII In 1992, following the success of the Air Jordan VI and Michael Jordan's first NBA Championship, Tinker Hatfield continued his innovation in the Air Jordan line with the Air Jordan VII — which was inspired partially by West African Tribal culture and partially by the Nike Huarache basketball shoe line.

He wore the \"Chicago\" colorway of the Air Jordan X. \r\n\r\nThe Air Jordan X's design was very simplistic. The original \"steel\" version was designed with a stitched toe piece. Michael didn't like the toe piece, so all subsequent colorways of the AJ X had a clean toe cap. \r\n\r\nThe X featured a padded collar, pull tab at the heel and an elastic band lacing system. The midsole of the X was constructed of lightweight Phylon connected to a rubber outsole. The outsole listed Jordan's career achievements on alternating stripes.\r\n\r\nEight original colorways of the AJX were released.

During the Air Jordan XI’s original retail arrival, the low-top version was nowhere to be seen, as Nike opted for the significantly modified “IE” version instead (no patent leather with triangular vents on the upper). The more traditional form of the Air Jordan Low definitely existed back then in PE format, however, showing up on the feet of Michael Jordan during summer-time offseason appearances and strangely enough, in the pages of vintage sneaker catalogs from Japan, among other sightings. But it wasn’t until a few years after the original Air Jordan XI campaign, that the patent toe’d low version would finally available.\r\n\r\n \r\nThe whole Air Jordan Retro process gave the XI Low a brand new life. Of course, that life has yet to really transfer any of the OG Air Jordan XI colorways over just yet. The 2001 releases rolled out a slew of new colorways (Snakeskin, Carolina Blue, etc.), and last year’s re-introduction focused on a clean tonal white with a red outsole, coming the closest to any sort of Chicago Bulls palette. For 2013, Jordan Brand takes a step closer to the original Air Jordan XI colorways with the White/Black-True Red – shown here in all its glory.

Sole Collector magazine voted the XI the top shoe of all time. \r\n\r\nTinker Hatfield's design for the Jordan XI featured patent leather for the first time on a basketball shoe. The upper was constructed of a polymer–coated, thin nylon ballistic mesh material. The collar and tongue were padded for max ankle comfort. The translucent outsole lay atop a full-length carbon fiber shank plate which provided extra spring. The shoe also included a full-length Air-Sole unit for maximum cushioning. \r\n\r\nMichael wore the black/varsity royal/white version in the movie Space Jam. Jordan also wore the same \"Air Jordan XI Space Jam\" shoe in the NBA playoffs. Many Brand Jordan athletes worn the AJ XI over the years; Ray Allen sported a white/green/gold version during the Celtic's 2008-09 season. \r\n\r\nWhen the XI was made, MJ was quoted as saying someone would one day wear them with a tuxedo. Months later Boyz II Men appeared at an awards show wearing tuxes and AJ XIs. \r\n\r\nWhile wearing the Air Jordan XI, Michael was elected an All-Star for the 10th time, the All-Star game MVP for the second time, scoring champion for the eighth time, and was again league MVP. The Bulls won the NBA title for the fourth time, and as he was for the previous three championships, Jordan was again the Finals MVP.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/kixland","options":[{"id":22895085,"name":"Size 8.5","price":400.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70952715/-/0e0fe_Screen-Shot-2011-12-22-at-10.36.53-PM-440x285.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70952715/-/0e0fe_Screen-Shot-2011-12-22-at-10.36.53-PM-440x285.png","width":440,"height":285},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70952779/-/air-jordan-xi-concord-summary.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70952779/-/air-jordan-xi-concord-summary.jpg","width":570,"height":450},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70952763/-/air-jordan-11-retro-concord-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70952763/-/air-jordan-11-retro-concord-2.jpg","width":620,"height":443},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70952707/-/air-jordan-xi-concord-release-reminder-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70952707/-/air-jordan-xi-concord-release-reminder-1.jpg","width":570,"height":378},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70952739/-/air-jordan-11-quotconcordquot-2011-retro-6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70952739/-/air-jordan-11-quotconcordquot-2011-retro-6.jpg","width":620,"height":413}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4936774,"name":"Sneakers","permalink":"sneakers","url":"/category/sneakers"}]},{"id":7229629,"name":"Air Jordan 12 \"Playoff\"","permalink":"air-jordan-12-playoffs","position":35,"price":260.0,"default_price":260.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/air-jordan-12-playoffs","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-12T23:27:51.000Z","description":"Black/Varsity Red-White\r\n#130690 001\r\nRelease Date: 2012\r\n\r\n\r\nAIR JORDAN XII Tinker Hatfield and Michael Jordan collaborated to create the durable, stylish Air Jordan XII as a follow-up to the XI. \r\n\r\nInspired by a women's fashion shoe and the Japanese flag, the Air Jordan XII was clean and simple. The rich leather upper was stitched to resemble a rising sun, while the toe and accent overlays were made of faux reptile leather. The XII featured the slogan \"TWO 3\" down the tongue, metal lace loops with Jumpman logos and a pull tab that ran up the entire heel that read, \"QUALITY INSPIRED BY THE GREATEST PLAYER EVER.\" \r\n\r\nThe XII had a full-length carbon fiber shank like the AJ XI. The XII introduced full-length Zoom Air cushioning to the Jordan line. \r\n\r\nThe Air Jordan XII was originally released in five colorways, including the black/red version that MJ wore during Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz. In that game, Michael was ill and his appearance was questionable, but he was able to play and put together an unbelievable performance in the Bulls win. The shoe he wore during that game is known among collectors as \"Flu Game XII.\" \r\n\r\nThe other colors of the XII saw the floor during that season as well. Jordan wore the black/white shoe during 1997 playoff games. With the Air Jordan XII on his feet, MJ made his 11th All-Star game appearance, won his ninth NBA scoring title and was named first team All-NBA and first team All-Defense. He won his fifth NBA title and NBA Finals MVP while wearing the XII.\r\n\r\nBeginning in 2003, the Air Jordan XII was re-released in several additional colors.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Kixland","options":[{"id":22895341,"name":"Size 8.5","price":260.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71028595/-/aj12playoff1-570x379.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71028595/-/aj12playoff1-570x379.jpg","width":570,"height":379},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71028611/-/aj12playoff2-570x379.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71028611/-/aj12playoff2-570x379.jpg","width":570,"height":379},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71028587/-/air-jordan-12-retro-playoff-2012-black-varsity-red-white-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71028587/-/air-jordan-12-retro-playoff-2012-black-varsity-red-white-2.jpg","width":918,"height":514},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71028579/-/air-jordan-12-playoffs-3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71028579/-/air-jordan-12-playoffs-3.jpg","width":650,"height":756},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71028555/-/air-jordan-12-playoffs-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71028555/-/air-jordan-12-playoffs-2.jpg","width":650,"height":451}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4936774,"name":"Sneakers","permalink":"sneakers","url":"/category/sneakers"}]},{"id":11816112,"name":"Air Jordan 13 \"He Got Game\"","permalink":"air-jordan-13-he-got-game","position":36,"price":229.99,"default_price":229.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/air-jordan-13-he-got-game","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-16T02:54:15.000Z","description":"Known for being Denzel Washington’s shoe of choice in the iconic Spike Lee film, He Got Game, this retro version of the Air Jordan 13 is getting ready to finally make it’s debut.

Seven years later, many Brand Jordan athletes wore the Retro version of the XIV on the court when shoes were hitting at retail. The idea for the XIV was modeled after Michael's love for cars, inspired specifically from a Ferrari. The Air Jordan XIV boasted a Ferrari-like shield featuring a Jumpman logo. In fact, the design of the AJ XIV included seven Jumpman logos on each shoe for a total of 14 per pair. The Jumpman logo can be seen on the side heel, outsole, insole, back heel, toe and on the metal lace tips. \r\n\r\nThe asymmetrical collar provided support, while mesh vents made for a breathable cooling system. Low-profile heel and forefoot Zoom Air made the Air Jordan XIV a comfortable ride, and many athletes consider the AJ XIV one of the best performance basketball shoes of all time.\r\n\r\nThe XIV was originally released in five mids and three low tops in 1998 and 1999. It was re-released in 2005 and 2006 in 10 total colorways. The popular \"Last Shot\" XIVs were brought back along with a variation of the White/Red colorway. One of the most sought-after AJ XIV models, the Indiglos, have yet to be re-released by Brand Jordan.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Kixland","options":[{"id":22895287,"name":"Size

is the Nike Lebron X (10) \"Christmas\" edition. The Nike Lebron X (10) is the 10th anniversary of the Nike Lebron signature line and there is much to celebrate. In 2012 Lebron James managed to win the NBA season MVP award, his first NBA Championship, NBA Finals MVP, and an Olympic Gold medal. All of that history gets infused into the Nike Lebron X (10) model like back in 1995 when MJ hit his mark of ten signature models. This model features the newest innovations in Nike technology and will be the most respected shoe on the court. Every year Nike drops a set of limited Christmas edition shoes and this year is no different. The Nike Lebron line is set on the red and green theme for Christmas which is evident here on this shoe sporting a mostly red upper with green accents on the laces, swoosh and outsole. This pair is not Nike+ compatible.","options":[{"id":27607940,"name":"Size 8.5","price":249.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":45.0,"amount_with_others":30.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86465357/-/nike-lebron-x-10-christmas-01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86465357/-/nike-lebron-x-10-christmas-01.jpg","width":648,"height":648},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86465273/-/nike-lebron-x-10-christmas-02.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86465273/-/nike-lebron-x-10-christmas-02.jpg","width":648,"height":648},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86465285/-/nike-lebron-x-10-christmas-03.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86465285/-/nike-lebron-x-10-christmas-03.jpg","width":648,"height":648},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86465381/-/nike-lebron-x-10-christmas-05.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86465381/-/nike-lebron-x-10-christmas-05.jpg","width":648,"height":648},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86465393/-/nike-lebron-x-10-christmas-06.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86465393/-/nike-lebron-x-10-christmas-06.jpg","width":648,"height":648}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4936774,"name":"Sneakers","permalink":"sneakers","url":"/category/sneakers"}]},{"id":12995679,"name":"Nike LBJ X BHM","permalink":"nike-lbj-bhm","position":43,"price":269.99,"default_price":269.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nike-lbj-bhm","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-16T03:09:03.000Z","description":"Nike LeBron X ‘BHM’\r\nAnthracite/Pure Platinum-Sport Grey\r\n586770-010","options":[{"id":41451753,"name":"Size 8.5","price":269.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123052458/-/nike-lebron-10-gr-black-history-month-4-01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123052458/-/nike-lebron-10-gr-black-history-month-4-01.jpg","width":400,"height":267},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123052500/-/bhm-2013-nike-lebron-x-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123052500/-/bhm-2013-nike-lebron-x-2.jpg","width":570,"height":606},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123052503/-/bhm-2013-nike-lebron-x-3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123052503/-/bhm-2013-nike-lebron-x-3.jpg","width":570,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123052509/-/bhm-2013-nike-lebron-x-4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123052509/-/bhm-2013-nike-lebron-x-4.jpg","width":570,"height":586},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123052515/-/bhm-2013-nike-lebron-x-5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123052515/-/bhm-2013-nike-lebron-x-5.jpg","width":570,"height":491}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4936774,"name":"Sneakers","permalink":"sneakers","url":"/category/sneakers"}]},{"id":9770439,"name":"Nike LeBron X EXT 'Cork\"","permalink":"nike-lebron-x-cork","position":44,"price":850.0,"default_price":850.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nike-lebron-x-cork","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-06T19:09:25.000Z","description":"Nike LeBron X\r\nClassic Brown/Classic Brown-University Red-Hazelnut\r\n580890-200\r\nFebruary 23, 2013\r\n\r\n\r\nComposed of genuine cork and premium leather, the Nike LeBron X \"Cork\" takes the performance juggernaut up a notch.

Enter the 1500s from New Balance x United Arrows, in a very simple and amazing wheat colorway.\r\n\r\nThe suede upper blends with the off-white midsole perfectly with slight reference to the Nonnaive 997s. The Japanese brand did an amazing job with this. It’s such a simple colorway, yet people shy away from it for whatever reason.\r\n\r\nI can see how some brands could be against it on a running sneaker, when it’s more of a bulkier shoe colorway, but United Arrows is the evidence that it works.

The two brands teamed up to bring special editions of a few iconic Converse models for the Spring/Summer 2013 edition of the “Born Not Made” collection.

In the brand's words, Kevin Durant's fifth signature model is designed with premium materials and leading performance technologies to represent the evolution of Durant and his style of play.\r\n\r\nAt the helm once again was Footwear Design Director Leo Chang, who combined inspirational cues drawn from Durant's personal journey with symbolism from the number five and wrapped the elements up in a premium performance package.\r\n\r\n“Championship drive takes an entire team, and the new KD V represents the roadmap I follow,” said Kevin Durant. “Leo did a great job on the shoe by combining the best technology with my journey and what the number five means to me.”\r\n\r\nWith an aesthetic likened to Durant's smooth, fluid style of play, the KD V integrates four leading Nike technologies: 1) a Nike Zoom unit in the forefoot, 2) Nike Air unit in the heel 3) unibody Hyperfuse upper construction for superior fit 4) external heel counter to allow the foot to move while still providing support.\r\n\r\nThe shoe’s hidden story comes from five players united on the court, five sides of a pentagon – a Washington D.C. landmark, five corners of a star, and Durant’s fifth Nike signature shoe. This story is illustrated through a unique outsole, midsole texture, tongue quilting and heel counter details.","options":[{"id":27607247,"name":"Size 8.5","price":149.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":45.0,"amount_with_others":30.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86461889/-/KD-V-Mens-Basketball-Shoe-554988_610_A.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86461889/-/KD-V-Mens-Basketball-Shoe-554988_610_A.jpg","width":1000,"height":714},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86461841/-/durant-shoe-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86461841/-/durant-shoe-2.jpg","width":640,"height":479},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86461853/-/durant-shoe-3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86461853/-/durant-shoe-3.jpg","width":640,"height":853},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86461973/-/durant-shoe-5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86461973/-/durant-shoe-5.jpg","width":640,"height":478},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86461817/-/durant-shoe-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86461817/-/durant-shoe-1.jpg","width":640,"height":494}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4936774,"name":"Sneakers","permalink":"sneakers","url":"/category/sneakers"}]},{"id":8792900,"name":"Nike Kevin Durant KD 5 - \"Away\" ","permalink":"nike-kevin-durant-kd-5-away","position":92,"price":149.99,"default_price":149.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nike-kevin-durant-kd-5-away","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-04T23:21:32.000Z","description":"In the “Away” colorway of the Oklahoma City Thunder. The most obvious difference between the KD V and the KD IV – which is one of the shoes of the year, if such an award existed – is that the KD V is a mid top that is low on the heel and rises up to the ankle for added stability and a more traditional basketball shoe look. As with all signature shoes, but especially Durant’s, there are features around the sneakers that are personal to Kevin including shout outs to his mom on the toe of the sole, his hometown of Washington DC with pentagon imagery, and his style influences. The “Away” colorway has a black base with photo blue and team orange accents.

That’s not a dig against Concepts co-owner Deon Point and his crew, who’s previous crustacean-related Dunks have become the stuff of legend among sneaker connoisseurs and crawfish aficionados the world over. But this latest design finds the guys being washed ashore and taking flight with a new direction in design centered around something a little less probable.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe initial reaction to Concepts’ new proposal of an all-pink ode to oinkers decked out in full pig suede was met with skepticism. Much like when the crew magically turned crustacean into craze before our very eyes, critics likened the odds of success for the new release to that of hogs taking flight. But the confident New Englanders stuck to their guns and drew upon their near-two decades of experience in the cut-throat sneaker game by honing in on a hush-hush street mythos that’s been proven time and time again: sneakerheads love some hog hide. With the design department in firm agreement to this little-known nugget of wisdom, we’re now proud to announce the newest Concepts x Nike project, a Dunk Hi SB slated for lift off in late-November.\r\nWhile flipping the swine-inspired colorway lovely, Concepts couldn't help but add a little jab at the naysayers who said these pigs would never fly. The silver swoosh on this otherwise all-pink release is intended not only to give these guys the gift of flight but also representing a tip of the hat to Nike Skateboarding’s current 10th Anniversary year.\r\nSo as excitement peaks with fans wondering what else the crew might have up their sleeve, prepare for lift-off as Concepts' newest creation boldly defies logic and wins, once again proving that anything is possible with Nike Skateboarding.\r\n","options":[{"id":26174892,"name":"Size 8.5","price":499.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81730833/-/940x638q80.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81730833/-/940x638q80.jpg","width":940,"height":638},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81730821/-/620x440q80.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81730821/-/620x440q80.jpg","width":620,"height":440},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81730809/-/7b28b401b3449fd8ddd44ac6aae3cd36.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81730809/-/7b28b401b3449fd8ddd44ac6aae3cd36.jpg","width":611,"height":432},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81730869/-/concepts-x-nike-sb-2012-when-pigs-fly-dunk-hi-4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81730869/-/concepts-x-nike-sb-2012-when-pigs-fly-dunk-hi-4.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81730857/-/cncpts-nike-sb-dunk-high-when-pigs-fly-online-release-500x365.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81730857/-/cncpts-nike-sb-dunk-high-when-pigs-fly-online-release-500x365.jpg","width":500,"height":365}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4936774,"name":"Sneakers","permalink":"sneakers","url":"/category/sneakers"}]},{"id":7924749,"name":"Nike Air Max Hyperposite ‘Statue of Liberty’","permalink":"nike-air-max-hyperposite-statue-of-liberty","position":100,"price":269.99,"default_price":269.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nike-air-max-hyperposite-statue-of-liberty","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-10T13:40:37.000Z","description":"Colorway: Crystal Mint/Metallic Copper Coin\r\nRelease Date: November 10th 2012\r\nProduct Code: 524862-301\r\n\r\nDonning its “Crystal Mint/Metallic Copper Coin” colorway, fans of the shoe can only expect greatness as these vibrant Nike Basketball kicks also boast copper-infused detailing, copper-esque branding, a full Max Air Unit, and a clear, yet speckled copper outsole.

The upper of the Air Jordan VI is said to have been designed to abstractly depict the number 23. Three original AJ VIs were made of leather, while the Black/Infra Red colorway was made of rich suede. \r\n\r\nThe White/Carmine/Black Jordan VI featured a leather heel and upper with carmine red suede on the toe and underlay. Other traits included a clean toe cap, rubber tongue with finger loops, lace locks, a molded plastic heel tab and an inner booty sleeve.\r\n\r\nThe Air Jordan VI is one of the most loved shoes in the Air Jordan line. Originally released in 1991, the White/September blue version was seen on the feet of Jerry Seinfeld in the second season of his hit TV series. \r\n\r\nTinker Hatfield designed the Air Jordan VI-inspired Batman boots worn by Michael Keaton in the 1992 film Batman Returns. On the court, Ray Allen and Vin Baker wore White/Navy/Red editions of the Air Jordan VI at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.\r\n\r\nIn 1991 while wearing the AJ VI, Michael averaged 31.5 points per game to win his fifth straight NBA scoring title. That year MJ was voted first team All-NBA, first team All-Defense and notched his seventh straight All-Star appearance while being named the 1991 league MVP.

It wasn’t just the Air Jordan XII (12) or Scottie Pippen’s first signature model (he’d worn the Air More Uptempo, which we featured as our Re-Fresh model last month). 1997 was marked by the execution of an idea that seemed impossible: attach a sole to a liquid that had been poured into mold and then hardened. The idea was to have the entire upper, mid, and outsole made from a single cast, and bringing the concept into fruition was one of the biggest challenges in the history of Nike. But, after a host of issues that blocked the progress, the Air Foamposite 1 was born, and the footwear game was changed forever.\r\nMany may wear their athletic shoes to the movies, the mall, and maybe even the club. But the purpose of the design of a properly-conceptualized basketball sneaker is to withstand the rigors of a 6 footer who may weigh 200+ pounds sprinting, stopping, leaping, and shifting for extended periods of time over multiple games. In the history of shoe design, no one had ever made or seen anything like the Foamposite, which was designed to hold its shape that was supposed to be very close to the natural shape of the human foot and be incredibly lightweight as well.\r\n","options":[{"id":30260625,"name":"Size 8.5","price":1.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":60.0,"amount_with_others":20.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110502585/-/nike_air_foamposite_one_suns_electro_purple_black_total_orange-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110502585/-/nike_air_foamposite_one_suns_electro_purple_black_total_orange-1.jpg","width":1000,"height":714},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110502615/-/Nike-Air-Foamposite-One-Phoenix-Suns_4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110502615/-/Nike-Air-Foamposite-One-Phoenix-Suns_4.jpg","width":750,"height":498},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110502660/-/images.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110502660/-/images.jpeg","width":275,"height":183},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110502597/-/nike_air_foamposite_one_suns_electro_purple_black_total_orange-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110502597/-/nike_air_foamposite_one_suns_electro_purple_black_total_orange-2.jpg","width":1000,"height":714}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4970707,"name":"Sold","permalink":"sold","url":"/category/sold"}]},{"id":7212493,"name":"Adidas JS Instinct HI (White)","permalink":"adidas-js-instinct-hi-white","position":159,"price":99.99,"default_price":99.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/adidas-js-instinct-hi-white","status":"sold-out","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-09-11T08:39:10.000Z","description":"WHT/BLACK1/WHT\r\nV24529\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease Date: Mar,3,2012\r\n\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/kixland","options":[{"id":22845597,"name":"Size 8.5","price":99.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23551897,"name":"Size 9","price":99.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23551899,"name":"Size 9.5","price":99.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23551901,"name":"Size 10","price":99.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23551903,"name":"Size 10.5","price":99.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23551905,"name":"Size 11","price":99.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70741927/-/558478981_o.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70741927/-/558478981_o.jpg","width":520,"height":358},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70741967/-/7133849813_0b7171424e_z.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70741967/-/7133849813_0b7171424e_z.jpg","width":640,"height":427},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70741943/-/adidas_Jeremy_Scott__Instinct_Hi_white2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70741943/-/adidas_Jeremy_Scott__Instinct_Hi_white2.jpg","width":620,"height":382},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70741935/-/566098896_o.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70741935/-/566098896_o.jpg","width":600,"height":456},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70741951/-/adidas-jeremy-scott-instinct-hi-white-black.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70741951/-/adidas-jeremy-scott-instinct-hi-white-black.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4936774,"name":"Sneakers","permalink":"sneakers","url":"/category/sneakers"},{"id":4937125,"name":"Sale","permalink":"sale","url":"/category/sale"}]},{"id":10077772,"name":"Fila 96 \"Grant Hill\"","permalink":"fila-96-grant-hill","position":160,"price":99.99,"default_price":99.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fila-96-grant-hill","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-21T22:52:52.000Z","description":"The Retro movement continues with the return of a forgotten basketball sneaker – Grant Hill’s Fila ’96.

Here are the details and please read carefully to know exactly what you are bidding and/or buying:\r\n\r\nThese shoes are new, unworn, mint in appearance. \r\nUnfortunately, the right shoe's charging port has broken into 3 pieces and has come out of the shoe*pieces are pictured.* The shoes were charging and when I removed the right shoes charge-tip internal pieces came out as well. It was and still is sickening. \r\nThe right shoe will not take a charge anymore. It did light up after the incident however it was over a year ago and it has since lost its charge.\r\n\r\nCheap electronic craftsmanship in my opinion for such an expensive pair of shoes. I spent months speaking with a rep at Nike that was actually part of the Mag team and long story short they will not repair or replace since there was no longer a warranty.\r\n\r\nI have not attempted any repairs on the shoe myself nor brought them to a repair shop. I do not know if the shoe can ever be repaired.\r\nHowever if you or someone you know is an electronic repair guru they may be able to do something. The left shoe is new, mint and completely free of defects. Charges, lights up, looks awesome.\r\nYellow box and accessories are new/mint as well.

Sported by Shaq as a rookie, the sneaker released in both white and black based makeups. Pump technology was present, as was the Dunkman logo on the drop tag. Due to Shaq’s departure from Reebok in the late ’90s, the sneaker remained without retro release during the duration of his playing career.\r\n\r\nThe Reebok Shaq Attaq served as the first signature shoe for Shaquille O’Neal and also the first official signature shoe for a Reebok athlete. Shaq sported his own signature during his rookie season, an honor that would not be replicated by a Reebok athlete until Allen Iverson four years later. In his first season, O’Neal would wear the Shaq Attaqs en route to 1993 Rookie of the Year accolades, putting up 23 and 14 a night. A fan favorite, Shaq was also voted a starter for All-Star Game, the first rookie to attain such a role since Michael Jordan in 1985.\r\n\r\nDescription by Nicekicks\r\nPictures by packershoes","options":[{"id":33386683,"name":"Size 8.5","price":239.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":33386875,"name":"Size 9","price":239.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":33386686,"name":"Size 9.5","price":239.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":33386689,"name":"Size 10","price":239.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":33510867,"name":"Size 11","price":239.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":45.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/104710888/-/RBK_SHAQ_ATTAQ_1024x1024.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/104710888/-/RBK_SHAQ_ATTAQ_1024x1024.jpg","width":680,"height":510},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/104710900/-/RBK_SHAQ_ATTAQ-2_1024x1024.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/104710900/-/RBK_SHAQ_ATTAQ-2_1024x1024.jpg","width":680,"height":510},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/104710924/-/RBK_SHAQ_ATTAQ-3_1024x1024.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/104710924/-/RBK_SHAQ_ATTAQ-3_1024x1024.jpg","width":680,"height":510},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/104710936/-/RBK_SHAQ_ATTAQ-4_1024x1024__1_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/104710936/-/RBK_SHAQ_ATTAQ-4_1024x1024__1_.jpg","width":680,"height":510},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/104710972/-/reebok-classics-2013-shaq-attaq-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/104710972/-/reebok-classics-2013-shaq-attaq-1.jpg","width":1000,"height":666}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4970707,"name":"Sold","permalink":"sold","url":"/category/sold"}]},{"id":11730456,"name":"Air Jordan 5 Retro 2013 \"Black Grape\"","permalink":"air-jordan-5-retro-2013-black-grape","position":166,"price":1.0,"default_price":1.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/air-jordan-5-retro-2013-black-grape","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-12T01:25:06.000Z","description":"Sneakers will ship out on Monday June.17.2013\r\n\r\nAir Jordan V\r\nBlack/New Emerald-Grape Ice-Black\r\n136027-007\r\n\r\nThe Black Grape Jordan 5s are just that with the same colors on the midsole/outsole as the Grape 5s, but with a color flip on the upper replacing the all white leather with black nubuck.

His creativity and innovative thinking continued on several levels with the design of the Air Jordan V. The shoe featured an asymmetrical collar and the cut of the shoe was higher than the previous two Air Jordans. The V still had the sculpted midsole, but included a new pattern inspired by a World War II fighter plane. \r\n\r\nThe visible air unit carried over from the III and IV, as did the use of mesh from the AJ IV. The outsole of the V was made of translucent rubber while very thin, clear rubber adorned the side panel of the upper and the lower part of the tongue. \r\n\r\nCertain colorways of the AJ V used reflective 3M material on the tongue — a nice innovation to the Jordan line. On every Jordan V, an \"AIR JORDAN\" patch was stitched on the inside of the tongue. \r\n\r\nAnother first was the Grape Purple /Emerald colorway that had never been seen on a basketball shoe. \r\n\r\nThe heel of the AJ V was built with strong ankle support. The heel featured a stitched \"NIKE AIR\" logo with a Swoosh underneath. Lace locks were included with the Air Jordan V for added lockdown. \r\n\r\nThe V continued the great success of the Air Jordan line and came at a good time as Michael Jordan was hitting his stride in the NBA.\r\n\r\nJordan Brand has re-released the Air Jordan V in multiple colorways, including the original Grape, Fire Red and Black/Silver colorways as well as the White/Royal/Maze color inspired by Jordan's high school alma mater, Laney High.\r\n\r\nWhile rocking the Air Jordan V in 1990, Michael Jordan made his sixth straight All-Star game appearance, won his fourth straight league scoring title and was named to the All-NBA First Team and All-Defensive First Team. Although the Bulls lost to the Pistons in the 1990 Conference Finals, Jordan was on the verge of one of the NBA's greatest dynasties — and driving the footwear industry to new heights.","options":[{"id":34332342,"name":"Size 8","price":1.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34332345,"name":"Size

Tanaami was 9 years old during the Great Tokyo Air Raid of World War II in 1945. Images seared into the back of his mind at that time would become major motifs and inspiration in Tanaami's art works: roaring American bombers, searchlights scanning the skies, firebombs dropped from planes, the city, a sea of fire, deformed goldfish, and flashes from bombs reflecting in water. \r\n\r\nIn 1999, a retrospective of Tanaami's works from the '60s was held at Gallery 360° in Tokyo.

Tanaami was 9 years old during the Great Tokyo Air Raid of World War II in 1945. Images seared into the back of his mind at that time would become major motifs and inspiration in Tanaami's art works: roaring American bombers, searchlights scanning the skies, firebombs dropped from planes, the city, a sea of fire, deformed goldfish, and flashes from bombs reflecting in water. \r\n\r\nIn 1999, a retrospective of Tanaami's works from the '60s was held at Gallery 360° in Tokyo.
