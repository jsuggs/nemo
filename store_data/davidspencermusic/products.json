Scary. Good.  Freeing.\n\n\tThat’s what it was like for David as he crafted his first solo album on the heels of a five-year, two album stint with SpencerAcuff.  The result: Love Like a Symphony – a charged album steeped in honesty.\n\n\tWith this album, fans of SpencerAcuff will recognize what worked best about the Chapel Hill, NC band – pop sensibility and eloquent harmonies – now loaded up with string arrangements, expansive sound and David’s soaring vocals.  Recorded in his own studio out of Nashville, the record picks up traces of Sting and David Gray.\n\n\tDavid has the poignancy of a singer-songwriter mixed with an inclination for catchy, memorable, stay-with-you melodies.  From the climactic title track to the soothing “Tender Words”, the album unfolds like the most honest moments in your life.  It will remind you of a late night conversation with a good friend or the love letter you read over and over again.\n\n\tDavid is joined on &#8220;Love Like A Symphony&#8221; by several familiar faces: producer Ben Shive (keys for Dave Barnes), mixing engineer David Henry (Guster, Josh Rouse), and Paul Moak (Mat Kearney) on lead guitar.\n\n\tIf you’re lucky enough to catch David in person, you’ll meet a performer who doesn’t hold back.  Simply put, his voice fills up a room. He sings from a genuine place that will take you in, wanting the full story.  And there’s something so infectious, unassuming and appealing about him when he tells a funny story in a rambling David kind-of-way.\n\n\tA seasoned performer at the age of 25, David has shared the stage with Pat Green, Better Than Ezra, and Glen Phillips(of Toad and the Wet Sprocket) &#8211; just to name a few.  He even braved the Apollo Theater in Harlem (but that’s a story for another day).  Spencer&#8217;s list of high-profile gigs continues to grow, with hundreds of clubs, concert halls, and colleges now under his belt.\n\n\tWhat people are saying&#8230;\n“David’s infectious pop melodies and outstanding vocal talents anchor this solo project that celebrates the joys of a new love.”&#8212;David Henry (Guster, Josh Rouse, <span class=\"caps\">REM</span>)\n\n\t&#8220;Watching David perform, I came to the inescapable conclusion that someday our festival&#8217;s claim to fame will be that David Spencer once played here before he got big.&#8221;&#8212;Bill Stevenson, <span class=\"caps\">HOPEFEST</span> Promoter\n\n\t&#8220;3.5 of 4 stars &#8230; <span class=\"caps\">A LOVE ALBUM TO BE CHERISHED</span>!&#8221;&#8212;The Daily Tarheel\n\n","options":[{"id":217739,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/79061/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/79061/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":48775,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":114618,"name":"David Spencer Logo T-Shirt","permalink":"david-spencer-logo-t-shirt","position":2,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/david-spencer-logo-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-06-15T04:39:28.000Z","description":"American Apparel, Heather Lake Blue, and oh-so-soft!","options":[{"id":554830,"name":"Small","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":554832,"name":"Medium","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":554833,"name":"Large","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":554834,"name":"Extra Large","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/589874/-/tshirt_davidspencer_plain1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/589874/-/tshirt_davidspencer_plain1.jpg","width":519,"height":454}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":48778,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":39950,"name":"David Spencer and Scott Cash: Peace Came Down","permalink":"david-spencer-and-scott-cash-peace-came-down","position":3,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/david-spencer-and-scott-cash-peace-came-down","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2007-09-09T07:17:13.000Z","description":"The freshest compilation of Christmas music in a long time.
