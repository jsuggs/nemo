I spent time looking at and thinking about Monet’s Lily Pond and Garden; however, I formulated my own way of modulating the arrangements and the feelings of being surrounded by flowers. Mine is closer to the spectacular imagery in The Sound Of Music than any actual garden scene, such as Monet painted from. From a day trip to Geneva, not only seeing the arch bridge in his painting, a thing I found most impressive about him was his flower garden directly in front of the house, planted row by row and color by color.  The soul of impressionism is using color to create light.  He studied every day by looking these real flowers. Very smart fellow.\r\nComparing to the Series 1, I was releasing spontaneities energy in lines and intensify the spring color to summer. \r\n\r\nBrooklyn Botanical Garden Series 2\r\nOil On Linen 2012\r\n94\"x55'\r\n","options":[{"id":45247803,"name":"Default","price":5000.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125597565/-/blossomno12_revised.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125597565/-/blossomno12_revised.jpg","width":2844,"height":1656},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125479794/-/2013-09-09_03.38.38.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125479794/-/2013-09-09_03.38.38.jpg","width":3840,"height":2160},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125480349/-/2013-09-09_03.42.30.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125480349/-/2013-09-09_03.42.30.jpg","width":3840,"height":2160},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125479743/-/2013-09-09_03.38.15.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125479743/-/2013-09-09_03.38.15.jpg","width":2160,"height":3840},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125597610/-/blossom_partial.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125597610/-/blossom_partial.jpg","width":3264,"height":2448}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6178251,"name":"Art","permalink":"art","url":"/category/art"}]},{"id":14077245,"name":"No. 25-Prime Cherry Blossoms","permalink":"no-25-prime-cherry-blossoms","position":40,"price":2400.0,"default_price":2400.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/no-25-prime-cherry-blossoms","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-09T19:26:08.000Z","description":"I told a friend that I got stock on these cherry blossoms in mid April during the morning coffee. She said,\" Oh! There are four trees budding up like crazy on some corner of Burgen street. You should go see.\"  I did. I walked slowly with very little hope, because I have seen many cherry blossom in many places.  Then I saw these four normal pink blossoms.  They were as vibrant as the ones in Central Park, but lack of tree pose gestures.  The tree trunks were straight up and lined with one another.  All of sudden, I thought about one very young brush painting instructor once said to me,\" Don't ever paint what you see!\"  \r\nI thank my friend who brought to the trees on Burgen.

I spent time looking at and thinking about Monet’s Lily Pond and Garden; however, I formulated my own way of modulating the arrangements and the feelings of being surrounded by flowers. Mine is closer to the spectacular imagery in The Sound Of Music than any actual garden scene, such as Monet painted from. From a day trip to Geneva, not only seeing the arch bridge in his painting, a thing I found most impressive about him was his flower garden directly in front of the house, planted row by row and color by color.  The soul of impressionism is using color to create light.  He studied every day by looking these real flowers.
