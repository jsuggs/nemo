The NEGATIVE OBJECT EP comprises four new tracks that unfold like a party in reverse: the journey begins with the wistful, yearning regret of ‘Heart(s) Faded’ and onwards with the broken machine chug of ‘Negative Object’; then the fluid sci-fi swagger of ‘A Stream Past The Meadow’ builds into the midnight acid of ‘Summer Moon’.\r\n\r\n<audio controls=\"controls\">\r\n    <source src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13817110/PassengerEPpreview.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\r\n<source src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13817110/PassengerEPpreview.ogg\" type=\"audio/ogg\">\r\n    <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13817110/PassengerEPpreview.mp3\">Preview</a>\r\n</audio>","options":[{"id":36708663,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121373835/-/morethanhuman-2-cl.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121373835/-/morethanhuman-2-cl.jpg","width":864,"height":864},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114516018/-/MTH-preview-01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114516018/-/MTH-preview-01.jpg","width":888,"height":892},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126182109/-/passengerpix.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126182109/-/passengerpix.jpg","width":975,"height":855}],"artists":[{"id":218928,"name":"THE PASSENGER","permalink":"the-passenger","url":"/artist/the-passenger"}],"categories":[{"id":5307099,"name":"Albums","permalink":"albums","url":"/category/albums"}]},{"id":11631108,"name":"MTH002: PLAYS:FOUR - LAY DOE EP","permalink":"plays-four","position":2,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/plays-four","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-07T00:43:05.000Z","description":"Released July 16th 2013\r\n4 track 150gm vinyl EP. \r\nLimited to 300 copies. \r\nDownload code included.\r\nHot foiled sleeve with wraparound high gloss UV decal.\r\nHand assembled and individually numbered.\r\nCover photography by Erik Undehn.\r\n\r\nPLAYS:FOUR is a sample-based electronic trio out of Vancouver. They believe in the hypnotic value of beats, and parallel sound objects of undeﬁned tension. The LAY DOE EP explores that tension with four alluring pieces: ‘Cuit’, with its subtle patterns emerging, evolving and blooming; the insistent fronds of tumbling rhythms and tone-clusters of ‘Freg(g)‘; ‘Phyto’, a minimalistic and playful skip around the universe and, tripping ever closer to time’s receding edge, the stately ‘All Around The Up’. \r\n\r\n<audio controls>\r\n    <source src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13817110/PlaysFourEPpreview.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\r\n<source src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13817110/PlaysFourEPpreview.ogg\" type=\"audio/ogg\">\r\n    <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13817110/PlaysFourEPpreview.mp3\">Preview</a>\r\n</audio>","options":[{"id":36708837,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121373877/-/morethanhuman-1-cl.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121373877/-/morethanhuman-1-cl.jpg","width":864,"height":864},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114516378/-/MTH-preview-02.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114516378/-/MTH-preview-02.jpeg","width":888,"height":892},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126182121/-/playsfourpix.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126182121/-/playsfourpix.jpg","width":975,"height":372}],"artists":[{"id":218925,"name":"PLAYS:FOUR","permalink":"plays-four","url":"/artist/plays-four"}],"categories":[{"id":5307099,"name":"Albums","permalink":"albums","url":"/category/albums"}]},{"id":12388602,"name":"MTH003: KEMPER NORTON - LOWERMOOR EP","permalink":"lowermoor-ep","position":3,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lowermoor-ep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-16T03:49:11.000Z","description":"Released October 18th 2013\r\n\r\n4 track 150gm vinyl EP.\r\nLimited to 300 copies. \r\nDownload code included.\r\nHot foiled sleeve with wraparound high gloss UV decal.\r\nHand assembled and individually numbered.\r\nCover painting by Jordan Milner.\r\n\r\nUtilising such diverse elements as sound collage, folk balladry, documentary and noise, coupled with a fierce political intelligence, KEMPER NORTON uses the 4-song structure of his LOWERMOOR EP to investigate the scandal of the Camelford water poisoning of 1988, which occurred on the eve of water privatisation in the UK by the Thatcher government. Themes of isolation, loss and centrality of water and the sea to the British psychology surge through the work. From the uncanny montage of voices and sound in 'SWW Circular' to the mournful 'SWW Anthem', LOWERMOOR is strangely affecting music, both beautiful and haunting.\r\n\r\n<audio controls>\r\n    <source src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13817110/KemperNortonEPpreview.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\r\n<source src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13817110/KemperNortonEPpreview.ogg\" type=\"audio/ogg\">\r\n    <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13817110/KemperNortonEPpreview.mp3\">Preview</a>\r\n</audio>","options":[{"id":39319050,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125968707/-/kemper-norton-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125968707/-/kemper-norton-1.jpg","width":864,"height":864},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121491381/-/KemperPreview.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121491381/-/KemperPreview.png","width":622,"height":664},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126181401/-/pastedGraphic.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126181401/-/pastedGraphic.jpg","width":975,"height":653}],"artists":[{"id":218931,"name":"KEMPER NORTON","permalink":"kemper-norton","url":"/artist/kemper-norton"}],"categories":[{"id":5307099,"name":"Albums","permalink":"albums","url":"/category/albums"}]},{"id":14196777,"name":"MTH004: TIME ATTENDANT - TREACHEROUS ORB EP","permalink":"mth004-time-attendant-treacherous-orb-ep","position":4,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mth004-time-attendant-treacherous-orb-ep","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-15T18:42:16.000Z","description":"Coming Soon\r\n6 track 150gm vinyl EP. \r\nLimited to 300 copies. \r\nDownload code included.\r\nHot foiled sleeve with wraparound high gloss UV decal.\r\nHand assembled and individually numbered.\r\nCover painting by Paul Snowdon.\r\nGo to Artists page for further information.\r\n\r\n<audio controls=\"controls\">\r\n    <source src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/l7ba5xj3kc9q0x6/TimeAttendantClip.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\r\n<source src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ecrza4gq1nb9z1z/TimeAttendantClip.ogg\" type=\"audio/ogg\">\r\n    <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/71dadq8nrurgu6j/TimeAttendantClip.mp3\">Preview</a>\r\n</audio>\r\n\r\nMore Than Human has unearthed an archival recording from the future by Time Attendant, the London-based audio-visual time sensitive Paul Snowdon. This work features six new soundscapes invoking macrocosmic awe and microscopic terror.\r\nIRIDIUM WATCHER is our slightly anxious guide, wise but weary, opening forbidden portals. We pause briefly at VOIDERS DELIGHT, an utterly alien sonic landscape, before arriving at the disturbing arcane ceremony of THE HEXAPOD STAR SHUFFLE, where our only help is the spoken evocations of poet Dolly Dolly.\r\nLETHARGY QUEST is the beginning of our journey inwards, shrinking down to where ordinary sounds are amplified, contorted, transformed. We behold the TREACHEROUS ORB, approaching with sentient menace, relentlessly probing, pulsating, engulfing. Finally we’re left alone with CLOUD DOWSING, set free into a bacterial world of the sub-atomic.","options":[{"id":45852603,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":12.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":30.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":30.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128556636/-/MTH004-Time_Attendant.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128556636/-/MTH004-Time_Attendant.jpg","width":622,"height":661},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126182157/-/timeattendantpix.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126182157/-/timeattendantpix.jpg","width":975,"height":975}],"artists":[{"id":240783,"name":"TIME ATTENDANT","permalink":"time-attendant","url":"/artist/time-attendant"}],"categories":[{"id":5307099,"name":"Albums","permalink":"albums","url":"/category/albums"}]},{"id":14243805,"name":"MTH005: DIETER MOEBIUS","permalink":"mth005-kemper-norton","position":5,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mth005-kemper-norton","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-17T19:37:09.000Z","description":"Released July 16th 2013\r\n\r\n4 track 150gm vinyl EPs. \r\n\r\nLimited to 300 copies. \r\n\r\nDownload code included.\r\n\r\nHot foiled sleeve with wraparound high gloss UV decal.\r\n\r\nHand assembled and individually numbered.\r\n\r\nGo to Artists page for further information.","options":[{"id":46014906,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":12.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":30.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":30.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126029544/-/MTH_001-Passenger_sleeve.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126029544/-/MTH_001-Passenger_sleeve.jpg","width":622,"height":661},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126182214/-/dietermoebiuspix.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126182214/-/dietermoebiuspix.jpg","width":975,"height":651}],"artists":[{"id":241260,"name":"DIETER MOEBIUS","permalink":"dieter-moebius","url":"/artist/dieter-moebius"}],"categories":[{"id":5307099,"name":"Albums","permalink":"albums","url":"/category/albums"}]}]
