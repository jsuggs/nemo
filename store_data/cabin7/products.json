The light cherry wood blocks are made with sustainable wood from Michigan. You can see the natural wood grain (even some knots), which only adds to the character of these wooden blocks. We've gilded these letter blocks on the two sides where the debossed letters are inset. With each reversible block, you get two sides with the same letter (i.e., A to A). The other four sides are raw cherry wood. The blocks are gilded by hand with love. The combination of the shiny golden surface and the raw cherry wood is so beautiful. \r\n\r\nThis gilded alphabet makes the perfect gift for any typography lover. The shiny golden letters would be a pretty addition to a wedding — spell out words on the dessert table or set the alphabet by a Photobooth for your guests to make some memorable photos. We could see the alphabet displayed in a shadow box in a child's nursery or displayed in a rad living room. \r\n\r\nThis listing is for one complete alphabet set. You'll receive 26 reversible gilded cherry wood blocks packaged in muslin bags. The sides of the blocks measures about 1.75 inches.\r\n\r\nLimited-edition of 5 alphabet sets. Once they go, they're gone!\r\n\r\n*As with our entire collection, these blocks are meant for display and decoration — they're not meant to be used as toys for the kiddos.

We love the combination of the shiny golden surface with the natural beauty of birch logs. \r\n\r\nThese cardholders are a petite version of the gilded cardholders in the collection — we have a mix of wide- and narrow-slot cardholders available. See descriptions of \"gilded cardholder, wide slot\" and \"gilded cardholder, narrow slot\" for further details. \r\n\r\nThese petite cardholders measure about 2-by-3 inches. (Note: in photos here you can see these petite 2-inch gilded cardholders next to 3-inch gilded cardholders to get a sense of scale.) Each cardholder is made of white birch branches, and we've sealed and gilded the two ends.  \r\n\r\nThis listing is for ONE gilded petite cardholder. Choose between wide slot (can hold about 15 business cards) or narrow slot (can hold one photo). \r\n\r\nNote: the card slot itself is not gilded — it reveals the lovely raw birch wood. We've kept the natural, gorgeous beauty of the birch intact, so the birch may have peeling bark. The cardholder will stay put with the natural nubs or bumps of the bark (unless if you put in a giant piece of paper!). It's easy to find the spot where it sits upright. \r\n\r\nNew York state residents will be charged New York state sales tax. See our shop policies for more details.

Vintage wood alphabet blocks have been turned into shiny gilded letters that are one of a kind.\r\n\r\nWe've gilded these vintage blocks on the two sides where the embossed letters are raised.
