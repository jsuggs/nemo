This bright & cheerful sun-faced Lion is here to help and keep you company every single day of the year.\r\n\r\nAnd, with a handy little perforation between the Lion and the dates, you can pop the artwork into a 12x12 record sized frame when the year is done. See the 3rd & 4th photos as an example. Boom! \r\n\r\nAll hand illustrated by us and wonderfully printed on an Indigo press here in Pittsburgh. Bright, smart, & ready to hang on any wall and keep you company all year long. \r\n\r\nRather than limiting ourselves to just a few colors with the hand silkscreen printing process, we decided to experiment with this design. Following a bolder and brighter illustration route than we could with screen printing we're exploring a more modern printing technique by utilizing the Indigo press format. \r\n\r\nAfter all, screen printing is a lovely and ancient tradition, but we love having a foot in both the historic past and the ever-changing future at the same time whenever possible. With incredible detail & vibrant colors and archival inks and archival, eco-certified 100lb cover paper we think you'll love this addition too.\r\n\r\n- Edition: Limited edition of 200 Each print is hand signed and titled.\r\n\r\n- Size: As the complete Calendar, 12x18 inches  (30.48cm x 45.72cm). Remove the Calendar portion at the bottom and the art print portion is 12x12 inches (30.48cm x 30.48cm).  \r\n\r\n- Paper: Mohawk Via Bright White, 100lb cover weight which is an archival, no-acid, American manufactured paper by Mohawk using Wind Power electricity.

You are looking at Summer Cardinal art print, following our cardinal friend into the long sunsets of a summer evening.\r\n\r\nWe have lots of Cardinals here all year round. I love looking out of my window and seeing their amazing scarlet red color jumping out from wherever they are, and whatever they are up to.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummer Cardinal is a part of my Cardinal Seasons series where I am doing things a little differently, rather than making a new image for each season, I've decided to follow the same bright red fellow in the same scene, across all 4 seasons. \r\n\r\nAnd here for Summer Cardinal, in honor of the softer, breezier and warmer life of summer, our little red fellow is enjoying the gathering sunset of a lovely night ahead in pinks, reds, and greens.\r\n\r\n- Inks: 4 colors with tender summer twilight pink, bark brown, scarlet red, fresh-leaf green  hand-mixed and non-toxic water based silkscreen inks.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Edition: Open, with each print hand signed, and titled.\r\n\r\n- Size: 16 x 22 inches (40.6 cm x 55.9 cm.)\r\n\r\n- Paper: Archival, no-acid, recycled content, American made Cougar Opaque White, 100lb cover weight.\r\n\r\n- Fits beautifully into either a standard 16\" x 20\" frame by trimming the border, or into an 18\" x 24\" frame as is with a matte.\r\n\r\nAdditional photos are from the hand screen printing process in my studio and show a lovely example of how these prints look framed.
