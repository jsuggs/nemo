Do you like surprises? Try out a \"grab bag\" of double-dipped coasters! Each set will come with 4 coasters in either maple or elm in varying color-combinations. They're just enough color to make your pop and enough sparkle to keep spirits bright throughout the winter.\r\n\r\nThese \"double-dipped\" coasters are an original design. I start out with a raw wood slice, sand it several times by hand until it is completely smooth, then paint on one color and then another. Finally, each coaster is coated twice with a sealant (and sanded once more) to ensure maximum water resistance while also not harming your furniture.\r\n\r\nEach coaster will measure about 3\" in diameter and 1/4\" thick. The elm comes from my aunt & uncle's farm in southern Indiana, where it was destined for the wood burner. All other wood slices are bought from fellow crafters/small business owners. I try to always buy from providers who use wood from fallen/damaged trees.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a way to add a little color to your home, or need a unique gift, these coasters are the perfect way to protect your valuable furniture in style.\r\n\r\nBecause wood is a natural material, each and every wood slice turns out different. There are always natural \"imperfections\" that add personality and individuality to each piece.
