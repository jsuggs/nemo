Im not going to write / think of the physical form of music of the album \"but, its soul\" and this work is great.\r\n\r\nIll clarify here that I am not tied to any particular style of music, I like music, period (I'm no purist and I am proud of it anyway). In fact I support the idea that there are only two kinds of music, good and bad! In general, I think that music, without distinction of gender, is so important to the life of a person, as the basic foundation in human growth. The knowledge to appreciate a good song is the same has appreciating a good painting, or a good book or movie, this is intimately related to the domain of emotions that one particular individual has.\r\n\r\n\"Royaume des Ombres\" is a magnificent work that can mess with my emotions \"temperament, personality and motivation,\" with my human nature, as a set of characteristics described by philosophy, including ways of acting and thinking, that all human beings have in common, even misanthropes, who are by nature averse to human beings and human nature in general \"a misanthrope is someone who is suspicious of humanity in a generalized way.\" The word comes from the Greek  Misanthropia, the union of the terms μίσος (hate) and άνθρωπος (man, human being).\r\n\r\nIn fact I was fortunate to be among the first with the privilege to hear this fantastic art (music) which is basically to combine sounds and silence and there is no doubt that music history is intertwined with the history of the development of intelligence and human culture and as noted in \"Royaume des Ombres\".\r\n\r\nWell, if you think of cinema as a cultural artifact created by certain cultures that are reflected in it and that, in turn, affect them, here we could say that this movie has no country ... \"The world is its country\" and do not need subtitles. I like by principle to relate major musical works and cinematographic works \"Royaume des Ombres\" fit neatly into the Oscars winner Crash by Paul Haggis.\r\n\r\n\"In LA nobody touches you. We're always behind metal and glass. I think we feel such a lack of touch, we hit each other just to feel something.\" (Crash Phrase). From here, Crash is a film that shows a portrait of a society marked by prejudice. This, however, is not reflected in the naive formula black-white, but is shown as a colorful and complex reality: black, white, muslim, latino, poor, rich.\r\n\r\nI never gave and will never give notes to musical works but this time I feel like saying \"Royaume des Ombres\" shoots the scale ... 11 to 10. Let us wait anxiously upcoming works of art.","options":[{"id":21227387,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65536829/-/cover.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65536829/-/cover.JPG","width":620,"height":620}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2452353,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":4459135,"name":"BORGNE - entraves de l'ame CD","permalink":"borgne-entraves-de-l-ame-cd","position":4,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/borgne-entraves-de-l-ame-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-09-18T00:19:30.000Z","description":"black metal from switzerland\r\nnew Borgne's album\r\n\r\nwww.facebook.com/borgneblackmetal\r\nwww.myspace.com/borgne\r\n\r\nEntraves de l'Âme is the fourth proper full-length from the Swiss artist Borgne, otherwise known as Bornyhake, and the first of his releases to drop the Roman numeration. If you've experienced his albums before, you'll already know that this project serves as more of an ambient, cosmic alternative to his more direct, bludgeoning Enoid, and though there are some places in which the two intersect, they are thematically separate. They're also both quite gripping, and if you're a fan of artists who brandish the more modern armor of atmosphere, obscurity and disgust, like Leviathan or Xasthur, then I feel it's only natural you would want to explore a number of his works.\r\n\r\nAs I've already hinted, Borgne's material carries both the scent of human carrion and a knack for expansive expression that swelters to fill almost any space, whether that be the stellar void, a valley in the Alps, or a fogged, cold woodland. Through the thick, resonant guitars, the enormous, lecherous rasp of progenitor Bornyhake, or the intentionally underpinned programming of the brutal drums, you are given a foundation upon which the eerie, simplistic synthesizers can truly soar, and length pieces like the 9-minute \"Die Trying to Take Off the Rope\" or gentle, measured escalation of \"The Plague\" are a true pleasure to behold, if you've got the time to kill. One of Bornyhake's greatest weapons is his production: virile and raw, yet intangibly glorious to the point that the listener can experience bliss among the bombardment, revelation among the ripping discourse.\r\n\r\nHe's also not above throwing out a lead guitar (in \"The Plague\") or a dire, ambient sequence (i.e. the book-ends \"Drown in Nothingness\" or \"Moorwanderung\"). There is a completeness to this work which should satisfy fans of the entire Burzum school of thought. The music is never complex or challenging, but it is constantly engaging the listener to a separate, ghostly plain of sadness and might. The balance is not necessarily perfect, but there's enough going on to sate both the desperate appetite of the depressive addict and the dark explorations of the psychedelic black metal astronaut, and Entraves de l'Âme is successful in carrying you off to another world, where only your emotional survival skills will determine the duration of your exposure.\r\n\r\n-autothrall 8/10","options":[{"id":14609673,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43657705/-/289151.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43657705/-/289151.jpg","width":600,"height":599}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2452353,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":14663883,"name":"ENOID - the new world murder cd + button + limited 7ep 10copies only","permalink":"enoid-the-new-world-disorder-cd-button-limited-7ep-10copies-only","position":5,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/enoid-the-new-world-disorder-cd-button-limited-7ep-10copies-only","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-06T17:55:27.000Z","description":"Enoid - The New World Murder CD\r\n\r\npre-order !!
