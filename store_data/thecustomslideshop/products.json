Before you hit the buy button you will need to make a few simple decisions and take a few measurements. I recommend you e-mail me first to discuss your order, but if you feel you are ready to buy then continue reading!\r\n\r\n1. The main thing here is that I want to make sure the slide fits your finger perfectly. So simply measure the width of the widest part of your finger you wish to use the slide on. I recommend the use of verniers for this for accuracy, but if you don't have any to hand then a simple ruler should be fine. All done? Great, lets move on.\r\n\r\n2. Now the customisation begins. There are a handful of options to think about. \r\nFirst of all, how thick would you like the sidewall of the slide? \r\nSuper thin eg:1.5mm or 2mm, means a brighter tone and a lighter, fast playing feel. A nice and chunky 3mm and above means a thick earthy tone and a heavy more precise playing feel. We can pretty much manufacture any thickness so the choice is yours!\r\nSecondly, What length would you like it? \r\nDo you just play individual notes, then perhaps go for a shorter, easier to handle slide. Do you bar all the strings? Then go for a full length slide. Just state what length you would like the slide upon ordering.\r\nStill more decision making!(you want it to be perfect right?!) Do you sometimes find a slide with straight edge feels uncomfortable on your finger? Then perhaps try the Chamfered edge(pictured).\r\nFinally, some cosmetic choices. Do you want your slide to feel like it has had 50 years of playing in sweaty blues clubs in the Deep South? Then try out our Relic'd service! If not, go with our standard finish. The lovely, highly polished style. Will make you want to keep the slide on your finger as a piece of jewellery!\r\n\r\nAll of our slides come with a free velvet storage bag.\r\n\r\n3.
