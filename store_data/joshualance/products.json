I came across a Japanese couple with their baby in a park and had to take a picture.  They said her name was \"Usa\".  Really, that's her name!  She must have been about 6 months old.  I tightened my technique for the face and made looser brushstrokes for the clothes.  I was going for an emotional bond, as she was staring right at me.  \r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\nTitle: ‘Usa in Kyoto'\r\nSize:  8x10 (oval)\r\nMedium:  oil on canvas board\r\nDate:  February 2013\r\n\r\nShipping:  Express","options":[{"id":30239927,"name":"Default","price":325.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127164177/-/Usa.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127164177/-/Usa.jpg","width":463,"height":594}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4725707,"name":"Portraits","permalink":"portraits","url":"/category/portraits"}]},{"id":9663669,"name":"Janice","permalink":"janice","position":21,"price":350.0,"default_price":350.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/janice","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-28T09:30:06.000Z","description":"This is taken from a photo of a young, beautiful Phillipino woman named Janice.

The concept of this painting is that it's two different paintings in one, two lives in one.  My life in the eastern USA and my other life in the western USA.  Like a picture card from a deck of cards, when one image is upside-down, it takes on a different reality and seen in a different way.  I have never tried this concept on a painting before.  This happens to be my largest painting to date, only my murals are larger.\r\n\r\nWon \"Most Exotic Painting\" award at the competition.\r\n\r\n*note-painting will be shipped rolled in a tube.\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\nTitle: ‘Two Paths of Reflection'\r\nSize:  60x40\r\nMedium:  acrylic on canvas\r\nDate:  October 2011\r\n\r\nShipping:  Express","options":[{"id":30245293,"name":"Default","price":980.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/85914557/-/-Two_Paths_of_Reflection-1-Joshualance.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/85914557/-/-Two_Paths_of_Reflection-1-Joshualance.jpg","width":714,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94965693/-/-Two_Paths_of_Reflection--Joshualance.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94965693/-/-Two_Paths_of_Reflection--Joshualance.jpg","width":714,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4725680,"name":"Landscapes","permalink":"landscapes","url":"/category/landscapes"}]}]
