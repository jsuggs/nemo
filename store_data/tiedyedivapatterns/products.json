No hand-sewing is required. \r\n\r\nComplete patterns and instructions are included for his hat and collar.\r\n\r\nFinished size 16\" tall.\r\nBest for advanced beginners. \r\n\r\nYou will receive your PDF pattern as an instant download upon purchase, and you will need Adobe Reader to view it and regular 8.5” x 11\" or A4 printer paper and a printer for printing the patterns.

You get two skirt patterns in one. Overskirt has a flat front and elastic (no shirring) back. Elastic-waist underskirt adds poof and rustle to her walk and only peeks out as she moves. Designed so that no itchy tulle ever touches the skin.\r\n\r\nThis pattern is a bundle book in itself with TWELVE sizes from 6 months to teen 13/14 and patterns and instructions for both the underskirt and the overskirt, plus a big section on tips for sewing, hemming and seaming special occasion fabrics. She'll want to wear the pretty underskirt on its own too.\r\n\r\nSpecial occasions deserve special fabrics! Use satin, silk, taffeta, garment-weight brocade, or linen for the overskirt. Tips for using, hemming, and making seams with special occasion fabrics are included. You can also use cottons or cotton blend fabrics. So many different looks - make an underskirt or two and a pile of interchangeable skirts in different fabrics for an entire holiday wardrobe.\r\n\r\nSo many beautiful skirts to show you in the tester album, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.603240349714328.1073741834.183671405004560&type=1\">click here to see the tester album on the Tie Dye Diva Facebook fan page</a>.

There's a reason bomber pilots loved these so - full ear flap coverage even in frigid winds. \r\n\r\nThis PDF sewing pattern teaches you how to sew these pilot hats with your choice of long ties, fun fringey tassels, or no embellishment at all, and you can line the crown or leave it unlined. \r\n\r\nSewing Level: Beginner to advanced beginner.\r\n\r\nNewborn size makes a great photo prop, tweens love the slouchy look - you'll be reaching for this fleece hat sewing pattern again and again.\r\n\r\n*As stated in the PDF pattern, for safety purposes, the no-embellishment or the tassels option should be used on infant/baby hats, not the long ties option. If an infant wears long ties such as during a portrait session, the infant should be supervised at all times.*\r\n\r\nSizes included: Newborn, 0-6 months, 6-12 months, 1-3 years, 4-5 years, 6-8 years and 9-12 years.\r\n\r\nYou'll need only 1/3 yard polyfleece - even for the ties and tassels, no special materials are needed. Polyester thread works best for sewing fleece.\r\n\r\nYou'll receive your downloadable PDF pattern at your registered Paypal email address instantly upon purchase. You'll need Adobe Reader to view it and regular 8.5” x 11” or size A4 printer paper and a printer. No paper copy will be mailed.

As the Tie Dye Diva, I have created and sold my boutique-style tie dye for years. My shop was a success, but I have hung up my dye-splattered apron for the last time and and I am ready to share my tips for tie-dyeing. You'll learn the basics of tie dyeing from choosing tees, folding, tieing, mixing dyes and creating custom colors, to applying the dye and curing and washing out. I'll show you step by step how to create three beautiful and popular tie dye patterns: perfect boutique hearts,  Best Friends rainbow tees, and now, spirals too.\r\n\r\nYou'll learn how to get that perfectly shaped heart, how to control stray splatters and bleeds, and how to cure and wash out for a bright, bold, long-lasting effect. The Best Friends tees were a best seller for me, and now I am sharing exactly how to make this adorable matched set of rainbow tees with you. (Click on number 2 or 3 over there to see the adorable Best Friends rainbow tees!)\r\n\r\nJust like my sewing patterns, this 28-page PDF tie dye tutorial is full of step-by-step full color photos and helpful explanations and tips. A computer-drawn template is included, as well as a section on where to buy dyes and chemicals (it doesn't have to be online!) and variations you can create using the methods you'll learn when creating hearts and rainbows. \r\n\r\nWhat you'll need: This tutorial is for creating professional grade tie dye with fiber reactive (Procion MX or Procion MX-type) dyes. They won't fade, run, or bleed when you are done. You will also need some other ingredients for the reaction, like soda ash, which you can buy at ay hardware or pool supply store or pool supply section of a big box retailer. Almost everything else you already have at home. I'll tell you exactly what you need, where to buy it (it doesn't have to be online!), how to use dyes and chemicals safely, and how to get beautiful results. I do not recommend that you use RIT or other craft kit dyes with these techniques.\r\n\r\nYou'll receive your eBook in .pdf format by email immediately upon purchase, and will need Adobe Reader to view it and a printer if you wish to print the ebook or template. No paper copy will be mailed. You are not purchasing an actual tie dye item or a kit, but a PDF file that teaches you how to tie dye your own heart and rainbow tees.\r\n\r\neBook tutorial is copyright Tie Dye Diva 2011, all rights reserved.
