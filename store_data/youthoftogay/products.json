Having become creatively engorged after their infamous “Dongs We Bury” EP the dudes have put their nose to the bump and grind-stone and pooped out ALL ORIGINAL TRACKS for this slippery slab of satire! Feasting on the ample musical man-buttfet of their own making, everyone in the band is excited to be surrounded by so many swollen members... members whom are swollen with humorous yarns and inspiration…..and boners.\r\nwww.myspace.com/seriouslyhardcoreisalreadywickedgay \r\n\r\nWe have teamed up with Philadelphia’s FRUIT PUNCH. This band is amazing! They effortlessly create music that is robust with social and personal exposition, political opinion and revolutionary art…and they stick it right up your social, personal and political bungholes….but not laughingly…definitely not laughingly. More seriously. For sure. \r\nwww.myspace.com/fruitxpunch \r\n- YOUTH OF TOGAY:\r\n\"Butthole of Doom\"\r\n\"Put Your Stolen Base in Me 46, A Love Song to Jacoby Ellsbury\"\r\n\"Late Night-rider\"\r\n\"Bears on The Prowl\"\r\n\"Gay Nazi Skinheads\"\r\n- FRUIT PUNCH:\r\n\"Bring The Rain\"\r\n\"Test of Faith\"\r\n\"You Are Your Own Monster\"\r\n\"Dedication\"\r\n\"You Must Be Mistaken\"\r\n","options":[{"id":1402111,"name":"Grey Marble Vinyl","price":4.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":0.0},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2683249/-/sleeve_rough2_front_small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2683249/-/sleeve_rough2_front_small.jpg","width":696,"height":696}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":281069,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":2642216,"name":"Youth of Togay \"Tranny Island\" PRE-ORDER","permalink":"youth-of-togay-tranny-island-pre-order","position":2,"price":1000000.0,"default_price":1000000.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/youth-of-togay-tranny-island-pre-order","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-07-04T04:55:53.000Z","description":"<a href='http://kck.st/aPpQcV'><img border='0' src='http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/patrickclement/youth-of-togay-tranny-island-7-ep-bostons-queercor/widget/card.jpg' /></a>\r\n\r\nClick into Kickstarter and pledge to fund our final 7\"!
