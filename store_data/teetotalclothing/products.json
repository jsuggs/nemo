Our vision to blur the lines between wearing a t shirt and a piece of art, only ever selling t shirts in limited runs, and all that stuff we go on about in the ‘About Us’ section… well that’s all summed up in this little fox. \r\n\r\nJthree Concepts is Seattle-based artist Jared K. Nickerson. Jared is a professional digital illustrator, originally from Halifax, Nova Scotia. With various moves westward across North America he is now based in Seattle, WA. Jared is co-founder of renowned vector community Blood Sweat Vector (BSV). \r\nHis main focus is character, logo, videogame, editorial, and textile design.  He also specializes in art direction, branding, and consulting. His client list includes Nike, Adidas, Coca-Cola, Activision, K2 Snowboards, and CultureClub to name a few.  \r\n\r\nAs well as being an illustrator, Jared is also an amateur music producer, song writer, and vocalist. His band, Dead Astronauts, just released their first single, \"Favorite Lover\", which is available on Amazon, Beatport, & iTunes.
