Fierce in its recognition of both beauty and the painful, yet tender truths of the universe, these poems remind us that Matthews is a genuine master at laying bare the complicated spectrum of the human condition. Here is a book where, as Matthews says, \"Everywhere life is ludicrous/ but absolutely crucial.\" \r\n- Ada Limón\r\n\r\nFor a first book of poems to be honest is rare enough: for one to concern itself with honesty, with the evasion of fancy and the lives of our excitements is even more so, and I feel thankful for this book. These narrowed poems, almost epigrammatic, but ultimately meditative, reflect the sorts of confrontation, such as with mirrors, that will matter in the end.\r\n- John Hollander\r\n\r\n\"William Matthews writes of the post-<em>Wasteland</em> world, familiar to many young people today but not always to their elders. Like all worlds, it is a state of consciousness, but with a difference. Work and love take the place of extremes of hope and despair; emotion and thought devoted to life as lived <em>in the present</em> take the place of blind worship of the past and blind fear of the future. If work and love can balance the ecology of our planet (both geographic and poetic), William Matthews will deserve our thanks. Like Gary Snyder and Wendell Berry, he knows that the poetry is in the ecology. Matthews, as I believe we shall soon see, is a man of their stature. I believe that he is the best young poet in American.\" \r\n-Stephen Mooney, Editor, <em>Tennessee Poetry Journal</em>\r\n\r\nYou can read a couple of poems at the <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org\" target=\"_blank\">The Poetry Foundation</a>: \r\n<a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/171611\" target=\"_blank\">\"Search Party\"</a> \r\n<a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/171613\" target=\"_blank\">\"Why We Are Truly a Nation\"</a> \r\n\r\nAll materials copyright © Cooper Dillon Books or their respective owners.\r\nNo material may be reproduced without written authorization.","options":[{"id":16338481,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49381859/-/RtNR_cover_front.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49381859/-/RtNR_cover_front.jpg","width":487,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49381867/-/RtNR_cover_back.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49381867/-/RtNR_cover_back.jpg","width":490,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49381919/-/portrait_williamMatthews.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49381919/-/portrait_williamMatthews.gif","width":149,"height":175}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2632223,"name":"Full-Length Collections","permalink":"full-length-collections","url":"/category/full-length-collections"}]},{"id":4878991,"name":"Pretty, Rooster by Clay Matthews","permalink":"pretty-rooster-by-clay-matthews","position":5,"price":14.0,"default_price":14.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pretty-rooster-by-clay-matthews","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-18T23:00:04.000Z","description":"Pretty, Rooster by Clay Matthews\r\nISBN: 978-0-9841928-4-7\r\nPaperback, 75 pages\r\n$14.00 + s/h\r\n\r\nPretty, Rooster features original comics from Shannon Wheeler (Too Much Coffee Man) and Micah Farritor (White Picket Fences & Night Trippers), with other visual stimulations by Max Xiantu.\r\n\r\nFrom the back of the book:\r\n\r\nReb Livingston, author of <a href=\"http://www.notellbooks.org/damsel\" target=\"_blank\">God Damsel</a>, says:\r\nThese tender, introspective poems pulse patiently as the world spins around and shines light. Their humbleness and devotion to the act of being is a condition that connects to the greater by relating to what appears, on the surface, as the minor details. \"I say, please, let's/ not forget about the small things. You say,/ please, now, let's not forget things either way.\" By not forgetting either way, Clay Matthews blesses the I-don't -know and mystery of everyday. \r\n\r\nJason Schneiderman, author of <a href=\"http://www.spdbooks.org/Producte/9780912592701/striking-surface.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Striking Surface</a>, writes:\r\n\r\nYou don't read these poems as much as you tumble through them. The pleasures of sound and sense are so perfectly calibrated that each of these sonnets wants to be read at least twice. The sonnet was invented as a vehicle for self-examination, and Matthews takes that literally, driving each one like it had a manual transmission. His discoveries are simultaneously comforting and unsettling, love always inflecting life, and life always inflectiing love. \r\n\r\nFrom Christina Davis, author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Forth-Raven-Christina-Davis/dp/1882295579\" target=\"_blank\">Forth a Raven</a>:\r\n\r\nWhat do the rooster's showy comb, the fool's cap and the vibrant petals of an annual plant have in common? They all contribute to the fusion of meanings in Clay Matthews' masterful sequence of \"Cockscomb\" sonnets. Matthews infuses the sonnet form with a folksy acoustic and bucolic slang, mixed with the kind of tenderness, vulnerability and knowing you would find in a Shakespearean jester. All of this in a sort of satellite dish of encyclopedic subjects ranging from auto racing to ars poetica, landscaping to Loch Ness.

Like the three year old in one of her poems, Cherry’s crisp language “rockets through the room firm and loud in [its] skin.” Haunts is moving, cathartic, gossipy, humorous, and always fascinating. \r\n\r\nStuart Dischell, author of <a href=\"http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780142002681,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dig Safe</a>, writes:\r\n\r\nThere is a fearlessness of spirit in Laura Cherry’s Haunts, her debut full-length collection—-a fearlessness of engaging the full round of life.

The poems in Haunts are crystal clear, but that doesn't help you see what's coming. Every turn is a surprise in this funny, wicked smart, tightly-crafted book. Laura Cherry makes me happy to be a poet. \r\n\r\nFrom <a href=\"http://adamclay.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Clay</a>, author of A Hotel Lobby at the Edge of the World:\r\n\r\nThe \"perfect symmetry\" of the cars on a bridge — symmetry in Cherry's work occurs not in nature, but in human life. A flock of birds takes off \"on schedule\" and the speaker thinks of a \"luminous plane.\" Cherry even has the gall to take on the odes (and the ghost) of John Keats. In each reading of this book, a new image or idea catches me.

In his collection of pastorals and anti-pastorals, sonnets and anti-sonnets, Pritts proves that the annus mirabilis need not contain monumental breakthroughs like those of Newton and Einstein to justify its wonders. Then isn't to say that these poems lack gravity or electricty, because the opposite is true. With revelations both calamitous and quotidian, Pritts makes us reconsider the entire notion of the calendar, as \"Leaves unfold & collect sunlight.//It is the second before everything.\" \r\n\r\nLaura Mullen, author of <em>When I Was Dead</em> and <em>Subject</em>, writes:\r\n\r\nNate Pritts's <em>The Wonderfull Yeare</em> invents new forms for feeling, bringing to life a speaker who sees, in nature, suggestive (but possibly untranslatable, inimitable) directions for moving forward from sorrow. To read these touching collage poems is to make the slow and transformative passage from a \"consant red ache\" to \"blue night...//& then afterward.\" \r\n\r\nYou can read reviews of <em>The Wonderfull Yeare</em> by following these links: \r\nFrom <a href=\"http://rattle.com/blog/2011/01/the-wonderfull-yeare-by-nate-pritts/\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Neumire at Rattle </a>\r\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.typecastpublishing.com/news/blondone-review-the-wonderfull-yeare-by-nate-pritts/\" target=\"_blank\">Typecast Publishing/Blondone </a>\r\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/journal/article.html?id=239684\" target=\"_blank\">Justin Taylor at The Poetry Foundation </a>\r\nFrom <a href=\"http://indigestmag.com/blog/?p=2718\">Brad Liening at InDigest </a>\r\n\r\nFind more reviews <a href=\"http://heartsicke.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.

Speaking to this unusual combination of themes in an interview with Eratosphere, Essbaum observed, “Why the pairing of sexual and religious expression seems wrong to our post-modern American ears, I think, is because we’re all (no matter what we believe or don’t) direct inheritors of a Puritan heritage that disdains human physicality … in lieu of pursuits of the spirit alone.” In a Coldfront review of Necropolis, critic Rick Marlatt noted, “Known for their remarkable mix of eroticism and religiosity, Jill Alexander Essbaum’s poems vibrate with well-proportioned rhymes, unforgettable imagery and a unique realization of form.”","options":[{"id":15894581,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127983645/-/theDevestation_cover_redux-750px.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127983645/-/theDevestation_cover_redux-750px.jpg","width":487,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/48843733/-/portrait_jill.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/48843733/-/portrait_jill.gif","width":149,"height":175},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127983633/-/theDevestation_cover_redux-back-750px.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127983633/-/theDevestation_cover_redux-back-750px.jpg","width":479,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2672209,"name":"Chapbooks","permalink":"chapbooks","url":"/category/chapbooks"}]},{"id":4878897,"name":"They Speak of Fruit by Gary L.
