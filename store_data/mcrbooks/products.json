Currently Executive Head Chef at The Mark Addy in on the banks of the River Irwell, he’s previously worked in some of Manchester’s best-loved dining establishments, including The French at the Midland, Reform, Lounge Ten, The Bridge and The Angel.\r\n\r\nThe book contains fifty deliciously distinctive recipes, combined with anecdotes and insights into the colourful life and experiences of the chef himself. Co-written by Neil Sowerby, and sumptuously photographed and designed by Joby Catto, this is both a practical, yet beautiful and informative book. Combining autobiographical laughter and lip-smacking dishes, <i>Crispy Squirrel and Vimto Trifle</i> is the perfect gift for the food lover in your life.","options":[{"id":48063015,"name":"Default","price":12.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":15.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127495488/-/Crispy-Squirrel-final-cover-for-press-600px_wide.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127495488/-/Crispy-Squirrel-final-cover-for-press-600px_wide.jpg","width":600,"height":773},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129167874/-/(McrBooksLtd)CrispySquirrelAndVimtoTrifle_iPad-21.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129167874/-/(McrBooksLtd)CrispySquirrelAndVimtoTrifle_iPad-21.jpg","width":800,"height":516},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129167919/-/(McrBooksLtd)CrispySquirrelAndVimtoTrifle_iPad-10.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129167919/-/(McrBooksLtd)CrispySquirrelAndVimtoTrifle_iPad-10.jpg","width":800,"height":516}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6654459,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]}]
