Formed in 1986, the band has toured relentlessly around the world, building a perversely loyal following. Their music is a mixture of hard rock, punk, and post-punk and typically features melodic, guitar-heavy, odd-metered, and rhythm based pieces. Their lyrical subject matter focuses on topics including depravity, domestic violence, sexuality and eggs. \r\n\r\nFree Electric State-Conceived in the musical hotbed of Durham, NC (Megafaun, Mountain Goats) Free Electric State draws from shoegaze and noise rock to create a dark, velvety wash of sound. The quartet, formed after a barroom discussion about Krautrock by guitarists David Koslowski and Nick Williams in 2009, quickly garnered rave reviews about their blistering live shows.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis 7' inch has a full color jacket, download card and is a red translucent pressing.

This album is a snap shot of the end of adolescence and the precipice of adulthood.\r\n\r\nThe songs are intricately crafted tales of anarchy, revolution, peace and the constant search for hope. The verses are dense labyrinths of tongue twisted word play, while the hooks are polished pop and serve as the grounding force for each of these stories.\r\n\r\nAt times, Katastrophe's crooning is reminiscent of a chain-smoking, whiskey drinking, soul singer and other times his voice is as smooth and rich as a bedroom r&b singer. This emcee's rat-a-tat machine gun flow lends itself to each track as if it were another percussion instrument. His cadence and voice are like volcanic eruptions conveying the urgency of every word and breath, spilling over each 16 bar verse.\r\n\r\nTracks like \"'til it's gone\" and \"halfway happy\" offer a laid back, jazzy, classic 90s era kind of beat with a message that there is always a light at the end of the tunnel, while \"tonight\" and \"big deal\" are tongue-in-cheek dance tracks that will set any crowd in motion.\r\n\r\nThis album is a journey through the mind of an analytical young man that doesn't just want to make music, but wants to affect change in the lives of everyone who listens to his syncopated cry. \r\n\r\nhttp://307knoxrecords.com/art_katastrophe.html","options":[{"id":9260223,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25197425/-/bigthumb-katas_worstamazing.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25197425/-/bigthumb-katas_worstamazing.jpeg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25197429/-/katas_press_jrosenstein.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25197429/-/katas_press_jrosenstein.jpg","width":325,"height":460}],"artists":[{"id":44049,"name":"Rocco Katastrophe","permalink":"rocco-katastrophe","url":"/artist/rocco-katastrophe"}],"categories":[{"id":1565524,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
