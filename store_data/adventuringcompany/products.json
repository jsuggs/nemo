They have a cosmopolitan distribution, with most species being found in the Old World and Australasia. There are roughly 90 species of kingfisher. All have large heads, long, sharp, pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails. Most species have bright plumage with little differences between the sexes. Most species are tropical in distribution, and a slight majority are found only in forests. They consume a wide range of prey as well as fish, usually caught by swooping down from a perch. Like other members of their order they nest in cavities, usually tunnels dug into the natural or artificial banks in the ground.\" - Wikipedia\r\n\r\n11\" X 17\" print / 100# cardstock\r\n\r\nArt by Lee Bretschneider","options":[{"id":47995278,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127478649/-/kingfischer.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127478649/-/kingfischer.jpg","width":587,"height":900}],"artists":[{"id":198825,"name":"Lee Bretschneider","permalink":"lee-bretschneider","url":"/artist/lee-bretschneider"}],"categories":[{"id":3282663,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":14871252,"name":"Grumpy Meep","permalink":"grumpy-meep","position":4,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/grumpy-meep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-15T17:26:23.000Z","description":"Meep.\r\n\r\n11\" X 17\" print / 100# cardstock\r\n\r\nArt by Lee Bretschneider","options":[{"id":48203589,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127637562/-/GrumpyBeaker_11x17.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127637562/-/GrumpyBeaker_11x17.jpg","width":587,"height":900}],"artists":[{"id":198825,"name":"Lee Bretschneider","permalink":"lee-bretschneider","url":"/artist/lee-bretschneider"}],"categories":[{"id":3282663,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":12940041,"name":"Tread Lightly","permalink":"tread-lightly","position":5,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tread-lightly","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-13T15:23:54.000Z","description":"Very... very... lightly.\r\n\r\nThe meth king Heisenberg's famous lines to his DEA agent brother-in-law are immortalized in the classic iconography of the historical Gadsden flag (Don't Tread On Me).\r\n\r\n11 X 17 print / 100# cardstock\r\n\r\nArt by Justin Peterson","options":[{"id":41266533,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125482179/-/tread_small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125482179/-/tread_small.jpg","width":675,"height":1035},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122715591/-/treadlightly_small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122715591/-/treadlightly_small.jpg","width":1035,"height":675}],"artists":[{"id":198867,"name":"Justin Peterson","permalink":"justin-peterson","url":"/artist/justin-peterson"}],"categories":[{"id":3282663,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":15132246,"name":"d100 Shirt","permalink":"d100-shirt-pre-order","position":6,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/d100-shirt-pre-order","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-27T01:50:47.000Z","description":"Greetings, Adventurer!
