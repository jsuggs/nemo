The aroma of just these ingredients together translate into a beautiful, soft subtle scent of plain CLEAN. \r\n\r\nMany people ask if they moisturize, and I reply that they do not so much moisturize as that they clean and condition without stripping your skin of it's precious natural oils promoting healthier, more balanced skin.  Naturally free of harsh detergents, phosphates, sulfates and artificial anything.  Better for your skin AND the environment.     \r\n\r\nThere is no pic of the soap w/ a label, but it does come with one as in omes in third pic except reading \"Pure & Simple\" :)\r\n\r\nIt costs relatively a lot to send one bar of soap so buy in multiples and save!

Sure they moisturize, but at the same time worsening the condition so you need to moisturize more often.           \r\n\r\nTreat your kisser kindly with a soothing blend of unrefined Canadian beeswax, unrefined cocoa butter, organic virgin coconut oil, cold pressed grapeseed oil, sea buckthorn oil, castor bean oil, and vitamin E. These lip balms glide on smoothly, are juicy yet long lasting... a customer favorite!  This unisex formula leaves the lightest sheen on your lips - just enough to look dewy and kissable.  They've all been very lightly flavored with all natural botanical extracts.  \r\n\r\nAlong with the usual soothing and protective natural ingredients, these little tubes of lip savers have been infused with a generous amount of sea buckthorn oil.  Sea buckthorn oil is derived from the berries of the sea buckthorn shrub whose berries are an extremely high source of vitamin C, vitamin E,  essential amino acids and beta carotene.  This oil is widely included in high end skin products to speed skin regeneration and effectively combat wrinkles as well as being credited with promoting the healing of skin injuries such as burns, sunburns,  wounds and eczema.    \r\n\r\nInspired by wording on the iconic British WWII poster, the tube wisely advises to Keep Calm and Carry Balm.

What sets India pale ale apart for much of its consumers (in both its liquid and bar form ;) is that it's made with the highest % of hops.   It's natural earthy, hop-py scent is accentuated with a touch of ginger lime - an invigorating unisex scent.
