Dyed flax fibers found in a prehistoric cave in Georgia suggest the use of woven linen fabrics from wild flax may date back even earlier to 36,000 BP. In the Jewish faith, the only law concerning which fabrics may be interwoven together in clothing is one, which concerns the mixture of linen and wool. Linen is also mentioned in the Bible in Proverbs 31, a passage describing a noble wife.
