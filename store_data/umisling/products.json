We believe it can help. Let's be a catalyst for change in rural Papua New Guinea! \r\n\r\nThis listing is for a gift to Project Baby Bilum in collaboration with Adriel Booker from The Mommyhood Memos. A sling will be sewn in our shop and shipped to Adriel in Australia, once we have 40-50 slings. She will take them with her on their next outreach trip to Papua New Guinea.\r\n\r\nBecome part of a movement that is changing women's lives.\r\n\r\nDo you know someone who would like a ring sling AND support Project Baby Bilum? Check out my listing for the Umi Sling, a 100% organic cotton sling. For every Umi sling sold, I will donate one to the Project. It's babywearing with a purpose!\r\n\r\nWhen going through checkout, just use your mailing address, even though a sling will not be coming to you - that way, we can send you a thank you card :)\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to gift a ring sling in someone's name, include their info in the Note to Seller, so we can send them a thank you card and certificate! \r\n","options":[{"id":25006926,"name":"Give in your name","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25062969,"name":"Give in the name of someone else","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87898598/-/babybilumbuttonLarge.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87898598/-/babybilumbuttonLarge.jpg","width":500,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/78784089/-/thankyoupostcardLARGE.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/78784089/-/thankyoupostcardLARGE.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
