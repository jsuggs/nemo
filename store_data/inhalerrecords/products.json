Cocean are first with Thick as Thieves, which opens with what sounds a bit like a scratchy record and progresses into an American Football style indie song, finishing with some chunky feedback fed riffing. It all fits together well; there’s no sense of disjoint, and closes with a fitting crescendo of guitars and drums. \r\n\r\nLines in Sand are next, and what a pleasant sand their track Moving Away to Start Again is. Reminiscent of such luminaries as Rival Schools, At the Drive-In and Sensefield amongst others it’s the kind of powerful, driving indie rock you thought the likes of Coldplay had managed to wipe out with their insipid drivel.
