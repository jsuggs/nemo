Green tea extract may also help support normal, healthy immune function.\r\n\r\nDreAesthetics Green Tea Extract may promote fat loss and support weight management by increasing energy expenditure! By increasing your overall metabolic rate, green tea can be used in combination with exercise to assist your fat-loss physique goals. Green tea extracts also contain a small amount of natural caffeine, which can help increase energy.*\r\n \r\n9 BENEFITS \r\n\r\n1. Assists Weight Loss\r\nThe ECGC contained in green tea extract limits the negative effects of a fatty diet and smoking. Consumption of green tea extract enhances the process of thermogenesis and increases the rate of metabolism of fat, without increasing the heart rate. Hence, consuming green tea extract can help you lose weight without jitteriness or feelings of anxiety. When you drink the beverage, it makes you feel full and discourages you from eating. The extract also helps your body burn more calories. All these factors make green tea an essential supplement in your weight loss program.\r\n2. Prevents Tooth Decay\r\nGreen tea extract has the ability to destroy plaque-causing bacteria and helps prevent tooth decay.\r\n3. Lowers Cholesterol and Blood Pressure\r\nGreen tea extract helps to lower the LDL (bad) cholesterol that’s responsible for clotting of blood. The extract helps prevent strokes and heart attacks. It promotes the production of HDL (good) cholesterol that removes the plaque in the arteries and keeps them elastic. This lowers your risks of suffering from heart disease. Persons suffering from hypertension also benefit by consuming green tea extract, because it lowers blood pressure.\r\n4. Fights Cancer\r\nGreen tea extract is rich in antioxidants, such as ECGC, that kill cancer cells and prevent their growth without harming healthy tissue. Consumption of this extract is especially beneficial to patients suffering from breast, lung, skin, liver, bladder, pancreatic, stomach or prostate cancer.\r\n5. Prevents Inflammation\r\nArthritic patients find that consuming green tea extract decreases the pain in their joints, because it prevents inflammation which in turn decreases wear and tear of the joints. The extract also slows the breakdown of cartilage and provides relief to patients suffering from arthritis.\r\n6. Controls Blood Sugar Levels\r\nThe polyphenols present in green tea extract reduce the amount of amylase that’s produced by the body. Amylase is the enzyme that converts starch into sugar. Consuming green tea helps to decrease blood sugar levels and thus helps keep diabetes under control.\r\n7. Prevents Liver Disease\r\nGreen tea protects the liver from toxins and thus helps prevent liver disease.\r\n8. Slows the Aging Process\r\nThe antioxidants present in green tea extract are responsible for slowing down the aging process of the body. This helps you look younger.\r\n9. Fights Infection\r\nGreen tea extract is antibacterial and antiviral, and helps the body fight respiratory and digestive infections such as influenza and diarrhea.\r\nGreen tea extract also helps increase the rate of metabolism of carbohydrates, reduces stress, cures headaches, improves digestion, boosts the immune system and increases your life expectancy.","options":[{"id":49889109,"name":"Green Tea Extract 100 Servings (100g)","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129364473/-/green_tea_pe_50__polyphenols.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129364473/-/green_tea_pe_50__polyphenols.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6823512,"name":"WEIGHT LOSS","permalink":"weight-loss","url":"/category/weight-loss"}]},{"id":15341070,"name":"BCAA","permalink":"bcaa","position":2,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bcaa","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-12-05T02:08:25.000Z","description":"BRANCH CHAIN AMINO ACIDS\r\nDieting down will get you shredded, but it might also shave some size from your biceps.
