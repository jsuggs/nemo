Die Hard sound like a more anarchic Animal Collective; Opener In The Garden is surely one of the darkest songs you'll hear this year. The foreboding, deep-pitched vocals set up an album of expanding and developing themes of unearthly transience.\r\n\r\nIt’s brought back to ground – Glasgow, specifically – in the idiosyncratic Here Goes The Rage, with a tornado of guitars that belie the theme of fighting in the street. The peculiar rhythms of Nailed To The Cross are unusually remarkable. Elsewhere, the simplistic beauty of Shiver Through literally does just what it says on the tin. The variety of strange sounds that meld so perfectly are a wonder; it’s an irresistible ode to the many facets of Glasgow, and a perfect introduction to the oncoming spring.\"\r\n \r\nFred Weedon @ The Skinny","options":[{"id":16973493,"name":"Default","price":10.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/51831673/-/12_Inch_Vinyl_Outer_Sleeve__1000.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/51831673/-/12_Inch_Vinyl_Outer_Sleeve__1000.jpg","width":990,"height":991}],"artists":[{"id":100841,"name":"Die Hard","permalink":"die-hard","url":"/artist/die-hard"}],"categories":[{"id":2179196,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"}]},{"id":3924520,"name":"Dam Mantle: Grey EP - HAL001","permalink":"dam-mantle-grey-ep-hal001","position":2,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dam-mantle-grey-ep-hal001","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-06-15T00:59:27.000Z","description":"There’s definitely something in the water in Glasgow; from the city that’s only just given us Rustie and the squelchy aural bliss that is ‘aquacrunk’ emerges an artist who has barely anything in common with the aforementioned, sonically speaking; however Dan Mantle is equally exciting. A Statue That Is Perpetually Unveiled finds a string section unravelling over and over, like a strategically starched vinyl copy of Stravinsky’s Petrushka, its cross-rhythms implying some impossible spatio-temporal territory between modern Cuba and early 20th century Russia. On Yoghurt, oriental lutes ring modulated beyond recognition, toyed with like a child playing with a Speak ‘n’ Spell, implying that this compelling debut EP was as much fun to make as it is to hear.
