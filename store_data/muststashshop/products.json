Vanilla base notes, with kiwi, strawberries and bubble gum, with top notes of juicy grapefruit and fresh bananas\r\n\r\nTahitian Vanilla: A bit fruity and floral, this is not your average vanilla!\r\n\r\nVarsity (for men): A great casual fragrance for men.   This may remind you of Tommy by Tommy Hilfiger.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotable Gnome product Ingredients:\r\n\r\nCocoa Butter is a fat extracted from the cocoa bean.  Its velvety texture and emollient properties make it a popular ingredient in soaps, lotions, and lip balms.  It contains Vitamin E, making it great for softening dry, chapped skin. In its raw form it has a delicious chocolate aroma; however, for our lotion bars, we use a deodorized form so that it doesn’t interfere with the fragrances we add.\r\n \r\nMango Butter is derived from the kernels of the mango tree.  It’s similar to cocoa butter, but it’s a little less oily feeling, and absorbs into the skin very easily.  Mango butter contains Vitamin A, B, and C, as well as the antioxidants quercertin and caffeic acid.  We’ve added just a tad of mango butter to our formula to keep it light and fast-absorbing.\r\n \r\nBeeswax has a multitude of uses: candles, shoe polish, producing batik fabric, and dozens of others.  It’s a staple in many skincare products due to its ability to seal in moisture.  It also keeps our lotion bars nice and firm but not hard.\r\n \r\nFractionated Coconut Oil is a coconut oil from which some of the fatty acids have been removed, leaving behind just a very light but effective moisturizer that absorbs easily into the skin.\r\n \r\nHemp Oil is considered a dry oil, so it feels less greasy than other oils.  It contains oleic acid and linoleic acid, which are both well-absorbed by the skin and are believed to have anti-inflammatory properties.  These acids, as well as gamma linoleic acid, also help the skin retain moisture.\r\n \r\nSweet Almond Oil is light yet very emollient.  Like hemp oil, sweet almond oil offers anti-inflammatory and anti-itch benefits, yet it also has vitamin E, an anti-oxidant and powerful moisturizer.  SAO is a popular ingredient in cosmetic and toiletry products, and makes a great massage oil.","options":[{"id":50423484,"name":"Unscented ","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50423487,"name":"Almond Cake","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50423490,"name":"Butt Naked","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50423493,"name":"Eastern Amber","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50423496,"name":"Fig","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50423499,"name":"Jasmin","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50423502,"name":"Lavendar","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50423505,"name":"Monkey Farts","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50423508,"name":"Tahitian Vanilla","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50423511,"name":"Varsity (Men's Scent)","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.75,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129250896/-/Medium-300x300.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129250896/-/Medium-300x300.jpeg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129250800/-/Mini_Lotion_bar.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129250800/-/Mini_Lotion_bar.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6885957,"name":"Moisturizers","permalink":"moisturizers","url":"/category/moisturizers"}]},{"id":15504303,"name":"Notable Gnome Cuticle Cream","permalink":"notable-gnome-cuticle-cream","position":13,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/notable-gnome-cuticle-cream","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-12T01:42:18.000Z","description":"We’ve formulated this cuticle moisturizer with argan oil, lanolin,  and vitamin E to offer rich lasting moisture, and packaged it in a slim stick tube to offer the ultimate in convenience.

You will also receive an exclusive code for an extended behind the scenes video and tutorials for Halele'a! A KAL for this beautiful cardigan will begin December 26th in the Must Stash Podcast group on Ravelry and we hope you will be able to join us. All orders will be shipped by December 10th. \r\n\r\nHelluva is a 6 ply fingering weight yarn of 100% Superwash Merino which comes in generous 150 grams skeins of 750 yards each.  \r\n\r\nSix colors to choose from:\r\n\r\nKa Pau [kah poo ah] is the blossom. Garnet with gray and black undertones, this color is  rich and vibrant without coming across as bold or garish.\r\n\r\nLana [lah nah] is calm as still waters. Blue bordering on indigo with a burnish of black like the blue waters of the ocean at night. \r\n\r\nMalana [mah law nah] is calming and soothing. This grayish blue skein has tones of amethyst and teal in places. It is a complex skein that knits up into a harmonious tonal color. \r\n\r\nPauo'le [pow oh lay] is never ending. The gray in this skein has undertones of pink/mauve with slight overtones of blue and brown. I love the complex yet neutral natural of this skein. \r\n\r\nPomaika'i [poh' mai kah' ee] is lucky! Emerald green is toned down slightly by a dark glaze and knits up with beautiful depth of greens. \r\n\r\nPualani [poo ah law nee] is Heaven's flower. Mel's yellow is what this skein should be called as she specially requested this color. It is a zesty yellow with cream and butter tones to soften but it is still a show stopper! \r\n\r\n\r\nALL PRE ORDERS WILL MAIL ON DECEMBER 10TH BARRING ANY NATURAL OR SUPERNATURAL DISASTER. \r\n\r\n<font size=\"3\" color=\"aqua\">**After the pre orders close on November 20th, the skein will return to their full price of $40 each.**</font>\r\n\r\n<font size=\"5\" color=\"yellow\">EVERY skein is hand made and therefore unique.
