On clear vinyl.\r\n\r\nSide A - Tired\r\nSide B - Casual Hopelessness / Tired (alt version)\r\n\r\nAlso available on iTunes!\r\n\r\nTomorrows Tulips formed on August 15th 2009 when alex bought a piccalo snare drum at the thrift store and handed it to Christina. The two spent 3 nights at Mike Mchugh distillery studio organizing some sort of an idea on how to play together. While socializing with Mike and discussing what to call the group it became vaguely clear what to do. The duo consists of stripped down pop that often disregards professionalism in anyway shape and form. Absolute Fearlessness prevails in creating songs that revolve around subject matter that consists of flowers, happiness, love, haircuts, friends, and un-macho-ism. TT will continue to make songs on cassette tape and post them on the internet and hand them out at shows until the release of the \"real\" recordings that were recorded onto two inch tape at the distillery all analog studio in late 2009.
