Six months after I stayed there it was demolished, to make way for something more up to date. This photograph was taken through the net curtain of the room I was in for the first 2 nights. The third night I was moved to a front-looking room, which, rather than 70s in style as this room was, was more 90s with brass bedside lights, pastel coloured linen but an amazing view of the River.
