Ultra rare in such conditions.\r\n\r\nIn 1989, a group of friends from Seixal, inspired by a shared musical taste, decided to form a band. Their name was born from the joining of their own initials: R.A.M.P. (Ricardo, António, Miguel, Paulo).\r\n\r\nThis new adventure would gain shape when Ricardo invited Rui, an old school friend, to take on the role of vocalist. From that moment on, hours and hours were spent in a friend’s garage rehearsing and composing. Their effort would soon pay off, when they went on stage of Rock Rendez-Vous, a mythical venue in Lisboa, putting on a Show that captured the media and critics’ attention due to RAMP’s mind blowing music and passionate performance. By that time, Sapo, their previous bass player, had already joined the band, which had adopted a more exigent posture than ever.\r\n\r\nMotivated by the excellent reviews of their live shows and a constantly growing public demand, RAMP focused their efforts for what would be their first recording - a demo tape that would be used to pursue a record deal.\r\n\r\nIn 1992 RAMP’s first record “Thoughts” (a Mini LP with six songs) hit the market through Polygram and three video-clips arose from the album: ‘Try Again’, ‘Last Child’ and ‘Thoughts’.\r\n\r\nUnanimously acclaimed by the Press as the truly break-through act of the past few years in Portugal, this record definitely marked the beginning of a new era intt the Portuguese modern music world.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\nA1\t\t The Comediants\t4:54\r\nA2\t\t Disillusions\t4:21\t\r\nA3\t\t March To Death\t3:15\t\r\nB1\t\t Thoughts\t4:11\t\r\nB2\t\t The Last Child\t4:00\t\r\nB3\t\t Try Again\t3:56\t\r\n","options":[{"id":33067312,"name":"Default","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103755268/-/RAMP.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103755268/-/RAMP.JPG","width":500,"height":501}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5070697,"name":"Lp's","permalink":"lp-s","url":"/category/lp-s"}]}]
