This closeness creates a heavy, dense piece of wood that I have sanded smooth so that the painting feels good in your hand. I use liquitex acrylic paint on my art so that the colors are bright, rich, and bold. I apply three coats of polycrylic to give the paintings a high gloss finish.\r\n\r\nThe juxtaposition of the organic wooden shapes, and the perfect circles create a work of art that is visually pleasing to the eye, and works well in any interior. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat inspires me:\r\n\r\nI am inspired by unique objects that I see in nature: hollowed out trees, wildflowers, salamander spots, clear, cold mountain streams, fungi, rattlesnake skin, moss, lichen on rocks, mountain rain pouring straight down, the Great Smoky Mountains, creek bottoms, Tennessee in the cool and green spring, the Grand Canyon in winter, and wide open spaces.\r\n\r\nSome recent clients include:\r\n\r\n- CBS's \" Two Broke Girls\" Season 3\r\n\r\n- NBC's \"Parenthood\" Seasons 3 and 4\r\n\r\n- Mcgraw- Hill Publishing (The Aims of Argument, College Text, Front Cover)\r\n\r\n- Memphis Children's Hospital \r\n\r\n- Martha Stewart (2012 and 2008) seasons : \r\nhttp://www.marthastewart.com/902181/tree-ring-paintings\r\n- University of Southern California Student Health Center\r\n\r\n-Lendrum Fine Art Los Angeles, CA\r\n\r\n- Nationwide Insurance Collaborative Space, Columbus, Ohio\r\n\r\n My work has been featured on Apartmenttherapy.com,Dwell.com, Huffingtonpost.com, style carrot.com, moderninkmag.com, urbanoutfitters.com,makezine.com.\r\n\r\nPlease watch my new video of me creating some Tree Ring Paintings. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAidQt1bO3g","options":[{"id":40434177,"name":"Default","price":175.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":32.0,"amount_with_others":12.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":12.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122129094/-/DSCN6834.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122129094/-/DSCN6834.jpg","width":1024,"height":768},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122129118/-/icm_fullxfull.28860296_ggpcu0arnvso8040cs00.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122129118/-/icm_fullxfull.28860296_ggpcu0arnvso8040cs00.jpg","width":1608,"height":1072},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122129079/-/DSCN6831.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122129079/-/DSCN6831.jpg","width":1024,"height":768},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122129085/-/DSCN6832.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122129085/-/DSCN6832.jpg","width":1024,"height":768},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122129091/-/DSCN6833.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122129091/-/DSCN6833.jpg","width":1024,"height":768}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1940022,"name":"Tree Ring Paintings","permalink":"tree-ring-paintings","url":"/category/tree-ring-paintings"}]}]
