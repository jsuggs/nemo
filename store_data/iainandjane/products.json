The scarf embodies the form of a thin red line, and the embroidered motto refers to the origins of the title. The phrase ‘the thin red line’ derives from the Crimean War, when during the Battle of Balaclava on 25th October 1854 the heavily depleted British Army’s 93rd regiment faced a Russian cavalry charge with a line of men only two deep instead of the conventional four. The soldiers were led by Sir Colin Campbell, who is said to have told his men ’There is no retreat from here, men. You must die where you stand’. \r\n\r\nForsyth and Pollard’s interest in coded communication and secret societies first emerged as part of their ‘Silent Sound’ project produced with J. Spaceman for A Foundation during the 2006 Liverpool Biennial.\r\n\r\n<b>This limited edition is available exclusively from 176/Zabludowicz Collection.

Iain Forsyth & Jane Pollard selected the track Judgement by Sister Mary Nelson. This is how they described the project:\r\n\r\n<i>“Judgement is a haunting track that seems to truly embody the spirit of the Anthology. We wanted to step inside it, to understand it, and to echo its conspiratorial sense of endeavour and purpose. It's unquestionably a call to action - so we took to the streets, to Trafalgar Square, and set about spreading the word of the song. This is our cover version.” </i>\r\n\r\nThis is an unlimited edition supplied unframed and unmounted. The print is not signed or numbered by the artists.
