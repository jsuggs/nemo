Essential oils of West Indies bay leaf and lime peel combine to give the bay rum fragrance its distinctive woody, sweet, and spicy scent. Organic and palm-free vegetable glycerine is a natural humectant, pulling moisture into the skin.\r\n\r\nNow here's the magic: we added wild harvested frankincense powder and holy basil (Tulsi, a sacred healing herb) hydrosol for their anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial and healing properties, said to be helpful in skin with excess oiliness or clogged pores. The result is a deeply therapeutic scent that is light and refreshing, never overwhelming.\r\n\r\nNot manly; Godly.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO USE\r\n------------\r\nuse as an after shave splash to soothe, tone and tighten skin. Can also be used on neck and chest as a light \"cologne\".
