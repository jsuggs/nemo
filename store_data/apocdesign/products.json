The new and improved COOLEST COLORING BOOK EVER* (*As determined by the Northeast Chapter of the Mid-West Coalition for Cool) has arrived. 20 black and white illustrations by the indomitable APOC. This new and improved print run leaves the BACK side of each ILLUSTRATED page blank! Tear one out, and you won't have to sacrifice the image on the other side. Are you a marker jockey? There's no image to wreck on the other side! Designed for maximum refrigerator coverage, there's a little something for everyone in this book. Legend has it that while most kids had Dr. Seuss read to them, APOC was dosed with either HOT ROD Magazine or CARtoons on a nightly basis during his most formative years.
