For the colour I use a turquoise merino wool, periwinkle blue merino wool, or hand dyed \"greens\" merino wool. With this I combine multicoloured blue merino silk blend, white soy silk fibre, and a bit of peacock shimmer to give it sparkle. The button is a tarnished brass shell shaped piece, perfectly in place.  The button and button hole are handstitched with a thread that matches the theme of the cuff.\r\n\r\nThis cuff is perfectly cozy on a chilly day, and perfectly cool on a warm one. The wool is not itchy and is surprisingly soft.\r\n\r\nYou are purchasing a custom made cuff, so what you recieve will be unique and may not be exactly the same as what you see here. \r\n\r\nSizing is as follows:\r\n\r\nSmall - wrist circumference from 3.5 - 5.5 inches\r\nMedium - wrist circumference from 5.5 - 6.5 inches\r\nLarge - wrist circumference 6.5 - 7.5 inches\r\nX-Large - wrist circumference - 7.5 + inches\r\n\r\nThe photo shown depicts the \"periwinkle blue\" option, you may contact me for an example of the other colour options.
