The pendant is approx. 4in. accross and 2in at widest point. \r\n\r\nThe necklace is finished with a handmade sterling silver clasp specifically desinged to go with the piece.

The pendant is artfully suspended at three points to form a small geometric offset to the curve of the pendant.\r\n\r\nThe necklace is finished with a handmade sterling silver clasp designed to fit the feel of the piece. A detail only you may see, it's a reminder of the unique handmade nature and attention to detail of every piece. \r\n\r\nEach necklace is a handmade work of art and will have slight variations. No two are just alike, part of their unique beauty. Similarly, each person's chemistry is different and changes the necklace over time, slightly burnishing it in places. This adds further depth and contrast, changing slightly with you over time, yet remaining essentially the same.\r\n\r\nAlso available with a champagne quartz (pictures coming soon)\r\n\r\nOne necklace is ready to ship. Subsequent orders, please allow 1-2 weeks to ship. If you must have it sooner, please contact me. If you must have it sooner, just let me know and I will do my best to meet your needs.

A genuine 2.5 mm white sapphire is the focal point of this modern, streamlined design. \r\n\r\nThe gorgeous white sapphire is luminous against the warm oxidized dome. A textured \"spacer\" band is added for added interest and contrast and then the final touch is a 2.3mm thin band set with three genuine 1.3 mm conflict free VS diamonds. The spacer band can also be made with a plain brush finish or with a wider 5mm version. More options here: http://www.etsy.com/shop/lolide?ref=si_shop\r\n\r\nPlease note that the dark oxidized dome on this ring will burnish with wear, creating a more subtle gunmetal finish over time. Since everyone's body's chemistry is different this process varies from person to person, the end result being unique to each individual. The dome can be re-oxidized periodically by a jeweler if desired.\r\n\r\nThe sapphire band can also serve as an engagment ring on it's own or be worn with other band combinations (see last picture for an exapmle with an additional white sapphire band) so you can truly make this set uniquely yours.

A genuine 2.5 mm white sapphire is the focal point of this modern, streamlined design. \r\n\r\nThe gorgeous white sapphire is luminous against the warm oxidized dome which sits atop a hand textured band. The focal piece is then flanked by two plain bands of differing widths and a stunning yet simple diamond \"wedding\" band.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the dark oxidized dome on this ring will burnish with wear, creating a more subtle gunmetal finish over time. Since everyone's body's chemistry is different this process varies from person to person, the end result being unique to each individual. The dome can be re-oxidized periodically by a jeweler if desired.\r\n\r\nThe sapphire band can also serve as an engagment ring on it's own or be worn with other band combinations (see last picture for an exapmle with an additional white sapphire band) so you can truly make this set uniquely yours.

The cut inset draws in the eye and adds an extra desgin element to make this ring stand out from others you will see.\r\n\r\nThis listing includes one 13mm palladium sterling silver band with a 6mm bezel set certified Moissanite coupled with a 2.5mm certified Moissanite flush set in the band. However, if you'd like a somewhat smaller (less wide) band and/or smaller stone, feel free to contact me and we can discuss your needs.\r\n\r\n***This listing includes a 2mm simple wedding band. If you would like just the wide band you may choose that option. The 2mm band can also be substituted with a 2.3mm band set with three VS diamonds, also available as an option.\r\n\r\nI created these rings to be versatile for any gender or couple and to accommodate mixing and matching to create the perfect set just for you. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: The metal in this ring is a palldium sterling silver, an alloy where sterling is mixed with valuable palladium for additional strength, durability and value. This ring set is also available in other metals. Please contact me with your ring size(s) for exact quote or quotes on other metals.\r\n\r\nView more wedding rings here: http://lolide.bigcartel.com/category/weddings\r\n\r\n**This ring can also be ordered with diamonds, sapphires, or other materials such as white gold or palladium, as well as various widths. The bands are also sold separately. I am happy to help you with a custom order incorporating your particular needs.\r\n\r\nThese rings are designed to be combined with other bands in this collection to create the perfect matching his/her, his/his, or her/her designs - just contact me with questions or special requests.\r\n\r\nThis ring is made with recycled materials and conflict free stones! Please allow 4 weeks for construction. If you must have it sooner, please contact me and I will do my best to meet your needs!\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Please size for a wide band when ordering. Wider rings often take a larger ring size and these rings cannot be easily resized. I will make the ring to your specification and it's always best to get the right fit the first time.
