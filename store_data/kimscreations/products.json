Using a soft measuring tape, measure around the belly just in front of the hind legs. Pull the tape measure snug but not too tight. Tutus are made with an elastic waistband for comfort. There is a gap under the belly to prevent soiling. \r\n\r\nSizing Guide\r\nWe highly recommend measuring your pet using the sizing guide below. Go up one size if they are in between sizes or if they have a lot of hair.\r\n \r\n               Waist          Tutu Length\r\nXXS         6-9\"              4\"\r\nXS         9.5-12\"           4\"\r\nS          12.5-15\"         4\"\r\nM         15.5-18\"         4\"\r\nL          18.5-21\"         5\"\r\nXL       21.5-24\"          6\"\r\nXXL    24.5-28\"           7\"\r\nXXXL  29.5-32\"          8\"","options":[{"id":13122154,"name":"XXS","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":13122156,"name":"XS","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":13122158,"name":"S","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":13122160,"name":"M","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":13122162,"name":"L","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":13122164,"name":"XL","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":13122166,"name":"XXL","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":13122168,"name":"XXXL","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38488742/-/greenandhotpink.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38488742/-/greenandhotpink.jpg","width":280,"height":296}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2189706,"name":"Tutus","permalink":"tutus","url":"/category/tutus"}]},{"id":3947988,"name":"Tutu Dress","permalink":"tut-dress","position":2,"price":55.0,"default_price":55.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tut-dress","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-06-18T23:01:39.000Z","description":"Custom Hand made Tutu Dress.

It won't be exactly like the one in the picture. I can use any colors you'd like as well. Prices are by size, not by color. \r\n\r\nFor Tutus:\r\nMeasure around the waistline to determine which of the following sizes are most appropriate for your little one.  For best fit, it is recommended that you order your tutu one inch smaller than the actual waist measurement.\r\n\r\nEach  Tutu is custom made to order based on the specifications you provide.  In each of our tutus, waist bands are made with 1\" non-roll elastic, and will stretch an addtional 2-3\" to allow for growth. I can also make them with Ribbon waists, if you would like a ribbon waist please let me know, and use your childs exact waist measurement for best fit with no gaps.\r\n \r\nIf you are ordering for someone who you dont know their measurements, you can use these average sizes. Please remember that the sizes are made an average size and mat not be exactly right.\r\n\r\nFor Tutus:\r\nMeasure around the waist and then  from waist to length you would like the the tutu to be.\r\n \r\n\r\nNewborn to 6 months:\r\n\r\nwaist 14 inches length 6/7 inches\r\n\r\n6 -12 months:\r\n\r\nwaist 16 inches length 7/8 inches\r\n\r\n12months - 2T:\r\n\r\nwaist 18 inches length 8 inches (perfect with our bloomers)\r\n\r\n12 months - 2T:\r\n\r\nwaist 18 inches length 10 inches (perfect portrait length)\r\n\r\n2T/3T:\r\n\r\nwaist 19 inches length 10 inches\r\n\r\n4T/5T:\r\n\r\nwaist 20 inches length 10/11 inches\r\n\r\n5/6:\r\n\r\nwaist 21 inches length 11/12 inches\r\n \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":13121828,"name":"Newborn-6 month tutu","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":13121832,"name":"6-12 month tutu","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":13121836,"name":"12 month-2T tutu short","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":13121838,"name":"12 month-2T tutu long","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":13121842,"name":"2/3T tutu","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":13121846,"name":"4/5tTutu","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":13121850,"name":"Custom Size Adult Tutu","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38485614/-/06182011414.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38485614/-/06182011414.jpg","width":750,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2189706,"name":"Tutus","permalink":"tutus","url":"/category/tutus"}]}]
