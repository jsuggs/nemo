It has a little chip on the underside (top left in the image) and a spot of crazing. \r\n\r\nI can just see it being used for your next Sunday dinner, carrying the vegetables you so lovingly prepared or - if you are mad about cakes (like me *coughs*) it would present those nicely as well. As always, who am I to tell you what to use it for, though. For all we know, you might want to hang it up on your wall...\r\n\r\nPlease contact us before buying to arrange local collection or get a quote for p&p.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":24127392,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75031224/-/serving-plate.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75031224/-/serving-plate.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75031704/-/platter-underside.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75031704/-/platter-underside.jpg","width":1000,"height":667}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3694335,"name":"J & G Meakin","permalink":"j-g-meakin","url":"/category/j-g-meakin"},{"id":3633097,"name":"Vintage tableware","permalink":"vintage-tableware","url":"/category/vintage-tableware"}]},{"id":7643157,"name":"Studio J & G Meakin sugar bowl","permalink":"studio-j-g-meakin-sugar-bowl","position":48,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/studio-j-g-meakin-sugar-bowl","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-23T10:09:00.000Z","description":"This is such a lovely totally retro design - the Topic range from J and G Meakin Studios.

Mr More Timer has a particular penchant for a garibaldi with his but really the big question should be, from which cup do you imbibe your morning tipple? It's not just the bean that gives you that kick and this cup and saucer set is the perfect oracle from which to enjoy your favourite blend.\r\n\r\nThis is Lord Nelson Ware from Staffordshire in good old Blighty and the design is rather pleasantly called Amanda. Lovely. The set consists of one small coffee cup, perfect for that elevenses treat, and a matching saucer, upon which to balance that all important biscuit based weapon of choice, and we have 6 sets available. There is a rather elegant flower motif inside the cup too. Tese cups and saucers do have a little crazing to them but no actual damage at all.\r\n\r\nThe cup measures 75mm across and 60mm high. The saucer comes in at a diameter of 120mm.\r\n\r\nPlease do drop us a line to ask about collection, delivery and possible extra sets.","options":[{"id":26160849,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81679134/-/Amandacup4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81679134/-/Amandacup4.jpg","width":1000,"height":771},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81679149/-/Amandacup7.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81679149/-/Amandacup7.jpg","width":1000,"height":829},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81679161/-/Amandacup5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81679161/-/Amandacup5.jpg","width":1000,"height":886},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81679173/-/Amandacup2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81679173/-/Amandacup2.jpg","width":1000,"height":799},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81679185/-/Amandacup1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81679185/-/Amandacup1.jpg","width":1000,"height":794}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3633097,"name":"Vintage tableware","permalink":"vintage-tableware","url":"/category/vintage-tableware"}]},{"id":8307357,"name":"Lord Nelson Ware, Cream Jug and Sugar Bowl Set","permalink":"lord-nelson-ware-cream-jug-and-sugar-bowl-set","position":50,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lord-nelson-ware-cream-jug-and-sugar-bowl-set","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-01T10:47:54.000Z","description":"A rather elegant elevenses treat here.
