This kit is designed for custom applications, and will not work on a stock XS 650 without modification.  \r\n\r\nIncluded in the kit are new intake gaskets, 1-2 mild steel TIG welded intake manifold, rubber coupler, and hose clamps.  Carburetor is not included.  A jet change is usually needed when switching to a 1-2 manifold.  Another thing that I have noticed is the stock slide return spring in mikuni carburetors is not strong enough to close the slide with the increased velocity of the intake charge.  Doubling up the return spring fixes the problem easily.  \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":44677410,"name":"Painted Hi Temp Matte Black","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":45483033,"name":"Raw","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125648145/-/Intake_mani_xs650_black.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125648145/-/Intake_mani_xs650_black.jpg","width":1200,"height":797},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125179419/-/xs_650_Intake_01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125179419/-/xs_650_Intake_01.jpg","width":1200,"height":797},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125179452/-/xs_650_Intake_03.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125179452/-/xs_650_Intake_03.jpg","width":1200,"height":797}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4094964,"name":"xs 650","permalink":"xs-650","url":"/category/xs-650"}]},{"id":11004159,"name":"Counter Balance Cycles T-Shirt","permalink":"counter-balance-cycles-t-shirt","position":2,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/counter-balance-cycles-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-05-07T13:54:36.000Z","description":"Premium T-shirt with Counter Balance Cycles logo.
