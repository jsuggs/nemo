I consider these as \"ready made\" forms to paint on. You can unfold them and then refold them into any shape you want. Here I just made a simple bowl shape which distorts the face in a crazy way. I've been concentrating on portraiture as of late, just to try and get a handle on it. There are endless possibilities for shapes when using these containers. I made a series using this format of still images from the original movie of King Kong. Every still in that movie is beautiful like a gorgeous painting with a violent but innocent ape as the subject. I also did a few skateboarder ones based on the photos of Glen E. Friedman of skateboarding legends Tony Alva and others in the 1970's skating empty pools in California.

He is a local musician and plays in various bands around town. Hanging around Jake is like hanging around a time machine, because he seems to have stepped right out of the 1970's. It reminds me of that movie with Brendan Fraser (Encino Man) when he was a recently thawed caveman hanging around some high school kids teaching each other life lessons. Actually I never saw that movie and I'm totally guessing at the plot. \r\nThis is a small 3- dimensional work that comes off the wall 2.5 inches. It is almost 5\" wide and 4\" tall.
