The Sisters cushion measures approx 18.5\" x 12\" x 4\" and is stuffed with polyfil.\r\n\r\nWe are lucky to have a Pendleton Woolen Mill nearby and incorporate their quality textiles into our work whenever possible. We also use knitted wool sweaters and wool blankets after they have been felted. All were washed, usually twice, before being transformed into our original designs. While most materials are now color safe, we do NOT recommend machine wash due to the wool content.
