Sushift™ - This leash has been designed and purposely built for drop kneers. We wanted to have more length on the urethane coil to allow drop kneers to have more freedom of movement when drop kneeing so we've built a leash with a longer coil and also a lighter urethane. This makes it more comfortable to drop knee with this leash as it's lighter then the prone leashes and feels looser. No more leash dragging in your knee and around your elbow and arm while drop kneeing. Of course the leash will work fine for prone, it's just a bit longer. Tested and approved in Tahiti, California, Europe and Hawaii.
