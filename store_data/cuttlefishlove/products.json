Looking for a steampunk fascinator that's got something a bit different about it? Made up of 3 intricately folded kanzashi flowers in burnt gold, oyster grey, turquoise and aqua silk, it also uses found pieces of silver coloured jewelry (may be real silver but I suspect not!) to adorn and create a really lush and exotic twist to the general steampunk theme. These silver parts will move as you do, drawing the eye to your incredible headpiece.\r\n\r\n3 paper clock faces (sprayed with a matt varnish for sturdiness) peek out from behind the main flower and pearl coloured beads and brass buttons add the finishing touches to this elaborate handmade piece.\r\n\r\nThe size of the whole piece is roughly 6.5 inches by 5inches (including the length of the dangles)\r\nThe flowers are:\r\n\r\nLarge flower - 3.5 inches diameter- Outer layer: Burnt gold silk (2 petals aqua silk), middle layer: oyster grey silk (2 petals light turquoise silk), inner layer: taupe silk (2 petals mid turquoise silk). Large brass button in the centre. An elaborate silver coloured (possibly real, but unlikely!) anklet from India is attached between the flower and the felt backing. 2 large crocodile clips are fixed to the back.\r\n\r\nMedium Flower - nearly 3 inches diameter- Outer layer: Burnt gold silk. Inner layer: taupe silk. Pearl coloured bead in the centre. A silver coloured dangly earring is attached between the flower and the backing felt. and a crocodile clip is fixed on the back.\r\n\r\nSmall flower - nearly 2 inches diameter - Outer layer: burnt gold silk. Inner Layer: aqua silk. 3 small pearl coloured beads in the centre.\r\n\r\nAll flowers and clocks are backed with brown felt.
