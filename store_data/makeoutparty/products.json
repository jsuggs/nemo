The follow-up to &#8220;Something to Make You Stay&#8221; features 11 brand new songs which return the band to their emo roots, bringing to mind classic Cap&#8217;n Jazz and Texas is the Reason. The quartet&#8217;s first LP will prove to be a more mature step in their growth as a band, and expands on the style they&#8217;ve been building for themselves since forming in late 2004.\r\n\r\n\tRecorded with producer Jesse Goins only 6 months after releasing their debut, &#8220;Lengths &#38; Limits&#8221; touches on the truely emo sound of the late 90&#8217;s, the sound that was here one year and gone the next. Tracklisting is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Sparks\r\n\r\n2. Back To Your Ways\r\n\r\n3. Conditional Needs\r\n\r\n4. Lengths &#38; Limits\r\n\r\n5. General Sherman Lost His Arm\r\n\r\n6. Cut Two Years\r\n\r\n7. Left You Behind\r\n\r\n8. Are We Sinking?\r\n\r\n9. Don&#8217;t Hold Your Breath\r\n\r\n10.
