iPhone cases tend to be much easier, quicker and cheaper to get whereas certain Nokia or LG models are much harder to find and far more expensive to get (keep in mind that if you do happen to have a model that does not cost me more than £2 or $3 for me to get then I will offer a discount at my discretion!)\r\n\r\nLarger cases such as iPads and Nintendos use much more of my supplies sometimes almost triple the amount of cabochons (cute plastic pieces) than an average phone case so the increase in price is necessary.\r\n\r\nEither choose from the examples above in the photos,(https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/108944152/custom-decoden-case-for-ipads-inc-minis?ref=v1_other_1) OR what you would personally like and include your design preference in the PayPal message or etsy message :\r\nFor example ;
