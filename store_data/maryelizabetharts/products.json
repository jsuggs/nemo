We went on a boat trip and stopped at a tiny island for lunch. There was this incredible tree with gnarled branches right on the edge of the water. The tree seemed so out of place on such a perfect tropical island. \r\n\r\nThis painting is of the little tiny island, surrounded with warm perfectly blue water. The island was lush, full of exotic fruit trees, flowers and tropical birds, but this one tree, dry and sun-bleached desperately clung to the beach, trying not to be washed away. This tree made an impression on me and I've tried to capture the way I felt while looking at in this painting. \r\n\r\nWhile the platter is functional, it is meant mainly for decorative purposes. Special, occasional use with finger foods such as cheese, sushi or cookies and cup-cakes is encouraged. Do not use sharp serving utensils of any kind. This platter would be fabulous displayed hanging on your wall or as a decorative plate for your mantel or side table.\r\n\r\n:: The platter is16.5\"Wx10.25\"Dx1\"H\r\n:: Hand-painted with non-toxic porcelain paint on Porcelain\r\n:: Clean with a soft damp cloth.

His work is a style I've always been drawn towards. I first learned how to paint with oils by copying works of the Old Impressionist Masters such as Van Gogh, Monet, Renoir, Matisse and many more. I studied their works to learn about technique, color theory and the freedom of their impressionism brushstrokes. This is the first time I've ever painted one of the old Masters on porcelain. I hope to create a series of these pieces to pay homage to the artists who have helped teach me what I know today. \r\n\r\nYou can see my other canvas paintings in my paintings gallery here: http://www.maryelizabetharts.com/?page/84283/painting-gallery\r\n\r\n****************************************\r\nCOPYRIGHT © 2007 Mary Elizabeth Arts, LLC\r\nI do report Trademark and Copyright Infringement.

Below are the details of my designs.\r\n\r\n**Winter:\r\nThe design is elegant, Gothic and classic.\r\nI've been painting trees my whole life and am continually drawn to the grace I find in bare tree branches silhouetted against a stark winter sky.\r\n\r\n♫♫Spring:\r\nThe design is bright, elegant and friendly. These elegant black beauties are jeweled with two-toned pink and cherry blossoms.\r\n\r\n☼☼Summer:\r\nThe summer trees have a full canopy of lush two-toned green leaves to show the sun's highlights and shadows across the leaves.\r\n\r\n♣♣Autumn:\r\nThe delicate branches are jeweled with bright orange, red and shimming metallic gold fall leaves. There are a few leaves \"fallen\" near the base of the tree. \r\n\r\nThe mug you receive will not be the exact one pictured but it will be nearly identical. No two mugs are alike as each is uniquely hand-painted. \r\n*************************************\r\nCOPYRIGHT © 2007 Mary Elizabeth Arts, LLC\r\nI do report Trademark and Copyright Infringement.\r\nIt is illegal to copy my work, photos or descriptions or ask another artist to do so.","options":[{"id":25296027,"name":"1 Four Seasons Mug","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.95,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/78750117/-/Etsy3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/78750117/-/Etsy3.jpg","width":1000,"height":864},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/78750093/-/etsy6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/78750093/-/etsy6.jpg","width":1000,"height":677},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/78750105/-/etsy1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/78750105/-/etsy1.jpg","width":1000,"height":791},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/78750051/-/Etsy4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/78750051/-/Etsy4.jpg","width":1000,"height":773},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/78750069/-/etsy5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/78750069/-/etsy5.jpg","width":1000,"height":726}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2901971,"name":"Everyday","permalink":"everyday","url":"/category/everyday"}]},{"id":7930701,"name":"Love Birds Cardinal Glass Ornament ","permalink":"love-birds-cardinal-glass-ornament","position":56,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/love-birds-cardinal-glass-ornament","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-10T23:24:03.000Z","description":"♫ Two little love birds, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g ♫\r\n\r\n♦ This glass ornament features a bright red male and a fluffy female cardinal wooing and cooing on a winter’s day.

This painting is full of energy and the bright yellow of the fields plays off the dark sky to create a stunning snapshot captured with paint. \r\n\r\n♥This is a painting that my dad and I created together. We both enjoy painting on our own but occasionally create big canvases together. Sometimes we'll paint side by side, one of use painting one half, while he paints the other, and then we'll switch sides. Or sometimes I'll paint a layer, and then he'll paint a layer and then we keep switching off until the painting is complete. These combined paintings are always a lot of fun, and since we both have different skill sets, we are able to create different types of paintings together that we never could on our own.

Festive, elegant and one of a kind. Notice the snow nestled on the branches and on the base of the glasses. The white snow contrasts beautiful against red wines. While the delicate black branches contrast against white wines. \r\n\r\n♥ These glasses are original, one-of-a-kind works of art. They would be lovely for entertaining this holiday season or for simply enjoying a bottle of wine with friends on cozy winter nights. \r\n\r\n:: This is a listing for 2 stemless wine glasses\r\n:: They are perfect for water, wine and juice\r\n:: Hand-painted with non-toxic glass paints\r\n:: Perfect for red, white and pink wines\r\n:: Dishwasher safe\r\n\r\n♥ I love this stemless style of wine glasses for many reasons:\r\n\r\n:: These stemless glasses are comfortable to cradle in your hands\r\n:: Modern in style and less likely to be accidentally knocked over\r\n:: Easy to wash as they fit on the top rack of the dish-washer. \r\n\r\nThe glasses you receive will not be the exact glasses pictured but they will be nearly identical. No two glasses are alike as each is hand-painted.
