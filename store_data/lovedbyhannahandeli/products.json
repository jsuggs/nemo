Be free from fear. Be free to stand up for what you believe is true. Be free to run, and jump and play.  Be free to be little. Be free to be you!\r\n\r\nThis is a special \"Loved by Hannah and Eli\" shirt with a special meaning and cause behind it. \r\nLilly's Mom writes....\r\n\"Lilly was born on July 19th, 2012 , and since that day she has been fighting. Fighting the odds. When she was 6 days old I found a small bump on her chest. I immediately took her to her pediatrician and she also showed much concern. That same day Lilly had a ultrasound, and an X-ray to try to determine what the eraser size bump on her chest was. The results came back that it was a hemangioma ( a birthmark). They said it wouldn't get much larger and should go away by the time she turned one. As I sat their holding my 6 day old baby hearing this news I knew it was wrong. I knew I wanted to be overjoyed it was just a birthmark and my Lilly was healthy but something inside told me no. Weeks went by and it got bigger and bigger. I researched and talked to every dermatologist that would speak to me and they all made that feeling I had inside stronger. I knew it wasn't a birthmark. I fought and fought for 3 months for the hospital to run more tests but all they said was, tests have already been done. I was told I had post pardon depression and I WANTED the bump to be more than it was. When Lilly was 14 weeks old the bump was as big as a golf ball. It was so big her chin would rest on it. It was effecting her breathing when she slept because it was so large. I couldn't take it anymore. I took her into the local emergency room and demanded her to be transferred to a hospital that would take me seriously. They held us their for 3 days refusing to do anything but monitor her while she slept. Lilly's pediatrician fought right along with me and demanded a transfer. And after 3 days we were finally on our way in an ambulance to children's hospital Los Angeles. That trip was the longest ride to la I have ever had. Watching my sweet 3 month old baby strapped to a gurney in a ambulance on a road to the unknown. When we arrived to children's hospital Los Angeles 6 surgeons came in and felt the bump, asked questions and they only agreed to do an ultrasound. When they did the ultrasound they came to the conclusion it wasn't a hemangioma , that it was a tumor. But they were POSITIVE it was nothing. That they would remove it in 3 months and that would be it. I had that same feeling in my stomach and knew these doctors were wrong. I refused to wait the 3 months to have it removed. They told me I was being selfish for demanding her surgery when she was only 3 months old and it was to dangerous for a baby. That their were other children that needed surgery more than Lilly. After much fighting , they agreed to remove it the next week. I will never forget walking into that surgery room knowing this was beginning. And wondering if I was going crazy, was I doing this to my baby or was I right? The surgery took an hour and a half and when we met with the surgeon he was very sure if looked like nothing. He said he was sure he got all of it, but it appeared to have grown out from between the rib bones. He said pathology would biopsy be mass and get a call in a few weeks.\r\n I got that phone call on November 14th,  2012 to be told the biopsy came back. Lilly had Ewing's sarcoma a very rare form of bone and soft tissue cancer. The surgeon went on to tell me how amazed he was and how sorry. And that if I would have let him wait the 3 months they wanted to it would have spread to her lungs. That she would have passed before she was one year old. He proceeded to tell me he could only find 3 other known cases of a baby being BORN with Ewing's sarcoma. The other 3 children didn't make it to one year old. They told us to enjoy our weekend and give Lilly the best weekend she could ever have and be at chla Monday morning to be admitted.  We all knew what that ment. We took Lilly to see Santa since it was 1 week before thanksgiving and I will never forget looking at her sitting on Santa's  lap praying it wouldn't be the only time. We took Lilly into chla that Monday and our entire life changes. Lilly had 2 surgeries that week ( one to put a broviac line in to administer chemo) and 1 for a bone marrow aspiration. We never got to go home. I never got to take my Lilly back to the house she was brought home from the hospital after bring born. Our new home was in the middle of Los Angeles in a hospital. We lived between the hospital and the Ronald McDonald house for 9 months. Lilly had 14 rounds of chemotherapy at 75% adult strength and 8 surgeries , one including removing a portion of her chest wall. All of this before she even turned one year old . Lilly went threw every day fighting cancer with a smile. She never gave  into fear and never let cancer touch her beautiful smile. She is the happiest child I've ever witnessed and cancer never touched it. She would walk the halls in her walker waving at all the other kids in their beds , blowing kisses and spreading hope. We walked those halls every single day for 9 months Lilly as happy as she could be. She never gave  up. And on July 9 th she was officially cancer free. Free of the fight for her life. Lilly is a child that never gave up hope. Never gave into cancer. And I'm her proud mommy\"\r\n\r\nYou can follow more of Lilly's journey on InstaGram @lillybumpus_giveforward ","options":[{"id":43292460,"name":"2t","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43926855,"name":"4t","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43926858,"name":"6t","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126264060/-/lilly_4.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126264060/-/lilly_4.JPG","width":1024,"height":1024},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124627788/-/be_free_team_lilly.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124627788/-/be_free_team_lilly.JPG","width":480,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124627797/-/detail.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124627797/-/detail.JPG","width":480,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126263994/-/lilly_3.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126263994/-/lilly_3.JPG","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126264015/-/LOVEDBYHANNAHANDELI_team_lilly_design_PNG.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126264015/-/LOVEDBYHANNAHANDELI_team_lilly_design_PNG.png","width":3276,"height":2400}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5932095,"name":"Long Sleeves","permalink":"long-sleeves","url":"/category/long-sleeves"}]},{"id":14964015,"name":" Woman's Contemporary Fit Raw-Edge Neckline \"MAMA BEAR\"","permalink":"pre-order","position":2,"price":55.0,"default_price":55.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pre-order","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-20T01:01:05.000Z","description":"Of course my little \"Man Cub\" Eli needed me to coordinate with him in my very own \"Mama Bear\" sweatshirt right?\r\nBeware, I might LIVE in this!\r\n\r\nOur custom arrow logo printed on the back\r\n\r\nThis sweatshirt is part of the eco-friendly Alternative Earth collection.

So while other 2 year olds were saying \"the cow says moo\" ... Hannah was howling at the moon. I knew I wanted to do something that represented that and captured that memory for us. Although, I thought a wolf might be an intense design on a babies shirt. So I did a fox! The fox silhouette itself is actual \"clip art\". I manipulated it to meet my desired design needs. Changing the eyes to Crescent moons, adding my kids initials \"he\" in one ear, adding some fun geometric patterns in the other ear, and adding the crossing arrows. \r\n\r\nPrinted with water based ink on American Apparel Infant Baby Rib\r\nUnisex Long Sleeve Lap T-Shirt in color Heather Grey\r\nNeckband designed for easy on-and-off\r\nShrinkage: will shrink an average of one size when put in the dryer \r\n(100% Baby Rib cotton construction (Heather Grey contains 10% Polyester) ","options":[{"id":41739672,"name":"3-6m","price":17.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124044582/-/fox_on_baylor.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124044582/-/fox_on_baylor.JPG","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124337565/-/fox_for_site_2.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124337565/-/fox_for_site_2.JPG","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123063618/-/fox.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123063618/-/fox.JPG","width":480,"height":640}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5932095,"name":"Long Sleeves","permalink":"long-sleeves","url":"/category/long-sleeves"}]}]
