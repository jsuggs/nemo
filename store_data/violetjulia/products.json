The smooth but unfinished wood block pairs nicely with the almost panoramic view of trees.\r\n\r\nThis block works as an object on a shelf or desk, and a small hole on the back allows for hanging on the wall.\r\n\r\nThe Polaroid process produces an image with soft focus and an intimate size, which invites close viewing. None of my prints have been digitally manipulated except to size them and correct colors to the original image.\r\n\r\nItem will be shipped within 7 days in protective packaging.\r\n\r\nIt's nice to have a little bit of outside inside.","options":[{"id":1113430,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2028429/-/DSC01299.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2028429/-/DSC01299.JPG","width":800,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":235935,"name":"Photo blocks","permalink":"photo-blocks","url":"/category/photo-blocks"}]},{"id":263100,"name":"Two Trees. 8x10 Photograph","permalink":"two-trees","position":3,"price":35.0,"default_price":35.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/two-trees","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-03-25T01:01:35.000Z","description":"This is a print made from a Polaroid photograph taken in the rerual Appalachian region of Virginia.
