This cassette remains excellent, however, and features the band playing on DJ Rick's Art for Spastics. G. Green, Green Green, Guh-Green; however you insist on saying it, is one of Sacramento's newest awesome bands, who up the tropical reverb sound and toss it in a blender with fun pop rhythms, classic rock love, punk influences, and Henderson's unforgettable and extremely unique vocal styling. Hard not to like. This tape features hilarious commentary as well. Tape has various color inserts and is a one sided white C-47.","options":[{"id":5564301,"name":"Default","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/14335151/-/ggreentape.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/14335151/-/ggreentape.jpg","width":561,"height":397}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":941761,"name":"Tapes","permalink":"tapes","url":"/category/tapes"}]},{"id":1509941,"name":"Vichy Water \"10 Songs\" Cassette EP","permalink":"vichy-water-10-songs-cassette-ep","position":2,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/vichy-water-10-songs-cassette-ep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-02-08T04:23:03.000Z","description":"Vichy Water was a short lived trio of best friends afflicted by fall time depression. The Water took complex post-punk styling, fucked it up and made it easy and fun. They took Elorduy's reverb-soaked guitar, and matched it with heavily distorted bass and straightforward punk beat. It could have been for fans of new wave, punk, surf rock, garage, pop, or anything. Contains the hits \"Turn it Down\" and \"Sacto, Great Job!\" The band planned on releasing a 7\" on Weird Forest Records, but split only after 4 months.\r\n\r\n10 songs, C-15 on Clear tapes, color inserts. Limited to 50.
