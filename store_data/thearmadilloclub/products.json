Playing around in the sketchbook really brought out some ideas and The Club decided to focus on the overall shape of the bell.\r\n\r\nWhile overlapping parts and playing with perspective we got the idea to work with the negative space the bell itself creates. The idea was to use three Liberty Bells to play off the idea of Liberty One and Two (skyscrapers in Philadelphia) and have the two bells to create a third version within the negative space. After a few different tries, the final Liberty Three design was created. \r\n\r\nLike all Armadillo Club t-shirts, Liberty Three is made with only quality materials. This original design is screened on ring-spun cotton with a tag-less collar to ensure comfort.

The quality of the shirt is hopefully up to his Whiteness’ standards and we think you will love it.\r\n\r\nAs any good Phillies fan knows, Whitey loved Philadelphia as much as he loved his buddy Harry Kalas, turning a phrase, smoking his pipe and drinking a good, cold beer. This t-shirt is inspired by all of these passions, taking a page from the beer labels, pipe tobacco packets and color schemes of old.  \r\n\r\nSo when you check out a Phillies game this year, do so with a Philly sports shirt that wasn’t thrown together in 5 minutes. Show off a bit of baseball pride when you step into Ashburn Alley and Harry the K’s and most of all, wear one of the greatest center fielders to ever play the game.
