She would very quickly tat them in white thread (almost without looking down at her hands) and use them to decorate hankies, cards or other little gifts for lucky recipients. \r\n\r\nThe design translates very nicely into a delicate silver pendant that floats above your collarbones.\r\n \r\nThese pendants are all one-off pieces. The butterfly is hand-woven in cotton thread, then cast into sterling silver. The cotton burns away in the casting process, preserving each knot for posterity and ensuring that no piece can be repeated- each is an individual. \r\n\r\nThe butterfly has a wing span of approx. 22mm, and comes with a delicate 45cm sterling silver chain.\r\n\r\nFor shipping rates, please see FAQ page below. \r\n\r\nMade in Australia, with love.\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":12099732,"name":"Default","price":80.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35206742/-/IMG_1561_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35206742/-/IMG_1561_2.jpg","width":1000,"height":990},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35206758/-/IMG_1558_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35206758/-/IMG_1558_2.jpg","width":1000,"height":952}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1635681,"name":"necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"},{"id":2042324,"name":"under $100","permalink":"under-100","url":"/category/under-100"}]},{"id":2743664,"name":"paisley pendant","permalink":"paisley-pendant","position":2,"price":265.0,"default_price":265.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/paisley-pendant","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-09-10T10:02:41.000Z","description":"The paisley pendant design is influenced by the flock wallpaper encountered in every pub I visited in Scotland.
