Gratitude for Superfood can be used as a facial mask or a facial scrub. With each use, this mask will help to fill in lines and wrinkles, will help keep an even skin tone, will improve elasticity by tightening and lifting, will keep your skin with a radiant, youthful glow.  \r\n\r\nSome of the ingredients that make this skin food so nourishing are:\r\nChia seeds (Salvia hispanica) are an ancient food once used by my ancestors as traveling food. Chia Seeds are a rich source of antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, alpha-linolenic acid and lots of minerals.  Chia seeds also helps reduce inflammation. Another staple ingredient are flax seeds. Flax seeds are a natural way to cleanse the skin by normalizing oily, dry or blemished skin.  Flax also helps stimulate circulation and leaves the skin soft and smooth. Another main ingredient is Oat Flour. Many cultures have used Oats to treat irritated skin. Oat Flour is known to soften and reducing the appearance of wrinkles. Oat Flour also minimizes scarring from acne and other blemishes. Oat Flour is also an anti-inflammatory. Another big ingredient is the Chaga mushroom. Chaga is a wild mushroom, that grows on birch trees in extremely cold regions of northern latitudes including Baltic regions, Scandinavia, Siberia, Alaska and Asia. Chaga mushrooms have the highest ORAC score.  What is the Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC)? The ORAC scale designed by the USDA, measures the amount of free oxygen radicals that a food, or supplement can absorb in your body. Chaga has the highest ORAC score for natural foods or supplements. Oxidative stress caused by free radicals, has been demonstrated to accelerate the aging process.\r\n \r\nOther ingredients are brown rice flour, white kaolin clay, dead sea mud, kelp, and a blend of essential oils. \r\n\r\nTo use as mask Recommended) mix a tsp or so in water or mash an avocado and let sit 20 minutes then rinse. You will feel your skin tightening and benefiting as soon as it starts to dry. To use as a facial scrub mix a tsp or so with water, or oil and let sit 3-5 minutes and scrub. \r\n\r\n\r\nAll of Terra Smiles products are made with positive energy and healing intentions.\r\n\r\nWe use only Organic, Sustainable and Non GMO products!\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please never hesitate to send over a message!\r\n\r\nBless \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":28046513,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.95,"amount_with_others":5.95,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":17.0,"amount_with_others":12.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87917630/-/IMG_4194.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87917630/-/IMG_4194.JPG","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4353956,"name":"Face Care","permalink":"face-care","url":"/category/face-care"}]},{"id":8832161,"name":"Roots Hair Mist","permalink":"roots-hair-mist","position":13,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/roots-hair-mist","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-07T21:12:02.000Z","description":"**This mist is for all hair types and dreads!**\r\n\r\nThis hair mist is made of extractions and infusions of over 10 organic herb extracts, and mixed with organic coconut oil, argan oil, wheat germ, red pimento, Jamaican black castor oil, and other organic oils and essential oils.

Terra Smiles Hair Food is a deep oil treatment for the hair and also treats split ends.\r\n\r\nOne of the main ingredients is the Jamacain black castor oil. This castor oil has an age old reputation as the all purpose powerful healing oil. Jamaican black castor oil is an unrefined form of castor oil which is much richer in nutritive properties that has been proven to be extremely effective for increasing hair growth by increasing blood flow to the scalp and supplying valuable nutrients to the hair follicles. It is also used for treating damaged, brittle and dry hair by providing hydration to the hair and scalp. High in Vitamin E and Omega 6 fatty acids, it moisturizes by acting as a humectant to attract and lock moisture into the hair.\r\n\r\nJamaican Black Castor oil is know to do the following:\r\n\r\n-Stimulates and increases hair growth\r\n\r\n-Reduces and prevents hair damage\r\n\r\n-Eliminates dry hair\r\n\r\n-Prevents dandruff\r\n\r\n-Wards off infections that causes hair loss\r\n\r\n-Thickens hair that is starting to thin out\r\n\r\nAnother key ingredient is Apple Cider Vinegar. ACV is known to stimulate hair follicles and increase circulation in scalp which promotes growth. As blood circulates, essential nutrients are carried to hair follicle cells. The more efficient circulation you have, the more nutrients reach these follicles, strengthening your roots and promoting a healthy head of hair.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther ingredients are organic coconut oil, and organic essential oils that promote hair growth.\r\n\r\nThis can be used as a deep conditioner or you can run a drop through the ends of hair to prevent split ends.\r\n\r\nAll of Terra Smiles products are made with positive energy and healing intentions\r\n\r\nWe use only Organic, Sustainable and Non GMO products!\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please never hesitate to send over a message!\r\n\r\nBlessings!
