We found out that it stays on really well with just the elastic fit. Little Becka would have nothing to do with the straps around her neck!!\r\n\r\nThe hat pattern has sizes from 3 months to 24 months and all are included in the same pattern. \r\n\r\nA dressier version of the hat has ribbon neck ties and bow with lace around the flounces.

Simple lines yet very sassy and stylish. Elastic waist for great fit on any figure. Skirt can be made with a coordinating border, one solid color or striped with many colors. Use your imagination for endless looks\r\n\r\nThis design is very basic for the beginning seamstress but also has more advanced options such as the gathered insert  and border hem. \r\n\r\nI have also added an updated one color skirt with an appliquéd flower, leaves and rick rack design.

She will feel all dressed up with the ribbon bows and the tutu underneath. It is so comfortable, easy to get into and just perfect for almost any occasion. \r\n\r\nYou can make it with the tutu under slip and bows or just plain with snap on buttons. Perfect for monogramming too! Only your imagination limits you as to what you can create with this versatile pattern. \r\n\r\nThis jumper pattern is not reversible. Many people have asked for a more simple pattern with just a facing and hem. No buttonholes either unless you want them. Straps are secured with snaps. Bows and covered buttons just snap on. \r\n\r\nThe neckline of this dress is similar to the “Sew Versatile” reversible jumper. This dress has more swing around the bottom for twirling around. \r\n\r\nThank you for choosing my patterns. This is a PATTERN for a dress.

Although this is not the traditional origami-like folds of a Kanzashi flower, it is a super easy way to get the same look and stylish design. \r\n\r\nI have taken this beautiful tradition and translated it into something fun, casual and functional for today’s fashions. The flowers look so much more complicated to make than they really are. \r\n\r\nYou can make it with scraps or groupings out of quilting fun packs. I used cotton, but any suitable weight fabric can be used. \r\n\r\nThis is just one of the basic styles of this Kanzashi tradition. With these basic steps you will be able to create endless possibilities. Change the covered button center and use vintage buttons or beads. You can make one layer or two. Add a trail of beads and you have a traditional Japanese Kanzashi look. It is up to you and your imagination. Be creative and add some whimsy to your wardrobe.\r\n\r\n I use this flower on my “Sew Retro” dress, pocketbooks, as a lapel pin, on headbands and hats, and just as a simple hair bow. The ways to use it are also endless. \r\n\r\nI PROMISE you one of the most detailed patterns on the market. Your pattern will be concise, colorful, informative and professionally displayed.

Beware you may get carried away! Choosing the material is the first step in creating what theme that your want to use. I show three designs as my samples. Traditional greens, reds and golds with red braid. This tailored look is great for a man’s stocking. I picked out a lime green and red and gold for an updated color scheme and more modern look. Last, I picked out combinations from Northcott fabric collection “Quest for a Cure”. This makes a very pretty and feminine Victorian or Shabby Chic stocking. \r\n","options":[{"id":13322877,"name":"Default","price":7.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/39172851/-/christmasdress_120.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/39172851/-/christmasdress_120.JPG","width":983,"height":653},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/39172827/-/christmasdress_110.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/39172827/-/christmasdress_110.JPG","width":664,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/39172243/-/Christmas_stocking_pattern_front.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/39172243/-/Christmas_stocking_pattern_front.jpg","width":716,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/39172835/-/christmasdress_113.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/39172835/-/christmasdress_113.JPG","width":664,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/39172843/-/christmasdress_118.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/39172843/-/christmasdress_118.JPG","width":664,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2220345,"name":"Christmas","permalink":"christmas","url":"/category/christmas"}]},{"id":4016663,"name":"\"QUILT AS YOU GO\" Grandmother's Flower Garden Quilting Pattern","permalink":"quilt-as-you-go-grandmother-s-flower-garden-quilting-pattern","position":43,"price":4.95,"default_price":4.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/quilt-as-you-go-grandmother-s-flower-garden-quilting-pattern","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-07-01T06:44:04.000Z","description":"Easy, quick and fun to make Grandmother’s Flower Garden  “quilt as you go” PDF pattern. This pattern is all you need to create many designs from a simple coaster , pot holder, place mat, table runner all the way to any size quilt. \r\n\r\nThe name for the procedure is called folded hexagon Australian patchwork or framed hexagon. This is a great way to use individual flowers for the center of your project. \r\n\r\nEach hexagon is pieced one at a time and has three basic pieces. Front, back and batting. You will sew all three together at once and when you are done, you have a completed “mini quilt”. When they are joined together as a hot pad, place mat or quilt, you are finished!  A coaster is just one completed hexagon. \r\n\r\nThis project is so portable. I take my pieces around to ball games in a sewing tin pail. \r\n \r\nI have made a pot holder and place mat for my sewing machine sample. I have used a zigzag stitch but I am sure there are other stitches that would be pretty too. \r\n\r\nThis is also a lovely hand piecing project. For the hand pieced sample, I have chosen a tea cup design and hand quilted around the outline of each cup. \r\n\r\nThis is also a cute pattern for an “I Spy” quilt.
