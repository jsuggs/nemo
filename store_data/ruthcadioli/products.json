The whole summer season was pretty wet and miserable, filled with endless rainy days. There were flash floods which came as such a shock to everybody because they were in areas previously considered to be safe from flooding, one little township was swept away. Then a bit later in the season, North Queensland was hit by a category 5 cyclone, Yasi.\r\n\r\nThe experience that year was very moving. I wanted to convey the tumultuous feelings it left me with. Awe of the power of nature and horror at the same time. \r\n\r\nFramed in a premium hefty black wooden frame.

Although toadstools aren't really related to finches in any natural sense, the colours and the patterns looked similar from a design point of view.\r\n\r\nI learnt a little about the history of the toadstool while researching images. Apparently they were used by Siberian shamans. First they would eat a few of the mushrooms which would somehow enhance its hallucinogenic properties then urinate, giving this to somebody else to drink...
