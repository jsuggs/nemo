It's the first of an \"artist series\" we plan on continuing with talented artists in the future. \r\n\r\nOur company has taken on a life of its own. This cap illustrates it with Stown letters being transformed into creatures. Phetus's logo (Phat Phace) is tastefully embroidered on the right side of the cap, and the Stown rear lettering has been cartoonified using wild eyes and expressions.  The underbrim features Stown & Phetus embroidery as a signature with the Phat Phace logo in the middle. The body of the hat is navy with a black brim, and a hot pink underbrim & snap.\r\n\r\nAvailable in limited quantities / One Size Fits All. This snapback simply will not last.
