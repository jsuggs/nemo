It's made from naturally occurring, active live healing clay compounds, volcanic ash and finely ground lens esculenta seeds. These are dry grains; when combined with water, the tiny particles form a liquid with extraordinarily powerful absorption properties, making it perfect for cleansing, detoxification and general skin treatment. A little goes a long way...\r\n\r\nFor all skin types\r\n• 100% natural soap-free, chemical-free formula\r\n• Gentle to delicate skin and environment\r\n• No additives, artificial fragrances, colors, detergents, or sulfates\r\n• Vegan and CCIC-Certified (no animal testing)\r\n• Comes in a convenient 2 oz recyclable glass jar\r\n\r\n\r\nWe would like to share our recommended skincare routine - 3 easy steps to naturally beautiful skin! It’s so simple and inexpensive, too. Your skin will thank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 1: Pre-cleanse the skin using a small amount of your favorite natural oil. Avocado, sweet almond, or jojoba are our favorites - your skin will tell you which one it likes best! Massage a few drops of the oil onto dry facial and neck skin for 1-2 minutes. Soak a washcloth in warm water, then gently and slowly wipe. Do not scrub!\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 2: Shake the Florere cleansing grains to evenly distribute all ingredients. In a small bowl, mix 1 part Cleansing Grains with 3 parts water or apple cider vinegar.\r\nStir until dissolved. Gently apply a thin layer over your face and neck. You can use a small brush or your fingers... just do not scrub! Allow to dry 1 - 5 minutes. Rinse thoroughly. If you feel a tightening sensation or the skin appears slightly red, this is normal and should disappear\r\nin a few minutes. (Note: This is a very concentrated product - 1/4 teaspoon of Florere Cleansing Grains should be enough for the face and neck - use sparingly!)\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 3: Press a tiny bit of Florere Raw Shea Butter Moisturizer onto damp skin. Use under the eyes and lips, too. (Note: Warm the shea in your hands until it liquefies, then apply. The size equivalent to two or three grains of rice should be enough for your entire face and neck.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for using natural products. Enjoy!
