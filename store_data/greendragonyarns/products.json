There is also an in feed tray that you use to stage the order that you feed the fibers and colors on.

You can produce a 4\" wide batt that can be spun from when you remove the batt from the carder. The batt that is created is the size of a commercial roving.

However, what really counts for carding is the ratio of the surface speed of both drums, because the difference of surface speed does the carding. You get this surface speed ratio by multiplying the gear ratio with the ratio of the diameters of the large drum and the licker-in.\r\n\r\nSuggested Retail is $435.00 You save $50.00.

Although bobbins and flyers are available for spinning this type of yarn, the standard wheels have been redesigned to be more suitable for spinning fine to medium yarns. The orifice on the standard wheel is sufficiently large (12.5 mm or 1/2\") as are the bobbins, (180-250 gr capacity), to allow you to create novelty yarns. Wheels come equipped with a two bobbin lazy kate.\r\nTechnically all Louet models are the same. Each wheel has a single belt bobbin drive with an adjustable flyer brake to regulate the tension. The flexible belts are made of polyurethane and never have to be adjusted.\r\nAll wheels are packed and shipped partially assembled in a flat box. The required assembly consists quite simply of tightening two nuts for which tools and instructions are provided.\r\nWheels are made of laminated hardwood with a \"birch\" exterior finish.\r\n\r\nThe best way to describe this wheel is a Victoria version of the S51DT. Bobbins, flyer and the Scotch tension are the same as on the Victoria. There are four ratios, which are: 1:6, 1:8.5, 1:12.5, 1:19. A removable insert provides two orifice sizes (12mm and 8mm). All rotating parts run on ball bearings for smooth operation, while the unit itself is constructed out of beech and birch plywood, smoothly lacquered.\r\nThe Julia comes standard with a stand-alone 3 bobbin Lazy Kate with an adjustable brake. Wheels are made of laminated hardwood with a \"birch\" exterior finish.\r\n\r\n<strong>Note: Wheels are drop shipped from the distributor.

You can picture the \"ladies in waiting\" gathered together in the castle spinning as a group, all on the Symphony.</br><br>This wheel has the details spinners have come to expect with Kromski products - lots of finely turned wood, attention to detail, and all the features spinners ask for. Start with a good size wheel diameter - 24\" - that rotates on bearing sleeves that contribute to effortless treadling. The double treadles are well engineered to be comfortable through long spinning sessions. The flyer is double drive but also has Scotch tensioning for single drive use.</br><br>The Symphony is made of European alder and birch.
