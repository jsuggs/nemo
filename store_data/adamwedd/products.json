(close to Bookham train station) – see map for location. \r\nI have almost 10 years teaching experience, tutoring pupils from ages 5 years to 70 years in both large groups & one to one tuition. I teach a mixture of the RGT & Rock School syllabus (for which some pupils enjoy the focus of working towards a graded exam, although not everybody does) & a selection of songs that my pupils would like to play from their favourite band, youtube video or album. All in all, it is a great idea to work towards a specific goal- whether this is a graded exam, or simply that you are now able to play the solo from your favourite song! \r\n\r\nPrices \r\n£25 for 1 hour lesson / £20 for 45 minutes lesson / £15 for 30 minute lesson","options":[{"id":17231897,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/52310343/-/18643_101068249923798_100000618710762_29934_6371534_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/52310343/-/18643_101068249923798_100000618710762_29934_6371534_n.jpg","width":402,"height":604}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
