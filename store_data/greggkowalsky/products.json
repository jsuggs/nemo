A one sided lp documenting part of his Master’s Thesis, which entailed taking one of his electronic compositions, scoring it for a live ensemble and then conducting the performance. Kowalsky enlisted the Contemporary Performance Ensemble, directed by Fred Frith, who also contributed violin. Recorded in 2005 at Mills college, the result was sublime. A gorgeous organic piece that references Feldman and Part and Melnyk as much as Kowalsky’s previous works. The strings are low and buzz and throb dramatically, the piano is minor key and delicate, fluttering in brief little flurries, streaks of high end run through the swirling moodiness, over the top voices soar in choral fragments, washes of cymbals sizzle, horns moan, all manner of instruments are smeared into a heaving organic whole, shakuhachi, vibraphone, flute, a sonic cloud constantly expanding, intensifying chordal whir, like some moody rock band with the bones pulled out, leaving just a gloriously amorphous sound shape, slithering and drifting, creeping and billowing, building and building, some sort of classic chorale stretched out into a shimmering dreamlike blur. On the surface, it’s a dark drift, but beneath the surface, sounds are roiling and churning, a sonic sea of tension and emotion, subtly psychedelic, a gorgeous, organic, orchestral drone. --Aquarius Records\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Gregg+Kowalsky/+videos/+1-ASFqgaQXv9Q","options":[{"id":11896304,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":12.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/34495728/-/gregg_k_tendrils-300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/34495728/-/gregg_k_tendrils-300.jpg","width":216,"height":216}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":737781,"name":"LPs","permalink":"lps","url":"/category/lps"}]},{"id":3548938,"name":"Battery Townsley LP","permalink":"battery-townsley-lp","position":5,"price":22.0,"default_price":22.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/battery-townsley-lp","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-04-05T23:47:21.000Z","description":"Beautiful clear vinyl edition, limited to 280 copies and individually numbered* The ninth release from Giuseppe Ielasi's Senufo Editions features Gregg Kowalsky's captivating performance consisting of 10 cassette players positioned inside the bunker of Battery Townsley, a World War II coastal fortification in Marin County, California. Ielasi also contributes a 'Studio Mix' afterthought on the other side, but the real star of this LP is Kowalsky's séance-like drones and spatial disturbances, beautifully recorded by Marielle Jakobsons. Using the natural (well, man-made) resonance of the bunker we get a real sense of swirling space as Raga-like drones mingle in the ether and glance off cold concrete whilst shuffling, scuttling rodent sounds emerge from the peripheries, drawing the ear in any one of ten directions at once. In stark comparison, Giuseppe Ielasi's studio mix tempers the psychedelic mass of sound into one long viscous drone, pulsing and radiating waves of slow moving energy which explore the full parameters of their sphere, like some dreamy reminiscence of the original event. This is a beautiful album, especially when coupled with the sleeve artwork from Jefre Cantu-Ledesma.
