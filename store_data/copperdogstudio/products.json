The special pen used for the drawing acts as a resist for the etching process, so that the background is etched away, leaving the name and design standing out! A blackening patina is used in the background, and then the raised design is cleaned and brightened so that it really stands out! The tag is cut into an oval or circular shape - the length of your pet's name determines the shape and size of each tag. \r\n*** Please keep in mind that if your pet's name is long, the tag will be larger. We generally try to keep tag sizes appropriate to your pet's size, but a Chihuahua named \"Mister Cucaracha\" might warrant a larger tag than chihuahuas might normally wear. Same goes for a kitty called \"Princess Fluffinstein.\" <3\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's how it works:\r\nYou pick the tag design you like, and go ahead and click \"Add to Cart.\" When the paypal order form comes up, there will be a section called \"Note to Seller.\" Here is where you tell us your dog's name - please double check to be sure spelling is correct!!! - and the type and size of your furry friend, so we can get a good idea of the size of tag we need to shoot for. -- This section appears after you get to the paypal screen, but if you don't see it or want to be doubly sure, just send us a message with your pet's info in the \"contact\" section of the site.  Make sure to include your name, too, so we'll know who gets what!\r\n\r\nThis product listing is for one pet ID tag in the \"Starlite\" design. Each tag is custom made to order, so each one will be as unique as your buddy! Your tag will arrive ready-to-wear with a split ring already attached. Please allow 7-10 days for your tag to arrive! \r\n\r\nAt your request, we will hand engrave your phone number onto the back of your pet's tag free of charge! Include this in the \"Notes to Seller\" section of your order form along with your pet's name and size. \r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that over time, the bright copper part of the tag might dull a little, but if you want to brighten it up again, just rub a little fine sandpaper (400 grit works great) or steel wool over the top, and it should shine right back up!\r\n\r\n\r\n10% of proceeds from each sale will be donated to local animal rescue organizations! We love our pets, and want to spread the love around! \r\n\r\nWe thank you for your purchase, and so do all the sweet pets you've helped by buying your pet ID tag from CopperDog Studio!

Include this in the \"Notes to Seller\" section of your order form along with your pet's name and size.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that enamel is glass.  If your pet is very active and wears other metal tags, you might want to think about a regular etched tag without enamel, as there is a possibility that the enamel could crack or chip. For any copper tag, over time, the bright copper part of the tag might dull a little, but if you want to brighten it up again, just rub steel wool over the top, and it should shine right back up!\r\n\r\n\r\n10% of proceeds from each sale will be donated to local animal rescue organizations!

Each tag is custom made to order, so each one will be as unique as your buddy! Your tag will arrive ready-to-wear with a split ring already attached. Please allow 7-10 days for your tag to arrive! \r\n\r\nAt your request, we will etch your phone number onto the back of your pet's tag free of charge! Include this in the \"Notes to Seller\" section of your order form along with your pet's name and size. \r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that over time, the bright copper part of the tag might dull a little, but if you want to brighten it up again, just rub a little fine sandpaper (400 grit works great) or steel wool over the top, and it should shine right back up!\r\n\r\n\r\n10% of proceeds from each sale will be donated to local animal rescue organizations! We love our pets, and want to spread the love around! \r\n\r\nWe thank you for your purchase, and so do all the sweet pets you've helped by buying your pet ID tag from CopperDog Studio!

It also helps if there is a relatively clean background. We'll remove most background noise in the editing process, but the less there is, the sharper the image of your buddy will be.  And that's what we want, right?  \r\n\r\nSo once we have your pet's photo, we can begin the process.  We use photoshop to edit the image into one that we can etch.  Then we transfer the image onto an 18 gauge copper plate.  The printed image acts as a resist for the etching process, which can take up to 8 hours, depending on the size and image to be etched.  Once the etching is done, we clean it up and use a blackening patina, so that the recessed areas that have been etched away are darker, creating a beautiful contrast where the natural color of the copper comes through.  \r\n\r\nDue to the nature of the process, please allow 2-3 weeks for delivery.  Your portrait will be shipped to you in a simple black frame, ready to be displayed in your home.  It's a wonderful tribute to your best friend!\r\n","options":[{"id":15446997,"name":"Default","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46225387/-/buster.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46225387/-/buster.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46300269/-/detail_2_copy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46300269/-/detail_2_copy.jpg","width":800,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2478767,"name":"Pet Potraits","permalink":"pet-potraits","url":"/category/pet-potraits"}]},{"id":4716289,"name":"Handmade Etched Copper Pet Portrait - 5\"x7\"","permalink":"hndmade-etched-copper-pet-portrait-5-x7","position":17,"price":75.0,"default_price":75.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/hndmade-etched-copper-pet-portrait-5-x7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-10-27T01:09:35.000Z","description":"Capture your best friend's lovable personality in a permanent, archival etched copper portrait!\r\n\r\nHere's how it works:\r\nAdd this item to your cart in either size that you choose: 4\"x6\" or 5\"x7.\" When we receive the order, we'll contact you through email, and ask you to send us a photograph of your pet.  \r\n\r\nHigh resolution images work best, so please send images that are 6 megapixels or higher (no camera phone images please.)
