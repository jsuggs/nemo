Landland is once again offering subscription packs for the 2013 calendar year! We will send you one of everything we make from January 1st to December 31st, including:\r\n\r\n• All posters we make for anything. \r\n• Art prints we make for gallery exhibitions, and for no reason at all, including some of the prints we produce for friends and guest artists. \r\n• Small, closed editions of art prints that will most likely only be available either via these subscriptions or if you're related to one of us. \r\n• Variants & test prints & maybe original art & other novelties. \r\n• Any and all records and books and small magazines that we release throughout the year on our funny little record label (called Landland is not a Record Label). We have plans for a couple records already that we're pretty excited about.\r\n• Anything else we might have forgotten about.\r\n\r\nThe deal: Landland 2013 Subscriptions will cost $600, which includes shipping to anywhere in North America (Overseas humans, get in touch with us and we'll figure it out). We know that this is a lot of money, and we plan on treating it as such. For the past couple years, we've been averaging around 50 prints/year (a decent handful of which were never available on our site...some of them were sold out before they even hit the ground) and a couple records, in addition to an assortment of smaller objects. We've been talking to a lot of good people about projects for January & February, and really excited about how it looks like our year will be starting off.\r\n\r\nSome fine print: Shipping to North America is included; For Int'l orders, send us an email and we'll figure it out. We will do our best to ship everything out in batches whenever it makes sense (2–3 times throughout the year), and your prints will generally be shipped flat. Your prints will have matching edition numbers whenever possible. We are open to working out payment plans...get in touch with us to find out more about that.\r\n\r\nThanks!","options":[{"id":14017605,"name":"Default","price":600.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/79727685/-/Subscriptions_2013_900px.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/79727685/-/Subscriptions_2013_900px.jpg","width":900,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2356265,"name":"Special Deals!","permalink":"special-deals","url":"/category/special-deals"}]},{"id":5119937,"name":"Landland Mystery Things!","permalink":"landland-mystery-things","position":29,"price":75.0,"default_price":75.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/landland-mystery-things","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-12-21T05:33:56.000Z","description":"Ok.

Dip a toe in the pool, or let us strap you into that weird tunnel car from The Running Man without a safety bar or a net at the end. \r\n\r\n<b><font color=\"#debd00\">How this works:</font></b> Pick one of the price options below...these prices include shipping to North America (Int'l orders will add $15.00, but we'll factor that into what you end up getting from us). We'll dig through our massive piles of stuff and pull out something (or sometimes a bunch of things) that seems worth whatever you've decided to send us. \r\n\r\nPretty much anything & everything is up for grabs...posters that you've seen on our website, posters you've never seen before in your entire life, postcards and stickers, records, art prints, test prints, original art, mixtapes, t-shirts, death threats scrawled on used bus transfers, old polaroids, \"found\" art, posters that you thought we've run out of. It's a total dice roll, except this time there's like a hundred different dice, and instead of being able to read any of the numbers, you just kinda hear some weird animal sounds way off in the distance.\r\n\r\nAs with our $100 Mystery Tubes, we are sensitive about whether or not we are presenting “A Good Deal” for you, which will most assuredly work to your advantage. \r\n\r\n<i><b><font color=\"#debd00\">The regular-sized fine print:</font></b> Things got a little weird with the Mystery Tubes, so just to avoid any weirdness, please don't email us with requests...if you want to email us and tell us what you already have (so we don't send you another one), that's totally cool, but none of this \"Could one of the posters be a [whatever thing]?\" business...we're too nice to not accommodate it, and it just ends up making us bite our nails. Oh, and this never comes up, but no refunds...either you're feeling lucky or you're not. We'll do our best to take care of you.</i>","options":[{"id":16617177,"name":"$3.00","price":3.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":16617179,"name":"$10.00","price":10.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":16617181,"name":"$15.00","price":15.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":16617183,"name":"$20.00","price":75.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16617185,"name":"$30.00","price":75.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16617187,"name":"$50.00","price":75.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16617189,"name":"$75.00","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16617191,"name":"$100.00","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":16617193,"name":"$150.00","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":16617195,"name":"$200.00","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":16617197,"name":"$300.00","price":300.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":16617199,"name":"$350.00","price":350.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":16617201,"name":"$425.00","price":425.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":16617203,"name":"$500.00","price":500.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":16617205,"name":"$575.00","price":575.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":16617207,"name":"$750.00","price":750.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/88950590/-/MysteryThingButton_900px_debd00.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/88950590/-/MysteryThingButton_900px_debd00.jpg","width":900,"height":900}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2356265,"name":"Special Deals!","permalink":"special-deals","url":"/category/special-deals"}]},{"id":8613768,"name":"Andrew Bird (Minneapolis)","permalink":"andrew-bird-minneapolis","position":30,"price":40.0,"default_price":40.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/andrew-bird-minneapolis","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-19T01:30:28.000Z","description":"<b><font color=\"#debd00\">Andrew Bird</font></b>\r\nDecember 17th, 2012 at the State Theatre in Minneapolis, Minn.<br>\r\n<b><font color=\"#debd00\">Info:</font></b>\r\nSeven-color screenprint on 100# French cover stock • 18\" x 24\"\r\nSigned & Numbered Edition of 120<br>\r\n<b><font color=\"#debd00\">Illustration/Design:</font></b> Jessica Seamans<br>","options":[{"id":27038373,"name":"Default","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84735810/-/AndrewBird_Mpls_FinalScan_1200px.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84735810/-/AndrewBird_Mpls_FinalScan_1200px.jpg","width":754,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":77548,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":8613591,"name":"\"Let the End Times Roll\"","permalink":"let-the-end-times-roll","position":31,"price":40.0,"default_price":40.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/let-the-end-times-roll","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-19T01:19:20.000Z","description":"An art print titled <b>\"Let the End Times Roll\"</b> made for the \"End of the World\" exhibition at <a href=\"http://www.galerief.com/events/\" target=\"_blank\">Galerie F</a> in Chicago, Ill.
