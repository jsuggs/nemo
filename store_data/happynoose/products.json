This time, the band sheds much of the lighter fair for a much heavier and darker sound than previous releases. \r\n\r\nProduced by Tim Green (Nation of Ulysses, the Fucking Champs) at his Louder Studios in Grass Valley, Calf. Happy Noose have crafted a sound that is driving, morose, and laden with pop hooks all at once. \r\n\r\nThree originals and a version of the never-released Joy Division song, \"Pictures in My Mind\" make up an EP well worth the seven inches of vinyl that make up its whole.\r\n\r\n500 copy, mixed-marbled vinyl run.\r\n\r\n\"At first listen, the members’ pedigrees seem to have little bearing on the music they’re making today, yet their execution is characteristically tough and no-frills. For comprising familiar punk, indie-rock and darkwave influences, Happy Noose’s sound is surprisingly hard to pin down... no doubt inspired by a pair of ‘80s Ian‘s, Joy Division‘s Curtis and Echo and the Bunnymen‘s McCulloch... In any case, though, both EPs solidly reflect the trio’s musicianship, chemistry and good taste.\" -- The Big Takeover\r\n\r\n\"back with a rather stellar EP produced by Tim Green who’s produced Melvins, Bikini Kill and more. On the title track “Amagosa” Happy Noose’s vocalist Ryan belts out his bold baritone notes over a steadily distorted guitar put through a vortex of pedals – ultimately, it’s a great opening track to settle the listener in for the next few songs.\" -- Sly Vinyl","options":[{"id":36560289,"name":"Default","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114059742/-/desc107.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114059742/-/desc107.jpg","width":700,"height":700}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5469471,"name":"Seven Inch","permalink":"seven-inch","url":"/category/seven-inch"}]},{"id":5416917,"name":"Happy Noose Sticker","permalink":"happy-noose-sticker","position":2,"price":1.0,"default_price":1.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/happy-noose-sticker","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-07T11:27:29.000Z","description":"3x3 screen printed sticker with triple gloss coating.

The initial pressing is VERY LIMITED.\r\n\r\n\t\r\nHappy Noose is trio of friends that came together after having played in many other bands spanning several decades. Members are in their 20s, 30s and 40s, providing a unique approach to punk rock music born out of a collective idea of musical resistance to dominant culture.\r\n\r\nHappy Noose Press:\r\nEarly Happy Noose Press:\r\n\"...their music is straightforward enough: good-time, plangent, dirty pop... music aches with desire... Morose, yet joyful. Fumbling, unsure but with a real swaggering gait. Lovely, lovely, lovely. It’s almost 1978 UK powerpop as well … or ’82 UK punk. Lovely.\" --Everett True, Collapse Board\r\n\r\n\"...with vocals that at times have a slightly despondent and unaffected charm that fit really well. Definitely one of the best things I’ve gotten for review—of which I didn’t have any prior knowledge—in a while.\" --Razorcake\r\n\r\n\"The music is a little more upbeat than the vocalists style and his yawning drawl lends the music a more morose feel than it would have otherwise. I found myself liking how these things played off each other.\" -Maximum RockNRoll 335\r\n\r\n\"Pretty awesome punk rock from this Olympia, Wa trio. Tight, upbeat and played with enthusiasm. Definitely worth checking out if that sounds like it's your thing.\" -Dead Formats\r\n\r\n\"First off, just have to mention this is not a punk record. It is indie rock, or if it were the 90's we'd be calling it Alternative... That's not saying this album sucks, cause it doesn't. These guys are quite good at what they do in the Pavement sort of way...\" --Maximum RocknRoll 339","options":[{"id":12115552,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":6.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35247878/-/mockupfinalcoveronly.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35247878/-/mockupfinalcoveronly.jpg","width":497,"height":496}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2044602,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]}]
