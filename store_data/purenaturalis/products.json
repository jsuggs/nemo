The horizontal dripped pattern is unique and my signature pattern.\r\nI use 100% cotton wicks that I hand crochet in order to achieve the right thickness for this particular candle size. The wicks are pre-dipped and there is no zinc or lead core in them. I do not use any essential oils for these pillars but they give off lovely sweet honey scent that is so natural to pure beeswax.\r\n\r\nThis listing is for 1 pillar candle that weights approx. 1 lb. (485 g).\r\nMeasurements: 3\" wide x 4\" tall (8 cm x 10 cm)\r\nBurn time: over 100 hours\r\n\r\nPure beeswax candles create soft, beautiful and warm light that also purifies the air by creating negative ions. They are non-toxic and non-allergic, perfect for any occasion and they burn several times longer than paraffin candles. They burn without creating soot and smoke. If you burn them in a draft-free environment, they don't drip.\r\n\r\nHOW TO USE:\r\nTo enjoy this candle as long as possible trim the wick to 1/4\" (5-8 mm) and as it burns, push soft sides inward. Burn for 3-4 hours at a time. Frosted white coating called \"bloom\" will develop over time which is attractive and a sure sign that the candle is made of 100 % pure beeswax. If you don't like it, polish it with soft cotton cloth.\r\n\r\nABOUT:\r\nAll Pure Naturalis products are made completely from scratch with basic raw ingredients such as plant oils and butters, clays, salts, fresh and dried botanicals. Some of the products may include beeswax that I obtain from local farmers. There are no synthetic colours or preservatives. A few products include tiny amount of high quality grain alcohol. My formulations are coloured with dried herbs, flowers, seeds and spices and scented with pure essential oils only. Most of our products are excellent for all skin types, children and dry, sensitive skin. And of course they are always free of SLS, parabens, propylene glycol, triclosan, mineral oils, petrolatum, paraffin, artificial fragrances and GMO oils such as soy, cottonseed, canola and corn.\r\n\r\n~ ~ ~\r\nIf you would like more of these beautiful candles, please let me know as I always have more in stock.\r\n\r\nSHIPPING: I refund overcharges in excess of $1.\r\nYour ordered items(s) will be beautifully wrapped and ready for gift-giving.\r\n\r\nPAYMENT: You DO NOT need to have a PayPal account to purchase, just click the Paypal button when you go through the checkout and look for the link to pay with your credit card.\r\n\r\n~ ~ ~\r\nFor more fabulous Pure Naturalis products visit our Facebook page:\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Pure-Naturalis-100-natural-handmade-soap-skin-care/297174296997737","options":[{"id":17754823,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":5.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":20.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69671225/-/Pure_Naturalis_-_Pure_Beeswax_Pillar_Candle-_Unique_Signature_Pattern__27_.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69671225/-/Pure_Naturalis_-_Pure_Beeswax_Pillar_Candle-_Unique_Signature_Pattern__27_.JPG","width":750,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2920311,"name":"Pure Beeswax Candles","permalink":"pure-beeswax-candles","url":"/category/pure-beeswax-candles"}]},{"id":5508685,"name":"Lime+Mint Lip Balm All Natural Unsweetened by Pure Naturalis","permalink":"lime-mint-lip-balm-unsweetened-all-natural","position":3,"price":4.25,"default_price":4.25,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lime-mint-lip-balm-unsweetened-all-natural","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-20T12:06:38.000Z","description":"Lime+Mint Lip Balm - citrus and mint mix is fantastic.
