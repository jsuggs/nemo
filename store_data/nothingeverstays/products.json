Experimenting with ideas and wanting to do something different, the band turned to friend and Producer Brian Wallace to take some of the bands previous work off of their Progression EP and Two Years Later and transform them acoustically.\r\n\r\nIncluded is a DVD that was produced, filmed and put together by Nothing Ever Stays.
