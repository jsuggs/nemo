Although also a silversmith and jeweller he is now best known as functionalist innovator and a key figure in the development of industrial lighting. His significance in the story of Twentieth Century design is becoming increasingly recognised by museum curators worldwide.\r\n\r\nSize: About 45.5 cm (18 inches) in height.\r\n\r\nCondition: Excellent, with only the most minor signs of age and use to the surface of the bakelite. There are no damages such as splits, cracks or dents, just some expected loss to the reflective paint on the inside of the shade. The lamp retains its original switch and is in working order having been rewired at some point in the recent past with a modern Continental European 2-pin plug. However all vintage electrical items must be safety-checked by a qualified electrican before use. Please see my important note concerning the sale of vintage electrical items below.

This had been caused by the economic crises that had gripped Germany in the aftermath of the First World War, culminating in a period of hyperinflation. \r\n\r\nAt the centre of May’s large-scale development scheme – a project that would successfully house ten percent of the Frankfurt population in new modernist dwellings by 1930 – was Schütte-Lihotzky’s remarkably progressive fitted kitchen.\r\n\r\nEach Frankfurt Kitchen was equipped with a stool, a gas stove, a fold-down ironing board and a concealed wastebin. \r\n\r\nBuilt-in storage was provided in the form of cupboards incorporating rows of small removable aluminium drawers, of which the one shown in this listing is a rare survivor. The drawers offered immediate access to everyday ingredients like flour (mehl) and sugar and had pull handles at the front and spouts at the back for easy pouring.\r\n\r\nThe final image is a scan of an original postcard (not included in this sale) showing an installation of the Frankfurt Kitchen at the Deutscher Werkbund's Die Wohnung expo of 1927. The event, which involved among others Behrens, Gropius, Le Corbusier, Mies Van Der Rohe and Oud, provided an opportunity for May and Schütte-Lihotzky to showcase their vision of egalitarian housing settlements to an international audience. This exposure eventually resulted in an invitation - three years later - from the Soviet Union to reproduce New Frankfurt-style developments on a truly mass scale.\r\n\r\n\r\nSize: \r\n\r\nApprox 130mm wide x 160 high x 290 length\r\n\r\n\r\nCondition: \r\n\r\nGood to very good indeed. As you would expect the drawers are in well used original condition. There is expected aged related wear to the surfaces and a couple of minor knocks here and there but no significant damages such as cracks or signs of restoration/repair.\r\n\r\nThe set includes 12 differently labelled storage drawers.\r\n\r\nText and photographs © Room 606.

The impoverished Weimer Republic government was desperately producing emergency money - increasingly high single note denominations - in an attempt to combat acute hyper-inflation.\r\n\r\nBayer returned to the Bauhaus in 1925 - now located at Dessau - as teacher, to lead a new course in advertising and typography. He remained a tutor there until 1928, the same year Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius departed.\r\n\r\nLITERATURE An illustration of the banknote can be found in the catalogue for the famous 50 Years of the Bauhaus exhibition, which was held at the Royal Academy in London in 1968, on page 118.\r\n\r\nCONDITION The notes are in very good circulated condition with some wear and marking consistent with age and use but no damages or repairs.

It's an uncommon slight variant of Dell's Model 6607, having a thinner and longer cylindrical wooden grip handle on the upright.\r\n\r\nAs the master in charge of the metalwork department at the Staatliches Bauhaus in Weimar, Christian Dell (1893-1974) worked in close collaboration with other modernist luminaries such as Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Marianne Brandt, Hin Bredendieck and Hans Przyrembel. Although also a silversmith and jeweller he is now best known as functionalist innovator and a key figure in the development of industrial lighting. His significance in the story of twentieth century design is becoming increasingly recognised by museums and leading auction houses worldwide.\r\n\r\nExecuted in black lacquered steel and chrome with painted wooden handle. The tubular steel upright is extendible to allow different heights and the shade can rotate through 360 degrees. It is stamped Kaiser Idell Original to the shade. The word Idell was an amalgam of Dell and idee, connoting a 'Christian Dell idea'.\r\n\r\nSize: About 570 mm in total height. The shade's diameter is about 160 mm and the diameter of the base is approx. 165 mm.\r\n\r\nCondition: The lamp is in very good unrestored condition with wear to the  surface of the lacquer in places consistent with age and use but no significant damages such cracks or splits to the metal or signs of corrosion . As you can see, it displays beautifully. The surface wear is highlighted in the close-up photos that I have provided below. The silvered interior of the shade is in very good condition.  The lamp retains its original switch but has had all vintage wiring removed for safety reasons, so it will required professional rewiring before use.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nSee Phillips de Pury & Company New York, 20-21st Century Design Art (Sale No. NY050205), December 8, 2005, lot 44 for  a similar (model 6007) Christian Dell lamp.

Among the locations featured are Petticoat Lane, Farringdon Street, Caledonian Market, Brixton, Covent Garden, Berwick Market, Shepherd's Bush, Brick Lane, Billingsgate and Commercial Road.\r\n\r\nThe book includes 64 full-page sepia reproductions of photographs by László Maholy-Nagy. Aside from these trademark atmospheric and dynamic images, the legendary Bauhaus artist / photographer also contributes a short but fascinating introduction.\r\n\r\nA Hungarian, Moholy-Nagy spent five years at the Bauhaus having been appointed a master by Walter Gropius. He wrote two of the books for the famous Bauhausbucher series, which he co-edited with Gropius: Malerei Fotographie Film (Painting Photography Film) and Von Material zu Architecture (published in English as The New Vision).\r\n\r\nHe stayed in London between 1935 and 1937 after the Nazis had forced the closure of the Bauhaus a year earlier. He went on to found the New Bauhaus in Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe Street Markets of London is one of just three books Moholy worked on during his time in the UK. At the time of listing I also have another of these publications - Eton Portrait by Bernard Fergusson - for sale in another auction.\r\n\r\nCondition: An excellent copy, beautifully professionally re-bound in green cloth. Internally it is very clean and bright, save for a small brown mark on the title page. The Moholy-Nagy photographs are absolutely stunning.  There is the bookbinder's book-plate but no previous owners' inscriptions or dustjacket.

The HLD 4's dryer mechanism is incredibly compact even by today's standards, housed within a rounded rectangle shape. \r\n\r\nThe parallel slits on the front pleasingly recall the same designer's famous SK 4 record player of 1956, while the white dot on the circular rocker switch softens the pared down austerity of the overall design.\r\n\r\nWhen launched in 1970 it was available in the three primary colours - a feature that helped to make it as popular with consumers back then as it does with collectors now.\r\n\r\nThe hair dryers are in excellent vintage used condition and working (please see note below). \r\n\r\nThey have only very minor surface signs of use consistent with decades of careful use – there are no cracks or signs of repair. Please scroll to the bottom of this page for more photos.\r\n\r\nThe hair dryers retain their original continental European 2-pin plugs. \r\n\r\nThere are several important things to note about functionality. Please read them carefully as they constitute a condition of sale.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, as is the case with all vintage electrical items, the hair driers are sold here as museum-quality DECORATIVE ITEMS ONLY, without any guarantee of functionality or safe use.\r\n\r\nBecause of their age and the variation in international electrical standards, the are definitely NOT intended for use.

Designed by Dieter Rams and Dietrich Lubs in 1978, the DW 30 is an early example of the digital watch and a shining example of Braun's Bauhaus-tradition design.\r\n\r\nEven the strap exudes functional minimalist perfection – it is attached to the body of the watch by means of four cross-headed screws that are incorporated into a metal strip.\r\n\r\nThe watch was only produced until 1981 and this is one of only 3000 ever made, making this is an extremely rare and highly sought-after item. \r\n\r\nOnly a handful have appeared in modern design sales in the top London auction houses over the past decade or so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCondition:\r\n\r\nThe watch is in excellent condition with minimal surface signs of age and wear but no significant damages or signs of repair.

In my experience it is a particularly hard-to-find model.\r\nI particularly like the colouring of this example; it has a cream dial that is offset by black elements: outer ring, inner ring, Univers type numerals and logo and hands. \r\n\r\nThe clock is fully factory marked both on the front of the dial and reverse. It measures approx. 20 cm in diameter and is in excellent used condition and full working order. There are only minor signs of age and use - no damages or signs of repair.\r\n\r\nReference\r\n\r\nSee Bernd Polster and Olaf Meyer, Braun 50 Jahre Produktinnovation, DuMont Press, Cologne, Germany, 2005, p 237 for illustration and more information. \r\n","options":[{"id":44378100,"name":"Default","price":165.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124954581/-/abk31_03.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124954581/-/abk31_03.jpg","width":1495,"height":1623},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124954578/-/abk31_02.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124954578/-/abk31_02.jpg","width":2938,"height":2152},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124954575/-/abk31_01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124954575/-/abk31_01.jpg","width":2964,"height":1987},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124954587/-/abk31_04.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124954587/-/abk31_04.jpg","width":3077,"height":1918}],"artists":[{"id":135419,"name":"Dieter Rams","permalink":"dieter-rams","url":"/artist/dieter-rams"},{"id":135431,"name":"Dietrich Lubs","permalink":"dietrich-lubs","url":"/artist/dietrich-lubs"}],"categories":[{"id":3666355,"name":"Braun","permalink":"braun","url":"/category/braun"}]},{"id":10415395,"name":"Kaiser-Jubiläums Möbel Ausstellung poster by Franz Fiebiger, 1908 ","permalink":"kaiser-jubilaums-mobel-ausstellung-poster-by-franz-fiebiger-1908","position":20,"price":250.0,"default_price":250.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kaiser-jubilaums-mobel-ausstellung-poster-by-franz-fiebiger-1908","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-08T12:00:00.000Z","description":"Original small poster by Franz Fiebiger for the Kaiser-Jubiläums Möbel Ausstellung (Kaiser's Jubilee Furniture Exhibition), Vienna, 1908. \r\n\r\nFiebiger had studied at the School of Applied Arts in Vienna with Koloman Moser and worked as a painter and graphic artist alongside more established members of the Vienna Secession.\r\n\r\nSize approx. 270 mm x 190 mm\r\n\r\nExcellent original condition","options":[{"id":32617081,"name":"Default","price":250.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":4.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":10.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102379576/-/poster_tn02.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102379576/-/poster_tn02.JPG","width":926,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102379060/-/poster_final.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102379060/-/poster_final.JPG","width":693,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102379348/-/poster_tn.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102379348/-/poster_tn.JPG","width":671,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":192052,"name":"Franz Fiebiger","permalink":"franz-fiebiger","url":"/artist/franz-fiebiger"}],"categories":[{"id":4509668,"name":"Art Nouveau","permalink":"art-nouveau","url":"/category/art-nouveau"},{"id":5015983,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"},{"id":5015986,"name":"Vienna Secession","permalink":"vienna-secession","url":"/category/vienna-secession"}]},{"id":6973673,"name":"A complete collection of Braun + Design / Design + Design Magazines (96 issues)","permalink":"a-complete-collection-of-braun-design-magazines-97-issues","position":21,"price":850.0,"default_price":850.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/a-complete-collection-of-braun-design-magazines-97-issues","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-08-15T19:18:35.000Z","description":"Every issue of the independent Braun journal by and for design obsessives. \r\n\r\nAll issues are original. - not facsimiles.

The largest denominations printed and are now particularly scarce and hard to come by. One milliarde was 1000000000 German Marks. In today's widely-used short scale numbering system, this would equate to 1 billion!\r\n\r\nHerbert Bayer attended the Weimar Bauhaus as a pupil from 1921 to 1923, at the time the economic crisis in post-WW1 Weimar was developing and reaching its dramatic peak. He initially took Johannes Itten's revolutionary Preliminary Course on colour and form, then moved on to study mural painting with Wassily Kandinsky and Oskar Schlemmer. It was at this time that he created the Universal alphabet; the lower-case only typography now synonymous with the Bauhaus and its powerful legacy. In 1923 he was also commissioned by the Thuringian State in Weimar to design the new high value banknotes. The impoverished Weimer Republic government was desperately producing emergency money - increasingly high single note denominations - in an attempt to combat acute hyper-inflation.\r\n \r\nBayer returned to the Bauhaus in 1925 - now located at Dessau - as teacher, to lead a new course in advertising and typography. He remained a tutor there until 1928, the same year Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius departed.\r\n \r\nFor background on hyper-inflation in the Weimar Republic see Wikipedia.org: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_inflation\r\n \r\nAn illustration of the banknote can be found in the catalogue for the first Bauhaus retrospective -  '50 Years of the Bauhaus' - which was held at the Royal Academy in London in 1968. The reference is on page 118.\r\n \r\nCondition: The note is in good circulated condition with some wear and marking consistent with age and use but no damages or repairs.

He also had connections with the social theorists of the Frankfurt School and worked on commissions from Theodor Adorno at Institute for Social Research during its tenure in New York.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Germany in 1947, holding the post of director of the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main until his retirement in 1962. (For more info seehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Kramer)\r\n\r\nMaterials: Nickel plated metal complete with circular lock plates \r\n\r\nCondition: Very good well used condition with no significant damages, but expected surface wear reflecting decades of age and use. They exhibit a beautiful patina.

But her tenure at the Gotha-based company was short-lived, coming after another relatively brief assignment working at Walter Gropius’s architectural office in Berlin.\r\n\r\nShe took over control of the firm’s metal product range and was charged with updating and reviving it, but ultimately found the firm’s inveterate conservatism stifling. This is an excellent example of this firms output during this period of modernization.\r\n\r\nDimensions: H. 15 x 10.2 x 11.8 cm.\r\n\r\nCondition: Very good used condition with some patination to the brass that could be improved with polishing.

It so doing it presents an essential pictorial history of the new architecture of the 1920s. \r\n\r\nWalter Gropius, Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret, Marcel Breuer, HP Berlage, Hans and Wasssili Luckhardt, Robert Mallet-Stephens, Erich Medelsohn, Bruno Paul, Gerrit Rietveld, Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe, Naum Gabo, Mart Stam, Hans Scharoun and Arthur Korn himself are among those included. There are numerous photographs of the Dessau Bauhaus, including many interesting interiors, and several of the buildings built for the Weissenhofsiedlung in Stuttgart. There is also a section on the use of glass in the decorative arts.\r\n\r\nKorn was himself a key figure in the modern movement in Germany. As an architect in the 1910s and 1920s, he had been an associate of Erich Mendelsohn, Walter Gropius and Ernst May, before being forced to flea Germany in 1938. Once settled in England he became a leading member of of the MARS Group (Modern Architectural Research Group) - chairing their plan for the regeneration of London in 1942. He went on to teach at the Architectural Association in London for twenty years.\r\n\r\nBook condition: Very good overall with signs of use consistent with age. There is minor yellowing to the page edges but the photographic plates remain crisp and stunning. There are no previous inscriptions, although for reasons unknown a previous owner has glued a small rectangle of brown paper (approx. 2cm x 3cm) to the title page beneath the title, next to the phrase ‘187 abbildungen’ \r\n","options":[{"id":41780220,"name":"Default","price":0.01,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":22.0,"amount_with_others":11.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123097353/-/KORN011_05_finala.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123097353/-/KORN011_05_finala.jpg","width":710,"height":791},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123097521/-/KORN011_01_finala.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123097521/-/KORN011_01_finala.JPG","width":800,"height":641},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123097527/-/KORN011_02_final_sm.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123097527/-/KORN011_02_final_sm.JPG","width":900,"height":574},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123097677/-/KORN011_03_finala.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123097677/-/KORN011_03_finala.JPG","width":800,"height":528}],"artists":[{"id":227109,"name":"Arthur Korn","permalink":"arthur-korn","url":"/artist/arthur-korn"}],"categories":[{"id":4367846,"name":"Books and Periodicals","permalink":"books-and-periodicals","url":"/category/books-and-periodicals"},{"id":3578335,"name":"Bauhaus","permalink":"bauhaus","url":"/category/bauhaus"}]},{"id":13971825,"name":"Christopher Dresser andirons (attributed) for Benham and Froud, England, c.1890 ","permalink":"christopher-dresser-andirons-attributed-for-benham-and-froud-england-c-1890","position":30,"price":360.0,"default_price":360.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/christopher-dresser-andirons-attributed-for-benham-and-froud-england-c-1890","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-04T15:06:13.000Z","description":"This wonderful pair of brass andirons, fire dogs or fire iron rests were attributed to the legendary English designer Christopher Dresser by Christie's of London in 2004 (see full reference below). \r\n\r\nApprox 16 cm high.\r\n\r\nLiterature:\r\nChristie's London (South Kensington), The Harry Lyons Collection, 19 October 2004, Lot 337.\r\n\r\nThey also appear in Dresser: People’s Designer, Exhibition by New Century June 1999, Item M-099, where they are unequivocally described as being Dresser’s design.\r\n\r\n\r\nCondition: \r\nExcellent used condition with no damages, just expected surface wear.\r\n\r\nA wonderful period find, they will look stunning as display pieces or given a new lease of life in the right location.\r\n\r\n\r\n© Text and photographs copyright of room_606.

He initially took Johannes Itten's revolutionary Preliminary Course on colour and form, then moved on to study mural painting with Wassily Kandinsky and Oskar Schlemmer. It was at this time that he created the Universal alphabet; the lower-case only typography now synonymous with the Bauhaus and its powerful legacy. In 1923 he was also commissioned by the Thuringian State in Weimar to design the new high value banknotes. The impoverished Weimer Republic government was desperately producing emergency notes - increasingly dramatic denominations - in a desperate attempt to combat acute hyper-inflation.\r\n \r\nBayer returned to the Bauhaus in 1925 - by then located at Dessau - as teacher, to lead a new course in advertising and typography. He remained a tutor there until 1928, the same year Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius departed. He emigated to the U.S.A in 1938 and established himself as a renowned graphic designer in America.","options":[{"id":29081090,"name":"Default","price":165.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":20.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91345835/-/bayerposter01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91345835/-/bayerposter01.jpg","width":375,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91345106/-/bauhaus50poster.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91345106/-/bauhaus50poster.jpg","width":280,"height":396}],"artists":[{"id":135417,"name":"Herbert Bayer","permalink":"herbert-bayer","url":"/artist/herbert-bayer"}],"categories":[{"id":3578335,"name":"Bauhaus","permalink":"bauhaus","url":"/category/bauhaus"},{"id":5015983,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":14068734,"name":"Modernist bowl by the Bauhaus student Karl Raichle, ca. 1935","permalink":"modernist-bowl-by-the-bauhaus-student-karl-raichle-ca-1935","position":46,"price":165.0,"default_price":165.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/modernist-bowl-by-the-bauhaus-student-karl-raichle-ca-1935","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-09T12:52:08.000Z","description":"Karl Raichle was a student at the Dessau Bauhaus while the metalwork department was being run by László Moholy-Nagy.\r\n\r\nOwing to leftist activism in his youth, Raichle was twice forced to relocate during the rise of the National Socialists.\r\n\r\nHis pieces - usually executed in pewter, copper or brass - are signed Meersburg, the town on Lake Constance where he was able to set up in business after 1933.

Peter Behrens, Bruno Paul, Richard Riemerschmid, Josef Maria Olbrich and Wiener Werkstatte founder Josef Hoffmann were all among its members.\r\n\r\nThe group went on to exert enormous influence in the progress of modernist design and functionalism, particularly in the formation of the Bauhaus.\r\n\r\nThis issue from July 1930 is replete with photographs of modernist architecture, furniture and interiors and features a fabulous 11-page illustrated article on the nascent Kiefhoek housing estate, designed by J.J.P. Oud in Rotterdam. \r\n\r\nThe project - built between 1928-30 by a key figure of De Stijl - gave rise to a complete modernist neighbourhood, is a true highlight of the Modern Movement and was declared a national Dutch monument in the 1990s.\r\n\r\nOther topics covered include news of a new housing development underway in Cologne and the Lichtbild art exhibition in Munich, held that year.\r\n\r\nCondition: It is very good indeed with only minor signs of ageing and use. The pages are clean and bright with no foxing. There is a neat ink inscription and institution stamp on the title page and a faint inscription in pencil on the back cover.","options":[{"id":40308276,"name":"Default","price":105.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":4.25}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122032542/-/form_juli_1930a.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122032542/-/form_juli_1930a.JPG","width":1062,"height":1500}],"artists":[{"id":222024,"name":"J.J.P.

The clamp fixture is complete, retainaing its original heart-shaped screw and white switch.\r\n\r\nAs the master in charge of the metalwork department at the Staatliches Bauhaus in Weimar, Christian Dell (1893-1974) worked in close collaboration with other modernist luminaries such as Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Marianne Brandt, Hin Bredendieck and Hans Przyrembel. Although also a silversmith and jeweller he is now best known as functionalist innovator and a key figure in the development of industrial lighting. His significance in the story of twentieth century design is becoming increasingly recognised by museums worldwide.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaterials: Lacquered steel. \r\n\r\nSize: About 55cm in height.

In the 1920s the Bauhaus used it in their workshops as they considered it useful and convenient lighting. Marianne Brandt, comparing Curt Fischer's light with the general Bauhaus model, said: \"even if our lights are adjustable, they are not as elegant and we envied the creator of the Midgard lamp.\"’\r\n\r\nCondition\r\n\r\nVery good indeed. As you would expect from a vintage item, it has taken some minor knocks over the years and their are expected minor surface traces of use consistent with age, but no significant damages such as cracks or major dents to the metal or corrosion. I believe the enamelling is original. The lamp has been rewired at some point by a previous owner with what appears to be modern continental European wiring and it works.

A noted precursor of modernism, this design is held in the collection of the Bröhan Museum of Art Nouveau, Art Deco and Functionalism, in Berlin and illustrated and described in the museum's catalogue, Modern Art of Metalwork, on page 155. Another example of this jug is on display at the Bauhaus Archive in Berlin.\r\n\r\nIt also appeared in the Deutsches Warenbuch of 1915 and bears close comparison to contemporary Deutscher Werkbund pieces by Peter Behrens, Bruno Paul, Josef Maria Olbrich and Richard Riemerschmid and others. In fact, in some volumes the design is firmly attributed to Riemerschmid, although this is not substantiated by Brohan, probably the most authoritative source.\r\n\r\nThe Deutscher Werkbund (DWB) was a group founded by Peter Behrens and Josef Hoffmann and involving Walter Gropius among others to promote the marriage of artistic endeavour with mass production. They went on to exert enormous influence in the progess of modernist design and functionalism, particularly in the formation of the Bauhaus.\r\n\r\nF. & R. Fischer operated from a factory in Göppingen, southern Germany. Little is known about precisely which designers contributed designs for them, but their consciously functional and forward-looking workbetrays the influence of Art Nouveau, the Wiener Werkstatte and Jan Eisenloeffel among others.\r\n\r\nDescription: The jug is of spherical form with cup-shaped lid and curving thumb-rest and raffia covered handle. The jug is executed in hand hammered nickel plated brass. It has interior pewter plating and bears the Fischer factory mark (two fish in an oval) the underside.\r\n \r\nSize: It stands at about 6 inches in height.\r\n \r\nCondition: Very good original condition, with only minor surface signs of age and use. There are no significant damages - just a couple of minor bumps to the metal. The fragile raffia handle is fragile but in good condition.

The impoverished Weimer Republic government was desperately producing emergency money - increasingly high single note denominations - in an attempt to combat acute hyper-inflation.\r\n\r\nBayer returned to the Bauhaus in 1925 - now located at Dessau - as teacher, to lead a new course in advertising and typography. He remained a tutor there until 1928, the same year Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius departed.\r\n\r\nLITERATURE An illustration of the banknote can be found in the catalogue for the famous 50 Years of the Bauhaus exhibition, which was held at the Royal Academy in London in 1968, on page 118.\r\n\r\nCONDITION The note is in good to very good circulated condition with some wear and marking consistent with age and use but no damages or repairs.

The sliding switch mechanism was a design innovation at the time.\r\n\r\nIt was created by Reinhold Weiss, then working under the design directorship of Dieter Rams. Weiss was the designer of several landmark Braun pieces of this period, including the HL 1 desk fan and HUV 1 sun lamp, both of which are represented in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York.\r\n\r\nThis lighter has a gold-plated case, making it a real luxuriant rarity. They are usually found in either polished chrome metal or in chrome with a panel of black faux-leather.\r\n\r\nThe piece is marked Braun permanent, Made in West Germany on the underside.  It measures approximately 105mm long by 32mm wide and 75 mm high and takes a type of fuel - gas - that's still very commonly available today.\r\n\r\nIt’s in extremely good vintage cosmetic condition.  It has only minor surface signs of use consistent with decades of careful use – there are no deep scratches, cracks or signs of repair. \r\n\r\nThe mechanism sparks and works but but is inconsistent. Because vintage items can go wrong at any time, it is being sold here as a display item only.\r\n\r\n***In the final picture the TFG 1 is pictured with a silver-plated T2 lighter by Dieter Rams. Please note that the T2 is not included in this sale but available in a separate listing.***\r\n\r\nIn all, a wonderful, museum quality example of 1960s Braun design. This model was only produced for two years and is correspondingly hard to find.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nSee Bernd Polster and Olaf Meyer, Braun 50 Jahre Produktinnovation, DuMont Press, Cologne, Germany, 2005, p 257 and 476 for an illustration and more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n© Text and photographs copyright room_606 (2013).","options":[{"id":38878554,"name":"Default","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":22.0,"amount_with_others":11.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120839214/-/gold01.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120839214/-/gold01.JPG","width":650,"height":533},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120839046/-/gold02.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120839046/-/gold02.jpg","width":1000,"height":660},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120839118/-/gold04.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120839118/-/gold04.jpg","width":1000,"height":665},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120839070/-/gold03.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120839070/-/gold03.jpg","width":1000,"height":753},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120838626/-/lighters02sm.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120838626/-/lighters02sm.JPG","width":1000,"height":748}],"artists":[{"id":135439,"name":"Reinhold Weiss","permalink":"reinhold-weiss","url":"/artist/reinhold-weiss"}],"categories":[{"id":3666355,"name":"Braun","permalink":"braun","url":"/category/braun"}]},{"id":11492325,"name":"EAMES OFFICE | Ticket for Griffith Park miniature railway, Los Angeles, 1957","permalink":"eames-office-ticket-for-griffith-park-miniature-railway-los-angeles-1957","position":68,"price":265.0,"default_price":265.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/eames-office-ticket-for-griffith-park-miniature-railway-los-angeles-1957","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-31T14:53:32.000Z","description":"In 1957 the Eames Office was invited to completely re-design a miniature railway at the Los Angeles amusement park Griffith Park.\r\n\r\nThis is a rare surviving ticket from the small-scale and slightly homespun project, which the Eameses undertook despite having already earned an international reputation by this stage of their careers.\r\n\r\nFor inspiration they drew upon a toy train set they had in their own collection and late nineteenth century carnival memorabilia.\r\n\r\nFor more information see Pat Kirkham, Charles and Ray Eames: Designers of the twentieth century, MIT Press, 1998, pp 130-131.\r\n\r\nSize: 2.5 inches (h) x 1.75 (w)\r\n\r\nPaper\r\n\r\nRare","options":[{"id":36215658,"name":"Default","price":265.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.22,"amount_with_others":3.11,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":12.4,"amount_with_others":6.2}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/113109462/-/griffith.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/113109462/-/griffith.jpg","width":499,"height":638},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/113110488/-/griffith01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/113110488/-/griffith01.jpg","width":472,"height":606}],"artists":[{"id":138667,"name":"Charles and Ray Eames","permalink":"charles-and-ray-eames","url":"/artist/charles-and-ray-eames"}],"categories":[{"id":3578341,"name":"Other Modernism","permalink":"other-modernism","url":"/category/other-modernism"}]},{"id":8863904,"name":"Kandem desk lamp","permalink":"kandem-desk-lamp","position":69,"price":350.0,"default_price":350.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kandem-desk-lamp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-09T19:25:01.000Z","description":"A modernist desk lamp, manufactured by Kandem (Korting und Mathieson), Leipzig, Germany, in the late 1930s\r\n\r\n **Please scroll down for multiple pictures \r\n \r\nBackground:\r\nWalter Gropius intended the Bauhaus at Dessau to be a factory of ideas and innovation that attracted the co-operation of industry. He hoped that the design prototypes his masters and students produced would be taken up by the leading companies of the day and - in close collaboration with the School - developed for industrial production.\r\nThis ambition was successful only in a few cases, but this lamp is an example of one such collaboration. The alliance between the Bauhaus and the Leipzig-based firm Korting und Mathieson began in the late 1920s and persisted into the 1930s.\r\nBy co-operating with the Bauhaus, Kandem acquired creative partnerships with several of its key figures, including Marianne Brandt, Hin Bredendieck and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy.\r\n \r\nDetails:\r\nThe lamp clearly exhibits the company's Bauhaus functionalist ethos. \r\n\r\nExecuted in a very dark green lacquered metal, the lamp is very flexible and manoeuvrable. The curved arm is set into the base with a ball socket and the joint that links the arm to the shade pivots up and down. \r\n\r\nThe lamp retains its original switch and is signed K & M for Korting and Mathieson on the underside of the base. The shade is enamelled white on the inside. \r\nIt stands at approximately 480 mm in height, while the diameter of the shade is about 180 mm.\r\n \r\nBibliographic references:\r\nSee Bauhausleuchten? Kandemlicht! (Bauhaus Lighting? Kandem light!: The Collaboration of the Bauhaus with the Leipzig Company Kandem), Justus A. Binroth et al., Arnoldsche Art Publishers, Stuttgart, pp 144/5. \r\n \r\nCondition:\r\nThe lamp is in excellent used condition with just very minor general surface wear consistent with age. There are no significant damages such as dents or scratches. The lamp retains vintage (though apprently not original) European wiring and works. In common with all vintage electrical items it must be safety checked by a qualified electrician before use.

Peter Behrens, Bruno Paul, Richard Riemerschmid, Josef Maria Olbrich and Wiener Werkstatte founder Josef Hoffmann were all among its members. \r\n\r\nThe group went on to exert enormous influence in the progress of modernist design and functionalism, particularly in the formation of the Bauhaus. \r\n\r\nThis issue from June 1928 is replete with photographs of modernist architecture, furniture and interiors and features articles by the architect Wilhelm Lotz and Walter Riezler among others. The contents are listed as follows:\r\n\r\nFurnishings and furniture types (featuring multiple illustrations of chair designs by Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe and Ferdinand Kramer, among others) | A Design for a Stadium | A contribution to the reform of cemeteries | The anniversary of the Wiener Werkstätte\r\n\r\nCondition: It is generally very good with some expected signs of ageing and use. The pages are clean and bright with no foxing. The front cover has only minor fading and wear to the extremities and displays brilliantly.

Internally extremely good, some light general wear but no significant faults or damages. As you always find in this publication, there some wrinkling and age-caused browning to the glassine wrapper but otherwise very good. \r\n\r\nImportantly, as you can see, all five of the coloured cut-out pieces contained within the glassine cover are present. Because it is easy for them to fall out in the course of normal handling, these are very often missing.\r\n\r\nIn all, a great copy of a scarce and important book - particularly rare in hard cover.

This is a very fragile publication and I would rate this extremely rare set as an excellent survival. The bindings are fragile throughout and the roughly cut page edges are a little dusty. Number 5, Vesnice spí, is the hardcover edition and in excellent condition. The all important covers are very good, though a little yellowed and slightly worn at the edges and very fragile at the spine in places they display beautifully. Some volumes have mylar covers.

His unrepentantly visionary approach to industrial design is documented in this book, in which the designer himself lays out in words, plans photographs and drawings his startling futuristic manifesto for modernising transport.\r\n \r\nThis stylish book records and expands on Geddes's celebrated exhibit at the 1939 Worlds Fair. Futurama: Metropolis of Tomorrow  mesmerised over five million (!) visitors with its creator's startlingly forward-looking plan for a utopian automobile-based national traffic system, complete with teardrop-shaped cars, cities of Art Deco glass and steel skyscrapers and open parklands intersected by seven-lane highways.\r\n \r\nThe influence Futurama left on visitors and commentators at the time was monumental and it earned General Motors, who had commissioned the exhibit, lasting kudos. Decades later the project received a reverential nod from Matt Groening, in the title of his undeservedly shortlived Sci-fi follow-up to The Simpsons.\r\n \r\nCondition: International FIRST EDITION and stated First Printing. Hardback in with dark brown/maroon lettering on cream boards. Condition: Very good indeed with only minor signs of age and use. No DJ. There is a little bumping to the covers and some foxing to the front and rear end papers only. Both externally and internally it is very clean and bright and the binding is tight. The black and white photographs are vibrant. Extremely rare and much sought-after in any condition.

It looks like the ultimate 70s design item, but somehow it's also hard to believe that it is over 30 years old.\r\n\r\nThe stylish L-shaped design is matched by a range of functions that includes an automatically dimming LED display and touch sensitive snooze bar.\r\n\r\nThis was conceived by Littmann while he was working under the Design Directorship of Dieter Rams.\r\n\r\nIt’s in excellent vintage used condition. The display is bright, the clock keeps excellent time and the alarm and snooze functions work. It has only very minor surface signs of use consistent with decades of careful use – there are no deep scratches, cracks or signs of repair. \r\n\r\nPlease note that the item’s functionality has been tested on the European mains electricity supply – others please check with an electrician local to you to confirm functionality. The label states that the clock uses 220 V ~ /50 Hz. All vintage electrical items should be safety checked before use. Needless to say, being a vintage item, its longevity as an accurate or functioning timepiece can't be guaranteed.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nAn example is held in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York.

These include Peter Behrens, Hans Christiansen, Patriz Huber, Emanuel Josef Margold, Albin Müller and Joseph Maria Olbrich.\r\n \r\nIn its expression of the dynamic German response to Art Nouveau, the influence of the Darmstadt colony is too often overlooked or understated.\r\n\r\nIt directly influenced the Austrian avant garde and particularly the establishment of the Wiener Werkstatte and later, via the Deutscher Werkbund, the emergence of modernism.\r\n\r\nAn extremely valuable reference for students, enthusiasts, collectors and dealers in German Art Nouveau, featuring myriad\r\nillustrations of work by the artists and designers of the Darmstadt Artists' Colony and fascinating documentary photographs of the settlement itself.\r\n \r\nThe books measures approximately 22 cm (8.75 inches) square.\r\n \r\nCondition: In very good condition indeed with only minor signs age and use. Internally the pages are very clean and bright.\r\n","options":[{"id":39572913,"name":"Default","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121521768/-/darmstadt01a.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121521768/-/darmstadt01a.JPG","width":1173,"height":1200}],"artists":[{"id":135581,"name":"Emanuel Josef Margold","permalink":"emanuel-josef-margold","url":"/artist/emanuel-josef-margold"},{"id":135453,"name":"Peter Behrens","permalink":"peter-behrens","url":"/artist/peter-behrens"}],"categories":[{"id":4509668,"name":"Art Nouveau","permalink":"art-nouveau","url":"/category/art-nouveau"},{"id":4367846,"name":"Books and Periodicals","permalink":"books-and-periodicals","url":"/category/books-and-periodicals"},{"id":5801391,"name":"Darmstadt Artists' Colony","permalink":"darmstadt-artists-colony","url":"/category/darmstadt-artists-colony"},{"id":6333009,"name":"Items < 51 GBP","permalink":"items-51-gbp","url":"/category/items-51-gbp"}]},{"id":14069349,"name":"Original modernist door handles designed by Hans POELZIG, ca. 1935 [4 pairs available]","permalink":"4-pairs-of-original-modernist-door-handles-designed-by-hans-poelzig-ca-1935","position":102,"price":100.0,"default_price":100.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/4-pairs-of-original-modernist-door-handles-designed-by-hans-poelzig-ca-1935","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-09T13:26:56.000Z","description":"These striking period door handles were specifically designed for the administrative offices of the giant I.G. Farben paint factory in Frankfurt.\r\n\r\nThe building, completed in 1931, was the work of the architect, painter and set designer Hans Poelzig.\r\n\r\nOne of the progenitors of the Modern Movement, Poelzig participated in the first major International Style project, the 1927 Die Wohnung expo.\r\n\r\nThe event saw the construction of an entire estate of modernist dwellings in the elevated Weissenhof suburb of Stuttgart.\r\n\r\nPoelzig contributed a prototype single family house alongside Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, Gropius and Behrens among others.\r\n\r\nHis imposing I.G. Farben building still stands and has become the centrepiece of the Goethe University campus in Frankfurt. Poelzig died in 1936, aged 67.\r\n\r\nThe nickel-plated brass door handles are offered without lock plates. They are in good to very good condition with signs of use and wear commensurate with age but no significant damages. They will look fabulous re-used in the right setting.\r\n\r\nLiterature:\r\n\r\nSiegfried Gronert, Türdrücker der Moderne, eine Designgeschichte, W.

This feature had been introduced by Dieter Rams in his iconic HLD 4 model in 1970. Furthermore, the cylindrical shape of the rear section mirrors the H 7 heater, which Weiss has co-designed with Rams in 1967. \r\n\r\nThe Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York holds eleven Reinhold Weiss items in its permanent collection, including the HLD 2 hairdryer.\r\n\r\nThis hairdryer comes in a boxed Coiffeur set that includes a pouch and original box, instructions card and guarantee leaflet. It is in absolutely mint / unused working condition. It's a truly fabulous find.\r\n\r\nThe hairdryer has a continental European 2-pin plug and has an integral voltage selector for 220 or 110 volts. There are several important things to note about functionality. \r\n\r\nMost importantly, all vintage electrical items are sold here as decorative items only and must be fully safety checked by a qualified electrician before being plugged into the mains, if you decide you want to use them. Please see my important condition of sale note covering all types of vintage electrical items below.\r\nSecondly, following any safety check, it is important to note that the hair dryer would require an inexpensive socket adapter to be used outside continental Europe. They are definitely NOT intended for use with bathroom shaver sockets.\r\nFurthermore, the items' functionality has been tested – for the buyer’s information only - on UK mains electricity supply. The selector for 110 volts was not tested. Prospective buyers from other countries must check with an electrician local to them to confirm safe compatibility. \r\n\r\n\r\nReference\r\nBernd Polster and Olaf Meyer, Braun 50 Jahre Produktinnovation, DuMont Press, Cologne, Germany, 2005, pp 464 for more information.

The sliding switch mechanism was a design innovation at the time.\r\n\r\nIt was created by Reinhold Weiss, then working under the design directorship of Dieter Rams. Weiss was the designer of several landmark Braun pieces of this period, including the HL 1 desk fan and HUV 1 sun lamp, both of which are represented in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York.\r\n\r\nThe piece is marked Braun permanent, Made in West Germany on the underside.  It measures approximately 105mm long by 32mm wide and 75 mm high and takes a type of fuel - gas - that's still very commonly available today.\r\n\r\nIt’s in very good vintage cosmetic condition.  It has only minor surface signs of use consistent with decades of careful use – there are no deep scratches, cracks or signs of repair. \r\n\r\nThe mechanism sparks and the lighter works, usually on the second click.

Please note that the item’s functionality has been tested on the European mains electricity supply (220 V ~ /50 Hz) – others please check with an electrician local to you to confirm functionality.

Sutnar become its principle art director in 1929, bringing his visionary approach to design to bear on all aspects of its output.\r\n\r\nHis startlingly innovative book jacket designs included the pioneering use of photomontage and  photographic detail inspired by Hollywood cinematography. \r\n\r\nAs the Victoria & Albert Museum states in its Modernism microsite, Sutnar played a very key role in the emergence of Modernism, but has been widely overlooked outside Eastern Europe.

Farben paint factory in Frankfurt.\r\n\r\nThe building, completed in 1931, was the work of the architect, painter and set designer Hans Poelzig.\r\n\r\nOne of the progenitors of the Modern Movement, Poelzig participated in the first major International Style project, the 1927 Die Wohnung expo.\r\n\r\nThe event saw the construction of an entire estate of modernist dwellings in the elevated Weissenhof suburb of Stuttgart.\r\n\r\nPoelzig contributed a prototype single family house alongside Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, Gropius and Behrens among others.\r\n\r\nHis imposing I.G. Farben building still stands and has become the centrepiece of the Goethe University campus in Frankfurt. Poelzig died in 1936, aged 67.\r\n\r\nThe nickel-plated aluminium door handles I'm offering here are of later manufacture, probably the early 1950s. They retain their original rectangular lock plates.\r\n\r\nThey are in excellent used condition with expected signs of use, but no significant damages. They will look fabulous given a new lease of life in the right setting.\r\n\r\nThis is one of 4 pairs I have available.

This had been caused by the economic crises that had gripped Germany in the aftermath of the First World War. \r\n\r\nKramer was also a contributor to the second C.I.A.M. conference, which was held in Frankfurt in 1929 and was focused on promoting functionalism in architecture through an evaluation of May's work. \r\n\r\nIn 1938 Kramer emigrated to the United States and soon began work on a number of design projects, including  a collaboration with the visionary Norman Bel Geddes on designs for the 1939 World's Fair in New York. \r\n\r\nHe also had connections with the social theorists of the Frankfurt School and worked on commissions from Theodor Adorno at Institute for Social Research during its tenure in New York.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Germany in 1947, holding the post of director of the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main until his retirement in 1962.\r\n\r\nMaterials: Nickel plated metal complete with original rectangular lock plates.\r\n\r\nCondition:Extremely good used condition with no significant damages, just expected surface wear reflecting decades of age and use. \r\n\r\nReferences: Berthold Lubetkin used Kramer's handles for his terrace of four houses at Genesta Road, London in 1933-4.\r\n\r\n** MORE QUANTITIES CAN BE SOURCED ON REQUEST.

It’s also an extremely pleasing device to handle and operate.\r\n\r\nIn their book Braun 50 Jahre Produktinnovation, Bernd Polster and Olaf Meyer describe it as a “minimalist monument” and “the simplest object yet to bear the Braun logo” (see below for reference).\r\n\r\nWeiss was the designer of several important Braun products - including the TFG 1 table lighter, HLD 2 hair dryer and the HL 1 and HL 70 desk fans and the Museum of Modern Art in New York has no fewer than eleven of his creations for the firm in its permanent collection.\r\nThe grinder is mains operated and has a standard European 2-pin plug.

It's a particularly ingenious design, using a spinning slotted cylinder to produce a surprisingly strong gust of cool air in two optional speed settings. To my mind, despite being a full 50 years old, it is far more effective than modern fans of the same size. The stand can be removed, allowing it to be operated upright, on its cylindrical base. There is a HL 1 in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York.\r\n\r\nThe fan is housed in a light grey plastic and steel casing and has a clear plastic guard with the Braun company logo in red. It measures approximately 140 mm x 140 mm x 70 mm. It is mains operated and has a standard European 2-pin plug.
