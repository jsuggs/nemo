Unquestionably one of the most talented electronic artists in the world, through his highly energetic DJ sets, sublime productions and acclaimed label Noir Music he has tirelessly built a reputation as a leader in his field. \r\n\r\nNotable releases include his collaboration with Haze ‘Around’, the Solomun remix of which has been the undisputed deep house anthem of the last 18 months, demonstrating Noir’s exceptional ear and propensity for being ahead of the game in nurturing world-class talent. This has since been cemented by signings such as NICe7 and Hot Since 82 to his label, proving his skills as an A&R are of an equally exemplary standard to those as a recording artist. \r\n\r\nHere he drops two brand new remixes, both of which can be found on his upcoming Noir In The House compilation, released 28th January on Defected Records. \r\n\r\nFirst up is his reworking of one of the biggest Ibiza bombs of recent memory, Intruder’s unifying ‘Amame’. Stripping things back to a bare, hypnotic groove, Noir allows the unmistakable vocal of Jei to float silkily over the raw percussion and twisted stabs of synth, creating a darkly persuasive record perfect for those deeper moments. \r\n\r\nNoir then heads further back in time, plucking Jason Jink’s seminal ‘Your First Time’ from his dusty shelves and smartening it up for today’s dancefloors. Heavily beefed drums and skittering hats add a distinct new dimension as Noir preserves the driving bass and sultry vocal. For lovers of the original record, this version offers the perfect update while simultaneously introducing it to new fans across the world.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://po.st/defitunes\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for iTunes.</a>\r\n\r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE:  All items will be shipped, once in stock, via an express service during this festive season.</b>\r\nUK - next day delivery\r\nEurope - 1-2 days\r\nROW - 3-5 days","options":[{"id":41716695,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":9.99,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123046551/-/NOIRITH_SAMPLER__B.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123046551/-/NOIRITH_SAMPLER__B.jpg","width":1500,"height":1500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123046566/-/NOIRITH_SAMPLER__A.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123046566/-/NOIRITH_SAMPLER__A.jpg","width":1500,"height":1500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6034341,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":13070970,"name":"DFTD Sampler Volume 1 LTD Vinyl","permalink":"dftd-sampler-volume-1-ltd-vinyl","position":40,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dftd-sampler-volume-1-ltd-vinyl","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-20T15:41:44.000Z","description":"<a href=\"http://po.st/defitunes\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for iTunes.</a>\r\n\r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE:  All items will be shipped, once in stock, via an express service during this festive season.</b>\r\nUK - next day delivery\r\nEurope - 1-2 days\r\nROW - 3-5 days","options":[{"id":41718906,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.25,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":9.99,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123048144/-/DFTD_SAMPLER1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123048144/-/DFTD_SAMPLER1.jpg","width":1500,"height":1500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6034341,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":13070349,"name":"Pipes Crooked Love (Trevino Remix) LTD Vinyl","permalink":"pipes-crooked-love-trevino-remix-ltd-vinyl","position":41,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pipes-crooked-love-trevino-remix-ltd-vinyl","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-20T14:55:26.000Z","description":"A Peter Pipes and DJ Parrot hook up with a Trevino collabo.

'Amame' has been floating around a very select DJ circle on limited vinyl pressing for some four months, and the question has evolved to 'how can I get hold of this tune?' 'Amame' is a Murk production from Oscar G and Ralph Falcon under the guise of Intruder. Any Murk production is a rare thing, and a record of this quality and breadth of appeal is perhaps even rarer. Effortlessly straddling the often tricky to navigate border between house and techno, it features one of the most hypnotically memorable vocals of the year courtesy of Jei. Already being championed by the likes of Kerri Chandler, Dennis Ferrer, Seth Troxler and even Ricardo Villalobos has ensured that all those loitering around the booths of DC10's closing party and Fabric's birthday were enquiring of its story.

To round off the package he then set about destroying the original vocal with trademark BHQ cut ups and a baseline that harks back to Leslie Joy's \"Love and Happiness\".\r\n\r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: If you order after 16/12/13 we can’t guarantee delivery before 25/12/13 due to the festive season.</b>\r\nUK - next day delivery\r\nEurope - 1-2 days\r\nROW - 3-5 days","options":[{"id":42322215,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":9.99,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123478716/-/DJ_SPEN_FALL_DOWN_ON_ME__A.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123478716/-/DJ_SPEN_FALL_DOWN_ON_ME__A.jpg","width":1500,"height":1500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6034341,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":13239711,"name":"Grand Corporation 'Wonder & Amazement' Ltd Edition Vinyl","permalink":"grand-corporation-wonder-amazement-ltd-edition-vinyl","position":51,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/grand-corporation-wonder-amazement-ltd-edition-vinyl","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-29T10:52:05.000Z","description":"Wonder & Amazement is a record I’ve had in various forms and incarnations from ex Chicken Lips members Steve Kotey & Andy Meecham for about a year now – a song that immediately grabbed me from the very first moment I heard it. Reminiscent of days gone by mixed with a touch of the new - a song that contains a mixture of both the old Classic and the new Classic. I’ve been championing it for a while now either in sets or charts, even including it on a recent compilation I did. A record that we are proud to be able to use as a soundtrack to this new era of Classic. Adding to its unique wonder we talked to a few amazing producers to get their own vibes on it for remixes. Crooked Man aka DJ Parrott I’ve been a fan of for years as part of The All Seeing Eye, his recent ‘Machine’, ‘Preset’ and ‘Ill Be Loving You’ releases (all of which I actually tried to sign to Classic) and for generally being a bit of a Sheffield legend. Here his two mixes are exactly what I hoped for from him. Deetron’s productions and remixes I’ve liked for ages and he seemed to be the right person to go to to give this record that bigger mix it needed. Yosa, is a completely under-rated Japanese producer in my eyes, who’s recent records have stayed in my sets for a long long time – the vocal & Instrumental mix delivered here are his second attempt, stripping back the unnecessary fiddly bits and keeping it bare to the bones…classic.\r\n\r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: If you order after 16/12/13 we can’t guarantee delivery before 25/12/13 due to the festive season.</b>\r\nUK - next day delivery\r\nEurope - 1-2 days\r\nROW - 3-5 days","options":[{"id":42322176,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":9.99,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123478680/-/GRAND_CORPORATION_WONDER___AMAZEMENT__B.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123478680/-/GRAND_CORPORATION_WONDER___AMAZEMENT__B.jpg","width":1500,"height":1500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123478686/-/GRAND_CORPORATION_WONDER___AMAZEMENT__B_SLEEVE.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123478686/-/GRAND_CORPORATION_WONDER___AMAZEMENT__B_SLEEVE.jpg","width":1500,"height":1500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123478689/-/GRAND_CORPORATION_WONDER___AMAZEMENT__A.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123478689/-/GRAND_CORPORATION_WONDER___AMAZEMENT__A.jpg","width":1500,"height":1500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6034341,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":13239744,"name":"The Hue 'Criss Cross EP' Ltd Edition Vinyl","permalink":"the-hue-criss-cross-ep-ltd-edition-vinyl","position":52,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-hue-criss-cross-ep-ltd-edition-vinyl","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-29T10:54:43.000Z","description":"Two original Classic members return too Classic with an adventure into the world of disco deviance.

Various interpretations of a mini LP to be released in the next few months…on this particular vinyl only version. Classic adds both Eddie C's disco adventure and the illusive Argentinean Leonel Castillo to the fold.

When that music has found its way to us through friends and people that are already part of the Classic family, in this case via JT Donaldson, Derrick and myself always stand up and take notice even more as we know there is usually a story behind it. \r\n\r\nAs a result, we are proud to welcome No Dial Tone as new members to the oddball family made up of miscreants and weirdos that is Classic.

Recent signings to Classic, No Dial Tone deliver their second original production to the imprint ‘Standing Still’ – a deep slow burning almost Bjork-esq vocal record kicks off the A side. Long time label cohort from the early Bar Rumba days; Mathew Herbert twists and turns the record into something completely ‘Herbert’ and ultimately ‘classic’ in its make up. On the flip...long-time Greenskeepers man James Curd returns to Classic with nothing short of a BUMP! ‘Gentle Help’ is typical Curd Funk and now with added Black Madonna flavours. Road tested relentlessly at the Smart Bar, the Chicago native channels the essence of old Dance Mania records and funnels it into something typically a little left of centre.
