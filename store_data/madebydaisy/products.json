The brass cuff has been hammered into its shape by myself.\r\n\r\nThe patina that I have used for this piece is slightly translucent, showing some of the lovely brass through. Wear over time can be expected, which only adds to the piece’s character. All of my cuff bracelets now come sealed in a layer of resin, giving the design a lovely glossy, hard wearing finish - although I would advise not to jump into the sea with it on or anything quite as drastic!\r\n\r\nThe brass that I use is sourced locally and I hand hammer each piece to shape.\r\n\r\nCuff bracelets come wrapped in bubble wrap, and then gift wrapped in brown paper which is stamped with the Made By Daisy logo, perfect for gift giving!","options":[{"id":47669601,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127234194/-/stag_cuff_brass.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127234194/-/stag_cuff_brass.jpg","width":570,"height":570},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127234197/-/deer_bangle.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127234197/-/deer_bangle.jpg","width":570,"height":570},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127234206/-/stag_bracelet.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127234206/-/stag_bracelet.jpg","width":570,"height":570}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3110971,"name":"Cuffs","permalink":"cuffs","url":"/category/cuffs"}]},{"id":14685750,"name":"Qimmiq","permalink":"qimmiq","position":23,"price":28.5,"default_price":28.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/qimmiq","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-07T15:31:36.000Z","description":"Inspired by Alaskan nature, \"Qimmiq\" Siberian Husky earrings.\r\n\r\nThe earrings are hand crafted from sterling silver sheet using a fine saw blade, and have been soldered on to sterling silver earring posts.
