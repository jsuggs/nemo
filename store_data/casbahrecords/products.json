Taking a cue from an increasingly active underground Texas music scene, they play a mix of first wave punk and new wave music with a focus on the catchy chorus, the thoughtful lyric, and a DIY mentality.\r\n\r\nThe band has previously released their ten song debut LP Tortures in the of spring 2010 on Red Lounge Records, and fellow Texas gore-hounds Hex Dispensers covered their song “I’m A Ghost” on one of their latest singles.","options":[{"id":42250077,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":105,"name":"France, Metropolitan","code":"FX"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123480318/-/occultdetectiveclub.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123480318/-/occultdetectiveclub.jpg","width":360,"height":360}],"artists":[{"id":228861,"name":"SOMETHING FIERCE / OCCULT DETECTIVE CLUB","permalink":"something-fierce-occult-detective-club","url":"/artist/something-fierce-occult-detective-club"}],"categories":[{"id":3850711,"name":"Vinyle","permalink":"vinyle","url":"/category/vinyle"}]},{"id":13217973,"name":"LA FLINGUE  - Kleb-Stoff Zéro-Deux (P-trash records - LP)","permalink":"la-flingue-kleb-stoff-zero-deux-p-trash-records-lp","position":13,"price":14.0,"default_price":14.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/la-flingue-kleb-stoff-zero-deux-p-trash-records-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-28T10:52:52.000Z","description":"http://laflingue.bandcamp.com/album/la-flingue-rubber-glue-z-ro-un","options":[{"id":42249864,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":105,"name":"France, Metropolitan","code":"FX"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123425079/-/laflingue.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123425079/-/laflingue.jpg","width":350,"height":350}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3850711,"name":"Vinyle","permalink":"vinyle","url":"/category/vinyle"}]},{"id":13217922,"name":"Useless Eaters - zulu  (P-trash records LP)","permalink":"useless-eaters-zulu-p-trash-records-lp","position":14,"price":14.0,"default_price":14.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/useless-eaters-zulu-p-trash-records-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-28T10:46:40.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":42249693,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":105,"name":"France, Metropolitan","code":"FX"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123424986/-/uselesseaters.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123424986/-/uselesseaters.jpg","width":198,"height":198}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3850711,"name":"Vinyle","permalink":"vinyle","url":"/category/vinyle"}]},{"id":13217775,"name":"DIGGER & THE PUSSYCATS S/T (P-trash Records LP)","permalink":"digger-the-pussycats-s-t-p-trash-records-lp","position":15,"price":14.0,"default_price":14.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/digger-the-pussycats-s-t-p-trash-records-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-28T10:31:17.000Z","description":"Hey y'all, Andy from DIGGER & THE PUSSYCATS here. Head P.Trash honcho asked me to write something to promote our two new 45s out on P.Trash Records and Timmeheiehumme Records. What can I say? We're just a dumb-arse rock and roll band who have aged considerably since our first P.Trash Record way back in 2005. Our waistlines and man-boobs have developed, but our music has not. We haven't tried to re-invent the wheel with these new tracks, but they're definitely Digger songs that could easily slip onto any of our previous albums/singles. If you like the band you'll like the songs. If you don't like us, then save your money for the next P.Trash/Timmeheiehumme release, which will probably be a whole lot better than these two singles.\r\nWhat do the new songs sound like? Consider it rock and roll with a bit of shabang! Moronic lyrics feature in the two songs I sing. The two songs that Sam sings have slightly more intelligent lyrics, but not by much. Lyrical subject matter includes being taught by your father how to seduce women in the same way that he seduced your mother / taking a trip to Italy and being fortunate enough to find yourself at a Bunga Bunga party at Berlusconi's house / following Jesus' wishes to do unto others' bodies as you would have them do unto your own body / having inappropriate relations with your best friend's sister and hoping the he'll still let you stay at his holiday house.\r\n\r\nYou see the front cover for each of the two Tour-7\"s. When they sit side by side, you can see the words \"digger\" and \"pussy\" running through the artwork to make it join up like the puzzle!\r\nThe artwork was done by Vanessa Imberger and features my daughter's Grandmother in a bikini on a motorbike holding up a dead snake that she killed with a shovel. True story. Now if that ain't Australian, I don't know what is? We're all Crocodile Hunters down here. We're about to come over on tour too, so check out our dates on facebook and let's have a beer at a show somewhere near you. And if you don't like us, you can come down and bash us in the toilets…but only if you buy both of these new records.","options":[{"id":42249237,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":105,"name":"France, Metropolitan","code":"FX"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123424674/-/digger_thepussycats.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123424674/-/digger_thepussycats.jpg","width":198,"height":198}],"artists":[{"id":228849,"name":"DIGGER & THE PUSSYCATS","permalink":"digger-the-pussycats","url":"/artist/digger-the-pussycats"}],"categories":[{"id":3850711,"name":"Vinyle","permalink":"vinyle","url":"/category/vinyle"}]},{"id":13217721,"name":"HEADACHE CITY - We Can't Have Anything Nice (P-Trash records - LP)","permalink":"headache-city-we-can-t-have-anything-nice-p-trash-records-lp","position":16,"price":14.0,"default_price":14.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/headache-city-we-can-t-have-anything-nice-p-trash-records-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-28T10:26:55.000Z","description":"Hey kiddo, if you missed the HEADACHE CITY hit-singles on fancy labels like HoZac you should definitely check out this platter!

Walking on garage punk streets, stomping our feet while dancing to our fav hits!

Well, you stopped by the right place. These guys ain't dealing in nostalgia. This album features future classics that could actually please all of the people all of the time\".\r\n\r\nThis above is an excerpt from the liner notes on Suzy & Los Quattro's new album, \"Stick With It\" (WPR/Screaming Apple 2008), penned by Lindsay Hutton, founder of the legendary magazine The Next Big Thing and collaborator in MOJO or SOUNDS.\r\n\r\n\"Stick With It\" is a great step forward in the band's career, proving they can beat any obstacle after two years of line-up changes. Now working as a four-piece, the band plans an extensive tour that will take them to 9 different countries. Musically speaking, the band sticks to their magic formula of catchy pop songs fuelled by crunchy guitars, you only have to listen to Crazy On The Phone or Because Of You to realize they still have it when it comes to writing immediate hits. But something has changed, this time the production and arrangements are taken up a notch, without losing a grip on punkpop.\r\n\r\nThis time Suzy & Los Quattro have broadened their horizons to a lot of the sounds they worship so much as die-hard music fans. H.A.T.E! is soaked wet in glam, winking an eye to bands like The Sweet, Slade and featuring some guitars likely to remind you of \"Billion Dollar Babies\" by Alice Cooper. Too Late will get your feet on the dance-floor like the disco Blondie did in the 70's and The Sounds have done recently. But Suzy & Los Quattro don't forget their 60's pop heritage, penning the beautiful ballad Maybe I'm Wrong, that would surely make Phil Spector proud with two pianos, strings and horns playing under Suzy Chain's voice, shining through every track of this album like never before.\r\n\r\nOf course they didn't miss their date with new-wave in cuts like Go On, which might remind you of Baby Let's Twist with Chrissie Hynde on lead vocals. And for the more straight-forward crowd, tracks like Comeback Superstar will please the surfers and Rock Boys (dig those harmonies!) will do it for the rock'n'rollers. Special mention to Donna Donna, an amazing track with one of the catchiest choruses ever, dedicated to Donna, a rescue dog that recently became part of the Quattro-Chain family, and that will be linked to animal rights camapaigns. And watch out for the ending, Henry Rollins, easily the best proof of a new level of versatility the band has reached. A fully a capella track done exclusively with Suzy and B.B. Quattro's vocals and dedicated to the tough and muscled DC singer.\r\n\r\nThis album consolidates all the things that Suzy & Los Quattro promised on their first album, \"Ready To Go!\" (2004), which got rave reviews and was licensed in Germany and Japan. During 2005 they embarked on their 2 week Japanese \"Lipstick To Japan Tour\", which confirmed their \"pop idol\" status in the land of rising sun, selling out two nights in Tokyo and receiving an almost beatlesque warm welcome.\r\n\r\nYou can see it for yourself on their Lipstick To Japan video here\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vygzxCQHViU\r\n\r\nThis tour was followed by a compilation of all their singles, \"The Singles\" (2006), a record that kept them on the road again, playing two times at the legendary Cavern Club in Liverpool, where John Otway from the BBC included their show on his top 10 of the festival (out of 150 bands on the bill!).

The album contains 11 self-penned songs, full of tempestuous and raw energy, with plenty of hooklines, verve and style. Songs that are soaked with a sixties spirit, but were made in the here and now. It’s all in there: fuzz-guitars, VOX organs, snarling vocals, throbbing bass and rattling drums – always short, tight and efficient. And that’s exactly how the odd garage record should sound. Their self-titled debut was painstakingly produced by David Langhard (aka Admiral James T.) with much love for the detail and with heavy use of analogue equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\nHailing from Zurich, THE ROYAL HANGMEN started eight years ago to proclaim the gospel of garage rock. First a simple cover-band, they soon found their own style and tunes and finally some attention amongst the international 60’s/retro scene. Their first 45 single Mary Jane was released back in 2009 on Greek label Lost In Tyme. Lots of concerts in France and native Switzerland followed thereafter, culminating in a support slot for the mighty SONICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt took them some time to record their first proper album, but it was definitely worth the wait. So get on your go-go boots, put that marvellous wax on the turntable and shake your hips to the driving Turn Me On, the frantic Mary Jane, the melodic She’s Gone or Get Out Of My Way and all the other smashing tracks on this record, until you reach the final comedown with the moody, psychedelic “Wake Up”. What a trip. If you go bananas listening to bands like the SHADOWS OF KNIGHT, the ZAKARY THAKS, the BAD SEEDS, the CYNICS and the STAGGERS, this one’s for you babe!\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s fab!

The result is Solo Dos En Tijuana, and a collection of bilingual tunes that are both bizarrely charming and eerily soothing. He uses a variety of instrumentation, but the guitar is its backbone, casually strummed or picked mariachi style. One of the music’s charms is the fact that it sounds truly original and difficult to categorize. It’s too pretty to really be rock, but way tougher and kookier than folk. His voice is deep but super-smooth, and the lyrics are simple, sincere, and mostly about love: “I was born so far away, so far away from here/You were born so right here/Lalalalalalala.” No joke, it completely rules.

Sans fioritures aucunes, teigneuses et habitées, les compositions de Magnetic Reaction promettent à l'auditeur une plongée en apnée dans l'univers du duo.\r\n\r\nLa face A, Electrocute Side, enchaînent les morceaux high energy. Des titres comme \"No Brain No Pain\", \"Drive My Car (I Can't)\", \"Jack Hyde\", \"Something To Say\",sont autant d'uppercuts que l'on prend en pleine poire. Avec une attitude quasi nihiliste, une ambiance parfois franchement claustro, un chant à la limite de la rupture et un son de batterie minimaliste mais ultra-efficace (par certains aspects d'ailleurs le duo n'est pas sans rappeler les Oblivians dans leur approche du rock and roll), les Magnetix jouent certes un rock primaire mais joué avec une telle conviction, une telle énergie qu'ils emportent toujours l'adhésion.\r\n\r\nLa face B intitulé Burn Side, globalement moins bruitiste, est l'occasion pour le groupe d'offrir quelques variations bienvenues avec le plus surf \"Vietnam\", \"Tell Me Why\", \"Get You\" ou \"Lawn Mowers Attack\" et ce, même si la face contient elle aussi son lot de titres incandescents (\"Mister Raper\").\r\n\r\nEn fait, en rééditant ce LP, Kizmiaz Records a offert sans doute, à notre avis, l'album le plus convaincant du duo. Ou au moins le plus enthousiasmant, probablement parce qu'on ne s'attendait sûrement pas à un disque de cette trempe.","options":[{"id":24044457,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":105,"name":"France, Metropolitan","code":"FX"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74755975/-/magnetix.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74755975/-/magnetix.jpg","width":223,"height":226}],"artists":[{"id":146581,"name":"Magnetix","permalink":"magnetix","url":"/artist/magnetix"}],"categories":[{"id":3034201,"name":"Vinyle + Mp3 download code","permalink":"vinyle-mp3-download-code","url":"/category/vinyle-mp3-download-code"}]}]
