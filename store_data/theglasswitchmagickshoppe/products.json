Use this broom to sweep away negativity or hang it up for protection in your home or sacred space. Made from broom corn, grown specifically for constructing besoms, the handles are made from Yucca Cactus (a much more renewable and eco-friendly option than most hardwoods that is both light weight and strong), with a cord threaded through the end for hanging. Please allow for variations, as each one of these brooms is hand made and unique.  The Hand Crafted Witches Besom / Brooms will measure between approximately 43\" - 53\" long. \r\n\r\nBesom / Broom\r\nBesom brooms are traditionally constructed traditionally associated with Witches, Wicca and Witchcraft. Besoms and brooms, are often used in Witchcraft and Paganism for 'sweeping the negativity away'. Besoms are also used as a protective device and often as the role of an 'inanimate familiar'. Traditionally an element symbolizing the union of the masculine and feminine principles, was used not for flying, but for the ritual cleaning of the working space, and protection and fertility rites. \r\n\r\nBesom or Witches Broom\r\n\r\nBesom As A Fertility Symbol \r\nThe old picture of the witch riding around on the broom's stick casting magic spells is believed to have come from a agricultural fertility rite, where the women rode around the fields(like on a hobby horse), with the broom between their legs, hoping to bring the farmers a good harvest. \r\n\r\nJumping The Broom \r\nMany pagan traditions have the bridal couple, jump across the broom, a symbol of fertility (old bit of agricultural fertility magic), to signify the establishment of their new household. The brooms are usually decorated for the occasion and then kept in a place of honor in the home.\r\nIn many Wicca handfasting(marriage) rituals, couples often jump over the broom if they want children. \r\nHistorically, brooms made great gifts for weddings or handfastings. Just add a little ribbon, some flowers, and your are good to go. No wrapping needed. Every new home needs a new broom! \r\n\r\nThe Ritual Broom \r\nWitches use brooms in magick and ritual. The pagan broom or \"besom\" is used in ritual for cleansing the general circle or ritual area. The besom is sweeping away the psychic dirt, getting the area purified for the ritual at hand. \r\nA Witch may begin a ritual by sweeping the area with the magick broom, visualizing the psychic dirt being swept out of the ritual area. The sweeping also helps to get the mind ready for the ritual, quieting the mind and narrowing the focus for the witch. The besom is a purifier and is related to the element of Water.\r\n\r\nFinding Other Witches \r\nBesoms have been used by Witches to indicate to other occultists that they were resident, or at work, by placing a besom (broom) outside the door. This is NOT to say that anyone who has a kitchen broom sitting outside their door is a witch.\r\n\r\nBesoms, As A Symbol Of Protection \r\nMany Witches keep a besom by their door, or hanging from their door to protect the home from unwanted outside energies.\r\n","options":[{"id":49480824,"name":"Default","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128542749/-/Wiccan_Witch_Handmade_Besom_Broom2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128542749/-/Wiccan_Witch_Handmade_Besom_Broom2.jpg","width":469,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128542746/-/Wiccan_Witch_Handmade_Besom_Broom.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128542746/-/Wiccan_Witch_Handmade_Besom_Broom.jpg","width":300,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3972975,"name":"* One of a Kind & Closeout","permalink":"one-of-a-kind-closeout","url":"/category/one-of-a-kind-closeout"},{"id":2616603,"name":"Besome Broom","permalink":"besome-broom","url":"/category/besome-broom"},{"id":2644907,"name":"Kitchen Witch","permalink":"kitchen-witch","url":"/category/kitchen-witch"},{"id":2621865,"name":"Pagan & Witch Home and Office Décor","permalink":"pagan-witch-home-and-office-decor","url":"/category/pagan-witch-home-and-office-decor"},{"id":2823179,"name":"Paganism","permalink":"paganism","url":"/category/paganism"},{"id":4766605,"name":"Protection Magick","permalink":"protection-magick","url":"/category/protection-magick"},{"id":2626741,"name":"Ritual Tools","permalink":"ritual-tools","url":"/category/ritual-tools"},{"id":2622229,"name":"Sabbat's & Esbats","permalink":"sabbat-s-esbats","url":"/category/sabbat-s-esbats"}]},{"id":14576124,"name":"56” Handcrafted Hardwood Witches Besom / Broom","permalink":"56-handcrafted-hardwood-witches-besom-broom","position":17,"price":65.0,"default_price":65.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/56-handcrafted-hardwood-witches-besom-broom","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-02T18:41:20.000Z","description":"56” Handcrafted Hardwood Witches Besom / Broom\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderful hand crafted besom broom has been lovingly hand made right here in Indiana.

I have been collection Cauldrons for years and helping others along the magickal path find truly old, antique and vintage cauldrons. I think perhaps the Goddess wants to make sure that this old and powerful Cauldrons find a good homes and are no longer discarded in barns and junked away like nothing. So I proudly search and look to find them wherever I go. \r\n\r\nThis is a wonderful large sized highly desirable 3 legged Cast Iron Cauldron from the late 1800’s. We found this cauldron in the area and it is in wonderful shape but has been painted, this can be easily removed in a full heat seasoning of the cauldron. The Cauldron has no markings on the bottom. Make of all cast iron it will be perfect and useable for potions and food. It has the hearth hook on the side of it (used for pulling it in and out of the hearth or fire) There are no other cracks, breaks or repairs. \r\n\r\nThis beautiful Antique Cast Iron Cauldron is 13 inches across 9 inches high and looks to hold around 2 gallons.\r\n\r\n*)O(*\r\nA Witches Cauldron; is not only for magick, spells and rituals it is also a link to our past and to the old traditions where the cauldron was at the heart of the household. Used for cooking, for preparing herbal preparations as well as for scrying or divining by wise women and men.

But in no way, does this mean it is a weaker or lesser form of Magick. Known as a Natural Magick, Candle Burning calls for few Tools. Candles are used in most Magick, weather to strengthen Powers, direct the magick or spell, or for the one whom is working the Magick. As well as for the Elements and for symbolizing the Goddess/God...... \r\n\r\nWitches, and those within the magickal world have been using Candle Magick for centuries. Each color reflects different powers, as well as different intents. In combinations, any form of Magick can be worked. \r\n\r\nFor myself I prefer Natural Bee’s Wax. It is a favorite used within candle magick because all things that come from the Goddess and Mother Earth have a natural energy all their own. \r\n","options":[{"id":46627956,"name":"Default","price":23.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126466653/-/6_Bees_Wax_Candle_Sheets___Wick_for_Spell_Working1.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126466653/-/6_Bees_Wax_Candle_Sheets___Wick_for_Spell_Working1.JPG","width":561,"height":495},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126466656/-/6_Bees_Wax_Candle_Sheets___Wick_for_Spell_Working2.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126466656/-/6_Bees_Wax_Candle_Sheets___Wick_for_Spell_Working2.JPG","width":640,"height":480}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3972972,"name":"* GLASS WITCH EXCLUSIVES","permalink":"glass-witch-exclusives","url":"/category/glass-witch-exclusives"},{"id":3973011,"name":"* Miscellaneous Witchy Stuff","permalink":"miscellaneous-witchy-stuff","url":"/category/miscellaneous-witchy-stuff"},{"id":2616601,"name":"Candles","permalink":"candles","url":"/category/candles"},{"id":3095713,"name":"Divination Scrying Spiritual","permalink":"divination-scrying-spiritual","url":"/category/divination-scrying-spiritual"},{"id":2633269,"name":"Goddess /  God","permalink":"goddess-god","url":"/category/goddess-god"},{"id":2884909,"name":"Goddess","permalink":"goddess","url":"/category/goddess"},{"id":4494398,"name":"Made to Order Magick","permalink":"made-to-order-magick","url":"/category/made-to-order-magick"},{"id":2616701,"name":"Meditation, Scrying and Divination Magick","permalink":"meditation-scrying-and-divination-magick","url":"/category/meditation-scrying-and-divination-magick"},{"id":4766605,"name":"Protection Magick","permalink":"protection-magick","url":"/category/protection-magick"},{"id":2626741,"name":"Ritual Tools","permalink":"ritual-tools","url":"/category/ritual-tools"},{"id":2891121,"name":"Spell Boxes and Spell Sets","permalink":"spell-boxes-and-spell-sets","url":"/category/spell-boxes-and-spell-sets"},{"id":2616625,"name":"Spell Kits","permalink":"spell-kits","url":"/category/spell-kits"},{"id":2765705,"name":"Spell Sets & Magick","permalink":"spell-sets-magick","url":"/category/spell-sets-magick"},{"id":2616645,"name":"Witch Made Magick","permalink":"witch-made-magick","url":"/category/witch-made-magick"}]},{"id":4881547,"name":"Set of Cast Iron Pentagram Pentacle Corner Brackets (ID)","permalink":"set-of-cast-iron-pentagram-pentacle-corner-brackets","position":77,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/set-of-cast-iron-pentagram-pentacle-corner-brackets","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-19T05:30:20.000Z","description":"Set of Cast Iron Pentagram Pentacle Corner Brackets\r\n\r\nBring blessings and protection to any doorway or window with this wonderful pair of Cast Iron Pentagram Pentacle Corner Brackets!

Smith's vibrant drawings transformed the standard tarot deck.\r\n\r\n\"A unique feature of the Rider-Waite deck, and one of the of the principal reasons for its enduring popularity, is that all of the cards, including the Minor Arcana, depict full scenes with figures and symbols. Prior to the Rider-Waite Tarot, the pip cards of almost all tarot decks were marked only with the arrangement of the suit signs -- swords, wands, cups, and coins, or pentacles. The pictorial images on all the cards allow interpretations without the need to repeatedly consult explanatory text. The innovative Minor Arcana, and Pamela Colman Smith's ability to capture the subtleties of emotion and experience have made the Rider-Waite Tarot a model for the designs of many tarot packs.\" Rider-Waite Tarot was named one of the Top Ten Tarot Decks of All Time by Aeclectic Tarot.\r\n\r\nPamela Colman Smith\r\nBorn February 16, 1878, in Middlesex, England to American parents, Smith's childhood years were spent between London, New York, and Kingston, Jamaica. During her teens, she traveled throughout England with the theatre company of Ellen Terry and Henry Irving. Thereafter, she began formal art training at Pratt Institute of Brooklyn, graduating in 1897.\r\n\r\nSmith returned to England, where she became a theatrical designer for miniature theatre, and an illustrator -- mainly of books, pamphlets and posters. Around 1903, she joined the Order of the Golden Dawn. In 1909, under the guidance of Arthur Edward Waite, she undertook a series of seventy-eight allegorical paintings described by Waite as a rectified tarot pack. The designs, published in the same year by William Rider and Son, exemplify the mysticism, ritual, imagination, fantasy, and deep emotions of the artist.\r\n\r\nArthur Edward Waite\r\nBorn in America in 1857, Waite was raised and educated as a Catholic in England. Beginning at the age of 21, Waite pursued research and writing on psychical and esoteric matters. Soon after joining the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, he became the Grand Master, and redirected the focus of the order from magic to mysticism. The Golden Order, whose structural hierarchy was based on the Kabbalah, is considered the single greatest 20th century influence on the occult. Waite was a prolific author of occult texts, works on the Holy Grail, and the body of mystical knowledge, which comprises the basis of modern Tarot. He is best known as the co-creator of the Rider-Waite Tarot deck and author of its companion volume The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, first published in 1910.\r\n\r\n*)O(*  While the images are deceptively simple, almost childlike, the details and backgrounds hold a wealth of symbolism. Some imagery remains close to that found in earlier decks, but overall the Waite-Smith card designs represent a substantial departure from their predecessors. Among other changes, Waite had the Christian imagery of most older tarot decks' cards toned down—the 'Pope' card became the 'Hierophant', the 'Papess' became the 'High Priestess'. The Minor Arcana are illustrated with detailed scenes and images by Smith, again a departure from many earlier decks with much simpler designs for the Minor Arcana but aligning this deck with, for example, the Sola Busca Tarot. The symbols used were influenced by the 19th century magician and occultist Eliphas Levi.\r\n","options":[{"id":46625433,"name":"Default","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126463974/-/DRIDERWAITE.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126463974/-/DRIDERWAITE.jpg","width":490,"height":598},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126463995/-/_T2eC16Z_!)EE9s2uiOVlBRiV9kY4Mw__60_35.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126463995/-/_T2eC16Z_!)EE9s2uiOVlBRiV9kY4Mw__60_35.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3973011,"name":"* Miscellaneous Witchy Stuff","permalink":"miscellaneous-witchy-stuff","url":"/category/miscellaneous-witchy-stuff"},{"id":2616689,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":2616701,"name":"Meditation, Scrying and Divination Magick","permalink":"meditation-scrying-and-divination-magick","url":"/category/meditation-scrying-and-divination-magick"},{"id":2823179,"name":"Paganism","permalink":"paganism","url":"/category/paganism"},{"id":2626741,"name":"Ritual Tools","permalink":"ritual-tools","url":"/category/ritual-tools"},{"id":2683215,"name":"Tarot","permalink":"tarot","url":"/category/tarot"}]},{"id":6011923,"name":"Black Mortar and Pestles for Herbs & Magick","permalink":"wonderful-black-mortar-and-pestle-for-herbs-magick","position":91,"price":13.0,"default_price":13.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wonderful-black-mortar-and-pestle-for-herbs-magick","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-24T01:55:11.000Z","description":"Black Mortar and Pestles for Herbs & Magick \r\n\r\nWe Witches love our herbs and working with our Mortar & Pestle as we mix each special magickal herbs.

Altar tiles can be placed on altars as symbols and outward meanings for the individual's sacred space. Altar tiles can also be used in rituals and spells in a variety of methods although one more common use is as a vessel to hold energy, this includes spirits. Many Witches/Wiccan practitioners use altar tiles on their altars to protect their them or to hold items such as candles or censors.\r\nAncient texts often speak of practitioners of the craft using altar tiles to trap and hold spirits whether it be for the actual ritual in progress or to entrap the spirit or negative energies within the altar tile itself permanently. \r\n\r\nThis beautiful Pentagram Moon Altar Tile will be a mystical energy to any altar or table. Designed using a heavy weight, metallic disk with a carved pentagram encircled by 5 crescent moons. Ideal as a small altar pentacle it measurements are approximately 3\" diameter and 3/8\" thick. The Pentagram Moon Altar Tile has been wonderfully crafted of silver plated brass to keep it beautiful for years. \r\n\r\nPentacle / Pentagram; The Pentagram is a symbol of a star encased in a circle. Always with 5 points (one pointing upward), each has its own meaning. The upward point of the star is representative of the spirit. The other four points all represent an element; earth, air, fire, and water. All these things contributive to who we are in life and are a part of spirit of all things.\r\n\r\nThe pentagram has long been believed to be a potent protection against evil, a symbol of conflict that shields the wearer and the home. The pentagram five points outwards is believe to be a sign of personal defensive, along with protective pentagon within the stars center.","options":[{"id":21567053,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66689733/-/Pentagram_and_Moon_Altar_Tile_001.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66689733/-/Pentagram_and_Moon_Altar_Tile_001.JPG","width":552,"height":527},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66689741/-/Pentagram_and_Moon_Altar_Tile_009.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66689741/-/Pentagram_and_Moon_Altar_Tile_009.JPG","width":508,"height":473}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2633311,"name":"Altar Sets","permalink":"altar-sets","url":"/category/altar-sets"},{"id":2621865,"name":"Pagan & Witch Home and Office Décor","permalink":"pagan-witch-home-and-office-decor","url":"/category/pagan-witch-home-and-office-decor"},{"id":2823179,"name":"Paganism","permalink":"paganism","url":"/category/paganism"},{"id":2633249,"name":"Pentagram Pentacle","permalink":"pentagram-pentacle","url":"/category/pentagram-pentacle"},{"id":2626741,"name":"Ritual Tools","permalink":"ritual-tools","url":"/category/ritual-tools"},{"id":2622229,"name":"Sabbat's & Esbats","permalink":"sabbat-s-esbats","url":"/category/sabbat-s-esbats"}]},{"id":14342025,"name":"Vintage Designed Large 12 Drawer Wood Apothecary Herb Spice Chest (BA)","permalink":"vintage-designed-large-12-drawer-wood-apothecary-herb-spice-chest","position":94,"price":69.0,"default_price":69.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/vintage-designed-large-12-drawer-wood-apothecary-herb-spice-chest","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-22T17:55:47.000Z","description":"Vintage Designed Large 12 Drawer Wood Apothecary Herb Spice Chest  \r\n\r\nWe Witches do love our herbs and spices.

As Christianity took hold, the use of runic alphabets in divination became reviled as a pagan practice.

With a interwoven filigree design representing the Lotus flower and the Goddess of the Moon.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful Luna Moon Lotus Plaque is formed of recycled pressed fiber, wood and paper. Painted in a soft blue with undertones of moonlight white that has been hand stressed to give it the appearance of an vintage piece. Approximately 16 inches round and 1 inch thick this wonderful piece will make a mystical and impressing addition to any room or altar area.\r\n\r\nThe Goddess for many of us is seen within the symbolism of the moon. The Moon Goddesses are important in many cultures around the world where they form a central role in mythology. The moon is associated with the divine female as in many tribal societies the feminine cycles were linked to the phases of the moon. Many of the lunar Goddesses, like Hecate and Cerridwen are also associated with magick and the intuitive nature of women.\r\n\r\nThe lotus representing the Moon and seen as a Lunar plant, can also be found in Indian and Oriental mythologies. The Hindu creation myth says that the golden lotus was brought forth from the primordial waters and that the Hindu trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva are each found seated on a golden lotus. Vishnu is said to have slept on a lotus and then had a lotus stem issue from his naval.

Barbara out did herself with the understanding she added to this deck.\r\nLady Abigail\r\n\r\nThis powerful tarot is lovingly crafted upon Wiccan beliefs and practices. On this magical journey, you’ll encounter beautiful gods and goddesses, joyous Sabbat celebrations, spell-weaving rites, and vivid scenes central to Pagan spirituality. From the suits—represented by air, fire, water, and earth—to the major arcana, the tarot’s overall structure is built upon Wiccan themes. Barbara Moore’s book introduces Pagan/Wiccan concepts, offers practical guidance on using the deck, and provides spreads.\r\n\r\nThe Book of Shadows Tarot Kit features one deck, Volume 1: As Above, and is designed to hold a second deck, Volume 2: So Below, to be released in 2013.\r\n\r\nHardbox kit (5 1/4 x 8 1/4) includes Volume 1: As Above deck (78 full-color cards) and full-color, 160-pp book\r\n\r\nBy the Author: How the Deck Came to Be\r\n \r\nIn 2008 I spent some time in Italy with the good folks at Lo Scarabeo. They asked me to create a deck, or rather a pair of decks. The set was to be called The Book of Shadows Tarot and was to be comprised of two separate decks. Beyond that, they had no requirements. I was free to do whatever I wished within that framework.\r\n \r\nOne of the key tenets for me is: As Above, So Below, so I decided to use that as my organizing theme. The first deck, As Above, is a non-RWS deck that represents the theory and teachings of Wicca. The second deck, So Below, is a RWS-based deck that shows how the magic of Wicca (for I believe that all of Wicca is Magic…although not necessarily the same as Witchcraft) is experienced by Wiccans in every day life.\r\n","options":[{"id":28668947,"name":"Default","price":33.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89930474/-/the-book-of-shadows-tarot.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89930474/-/the-book-of-shadows-tarot.jpg","width":590,"height":450},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89930066/-/9780738735078-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89930066/-/9780738735078-2.jpg","width":326,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89930090/-/DBOOSHA.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89930090/-/DBOOSHA.jpg","width":300,"height":404},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89930102/-/the-book-of-shadows-tarot.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89930102/-/the-book-of-shadows-tarot.jpg","width":540,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2616689,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":2680645,"name":"Book of Shadows","permalink":"book-of-shadows","url":"/category/book-of-shadows"},{"id":3095713,"name":"Divination Scrying Spiritual","permalink":"divination-scrying-spiritual","url":"/category/divination-scrying-spiritual"},{"id":2616701,"name":"Meditation, Scrying and Divination Magick","permalink":"meditation-scrying-and-divination-magick","url":"/category/meditation-scrying-and-divination-magick"},{"id":2686509,"name":"Pendulum & Pendulum Sets","permalink":"pendulum-pendulum-sets","url":"/category/pendulum-pendulum-sets"},{"id":2626741,"name":"Ritual Tools","permalink":"ritual-tools","url":"/category/ritual-tools"},{"id":2683215,"name":"Tarot","permalink":"tarot","url":"/category/tarot"}]},{"id":5851739,"name":"Familiar Pet Starter Kit & Healing Magick Set (BE)","permalink":"familiar-pet-starter-kit-healing-magick-set","position":105,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/familiar-pet-starter-kit-healing-magick-set","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-04T00:00:31.000Z","description":"Familiar Pet Starter Kit & Healing Magick Set\r\n\r\nFAMILIAR: A familiar is an animal that you are personally and closely and intimately acquainted with.

Let one or all four bless your home with their special gifts.\r\n\r\n1. * Elemental Fire Fairy:  Fire fairies are known for their short temper. When this happens they burn things in their path. They are the ones that cause forest fires. They can be quite nice, though. The spirit of the hearth fire is often thought of as female, and was once widely worshipped as a Goddess, formless essence symbolized by the flame, which flows through everything that has life. As the domestic hearth is the sacred center of the home, the hearth of the Gods is the center of the cosmos. She presided over all hearth and altar fires. The hearth was in the care of the woman of the home and before each meal something was thrown on the fire as an offering.\r\n\r\n2. * Elemental Water Fairy: The Water Fairies can breathe under water. They live, usually, on the bottom of some source of water. They usually don’t like humans because they think they are too loud so they try to avoid them. They are very peaceful and are not know for violence. The term Water Fairy or Sprite is a broad term referring to a number of supernatural legendary creatures. The term is generally used in reference to elf-like creatures, including fairies, and similar beings (although not earth beings), but can also signify various spiritual beings, including ghosts. \r\n\r\n3. * Elemental Air Fairy: Air Fairies are very nice and love to watch over people and try to make sure they don’t get hurt. They are known to cause storms when mad. They also do this when Earth Fairies ask them to because the ground is to dry. Some fairies seem to represent spirits of weather, particularly whirlwinds, wind, storm, rain, lightning, sunshine and so on. Air Fairies are believed an important air spirit, one of the three primary spirits along with the Moon and Sea. They live far above the earth and controlled the weather, but punishes human misdeeds with sickness and bad weather.\r\n\r\n4. * Earth Fairies live in woods, gardens, and other places with many plants. They are known for helping travelers without them knowing it. They love animals, especially the squirrel. Working with must be treated with the utmost respect. Earth elementals are concerned with the physical world, with growth, formation, strength and health. Earth elemental magick might include working with plants, crystals, gardens, and the wildwood. \r\nThe Glass Witch Magick Shoppe\r\n","options":[{"id":43286223,"name":"Fire Fairy (HC)","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43286226,"name":"Water Fairy (HC)","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43286229,"name":"Air(Wind) Fairy (HB) ","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43286232,"name":"Earth Fairy (HB)","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124161045/-/add.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124161045/-/add.jpg","width":1043,"height":658},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124161057/-/SE725a.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124161057/-/SE725a.jpg","width":469,"height":476},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124161060/-/SE726a.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124161060/-/SE726a.jpg","width":463,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124161051/-/SE724a.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124161051/-/SE724a.jpg","width":494,"height":485},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124161048/-/SE723a.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124161048/-/SE723a.jpg","width":450,"height":479}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3973011,"name":"* Miscellaneous Witchy Stuff","permalink":"miscellaneous-witchy-stuff","url":"/category/miscellaneous-witchy-stuff"},{"id":2850747,"name":"Fariy Fay Faery","permalink":"fariy-fay-faery","url":"/category/fariy-fay-faery"},{"id":2621789,"name":"One of a Kind MAGICK Sets, Kits and Collections","permalink":"one-of-a-kind-magick-sets-kits-and-collections","url":"/category/one-of-a-kind-magick-sets-kits-and-collections"},{"id":2621865,"name":"Pagan & Witch Home and Office Décor","permalink":"pagan-witch-home-and-office-decor","url":"/category/pagan-witch-home-and-office-decor"},{"id":2823179,"name":"Paganism","permalink":"paganism","url":"/category/paganism"},{"id":2884905,"name":"Statues and Resins","permalink":"statues-and-resins","url":"/category/statues-and-resins"},{"id":4807882,"name":"Talisman","permalink":"talisman","url":"/category/talisman"},{"id":2668965,"name":"Totem / Totems","permalink":"totem-totems","url":"/category/totem-totems"}]},{"id":8365779,"name":"Perfectly Sized Altar & Ritual Tabletop Cast Iron Cauldron (JF)","permalink":"perfectly-sized-altar-ritual-cauldron","position":137,"price":28.0,"default_price":28.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/perfectly-sized-altar-ritual-cauldron","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-04T18:45:58.000Z","description":"Perfectly Sized Altar & Ritual Tabletop Cast Iron Cauldron\r\n\r\nThis is nothing more influentially magickal than feeling the old world energy swirling up and around as you use your cast iron cauldron in your personal rituals or group circles. \r\n\r\nThis Altar & Ritual Tabletop Cauldron is the perfect size to proudly place on your altar for spell work or for burning your sage and resins as will as ritual work. \r\n\r\nSimple and unadorned the Altar & Ritual Tabletop Cauldron is made of cast iron and holds 26 ounces.

The power of Dragons can be a great influence not only in one's magickal working, but in day to day life as well. Dragons are often called on as guardian spirits. They make for exceptional allies who can be called on in times of need, for protection or guidance. Dragon Magick, like all magick is made up in its base form from the five main elements that exist throughout the known universe, Fire, Wind, Earth, Air and Spirit. When using Dragon Magick you are in fact calling forth an element in its Dragon form. Each element and its Dragon has certain magickal qualities, moods and purpose. Each also has positive and negative traits which much be dealt with.\r\n\r\nProudly designed and Witch made by Lady Abigail.  \r\n*Crystal Ball is NOT included \r\n","options":[{"id":43754271,"name":"Default","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124497222/-/DSC00006.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124497222/-/DSC00006.JPG","width":515,"height":622},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124497216/-/DSC00001.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124497216/-/DSC00001.JPG","width":390,"height":528},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124497228/-/DSC00012.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124497228/-/DSC00012.JPG","width":452,"height":487},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124497225/-/DSC00008.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124497225/-/DSC00008.JPG","width":473,"height":529}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3972972,"name":"* GLASS WITCH EXCLUSIVES","permalink":"glass-witch-exclusives","url":"/category/glass-witch-exclusives"},{"id":3972975,"name":"* One of a Kind & Closeout","permalink":"one-of-a-kind-closeout","url":"/category/one-of-a-kind-closeout"},{"id":3973011,"name":"* Miscellaneous Witchy Stuff","permalink":"miscellaneous-witchy-stuff","url":"/category/miscellaneous-witchy-stuff"},{"id":3095601,"name":"Boxes, Chests, Trunks","permalink":"boxes-chests-trunks","url":"/category/boxes-chests-trunks"},{"id":2616627,"name":"Crystal Balls","permalink":"crystal-balls","url":"/category/crystal-balls"},{"id":2633227,"name":"Crystals and Stones","permalink":"crystals-and-stones","url":"/category/crystals-and-stones"},{"id":3095713,"name":"Divination Scrying Spiritual","permalink":"divination-scrying-spiritual","url":"/category/divination-scrying-spiritual"},{"id":4494398,"name":"Made to Order Magick","permalink":"made-to-order-magick","url":"/category/made-to-order-magick"},{"id":2616701,"name":"Meditation, Scrying and Divination Magick","permalink":"meditation-scrying-and-divination-magick","url":"/category/meditation-scrying-and-divination-magick"},{"id":2621789,"name":"One of a Kind MAGICK Sets, Kits and Collections","permalink":"one-of-a-kind-magick-sets-kits-and-collections","url":"/category/one-of-a-kind-magick-sets-kits-and-collections"},{"id":2621865,"name":"Pagan & Witch Home and Office Décor","permalink":"pagan-witch-home-and-office-decor","url":"/category/pagan-witch-home-and-office-decor"},{"id":2823179,"name":"Paganism","permalink":"paganism","url":"/category/paganism"},{"id":4766605,"name":"Protection Magick","permalink":"protection-magick","url":"/category/protection-magick"},{"id":2626741,"name":"Ritual Tools","permalink":"ritual-tools","url":"/category/ritual-tools"},{"id":2616645,"name":"Witch Made Magick","permalink":"witch-made-magick","url":"/category/witch-made-magick"}]},{"id":13625532,"name":"Crystals & Lace Jewelry Treasure Chest ","permalink":"crystals-lace-jewelry-treasure-chest","position":149,"price":45.0,"default_price":45.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/crystals-lace-jewelry-treasure-chest","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-17T19:26:07.000Z","description":"Crystals & Lace Jewelry Treasure Chest \r\n\r\nComing within a lovely small wood round toped Treasure Chest designed to have a vintage energy.

Exactly opposite Beltane on the wheel of the year, Halloween is Beltane’s dark twin. \r\nMany have believe that Samhain is a Celtic holiday.

These magickal handmade Dream Catchers are made of an antiqued metal with feathers, stones.\r\nDream catchers are one of the most fascinating traditions of Native Americans. The traditional dream catcher was intended to protect the sleeping individual from negative dreams, while letting positive dreams through. The positive dreams would slip through the hole in the center of the dream catcher, and glide down the feathers to the sleeping person below. The negative dreams would get caught up in the web, and expire when the first rays of the sun struck them. \r\n\r\n The dream catcher has been a part of Native American culture for generations. One element of Native American dream catcher relates to the tradition of the hoop. Some Native Americans of North America held the hoop in the highest esteem, because it symbolized strength and unity. Many symbols started around the hoop, and one of these symbols is the dream catcher. \r\n\r\nThis Beautiful Hand Made Metal Dream Catcher has been adorned with stones, chips, feathers and will sparkle when the light hits them. With metal beads and chain these elegant dreamcatchers can be worn as Jewelry, hung in Windows for Protection, hung in a car or over a bed to enchant your space while helping to ensure a night full of good dreams.  \r\n\r\nEach of our Beautiful Hand Made Metal Dream is 3 inches round. The beads, stones and feathers hang approximately 8 inches long making the entire piece 11 inches.

Allowed to travel between the worlds of life and death as it carries messages into the veils.\r\nRavens are found all over the world in folklore, artwork and mythology. Whether the meaning of a Raven is good or bad depends on the people of that culture. Ravens have been regarded as omens of death, war, and bad luck to some, and creators of light, fire, magick, and change to others. Like any change within our lives, it depends on how you look at it. Change is the ending of one thing (death) and the beginning of something new (creation). Native American Indian mythology Raven is the bringer of light to the people.

She had it carefully placed in a small box in the herb closet. It was hand carved and held together with twine and screws so it moved like a person would move and could be posed accordingly. After asking my Grandmother about it she explained it was a Binding Doll. It could be used for all forms of Binding magick from binding someone from doing negative magick to binding yourself from over eating. Over the years I tried to made these Binding Dolls and found it was not my gift. Then I found these wonderful Wooden figures that are bother flexible and can be posed as needed. \r\n\r\nThis is a very Old World from of Magick. Witches have been making Binding Dolls for as long as time has been time. If you can think it, you can use this perfectly proportioned Wooden Flexible Binding Doll for the work you desire to do. \r\n\r\nThis Wooden Flexible Binding Doll Set is 4 ½ inches tall and wonderful for magick workings for those of advanced magickal understandings.

Seen as the Three Fates, in classical mythology, man’s destiny is controlled by the Three Fates. When people are born the Fates determine how their lives will unfold, what will happen to them and when they will die. All human beings, and even the Gods, were subject to their whims, except perhaps for Jupiter, although opinion differed on this matter in antiquity. \r\nThe Fates are depicted from beautiful Goddesses to ugly old women, depending on your choice of history. (I choose beauty.) Each one with her own task. Clotho (the spinner) spun the ‘thread of life.’ Lachesis (the allotter) measured the thread with her measuring rod and thus ordained how long someone would live. Atropos (the unturnable) cut the thread of life when the time had come. In the visual arts the Fates also sometimes stand for death, or accompany Death on his rounds. \r\n","options":[{"id":31848184,"name":"Default","price":85.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99990223/-/9201-three-graces-greek-statue-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99990223/-/9201-three-graces-greek-statue-2.jpg","width":593,"height":771},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99990247/-/The_Three_Fates__The_Three_Graces_Bronzed_Statue_016.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99990247/-/The_Three_Fates__The_Three_Graces_Bronzed_Statue_016.JPG","width":480,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99990235/-/9201-three-graces-greek-statue-900x900.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99990235/-/9201-three-graces-greek-statue-900x900.jpg","width":611,"height":671}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3973011,"name":"* Miscellaneous Witchy Stuff","permalink":"miscellaneous-witchy-stuff","url":"/category/miscellaneous-witchy-stuff"},{"id":2633269,"name":"Goddess /  God","permalink":"goddess-god","url":"/category/goddess-god"},{"id":2884909,"name":"Goddess","permalink":"goddess","url":"/category/goddess"},{"id":2621865,"name":"Pagan & Witch Home and Office Décor","permalink":"pagan-witch-home-and-office-decor","url":"/category/pagan-witch-home-and-office-decor"},{"id":2823179,"name":"Paganism","permalink":"paganism","url":"/category/paganism"},{"id":2884905,"name":"Statues and Resins","permalink":"statues-and-resins","url":"/category/statues-and-resins"}]},{"id":4889729,"name":"Brilliant Brass Mortar and Pestle (CC)","permalink":"brilliant-brass-mortar-and-pestle","position":177,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/brilliant-brass-mortar-and-pestle","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-20T21:39:16.000Z","description":"Brilliant Brass Mortar and Pestle \r\n\r\nFor those who work with natural magick ingredients such as herbs, roots, and seeds, a mortar and pestle set is a necessity when making up traditional sachet powders, incense powder compounds, spell mixes and healing herbs.

Many even fear thinking about it, because if you don't think about it, it want happen. It can and as a Breast Cancer Survivor and Witch, I have been asked over and over how I handled Breast Cancer and what all I did for healing. To start with, everyone is 100% different and I did what I had to do for myself, just as anyone dose. I nor anyone has a cure yet for Breast Cancer, but Goddess willing in time their will be. \r\n\r\nThis Breast Cancer Healing Spell Set has been created according to the healing spell work I used for myself. Each item has direction and purpose according to strength and healing. This spell is wonderful for anyone who has had to deal with Breast Cancer for themselves, their friends or family.

I can not make any promises on anyone’s personal healing. Everyone must heal from within their own spirit and body according to their time. Yet, I do believe that a positive attitude, fighting spirit and blessings found within the Goddess aids in our recovery beyond any spell. \r\n\r\nThis is my personal story: \r\n\r\nBreast Cancer: A Witches Story\r\n\r\nIt had been a peculiar day and I was confused with all the unfamiliar sensations that keep coming into my spirit. I was setting on the back porch swing with my one leg hanging down so I could keep moving. I was starring into the nothingness of something I could not explain. Even the air moving across my skin seemed to be saturated with a confused energy going from warm to cool and back again. I must have been deep into the consideration of it all when my Great Grandmother walked out from the kitchen. “You all right Little One, or did someone walk across your grave?” Just then I could hear thunder rolling up from the valley across the hilltops. First soft and gentle, then louder like it was gaining power as it moved along. \r\n\r\nMy Great Grandmother sat down with me on the swing and smiled as if she knew every deep thought I was having. “Don’t worry honey,” she said. “Sometimes our spirits quicken like butterflies leaving a cocoon. We know there is more life for us to live but our spirits fear we want get to it all in time.” I guess as children we can’t really understand that there may not be enough time, that something can change every single moment of our life. That we may have to fight to get out of that cocoon and set our spirits free to live.\r\n\r\nI hate going to doctors and on this day as I hung up the phone I was thinking how I really didn’t have the time to waste going to the doctor or sitting in an office to get a mammogram. I was pretty good about going; I have a family history of breast cancer, but you know how it is, it will never happen to you. I made the appointment anyway, begrudging the time I could be doing something else. In a few weeks I found myself sitting there in my little paper waist shirt waiting for someone to come into the room and tell me all the x-rays and ultrasounds were good. Then I had that feeling come over me again; that feeling I had in childhood when my Great Grandmother would ask me if someone was walking over my grave. You know you never expect anything to be wrong, or maybe we don’t want to think it is possible but life can change in an instant. \r\n\r\nThe doctor walked into the office and before she could say a word, I could feel the tears running down my cheeks. I shook my head as if I could make it all go away but I couldn’t. It was real and I had breast cancer. It was only a few days until I was in the hospital undergoing a double mastectomy. \r\n\r\nAt that time I believed that my world and my life was changing and I no longer had any control of anything. I cried, I grieved, I asked why me. Okay, why not me. As a child of the Goddess I believe that everything we are given in life it to teach us, but it is also given to us that we, perhaps in some small way might help others if and when they face the same kinds of struggles.\r\n\r\nI have to tell you there is nothing that will slap you back into reality as fast as looking down to where you once had breasts and finding none. In this moment you can either give into grief or find the guiding power to heal and survive. \r\n\r\nI could hear my Great Grandmother speaking to me just like she did as a child on that old porch swing. I could feel that my spirit was worried I wouldn’t have enough time to do all I wanted to do in my life. I was going to have to fight for and it and I did. \r\n\r\nNo one wants to have this terrible disease. But I did, and as breast cancer survivors will tell you, I always will have it; like some monster hidden behind a tree that might jump out and scare the crap out of you anytime and at any moment. It’s there and not only there for me, but my daughter and my granddaughter.\r\n\r\nEvery person in America knows or will know someone with breast cancer in their lifetime. Sadly it could also be you. My faith in the Goddess and Her ability to heal me from my fears and this disease, I believe, was one of the greatest gifts of recovery I had. \r\n\r\nMy gift back, is to help others be aware. \r\n\r\nApril is when we have the; Breast Cancer Walk for the Cure in many areas of the country. These walks is extremely important to me and the hundreds of thousands of us all over the world that are breast cancer survivors. For that reason I have shared here my story as a Witch with breast cancer. \r\n\r\nBreast cancer is a killer. It has no respect for human life, it doesn’t care what your income might be and it could care less where you live. Breast cancer is disease that can strike anyone at anytime, men and women. It is my hope that in sharing these few words of my survival of breast cancer; it will somehow help others to be aware. \r\n\r\nBreast Cancer Facts: \r\n\r\n*Over 40,000 people will die of breast cancer this year in the united states.\r\n*One out of every seven women will develop breast cancer \r\n*A woman's chances of developing breast cancer increases with age: (I was in my 40‘s) \r\n*Approximately 200,000 cases of breast cancer will occur in the United States this year. \r\n\r\nTraits common to breast cancer survivors: \r\n\r\n*They are well-informed and take control of their treatment \r\n*They know cancer is just a symptom and make life-style changes\r\n*And most importantly, they have a positive attitude.\r\n\r\nI share my story and ask that everyone become a part of every woman’s, and yes man’s, survival by supporting and doing what you can do to fight this killer of life. Goddess willing, Let us be the cure. \r\n\r\nBlessings and have a magickal pink day.\r\nLady Abigail\r\nCopyright © 03252010\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":18856847,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/57776145/-/__KGrHqZHJBkE63VtkvRHBOz-C-zsOw__60_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/57776145/-/__KGrHqZHJBkE63VtkvRHBOz-C-zsOw__60_3.jpg","width":450,"height":712},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/57776137/-/__KGrHqZ__okE63_r2r_FBOz-C-o1rQ__60_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/57776137/-/__KGrHqZ__okE63_r2r_FBOz-C-o1rQ__60_3.jpg","width":480,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/57776129/-/__KGrHqN__p8E63Zwhd_sBOz-D_iCv___60_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/57776129/-/__KGrHqN__p8E63Zwhd_sBOz-D_iCv___60_3.jpg","width":480,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/57776121/-/__KGrHqF__h8E7_R0IZM_BOz-C__6IQ__60_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/57776121/-/__KGrHqF__h8E7_R0IZM_BOz-C__6IQ__60_3.jpg","width":480,"height":640}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3972972,"name":"* GLASS WITCH EXCLUSIVES","permalink":"glass-witch-exclusives","url":"/category/glass-witch-exclusives"},{"id":3973011,"name":"* Miscellaneous Witchy Stuff","permalink":"miscellaneous-witchy-stuff","url":"/category/miscellaneous-witchy-stuff"},{"id":2616601,"name":"Candles","permalink":"candles","url":"/category/candles"},{"id":2621789,"name":"One of a Kind MAGICK Sets, Kits and Collections","permalink":"one-of-a-kind-magick-sets-kits-and-collections","url":"/category/one-of-a-kind-magick-sets-kits-and-collections"},{"id":2616625,"name":"Spell Kits","permalink":"spell-kits","url":"/category/spell-kits"},{"id":2765705,"name":"Spell Sets & Magick","permalink":"spell-sets-magick","url":"/category/spell-sets-magick"},{"id":2616645,"name":"Witch Made Magick","permalink":"witch-made-magick","url":"/category/witch-made-magick"}]},{"id":6401735,"name":"Amazing Wood God & Goddess Altar Set: Chalice, Libation Bowl, Wall Sconce Set (FG)","permalink":"amazing-wood-god-goddess-wood-altar-set-chalice-libation-bowl-wall-sconce-set","position":183,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/amazing-wood-god-goddess-wood-altar-set-chalice-libation-bowl-wall-sconce-set","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-08T21:50:00.000Z","description":"Amazing Wood God & Goddess Altar Set: Chalice, Libation Bowl, Wall Sconce Set\r\n\r\nThis astonishing Wood God & Goddess Wood Altar Set was found in a local Vintage shops in Southern Indiana.

Each one is made with by melting glass rods and allowing the colors to mix with clear glass until they form a tear and fall. The Goddess Tear represents the many aspects of our lives with the Goddess as we see Her. \r\n\r\nAnointed and blessed from the night of the full moon through the night of the dark moon, they hold a balance of the Goddesses and Her power within them. In times of personal struggles you simple hold it in your hands and allow the energy within to fill your heart and soul with the love and light of the Goddess. \r\n\r\nThis Goddess Tear is approximately 1 inch long and made of mixed colors. Each one slightly different from the other like a natural tear and comes in a small bag for protection. A black cord has been added for you to use but you can easily add the Goddess Tear to any chain, cord or ribbon. \r\n\r\n* New Color Black & Purple: I’m not exactly sure how I made these. 1st and maybe only time I will end up the colors somehow mixed. The ribbons are dark almost black until held up to the light where purple appears to glow through. I love them and I hope you do too… Lady Abigail \r\n\r\nGoddess Tears were something I designed simply by accident. In a time when my energy had been waning and I felt lost I decided to work with my glass and make some beads for a necklace. My mind not being on my work, I let the glass form itself as I twisted and bent the colors around. When the first one formed I had a spiritual feeling of peace. When it cooled I noticed it had an eye so that I could place a cord through it to wear. I did so and placed it in the window on the full moon. Then on the dark moon I remember it being there. When I picked it up again I felt that energy of peace and calming. That is when I realized that each one is formed not just from glass but from the spirit and love of the Goddess. By Her tears for all Her children we are blessed and find peace in times of trouble. \r\n\r\nBlessed be,\r\nLady Abigail\r\n\r\n* Chain not included.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":29243381,"name":"Dark Purple (15H)","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15837719,"name":"Black (15H)","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16913301,"name":"Stripe  (15H)","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16913303,"name":"Teal (15H)","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16913305,"name":"Green (15H)","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16913307,"name":"Pink (15H)","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29243384,"name":"Red & Yellow Flame (15H)","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91860350/-/Black_with_colors.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91860350/-/Black_with_colors.jpg","width":430,"height":558},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91858622/-/Goddess_Tears_008.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91858622/-/Goddess_Tears_008.JPG","width":566,"height":382},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91858634/-/Goddess_Tears_017.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91858634/-/Goddess_Tears_017.JPG","width":393,"height":355},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91858646/-/Goddess_Tearss_007.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91858646/-/Goddess_Tearss_007.JPG","width":492,"height":466},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91859138/-/Tears_of_the_Goddess_or_Goddess_Tear_Black_009.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91859138/-/Tears_of_the_Goddess_or_Goddess_Tear_Black_009.jpg","width":464,"height":534}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3972972,"name":"* GLASS WITCH EXCLUSIVES","permalink":"glass-witch-exclusives","url":"/category/glass-witch-exclusives"},{"id":3973011,"name":"* Miscellaneous Witchy Stuff","permalink":"miscellaneous-witchy-stuff","url":"/category/miscellaneous-witchy-stuff"},{"id":3973182,"name":"Glass Magick","permalink":"glass-magick","url":"/category/glass-magick"},{"id":2633269,"name":"Goddess /  God","permalink":"goddess-god","url":"/category/goddess-god"},{"id":2884909,"name":"Goddess","permalink":"goddess","url":"/category/goddess"},{"id":2818465,"name":"Goddess Tear / Goddess Tears","permalink":"goddess-tear-goddess-tears","url":"/category/goddess-tear-goddess-tears"},{"id":2616713,"name":"Jewelry","permalink":"jewelry","url":"/category/jewelry"},{"id":2621789,"name":"One of a Kind MAGICK Sets, Kits and Collections","permalink":"one-of-a-kind-magick-sets-kits-and-collections","url":"/category/one-of-a-kind-magick-sets-kits-and-collections"},{"id":2823179,"name":"Paganism","permalink":"paganism","url":"/category/paganism"},{"id":2668965,"name":"Totem / Totems","permalink":"totem-totems","url":"/category/totem-totems"}]},{"id":7749192,"name":"Amazingly Tiny Magick Jewelry Spell Bottle (15B)","permalink":"amazingly-tiny-magick-jewelry-spell-bottle","position":200,"price":9.0,"default_price":9.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/amazingly-tiny-magick-jewelry-spell-bottle","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-30T14:32:26.000Z","description":"Amazingly Tiny Magick Jewelry Spell Bottle\r\n\r\nThis wonderful little glass bottle provides a faceted octagon shape that make it much more durable than other spell bottles.

Our ancestors often envisioned their Gods as anthropomorphic beings who encapsulated this wild essence. Today the Gods of the bull, the ram, goat and stag still hold tremendous power and are invoked at rituals by a new priesthood who continue to seek the wildness of nature and the inspiration that it holds. These deities transcend the safe and known boundaries of human structure, sometimes even luring us across the threshold of the known into the unknown worlds.\r\n\r\nVintage pewter libation horns. Wilton RWP Armetale French horn mugs/steins. According to the the information I can find, Armetale pieces won't break or chip under normal use.

Their size is just big enough without being to much. \r\n\r\nGreen Onyx is also known for its ability to aid with its energetic properties. This can help instill anything within it with its properties, or otherwise aid you in empowering your ritual works and intentions. An added plus when seeking success in life as well as working for prosperity.

Like herbs, crystals and plants these natural remnants of an Owls dinner have magickal energies. Not everyone is going to be comfortable using them, but for those that understand natural nature energy they are amazing.\r\n\r\nYep, that was it was a bag of Owl regurgitation. Owls take everything in basically eating things whole. This includes the feather, hair, bones, teeth, jaw bones, back bones and a tail. Then they get rid of the remains (all part not nourishing to them) in one little ball call a Owl Pellet. This pellet is full of tiny bones. Teeth and so forth that are perfect for spell work and magick. They are also considered clean bones because the came by way of natures laws. Also the Pellets hold energy and power from the Owls much stronger than a feather especially for those whom honor the Owl as their personal Totem. \r\n\r\nAll Barn Owl Pellets are Heat Sterilized, and individually wrapped in aluminum foil. Filled with skeletal remains for identification of prey taken by the Barn Owl. Can be used to teach children the nature of food chains and to demonstrate the role of avian predators in the ecosystem, and to provide information about the presence of animals in a particular area. Each Barn Owl Pellet is from the wild and unique in size, shape, and contents. Owl Pellets are a Natural Magickal and Educational Tool. \r\n\r\n* No Owls are harmed in the harvesting of the pellets.\r\n\r\nEACH KIT INCLUDES: \r\n\r\nA Beautiful \"Full Color\" Box (9\"x 6\"x 2\") containing a Photograph of an adult Barn Owl. \r\nA 9 page Study Guide containing information about the Barn Owl, owl pellets, how to dissect owl pellets and how to identify the animal skulls found in owl pellets. To enhance this study guide we have included 7 photos, 6 illustrations of the skulls of common prey found in owl pellets and corresponding illustrations of the 6 common prey, along with illus- trations of the prey animals and two different views of the vole skeleton identifying the individual bones of the mouse skeleton. \r\nBone Id Sheet comparing bones from rodents, shrews, moles, and birds. \r\nPlastic Forceps \r\nOne Magnifying lens \r\n3 Heat Sterilized Barn Owl Pellets wrapped in aluminum foil \r\n\r\nOwls: The owl is the symbol of the feminine, the moon and the night.\r\nThe owl is the bird of magick and darkness, of prophecy and wisdom and are associated with the Goddess Athena. \r\nBarn Owl: This totem reflects the ability to the heart and the mind. It can connect you to spirits and the houses that they haunt. Mediums and “ghost hunters” often have this totem for protection and for its strong clairvoyant abilities.\r\n\r\nBones in magick: Different bones are used in different magick. Clean Bones used from natural law or a nature kill (Like these) are called clean bones and can be used in magick, spells, healing, powerful protection. \r\nUnclean Bones (Any from being killed or painful death are called unclean.) Those are used for spell casting and hexing. \r\n\r\n* The general the way to know what magick each item is best used for is to use them according to the bone. For instance a jaw bone would be used to stop gossip or skull to heal a headache... \r\nBlessings.\r\nLady Abigail","options":[{"id":20331943,"name":"Default","price":21.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/62677199/-/MainImage13.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/62677199/-/MainImage13.jpg","width":433,"height":425},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/62677191/-/51RQsKlj_BL__SL500_AA300_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/62677191/-/51RQsKlj_BL__SL500_AA300_.jpg","width":347,"height":256}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3972978,"name":"* On SALE","permalink":"on-sale","url":"/category/on-sale"},{"id":3973011,"name":"* Miscellaneous Witchy Stuff","permalink":"miscellaneous-witchy-stuff","url":"/category/miscellaneous-witchy-stuff"},{"id":2616689,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":3095713,"name":"Divination Scrying Spiritual","permalink":"divination-scrying-spiritual","url":"/category/divination-scrying-spiritual"},{"id":2621783,"name":"Herbs, Oils and Herb Tools","permalink":"herbs-oils-and-herb-tools","url":"/category/herbs-oils-and-herb-tools"},{"id":2621789,"name":"One of a Kind MAGICK Sets, Kits and Collections","permalink":"one-of-a-kind-magick-sets-kits-and-collections","url":"/category/one-of-a-kind-magick-sets-kits-and-collections"},{"id":2621865,"name":"Pagan & Witch Home and Office Décor","permalink":"pagan-witch-home-and-office-decor","url":"/category/pagan-witch-home-and-office-decor"},{"id":2626741,"name":"Ritual Tools","permalink":"ritual-tools","url":"/category/ritual-tools"},{"id":2765705,"name":"Spell Sets & Magick","permalink":"spell-sets-magick","url":"/category/spell-sets-magick"},{"id":4807882,"name":"Talisman","permalink":"talisman","url":"/category/talisman"},{"id":2668965,"name":"Totem / Totems","permalink":"totem-totems","url":"/category/totem-totems"},{"id":2616645,"name":"Witch Made Magick","permalink":"witch-made-magick","url":"/category/witch-made-magick"}]},{"id":10928628,"name":"Beautifully Engraved Magick Wax & Stamps Seals","permalink":"beautifully-engraved-magick-wax-stamps-seals","position":226,"price":17.0,"default_price":17.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/beautifully-engraved-magick-wax-stamps-seals","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-03T13:10:49.000Z","description":"Beautifully Engraved Magick Wax & Stamps Seals\r\n\r\nThese Metaphysical Magick Seals and Wax Kits are comprises of a Natural wax stick with a wick and a golden metal seal in a magickal Witch & Pagan designs; that is a Pentacle or Pentagram, Triquetra and a Celtic Trikele and .

The Pagan Cats tarot embraces these qualities, portraying them walking silently between worlds, and playing with the mysteries of life in their mischievous ways. \r\nThe deck offers 78 Arcana that provide glimpses of the world through the playful and wise eyes of cats, perhaps helping you understand the mysterious that surround us or grow closer to your companion and familiar. Also included is a small pamphlet with basic instructions as to how to use your Pagan Cat Tarot for your divination. \r\n\r\n* Crow's Magick Tarot By Londa Marks \r\nThe Crow's Magick Tarot by Londa Marks is designed to capture \"the place of dreaming and visions\" which is the world of the crow. It is a world where \"strange planets and empyrean worlds merge with wildlife, cyber and geometric spirits.\" Birds and other creatures are dominant in this deck of bright colors on a black background. Even the court cards are represented by animals, not humans. Each card gives two keyword definitions as well as some astrological correspondence signs (although these are not explained in the text). There is a separate companion book for this deck called Crow's Magick. Londa is also the creator of the Londa Tarot. \r\n\r\n* The Robin Wood Tarot By Robin Wood \r\nThe Robin Wood Tarot has rapidly become one of the most popular Tarot decks in the world. Its beautiful art, vibrant imagery and luminous energies, enchants everyone.\r\nThe 22 Major Arcana cards are filled with life that was previously unseen in the Tarot. It is also filled with the energy of nature, taking the images outside of rooms and into the beautiful abodes of the gods. For example, The High Priestess is an ageless woman wearing a lunar headband. Behind her are trees and a darkened sky lit only by the moon.\r\nThe shining strength of this deck lies in the fifty-six cards of the Minor Arcana. The characters on the cards almost seem to breathe. Often, the cards seem so dimensional you get the feeling you could jump into them. Watch the boy carve pentagrams on wooden disks in the eight of Pentacles. Gleefully help steal blades in the five of Swords. Join in the merry dance on the four of Wands.\r\nThe 56-page booklet explains everything to give a Tarot reading, including the upright and reversed meaning for each card and 3 different layouts. Each of the pip cards is given a word or short phrase to help you identify the meaning of the card with virtually no effort.\r\nPagans will love the influence of nature on this deck. Beginners will find it makes learning the Tarot fun and easy. Experienced Tarot readers will love the radiantly colorful, symbolic, and infinitely captivating deck.

The pestle is a heavy club-shaped object, the end of which is used for crushing and grinding. The mortar is a bowl once made of heavy cast iron is now more typically made of hard wood, ceramic or stone. \r\n\r\nThe substance to be ground is placed in the mortar and ground, crushed or mixed with the pestle. Sometimes referred to as an \"Apothecary Grinder\".\r\n\r\nThis Large and Extremely Rare Cast Iron Mortar & Pestle made of heavy cast iron which as been pitted over many years of use and age. The Mortar stands just over 6.5 inches tall with a 8 inch wide bowl. The base is 7.5 inches across and the bowl is 7 inches deep.\r\n\r\nThe Heavy Cast Iron Pestle is 11 inches long and they are the original set. Both have a wonderful and vintage energy that can be felt when working with this magickal set.\r\n\r\nI have only slightly cleaned them since many of the spirit heart believe to clean them to much removes some of the energy held within them. There is some pitting on each piece which is only to be expected with something this old and rare. We believe it dates back to the mid 1700’s. No apparent markings can be seen, but the only one I could fine similar to this set was in England and dated to the early 1700’s. \r\n\r\n* This is an genuine and authentic \"Antique\" Cast Iron Mortar and Pestle. It is well over 100 years of age. Yet according to our research the mortar and pestle are approximately two hundred years old. They are a set and are sold only as a set.\r\n\r\nCondition: \r\nThis measures in overall height, as measured from the bottom to the top, approximately 6.5 inches. The top interior diameter, as measured across the inside of the upper rim, measures approximately 8  inches.\r\nThe bottom diameter, as measured across the bottom, measures approximately 7.5 inches \r\nThe inside of the mortar is approximately 7 inches deep.  \r\nThe total weight of both pieces, together, the mortar and the pestle, weighs approximately 20 lbs.

Each page found within this book are made from cotton scraps found at the floor of garment factories and recycled natural items such as fruit and vegetable husks, further enhancing this wonderful magick of this Book of Shadows. This blank book is approximately 300 pages in length, with stitched binding. \r\n\r\nSolstice Leather Blank Book\r\nPortraying both the sacred Solstices, this beautiful leather-bound 4 1/2\" by 6 1/2\" journal is a wonderful representative of time passing throughout the year. The leather surface has been hand embossed and printed to portray the sun for both the winter and summer solstice in a stylized fashion, two separate images divided by the binding, which has be styled as the sweeping trunk of a tree. \r\n\r\nFairy Leather Blank Book\r\nBeautifully bound within red, hand-stitched leather, this delightful journal has been carefully embossed and dyed to portray a scene out of Celtic legend. On the front face you will find the image of a beautiful fairy, lithe and robed in gossamer with the wings of a butterfly, all framed within an elaborate border of Celtic Knotwork. This Knotwork extends then down the binding, and expands to embrace the picture on the back which shows a dragonfly, hovering among flowers. This book is approximately 7\" by 5 1/2\" in size.\r\n\r\nGoddess Leather Blank Book of Shadows\r\nHand crafted and stitched green-dyed leather this thick leather bound 4 1/2\" by 6 1/2\" journal displays on its covers two very distinct and different views of the Goddess. On the front she would seem a wholesome being, nurturing and gentle-featured as she sits in the lotus position. With her chest bared but for her concealing hair, she sits before a backdrop of a woven Celtic pattern, seemingly embracing a starry night in her hands, from which pours the waters of life. On the back cover, you will see a very different depiction. This is the Goddess of womanly wrath, beautiful even as she is frightening; the very image of a woman who will protect her children by any means, and strike with a wrathful hand. \r\n\r\nTree of Life Leather Blank Book (Yellow & Green)\r\nBedecked in wonderful Celtic imagery, this 4 1/2\" by 6 1/2\" leather-bound journal portrays the tree of life, with its far reaching branches snarled in a twisting canopy of Celtic knots and leafy foliage. Beneath this, the tree contorts into an ancient warped trunk and deep roots that spread out into a wide design of Celtic Knotswork weaving in and out of itself to create a wondrous, tangled pattern. \r\n\r\nBlue Celtic Leather Blank Book\r\nFeaturing hand-tooled leatherworking that you can lose yourself in for hours, the Blue Celtic leather blank book is intricately worked with complex patterns of knots, Triquetras, and spirals deeply rooted within Celtic traditions. Follow the patterns and grow mesmerized in the intricacies that can leave you drifting into a meditative trance all too readily. The leather, dyed a rich blue coloring, features a corded binding with the pages within, and a leather thong that can be coiled around the book to hold its cover securely shut.\r\n\r\n* The Book of Shadows is a scared, private place where spells, rituals, and often inspirations are written. A Book of Shadows has the energy of the person who creates it, the spells within it and the spirit in which you keep it. Many Books of Shadow are handed down from generation to generation as blessings of those who honored the magick in times pasted.

Most of us can not have enough of them and collect them in all sizes and shapes. I think it is because they put us in touch with our mystical past of standing at the fire stirring all manner of magick brews and healing potions. \r\n\r\nA cauldron is more than just a pot to cook in or to burn your incense.  It is also a symbol of the Goddess, a representation of abundance, knowledge and wisdom of the old ways and the old magick. Cauldrons are used in magick for calling spirits, knowledge, physical restoration, regeneration of life, transformation, and scrying or seeking the truth. Cauldrons are magickal vessels used to represent the Goddess, grounding to earth, the fire element and ritual magick. \r\n\r\nBrass Cauldron:\r\n\r\nThis magickal brass Cauldron is a wonderful tool for your altar and all of your sacred rituals. Created out of solid brass in the classical cauldron design, with three short legs and two handles on either side, which in turn support a carrying handle that stretches between them. Decorated on both front and back with a pentagram, it is a wonderful tool for burning your ritual incense, tea light and votive candles, or otherwise leaving offerings of oil, herbs, or even food. \r\n\r\nIncluding the handle, this small brass cauldron measures approximately 4\" wide and 4\" high, with interior dimension of approximately 2 1/2\" diameter and 1 1/4\" deep. 　\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":15923239,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68042307/-/c1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68042307/-/c1.jpg","width":850,"height":742},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47982601/-/c2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47982601/-/c2.jpg","width":300,"height":259},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47982609/-/c3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47982609/-/c3.jpg","width":800,"height":734},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47982593/-/c1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47982593/-/c1.jpg","width":800,"height":692}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2616599,"name":"Cauldrons","permalink":"cauldrons","url":"/category/cauldrons"},{"id":2633249,"name":"Pentagram Pentacle","permalink":"pentagram-pentacle","url":"/category/pentagram-pentacle"}]},{"id":5232581,"name":"Triple Blessings Wind Chime (GA)","permalink":"triple-blessings-wind-chime","position":285,"price":19.0,"default_price":19.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/triple-blessings-wind-chime","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-01-12T01:59:51.000Z","description":"Triple Blessings Wind Chime \r\n\r\nI love wind chimes!

Old keys, Skelton keys, latch keys all seem to have a magickal energy that draws us to them. Keys are often used in magick and spell work to lock and unlock a spell or to open the doorways into the veils as will as to honor the Goddess Hekate. Many Witches work with and honor the Goddess Hekate; Keys being one of her most powerful symbols.\r\n\r\nThis magickal set of 5 cast iron Keys are held within a metal ring. The Keys of Magick and Light Set when hung is just over 7 inches long. The center key which is the longest is 4 inches long. These Keys of Magick and Light are superbly painted in black and bronze patina to give them a mystical appearance. Hang then in your home to give a powerful statement of control and magick to any room or area they are placed.  \r\n\r\nA Skeleton Key are seen as an amulet to open the doors of opportunity and success, and lock out or repel negative energies. In magick they are used for unlocking spells, magick, even the dreams of what is hidden within. Keys are a symbol of Hekate/Hecate the Goddess of Witches and Witchcraft since she carried and held the Keys to Hades. Therefore they have to power to shield and lock out those spirits that might cause harm or come into a home unwelcome.
