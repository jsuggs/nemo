An eclectic and intense effort which goes beyond any easy definition of musical genre. \"Vega\" consists of 7 new songs for almost 50 minutes of music and includes important contributions from various guest musicians. Starting from the basis of the milestone \"Fulgures\", the progressive influence showed before by the band becomes clearer and stronger culminating into an haunting visionary form of expression. Giving voice to a constant quest, to the fiery longing for a lost point of reference which constantly glimpses through the ever storming sea of the flowing eras, \"Vega\" lets the potential dispayed by the band in the previous release finally bloom, confirming JANVS as one of the most deep and unique acts in the current independent scene\r\n\r\nMp3 sample:\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.atmf.net/samples/Janvs_VEGA_07_Vesper_II.mp3\">Mp3 Sample</a>","options":[{"id":749410,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1051911/-/janvs_vega_frontcover._400.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1051911/-/janvs_vega_frontcover._400.jpg","width":400,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":156192,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":166447,"name":"Tronus Abyss - Vuoto Spazio Trionfo","permalink":"tronus-abyss-vuoto-spazio-trionfo","position":2,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tronus-abyss-vuoto-spazio-trionfo","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-10-14T20:16:00.000Z","description":"The re-release of the at that time revolutionary 2003 “Kampf” has unveiled the story of one of the most innovative bands in the Black Metal field, trespassing on the electro and apocalyptic field. After 5 years it’s time to give a new sign of communication and “Vuoto, Spazio, Trionfo” is a challenging and magnificent merging of noise ambient apocalyptic soundscapes and Black Metal de-fragmented memories. Not like the many wannabe pseudo-experimental acts TA sets new standard thanks to many years of electronic shaping of their sound and the very inner core of visionary Black metal. Starting from the rusty songs of the album to the more liquid and open atmospheres TA won the challenge of doing experimental and personal music in spite of the today tendency to follow the rules and market standards. This is because they’re a manifestation of the spirit, this cd will drive to madness those into Spektr, Darkspace because will show a further step of evolution, in some way recalling the madness of the Arcturus’ experimental face.\r\n\r\nMp3 sample:\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.atmf.net/samples/TA_VST_01_Trasformazione.mp3\">Mp3 Sample</a>","options":[{"id":749456,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1051931/-/tronus_abyss_vst_front_400.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1051931/-/tronus_abyss_vst_front_400.jpg","width":400,"height":370}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":156192,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":166454,"name":"Svarti Loghin - Empty World","permalink":"svarti-loghin-empty-world","position":3,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/svarti-loghin-empty-world","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-10-14T20:20:29.000Z","description":"Svarti Loghin are destined to become the Swedish point of reference for words like skillfull, emotive and depressive Black Metal.\r\nThe gloomy atmosphere of their debut leads to progressive territories and to B disharmonic and melodic vibrations. Empty Wold is the anti-modern anthem which sophistication is the feeling of the music itself instead of any sort of instrumental joy. Empty World is like a twilight gradually covering Midgard, the demonstration that Scandinavia has still something unique to offer to the Black Metal and obscure music scene more in general. The awesome songwriting can sometimes recalls the darker feeling of Forgotten Woods' \"The Curse of Mankind\" or younger bands like early Alcest but it's something beyond. Attractive like nature but in the meantime deadly \"Empty World\" is the hard cider that will lead to watch the last breath of this vanishing world.\r\n\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.atmf.net/samples/svarti_Loghin_01_karg_nordisk_vinter.mp3\">MP3 SAMPLE</a>","options":[{"id":749465,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1051979/-/SL_EW_front_jpg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1051979/-/SL_EW_front_jpg.jpg","width":400,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":156192,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":166457,"name":"Lantlos - Lantlos","permalink":"lantlos-lantlos","position":4,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lantlos-lantlos","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-10-14T20:22:11.000Z","description":"The cold calling of our dying modernity, featuring the Geist's singer the German band Lantlos is able to shape tasteful black metal and to switch inside their creation acoustic passages with a result that recalls of Ved Buens Ende's \"For Those Who Caress the Pale\" and Amoesoeurs.

Letum starts where the melancholic hymn of the debut ended up, with a further obvious improvement on the song-writing and expressive potentiality. The album carries the name of the atavic creature Letum as it was called in the Roman mythology, and Keres in the Greek one. Dwelling the underworld, he was the representation of the overtaking from the world of the living to the spiritual world of the dead, the concept is about a borderline experience between our life and beyond.
