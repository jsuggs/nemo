The music of the duo from Athens (Greece) is transparent, fresh and takes your breath away. It is strictly analogue, though alongside the synthesizers, drum-machines and loops a bass line, a dreamy piano and saxophone melody may surprise you. The female voice narrates about love and the loss of it, about death and the fear of it, about sexuality and the repression of it, about addictions, psychological weaknesses or strengths, all our own personal ghosts, which distinguish humans from other species. The power and tenderness of the male vocals penetrate your senses directly.

Today M!R!M is a 23 year old boy, named Iacopo Bertelli. His music was generously tagged as “post punk”, however the layers of it make any categorization , a difficult matter.\r\nBertelli, created “Heaven” in his bedroom ,trapped inside four walls of loneliness and fear of what the future may bring. Haunted by the Jesus and Mary Chains ' dirty guitar sounds, the New M!R!M keeps the powerful, dynamics of their older work intact, but upgrades it ,adding the most essential ingredient in creating good music: The Passion.\r\n“Heaven” is literally Bertelli's personal hell, and all his songs seem to feed on his subconscious, creating a doomed, vulgar, acid world with whispers that become screams and guitar effects blend with inner voices and synths.\r\nYou will be surprised many times , listening to “Heaven”. You might find traces of SUICIDE 's frenzy, WIRE's straight forwardness and DNA 's nihilism. You might as well be surprised by the noir wave duet with Nathalie Bruno (from the promising band ,PHOSPHOR),one of the highlights of the LP.\r\nM!R!M 's “Heaven” is definitely worth the wait of those who already new the band and a great introduction to all of those who search for a dirty, violently personal sound.\r\nThe Cover is made by contempory artist, Zigendemonic.\r\nThe LP will be released in 500,hand numbered, limited copies, including download link.\r\nBand info : http://wearemrm.bandcamp.com/ \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":44337537,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":190,"name":"Russian Federation","code":"RU"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":184,"name":"Poland","code":"PL"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129547509/-/mr.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129547509/-/mr.jpg","width":960,"height":960}],"artists":[{"id":236469,"name":"M!R!M!","permalink":"m-r-m","url":"/artist/m-r-m"}],"categories":[{"id":6300615,"name":"LP Vinyl","permalink":"lp-vinyl","url":"/category/lp-vinyl"}]},{"id":14202837,"name":"FP 013 / DORIC-OVER MENTALITY LP ","permalink":"7f002-doric-s-t","position":23,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/7f002-doric-s-t","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-15T23:05:22.000Z","description":"Doric is the solo, side-project of Stathis Leontiadis, mostly known as the one half of the Human Puppets, as well as the Exetix and Plexiglas.\r\nBeing involved in various avant garde/new wave music projects since 1996,intrigued by the all analogue mentality of the late 70’s-early 80’s music field , he passionately committed to vintage synths and machines, creating a very distinctive and specific style and considered by many as “specialist”.\r\nHis live performances are all analogue by choice and are interestingly captivating as the sound is being built on stage, just like the old days.\r\nWe proudly introduced him as a unit to the world ,with a brilliant and unique self title 7” (Feb/2013) that was an instant sold out. Therefore the next step of a full LP seemed inevitable and needed.\r\n”Over Mentality\" is a record ,full of Minimal Electro perfectionism and New Wave complex landscapes, performed with the agility and passion of a natural born Purist. \r\nDoric's mentality, carries raw, passionate ,old school values filtered with the innovation of a musician that is cursed to live Today. His subjects vary from unexpected loves ,cursed lives, wasted ,devoured dreams however, all of them cling under one thematic area: How memories fulfill us and keep us sane.\r\nThe artwork of the record implies the handmade, oldschool ethos as well.\r\nThe Lp will be released in 500,hand numbered, limited,black vinyl copies, including download link.\r\nArtist: www.facebook.com/Doric.music\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":45871680,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":190,"name":"Russian Federation","code":"RU"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":184,"name":"Poland","code":"PL"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129547140/-/dor.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129547140/-/dor.jpg","width":207,"height":206}],"artists":[{"id":236460,"name":"Doric","permalink":"doric","url":"/artist/doric"}],"categories":[{"id":6300615,"name":"LP Vinyl","permalink":"lp-vinyl","url":"/category/lp-vinyl"}]},{"id":14202801,"name":"FP012 /BLABLARISM-AGNOSTODYNIS LP","permalink":"7f002-sally-dige-s-t","position":24,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/7f002-sally-dige-s-t","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-15T23:03:19.000Z","description":"Blablarism is Oksana Zmorovytch from Kiev. She creates a music elixir based on shoegazy ghosts and drone labyrinths.This is her first full LP and contains some older songs blended with new ethereal stories.\r\nThe fact that she is from Kiev, affects her music, adding endless landscapes of grey, tradition blended with New Modern Ways and intriguing mythology.\r\nThere is something mystical about Blablarism's music. It sometimes appears as common as an old shoegaze record you have played one millions times on your teenage room, then suddenly turns to a cold wave anthem with incomprehensible almost pagan vocals and gloomy, fustian synths.\r\nBlablarism can also be described as experimental electronic, although the synthesis is somehow wisely structured and moderated with caution. The stories on this album are all like a personal diary written, not with words but with noises. And this private pieces of her are accompanied with romantic visuals and associative aesthetics in order to guide you into her heart.\r\nIf you are searching for pureness and crystal clear sensitivity in an artist, then you will love this record. Dark electronica with reverberating guitars, gloomy synthetic sounds and blackened bass themes.\r\nThe LP will be released in 500 hand numbered, limited copies, including download link.\r\nInfo: www.facebook.com/blablarism\r\n","options":[{"id":45871596,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":190,"name":"Russian Federation","code":"RU"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":184,"name":"Poland","code":"PL"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129546726/-/bla.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129546726/-/bla.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[{"id":236472,"name":"Blablarism","permalink":"blablarism","url":"/artist/blablarism"}],"categories":[{"id":6300615,"name":"LP Vinyl","permalink":"lp-vinyl","url":"/category/lp-vinyl"}]}]
