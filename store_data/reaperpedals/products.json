Attack will give you a boost to the bottom-end, more gain at hand of the Chaos knob and a slight boost in the mids section.\r\nDefence setting will give you more of a straight up cleanboost without colouring your tone.\r\nHue knob plays only with the highs and will at a 12 o'clock position be pretty much neutral and true to your basic tone, turn it up and you have a more cutting and open sound.\r\nThe notable thing about this booster/overdrive is the fact it's using mosfets for clipping unlike pedals such as the Tubescreamer which uses silicon diodes for clipping. Silicon diodes will give you a more compressed and unnatural type of sound where mosfets will preserve your tone and sound more open and realistic.\r\nStacked opamps is another feature, this means there is two opamps on top of each other which have been carefully picked and blended to give you extra crisp and punch.\r\nAnother cool feature is that I have made a built in voltage doubler, what this means is that you plug a 9V DC in and bam, the pedal runs at 18V DC to allow for more headroom and clearness, plug 12V DC and you have 24V DC feeding it.\r\nI would not recommend going any further then plugging a 12V supply into it.\r\n\r\nSee this as a pre-order and keep in mind to allow 4-6 weeks for delivery as each and every pedal is handcrafted.\r\n\r\n<b>Features:</b>\r\n&middot;
