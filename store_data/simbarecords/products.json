This LP is a collection of their debut 7”, In Transit, released in 1997 on Initial Records, along with their pair of 7”s recorded in between their first two albums (U.S. Songs and False Cathedrals). These two records, If They Do 7” (Initial Records) and Will You (Revelation Records) have long since been out of print. Rounding out this collection of eight songs are two instrumental tracks that were recorded during this period. One was previously on the CDEP version of the If They Do release while the other, “Orphalese”, has never been released on any format.\r\nThese long-out-of-print 7”s are the part of the puzzle that needed to be reissued to keep ELLIOTT’s legacy available to everyone. They bridge the gap between the songwriting of U.S. Songs and False Cathedrals, showing the band’s evolution and development.","options":[{"id":30802816,"name":"black 180g vinyl - limited to 300 copies","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":41173785,"name":"grey marble vinyl - limited to 500 copies","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":41173788,"name":"clear vinyl - rsd version - limited to clear vinyl","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":9.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96715495/-/elliott.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96715495/-/elliott.jpeg","width":985,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2985833,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]},{"id":9845152,"name":"simba book","permalink":"simba-book","position":2,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/simba-book","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-10T21:54:58.000Z","description":"Simba Zine started in 1992 as a traditional zine and morphed into one of the most popular and well-respected \"emo\" zines of the 90's hardcore scene.

All personal writings are political and revolutionary in their own right. Challenging gender roles, rules, and assumptions about sex, friendship, and love, never afraid to discuss something \"too personal\", these writings challenged the way people thought and behaved. Simba crossed the boundaries between the hardcore and riot grrl scenes and was undoubtedly one of the most influential zines in the 90s.","options":[{"id":30802603,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96714535/-/facebookad2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96714535/-/facebookad2.jpg","width":239,"height":356}],"artists":[{"id":183055,"name":"vique martin","permalink":"vique-martin","url":"/artist/vique-martin"}],"categories":[{"id":4789453,"name":"book","permalink":"book","url":"/category/book"}]},{"id":6064951,"name":"simba book shirt","permalink":"simba-book-shirt","position":3,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/simba-book-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-30T09:01:35.000Z","description":"this is the cover of the forthcoming simba book. \r\nsoft t-shirts \r\nsmall and medium available right now!","options":[{"id":19376559,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59545485/-/Simba_Shirt_2_Mock_Up.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59545485/-/Simba_Shirt_2_Mock_Up.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[{"id":112859,"name":"simba","permalink":"simba","url":"/artist/simba"}],"categories":[{"id":2978277,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":5790353,"name":"simba logo t-shirt","permalink":"simba-t-shirt","position":4,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/simba-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-03-27T07:59:25.000Z","description":"yellow print on brown shirt.\r\nsize small-large made now!  : )\r\n","options":[{"id":18578133,"name":"small","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":18578135,"name":"medium","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":18578137,"name":"large","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/56842951/-/Simba_Shirt_Mock_Up-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/56842951/-/Simba_Shirt_Mock_Up-1.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[{"id":112859,"name":"simba","permalink":"simba","url":"/artist/simba"}],"categories":[{"id":2978277,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]}]
