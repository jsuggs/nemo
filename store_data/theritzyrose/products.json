I travel all over to find only the best pieces of jewelry to use in these bouquets. So many of these pieces have a story behind them. Each bouquet is one of a kind.\r\n\r\nThe small size measures about 5-6\" across at the widest point (18\" in circumference). It is a really great size for a destination wedding- carry it on safely to the beach! This size is also usually not too heavy. You will have this bouquet long after your wedding day is over. You can hand it down to your daughter to carry at her wedding. Or, pick out a few pieces from the bouquet and give them to your bridesmaids as gifts. Choose your favorite piece and add it to a chain to create a necklace that you can wear everyday (or contact me if you want me to create a custom piece of jewelry from your bouquet after the wedding). This will become an instant heirloom that you will treasure forever.\r\n\r\nI use pieces from my own collection, so you don't have to worry about finding them, unless you want to! Many brides send me their collections of jewelry from friends, family or their own flea-marketing. I will of course reduce the price if you use your own, so contact me if you're thinking about it. Some ideas for personal pieces, many of which I have ready in my studio... I can add a cross, a star of David, something patriotic, or an initial. You can even send me a piece of jewelry that is important to you (maybe you have one of your grandmother's brooches, your grandfather's military pins or a childhood locket), and I can place it front & center on the stem of the bouquet. \r\n\r\nWhen you see one of these in person, you will realize how much depth, texture and detail goes into it! I also like to add comical little touches such as a rubber bumble bee from a 1960s hat-maker's shop perched on a flower, or a butterfly that just landed on a leaf. The floral and rhinestone brooches date back to the 1920s, and include 30s pins, 40s, 50s and 60s era brooches. The art deco pieces are really gorgeous, and take on a completley modern look when I arrange them all together.\r\n\r\nIf you were inspired by Miranda Lambert's bouquet, you found the right designer! Ever since my bouquet made it into the news and all over wedding blogs, there are quite a few other shops popping up that make their version of my bouquets. Be sure to choose a designer who has a strong background in bridal and retail business, and make sure you see plenty of examples of their work!

Introducing the heart-shaped jewelry bouquet from The Ritzy Rose. This extra large bouquet is shaped like a heart and turns heads. If you like sparkle and bling, this is your bouquet! I was feeling particularly romantic with Valentine's Day around the corner, so I created this heart-shaped beauty.\r\n\r\nThis bouquet was sold to another bride, but I can recreate this for you in any combination of colors. The bouquet in the photos (taken by the talented Christa Kimble of Columbus, Ohio) was made of art deco brooches, dress clips, earrings, etc. It measures about 10-11\" from the top to the point. There are some dangling rhinestone earrings dripping from the point. I can use any color ribbon to wrap the stem.\r\n\r\nYou will have this bouquet long after your wedding day is over. You can hand it down to your daughter to carry at her wedding. Or, pick out a few pieces from the bouquet and give them to your bridesmaids as gifts. Choose your favorite piece and add it to a chain to create a necklace that you can wear everyday (or contact me if you want me to create a custom piece of jewelry from your bouquet after the wedding).
