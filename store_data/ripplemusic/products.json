Fen are clearly masters at the complementary meshing of instruments. Trails Out of Gloom is a brilliantly composed album that sounds half way between the cleaner moments of Opeth and Anathema, whilst also retaining its own unique identity. Fen provide a delightful presentation of mellow and erudite prog.\" -- Power Play Magazine issue #121\r\n \r\n “Dark and Aggressive.  If your tastes veer from Porcupine Tree to Tool, these could be trails worth exploring.” -- Geoff Barton, Classic Rock Magazine #146 \r\n\r\n\"Fen will pull you in and leave you wanting more!  Trails Out of Gloom creates textured melodies that always offer something different each time around.  Reminds me of what I like about progressive rock, it's ability to create songs that tell stories with their instruments as well as their words.  Doug Harrison has a wonderful voice.  Don't miss out on this release, it's one of the better examples of the style I've heard in quite some time.\"  -- Cosmos Gaming and Music\r\n \r\n\"Opening with the title track, an acoustic, folk-inflected lament, there are elements of Opeth in the stunning guitar playing, while the lush, warm tones recall latter-day Anathema although vocalist Doug Harrison has a wider vocal range than most, ranging from a stunning falsetto to the sombre tones more traditionally associated with this type of music. The production is top notch too, with the guitars kicking in with surprising depth and clarity.  Hints of Porcupine Tree as well as Soundgarden’s epic, psychedelic rock. It’s quite a ride, with the band showcasing a remarkable grip of dynamics, allowing the songs to grab you and draw you into their mighty ebb and flow. Ultimately ‘Trails out of Gloom’ is a ride through the many different moods of a band possessed of great talent. While many reference points abound, they are so many and so varied as to only offer brief glimpses of the wonders contained within the album and any fan of progressive music will be utterly captivated by Fen. Give it a try, you undoubtedly will not regret it \" --Sonic Abuse\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure that I'll do justice to this release. Vancouver's Fen effortlessly create smooth as silk melodies that will mesmerize your senses then grind out heavy, semi-fuzzed out passages with the same passion and skill. It's not just that they are creating moods, but rather that they are guiding them and us. Perhaps the band's greatest asset is their ability to get so much out of every step they take. Each note, beat and word that Fen create all have a purpose and as a listener you will feel that.  They are great at constructing and building these simple pieces together to make fantastic songs that unfold like masterful stories. Indeed this album is a grower. I liked it on the first play, but definitely like it more on each play. With each play I discovered more and more reasons to enjoy \"Trails out of Gloom\". -- Heavy Metal Time Machine\r\n \r\n  \"A rich and emotional ride into alternative heavy rock territories. A different type of heavy-- an emotional, dark, brooding heavy that evokes prime Alice in Chains and Tool with maybe a nod to bands such as Opeth and Anathema. Acoustic guitars pepper the whole album and add a beautiful counterpoint to the heavier moments such as tracks like \"The World is Young\" which switches from muscular despondency to delicate introspection. For every soaring vocal melody and ethereal guitar passage there is an equally heavy wall of doom waiting to explode. If this is prog it's prog in the classic sense where the song remains at the core of the sound over musical excess.  this is a remarkable album should you wish to remove yourself from your comfort zone and experience a different kind of heavy. Absorb it then listen again as repeated listens reveal the true depth here.\" -- Sleeping Shaman\r\n ","options":[{"id":7351471,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":13.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/24615804/-/Trails_Cover_web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/24615804/-/Trails_Cover_web.jpg","width":523,"height":470}],"artists":[{"id":43260,"name":"Fen","permalink":"fen","url":"/artist/fen"}],"categories":[{"id":478941,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":6578935,"name":"I Like Vinyl T-shirt (Black) ","permalink":"i-like-vinyl-t-shirt-black","position":25,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/i-like-vinyl-t-shirt-black","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-29T23:36:44.000Z","description":"Let the world know how you feel about it with the \"I Like Vinyl More Than I Like People\" T-shirt brought to you by none other than Ripple Music.

The Mos Generator frontman's new project, the two man Stone Axe, is essentially a ten song lesson on what The Riff was like when mutton chop'd giants walked the earth. Highlights? The whole album, really. While Reed does an impressive job making it seem like the work of a full band knocking out the songs live in the studio (he's credited with all instruments), Brinkerhoff also deserves praise for his vocals. He falls somewhere between Paul Rodgers and David Corverdale back when he was taking orders from Richie Blackmore. It's a powerful voice that's as soulful as it is gritty. You like Cream, Free, Thin Lizzy, The Faces, AC/DC, and Deep Purple? You'll enjoy the hell out of this impressive debut.\" -- Arzgarth (Stonerrock.com)\r\n\r\n\"Mos Generator frontman Tony Reed has released a very focused and to the point album with his new project. These guys lug out the massive sounds and they begin spinning them around, manipulating and pulling us with them. The music is basic at its core, but undeniably mesmerizing. Quite simply they know how to create the kind of music that celebrates the essence of what once made rock music great and craft the kind of guitar riffs that will pull in all who hear.\"  --  Heavy Metal Time Machine\r\n\r\n\"This is great modern classic rock\" - Get Read to Rock\r\n\r\n\"From the fertile mind and nimble fingers of Mos Generator riff-monger Tony Reed and former punk howler Dru Brinkerhoff, Washington-based groove-merchants Stone Axe pay tribute to classic 70s hard rock bands from Thin Lizzy to Leaf Hound.

There's no one better than Mighty High at making fun of wretched metal excess.  It's priceless.\"  -- Lucid Culture\r\n\r\n\"Stone Axe is pure old-school metal played with a power that is sadly rare these days.  Will leave you lusting for more if an ounce of rock and roll spirit throbs in your veins. Mighty High kick off a stoned punk squall that sounds like Queens of the Stone Age playing Rancid Covers.  Both tracks are well worth your time and money and it’s hard to imagine rock fans not wanting to track down at least one of the albums by these fantastic bands. Either way, with two bands of this quality on one release this is something of a must-have.\"-- Sonic Abuse\r\n\r\n\"Newcomers Ripple Music managed to get two highly explosive bands onto a 7\".   Stone Axe's \"Metal Damage\" has me thinking of pre-Stained class Judas Priest, the kind of mid-1970's metal where band's took their time and built up the sound with a steady boil of activity. Mighty High's \"Don't panic it's organic\" is even better. The main riff is huge and dripping with 1970's fuzzed out goodness. This is the perfect tune for playing about two minutes after 5:00 on a Friday. Both bands deliver the goods on this album.\" -- Metal Mark, Heavy Metal Time Machine\r\n\r\n\"Ripple Music have a gem on their hands. An awesome set of tunes. Stone Axe delivers the goods once again.“Metal Damage” is a throw back to classic Judas Priest from the later 70′s to early 80′s. The best duo around to preserving music from the 70′s.

Named by Classic Rock Magazine as on of the \"lost pioneers of Heavy Metal,\" Acid Blues is the White Man's Burden collects 7 tracks of of never before released manic riffing, intense jamming, and acidified blues, all recorded by JPT from the mid seventies to the early 2000's.   \r\n\r\nFeaturing the mind blowing guitar mastery of Terry Swope, this is a collection no fan of proto metal, psychedelic acid rock, or early 70's rock should miss.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Each track sizzles with nostalgia, with fuzzy guitars, gritty vocals, and extended jam sessions that instantly transport you to what feels like a Hendrix concert. Everything grooves in its own right. . .  will undoubtedly dazzle fans of classic blues rock. Terry Swope has got to be one of the world's most underrated guitarists!\r\nIf you miss the glory days of Cream, Deep Purple, and Jimi Hendrix, you have to check out these uncovered gems from JPT Scare Band.\"  -- Bill's Music Forum and the Rock and Roll Report. \r\n \r\n \r\n \"The trio veers between Cream and Grand Funk Railroad.\" -- Tom Harrison, Quick Spins, The Province Newspaper\r\n\r\n\"Acid Blues Is the White Man's Burden, seven lengthy psychedelic bluesy rock stompers (nine of the vinyl version) that come howling out of the speakers. This is Classic Rock from the Golden Age! Holds its own against their famous niche sharers, such as Cream, Ten Years After, Rory Gallagher and the mighty Led Zeppelin. Singer Swope has the swagger and the chops, and the rhythm tandem of Jeff Littrel and Grigsby are solid and smooth. It just goes to show that it's never too late to be recognized as an interesting chapter in the Big Book of Rawk.\" -- Here Comes the Flood\r\n\r\n\"A Gem to treasure.  Let the hypnotic music swirl around you.  For anyone who wishes to delve into the heritage of the current crop of stoner bands, this is an unmissible compilation.  Terry Swope rivals some of the day's greats including Clapton and Hendrix.   JPT Scare band are the unsung heroes of the cult rock scene and now they have decided to remind the world of their phenomenal abilities. \"Long Day,\" is fresh, a great introduction to the band.  Centerpiece \"Stone House Blues\" recalls the excellent Led Zeppelin at the BBC disc with it's loose and thundering bass.  \"I've Been Waiting\" has a riff so heavy it could be encased in lead.  Sits comfortably along side Black Sabbath.\"  -- Sonic Abuse\r\n\r\n\"Album of the Day!\" -  Roadburn.com\r\n\r\n\"Acid Blues is the White Man’s Burden is without question one of the most natural sounding and charismatic records I’ve heard this year. At once celebrating what they were and what they are in a way few bands can actually pull off convincingly. Littrell, Grigsby and Swope show remarkable chemistry. Swope’s leads are not to be understated. The soul in what he does is so up front it’ll bring a tear to your eye. JPT Scare Band are able to harness what made heavy ‘70s rock so influential without sounding like they’re ripping anyone off, including themselves.  If you’re not moved by the way these three players work together in the jammed-out last minutes of “I’ve Been Waiting,” you’re just not getting the point. Acid Blues is the White Man’s Burden might be a sleeper, but for those who discover it, it’s treasure.\" -- The Obelisk\r\n\r\n\"Compiled from studio outtakes spanning over 35 years, that this album hangs together so coherently and is wall to wall with the highest quality tuneage is a testament to just how incredible this band really is. An orgasmic display of sonic abuse from guitarist Terry Swope. Fuck me, this guy is a lost gem!!!

Named by Classic Rock Magazine as on of the \"lost pioneers of Heavy Metal,\" Acid Blues is the White Man's Burden collects 9 tracks of of never before released manic riffing, intense jamming, and acidified blues, all recorded by JPT from the mid seventies to the early 2000's. Includes download code. \r\n\r\nFeaturing the mind blowing guitar mastery of Terry Swope, this is a collection no fan of proto metal, psychedelic acid rock, or early 70's rock should miss.\r\n\r\nAll on glorious double 12\" multi-colored vinyl with bonus tracks unavailable anywhere else! \r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Each track sizzles with nostalgia, with fuzzy guitars, gritty vocals, and extended jam sessions that instantly transport you to what feels like a Hendrix concert. Everything grooves in its own right. . .  will undoubtedly dazzle fans of classic blues rock. Terry Swope has got to be one of the world's most underrated guitarists!\r\nIf you miss the glory days of Cream, Deep Purple, and Jimi Hendrix, you have to check out these uncovered gems from JPT Scare Band.\"  -- Bill's Music Forum and the Rock and Roll Report. \r\n \r\n \r\n \"The trio veers between Cream and Grand Funk Railroad.\" -- Tom Harrison, Quick Spins, The Province Newspaper\r\n\r\n\"Acid Blues Is the White Man's Burden, seven lengthy psychedelic bluesy rock stompers (nine of the vinyl version) that come howling out of the speakers. This is Classic Rock from the Golden Age! Holds its own against their famous niche sharers, such as Cream, Ten Years After, Rory Gallagher and the mighty Led Zeppelin. Singer Swope has the swagger and the chops, and the rhythm tandem of Jeff Littrel and Grigsby are solid and smooth. It just goes to show that it's never too late to be recognized as an interesting chapter in the Big Book of Rawk.\" -- Here Comes the Flood\r\n\r\n\"A Gem to treasure.  Let the hypnotic music swirl around you.  For anyone who wishes to delve into the heritage of the current crop of stoner bands, this is an unmissible compilation.  Terry Swope rivals some of the day's greats including Clapton and Hendrix.   JPT Scare band are the unsung heroes of the cult rock scene and now they have decided to remind the world of their phenomenal abilities. \"Long Day,\" is fresh, a great introduction to the band.  Centerpiece \"Stone House Blues\" recalls the excellent Led Zeppelin at the BBC disc with it's loose and thundering bass.  \"I've Been Waiting\" has a riff so heavy it could be encased in lead.  Sits comfortably along side Black Sabbath.\"  -- Sonic Abuse\r\n\r\n\"Album of the Day!\" -  Roadburn.com\r\n\r\n\"Acid Blues is the White Man’s Burden is without question one of the most natural sounding and charismatic records I’ve heard this year. At once celebrating what they were and what they are in a way few bands can actually pull off convincingly. Littrell, Grigsby and Swope show remarkable chemistry. Swope’s leads are not to be understated. The soul in what he does is so up front it’ll bring a tear to your eye. JPT Scare Band are able to harness what made heavy ‘70s rock so influential without sounding like they’re ripping anyone off, including themselves.  If you’re not moved by the way these three players work together in the jammed-out last minutes of “I’ve Been Waiting,” you’re just not getting the point. Acid Blues is the White Man’s Burden might be a sleeper, but for those who discover it, it’s treasure.\" -- The Obelisk\r\n\r\n\"Compiled from studio outtakes spanning over 35 years, that this album hangs together so coherently and is wall to wall with the highest quality tuneage is a testament to just how incredible this band really is. An orgasmic display of sonic abuse from guitarist Terry Swope. Fuck me, this guy is a lost gem!!! Blazing with a technique that would make most big haired 80's shredders shit their pants but grooving with a feel that would make Billy Gibbons weep, Swope lays on note after note of pure class. This is certainly no one man band though, bassist Paul Grigsby lays down such a filthy groove that you want to take a shower afterwards and drummer Jeff Litrell swings like an aging virgin's nut sack!!!

The album features 12 tracks that range from blues to bluegrass to jazz to funk and it’s all wrapped in a neat package of Americana, extended jam-oriented rock. Refuge marks the third full-length release from the band and this fine crafted set of music is available in digipak CD and digital formats. \r\n\r\nFeatures the chart topping single, \"Don't Waste\"\r\n\r\n\"Seriously, these guys have so much soul that I can get jiggy wit, as well as tap my toe hard on that wooden floor at the pub in unison with the rhythm.  There’s also enough funk to bring down the house, and I’ll be damned, this Todd Goodnough is a rockstar – he’s got the voice, and he’s got excellent riffs!  I love the hybrid of genres MODERN DAY MOONSHINE unleashes on their latest release, Refuge, which is out now via our like-minded musical bros at Ripple Music.  Listening to Refuge, I’m picturing Bob Dylan having a casual drink with Miles Davis and Led Zeppelin, and Jim Croce comes to join the party, taking an extra pair of cigarettes out of his t-shirt sleeve. If you’re looking for classic rock fused with the good ol’ blues plus plenty of flare, go out and buy some MODERN DAY MOONSHINE.  These guys have something going on, and though classic rock as a definition is mostly looked at in the 60’s and 70’s, let’s go ahead and squeeze MODERN DAY MOONSHINE in there!  Promise it will be less harmful than the moonshine of the past, but may be more infectious.-- All About the Music\r\n\r\n\"'Unsung\"  kicks off acoustically then, when the 3 piece get going it hints at touches of CSN&Y. \"Expiration Date\" picks things up, as does \"Don't 'Waste\", which hints at the soft side of Allman Brothers or Grateful Dead.
