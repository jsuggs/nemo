Because each one is hand folded, there will be slight variations in the details. \r\n\r\nThe crane, or \"tsuru\" is a classic origami design, unchanged for centuries. Its often the first animal many folders learn, and is considered a symbol of good luck and wishes granted. Paper cranes are given to people who are sick to wish them a good recovery, or left at cemetaries or memorials as a wish for peace.\r\n\r\nThe classic origami crane is folded from a square sheet of paper, using only 19 folds. Now imagine starting with a square sheet of fine silver only 1 1/2 inches across, and you get this tiny work of art.\r\n\r\nThis crane is carefully folded from .999 fine silver, kiln fired, and highly polished. Its just barely 1 inch wide from wingtip to wingtip, or from nose to tail. Comes with an 18\" sterling silver chain.","options":[{"id":9838818,"name":"Default","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27211042/-/bigcrane.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27211042/-/bigcrane.jpg","width":997,"height":999}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1670832,"name":"Pendants","permalink":"pendants","url":"/category/pendants"}]},{"id":2816505,"name":"Silver Origami Cat Earrings","permalink":"silver-origami-cat-earrings","position":2,"price":30.0,"default_price":30.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/silver-origami-cat-earrings","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-10-23T00:00:39.000Z","description":"The origami kitties have been so popular, I decided to shrink them down to earring size.
