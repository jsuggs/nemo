Most songs are carried by their combination of drum & organ/piano. Think church, think the circus, think a cabaret. Their proposed effect is one of thunder & lightening behind an orotund voice, in a narrative that puts a subject against God before a final juxtaposition that more often than not is a rebuke against the character and his human view of love and spiritual insight. This formula of recondite disclosure is both sincere and sardonic. Their lyrics read like a play, or a prayer. Their influences include older folk/rock gothic outfits like the Bad Seeds, the Violent Femmes the Cramps, and the mind of Tom Waits. An accessible, modern categorization of Darlings’ could put them aside acts like the Horrors or the Dresden Dolls. What may be lost, in review, is this… Darlings’ Cabinet of Sundry Horror is fun. Fun, and sexy, and worth a listen. Start with ‘Devils! Prophets! Blind Men! Ghosts!’ or ‘I am the blackest of plagues’ (their singular guitar track).\r\n","options":[{"id":895718,"name":"n/a","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1396140/-/darlingspins.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1396140/-/darlingspins.png","width":339,"height":408}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":164691,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":202962,"name":"Pins & Sticker combo","permalink":"pins-sticker-combo","position":2,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pins-sticker-combo","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2008-12-13T21:14:55.000Z","description":"3 limited edition pins and a sticker from yours truly,\r\nDarlings' Cabinet of Sundry Horror!\r\nPick some up before they run out!","options":[{"id":895661,"name":"n/a","price":3.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1395976/-/darlingspins.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1395976/-/darlingspins.jpg","width":339,"height":408}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
