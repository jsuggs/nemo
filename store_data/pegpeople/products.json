All characters are made from dolly pegs and come packaged in a box which expands into a stable, with a guiding star. \r\n\r\nAt present, the Peg Nativities are made to order and so it may be up to a week after an order is placed before the nativity is dispatched.","options":[{"id":9480045,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25954503/-/Peg_Nativity.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25954503/-/Peg_Nativity.jpg","width":850,"height":498}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1607767,"name":"Peg People Sets","permalink":"peg-people-sets","url":"/category/peg-people-sets"}]}]
