The cast–a cynical, deliberately male-repellant woman; a young man who invokes memories of his lover through scents; an unorthodox collector who finds the diary of an unorthodox man; and a flock of other delightful eccentrics–look for happiness through their solitude:\r\n\r\nAn unnamed writer narrates his story as he battles to stay true to his calling despite the odds… a dejected man journeys to seek his heart’s desire in the workroom of a powerful crone… and an art prodigy discovers what it means to experience his most coveted luxury.\r\n\r\nEnchanting and poetic, with a balanced brew of melancholy and humor, All Things Blue is a metaphor for impermanence. Loneliness–the stronger universal emotion that ultimately binds us–is just as temporary as bliss.","options":[{"id":16983637,"name":"Default","price":1.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/51459835/-/cover_7_small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/51459835/-/cover_7_small.jpg","width":364,"height":520}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2791171,"name":"ebook","permalink":"ebook","url":"/category/ebook"},{"id":2791173,"name":"fiction","permalink":"fiction","url":"/category/fiction"},{"id":2791175,"name":"short stories","permalink":"short-stories","url":"/category/short-stories"},{"id":2791177,"name":"literary collection","permalink":"literary-collection","url":"/category/literary-collection"}]}]
