The controller can measure the Voltage and Current in real time and display them on the LCD.  The controller has three displays modes. The display shows  also the state of the controller which are :  CHG for charging state , FLT for Float state.  It also displays battery health : Battery Low, Battery Normal , Battery Full.  On the main display the charged capacity is shown. The controller  uses minimum current to manage the LCD backlight. The backlight  fades to minimum after 2 minutes. A button can restore maximum back light which dims back to minimum to minimize energy consumption.\r\n\r\nThe controller Keypad  can be used to set-up the controller, or else toggle the display modes. The controller has also a current limit feature which works by limiting the total current being charged to the battery and disconnecting the input voltage to regulate it. The user can set any current between 1 to 30 amp.\r\n\r\nDisplay Screens \r\n\r\n1: \r\nShows voltage , current, Battery State, controller state, charge capacity.\r\n\r\n2:\r\nShows voltage and calculated power and the controller state\r\n\r\n3:\r\nShow current and  calculated power and the controller state\r\n\r\nCurrent : Displays  currents up to 30 Amp \r\nVoltage : Displays  Battery Voltage   ( 12v version ) \r\nLcd  Backight circuit fades to minimum to save energy.\r\nPower Mosfet  9 Amp to switch a power relay to change state charge/Float\r\nHas built in state thresholds.
