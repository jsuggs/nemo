Each of the 16 lighthearted designs reflects Anni’s favorite things—relaxing at home, shopping, traveling, and of course, sewing. Her passion for hand stitching plays a fanciful role in most all the projects with her signature quirky embroidery designs.\r\n\r\nAmong the projects are three charming quilts as well as a pillow, table runner, and other decorative accessories to warm your everyday surroundings. Whether you’re running to the local mall or traveling abroad, Anni’s handy bag, coin purse, and travel document holder will keep everything in its place. And every quilter can use Anni’s delightful pincushion, needle book, and sewing case to keep his or her sewing accessories organized!\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":20547653,"name":"Default","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63410645/-/Some_Kind_of_Wonderful.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63410645/-/Some_Kind_of_Wonderful.jpg","width":200,"height":256}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3343643,"name":"Hatched and Patched - Anni Downs","permalink":"hatched-and-patched-anni-downs","url":"/category/hatched-and-patched-anni-downs"}]},{"id":4913349,"name":"Issue 8 - Vignette - PRE-ORDER","permalink":"issue-5-vignette","position":2,"price":17.5,"default_price":17.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/issue-5-vignette","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-23T08:25:17.000Z","description":"Information for Issue 8 is unavailable at this moment ... information should be available very soon.\r\n \r\nVignette is Leanne Beasley's wonderful new magazine.\r\n \r\nThis beautiful magazine has lovely stitchery projects and part 13 & 16 of 'Vignette in Stitches' which is a 9 block mystery quilt, plus much more ... this I will leave as a surprise!\r\n \r\nThis is a must have for any Leanne's House fan.\r\n \r\nMy special price for Vignette is $17.50, not the RRP $17.95.\r\n \r\nFREE postage for this item within Australia.\r\n \r\nPostage rate for New Zealand, Singapore are quoted.
