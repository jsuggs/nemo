On the strength of his debut EP, Tree,Kazerouni found a community of musicians at famed underground venues like the Smell and Pehrspace and recruited a band of scene veterans including Erik Felix, Geoff Geis, and Frank Maston. As a four-piece, the band has become a centerpiece of LA’s vibrant DIY scene, recently representing the “new class” at the Smell’s sold out 14th Anniversary show with Best Coast and Abe Vigoda. A staple of Southern California college radio since the 2009 release of “Fly a Kite,” So Many Wizards earned airplay on BBC 1 with the 2011 single “Inner City” and was subsequently invited to tour the UK in March of 2012. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>TRACK LISTING:</b> \r\n1.
