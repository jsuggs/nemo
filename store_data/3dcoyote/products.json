Here Peyote Tapes present a live recording of the ladies delivering a caustic and droning set at Titwrench, Denver CO’s all girl noise festival. Layers and layers of static, square waves and bass buzz converge into one blasting miasma of ur-woman sound. Indian Weapons are Oklahoma’s Brad Rose and Nathan Young churning wave after wave of blossoming organic vibration. Much like the duo’s previous work in Ajilvsga in that it’s heavy and intense, but rather than noise synth blast that is Ajilvsga’s modus operandi, Indian Weapons are more electro-acoustic and definitely more neon than dark.
