x 24\"\r\nAcrylic, spray-paint, and enamel on wood\r\n2013\r\n\r\n\r\nNalini ‘Deedee’ Cheriel is a visual artist who started out creating record covers and T-shirts for the Oregon music scene in the early ‘90s.  Born in the hippie town of Eugene, Oregon, she began her own band and record label at the age of 19.  Influenced by the popular DIY culture of that time, she played in several all-girl bands (Juned, Adickdid, The Teenangels, The Hindi Guns) and co-created the semi-autobiographical film Down and Out with the Dolls. This artist has lived and studied abroad: Honduras, Chile, England, Portugal, Spain and her native India.\r\n\r\nNow residing in Los Angeles, Cheriel’s work explores narratives that recognize the urgency and conflict in our continuing attempts to connect to the world.  With influences derived from such opposites as East Indian temple imagery, punk rock, and her Pacific Northwest natural environment, her images are indications of how we try to connect ourselves to others and how these satirical and heroic efforts are episodes of compassion and discomfort.  Bold elements drawn from landscapes -both urban and natural- and pop culture suggest the ability to find commonalities and relationships between ourselves and our surroundings that inevitably confirm our greater humanity and quest towards love.\r\n\r\nLearn more about Deedee Cheriel here: http://deedeecheriel.com","options":[{"id":42837138,"name":"Default","price":1375.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123852630/-/photo_(62).JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123852630/-/photo_(62).JPG","width":1008,"height":1332}],"artists":[{"id":143931,"name":"Deedee Cheriel","permalink":"deedee-cheriel","url":"/artist/deedee-cheriel"}],"categories":[{"id":3506235,"name":"Art","permalink":"art","url":"/category/art"}]},{"id":13457955,"name":"CONE BELL (TAN)","permalink":"cone-bell-tan","position":61,"price":100.0,"default_price":100.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cone-bell-tan","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-09T18:26:13.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":43081341,"name":"Default","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124034475/-/photo_2.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124034475/-/photo_2.JPG","width":480,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124034463/-/photo_1.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124034463/-/photo_1.JPG","width":376,"height":629}],"artists":[{"id":136427,"name":"Mt.

They are really, really cool. It ain’t great for the health of your hair and scalp to wash your hair every day, dry shampoo absorbs oil and add body so ‘no shower day’ can be ‘awesome hair day’. Yet upon inspection of the dry shampoos out there on the shelf, even the products deeming themselves ‘natural’ are loaded with aluminum. Applying aluminum to your armpits is bad, but to your head- where your brain lives, is just stupid. And breathing aluminum powder in? Faa-get about it.\r\n\r\nAny powder you are applying that close to your grill should damn well be edible. I’ve been experimenting with just the right proportions of starch to cocoa to clay for months. The cocoa adds a yum smell and adds a little color so your hair doesn’t look dull and powdery, and the starch and clay absorb oil. The light brown color will work with all hair shades. A little lavender essential oil promotes a healthy scalp. Beware, the combination of lavender and chocolate may send you on a expensive chocolate bar binge.\r\nTo use, dip a make up brush into the powder and tap off the excess. Part your hair at it’s oiliest sections and apply the powder using the brush. You may want to wrap a towel around your shoulders as not to get powders on you threads. Once you’ve applied the powder to your satisfaction, turn your head upside don and brush through. Viola! You are now a chocolate crowned goddess/god!\r\n2 oz will last you a long time, even with regular use.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\ncocoa powder*, arrowroot starch*, kaolin clay, lavender essential oil*","options":[{"id":32861083,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103112008/-/hair.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103112008/-/hair.jpg","width":925,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":193150,"name":"Fat & the Moon","permalink":"fat-the-moon","url":"/artist/fat-the-moon"}],"categories":[{"id":3506233,"name":"House","permalink":"house","url":"/category/house"}]},{"id":10497880,"name":"Shibori pillow 1","permalink":"shibori-pillow-1","position":124,"price":125.0,"default_price":125.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/shibori-pillow-1","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-12T02:28:42.000Z","description":"Hand dyed with natural indigo using Japanese shibori clamp and resist techniques.\r\n\r\nIncludes feather/down insert (lofty 95% feather / 5% down fill).\r\n\r\nSewn with same cloth piping and an invisible zipper.\r\n\r\n20 inches by 20 inches","options":[{"id":32889052,"name":"Default","price":125.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/115496568/-/1003431_468078126601556_1447803815_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/115496568/-/1003431_468078126601556_1447803815_n.jpg","width":612,"height":612},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103196632/-/photo_2.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103196632/-/photo_2.JPG","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[{"id":193207,"name":"Folk Fibers","permalink":"folk-fibers","url":"/artist/folk-fibers"}],"categories":[{"id":3506233,"name":"House","permalink":"house","url":"/category/house"}]},{"id":7804725,"name":"HAND DYED QUILT (twin)","permalink":"hand-dyed-quilt","position":125,"price":1800.0,"default_price":1800.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/hand-dyed-quilt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-02T23:02:02.000Z","description":"Ashley Thayer makes hand dyed textiles and quilts using various dye techniques.
