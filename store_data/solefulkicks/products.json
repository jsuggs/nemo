Having originally released back in 2000, you sneakerheads may recall that that time period was home to the Air Jordan V’s OG retro run. In using MJ’s High School as the muse for the color combo, this particular pair of V’s is regarded as one of the most popular non-OG colorways to have hit the sneaker scene. Staying true to its original roots, this upcoming release looks just as good now as it did some 13 years ago. \r\n\r\nEquipped with a crisp tumbled leather upper, the infamous touches of varsity maize and royal lay comfortably about the accents. What better way for Jordan Brand to kick off the month of November then by re-releasing this bonafide classic motif. With over a decade in the books, it’s about time JB dug a little deeper into their sneaker reserves and showed some love to a pair of kicks that haven’t released in a long time.

As of late Jordan Brand has been more and more dedicated to the story telling aspect of their various retro offerings. In 2013 we had that timely release of the Air Jordan III ’88 Retro on the 25th anniversary of Michael’s legendary Dunk Contest performance in those shoes. Last year the Air Jordan IX “Kilroy Pack” built off the Johnny Kilroy persona to create six separate sneakers revolving around the idea of alternate personalities for Michael Jordan. Earlier on in the same year they served up an Air Jordan IV in an old-school Cleveland Cavs colorway as a nod to “The Shot” that was put up in the face of one Craig Ehlo. Since the Air Jordan line is such a cultural phenomenon, there are plenty more stories to tell beyond those of Michael’s actions and achievements in the shoes, but this upcoming release points to a specific era of influential  fashion and style that even the most modern trends can’t seem to shake.\r\n\r\nThis brand new Air Jordan 5 release is one that takes a look at the rich history of Jordan Brand in a completely different context. The colorway in place is oriented to the decade that they arrived in and the colorful prints and patterns most closely associated with those times. Keep in mind that the Air Jordan 5 could often be spotted on the feet of many more celebs than just Mike, causing them to also be linked in peoples’ memory with a couple of actors of the day and their associated projects (Which is the origin on the unofficial “Bel Air” nickname in this case). The innards of the shoe feature some West Coast inspired graphics that stick to the florescent end of the spectrum, with the outer planting plenty more of those tones into the accents that pop off the cool grey upper.","options":[{"id":45113016,"name":"Size 2.5Y","price":99.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125674536/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125674536/-/image.jpg","width":704,"height":553},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125674578/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125674578/-/image.jpg","width":480,"height":350}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5460045,"name":"Air Jordan","permalink":"air-jordan","url":"/category/air-jordan"}]},{"id":13835241,"name":"Air Jordan 3 Retro Bright Crimson","permalink":"air-jordan-3-retro-bright-crimson","position":14,"price":159.0,"default_price":159.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/air-jordan-3-retro-bright-crimson","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-28T00:08:10.000Z","description":"The Jordan Retro III “Bright Crimson” is named after the bright crimson color that is featured on the shoe’s midsole and branding.
