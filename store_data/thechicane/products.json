For some, though, part of the romance died when the engine moved behind the driver. \r\n\r\nThe 1950s was a magnificent period of Formula 1 history. The cars were tough. The drivers were tough. The adventuring spirit of an earlier age carried through with these magnificent drivers listed here.\r\n\r\nHard to argue with these names: Ascari. Fangio. Hawthorne. Moss.\r\n\r\nThere's almost no point in choosing a favorite—the magic was in the collection of skill, daring, and spirit they brought to an entire era. Celebrate them all.\r\n\r\nVintage fit burgundy t-shirt made and printed in USA.\r\n\r\nSold out of your size? <a href=\"mailto:harlo@thechicaneblog.com?subject=Legends T-Shirt reprint request\">Request a reprint</a> of this shirt.","options":[{"id":39322770,"name":"M","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39322773,"name":"L","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39322776,"name":"XL","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39322779,"name":"2X","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121349337/-/legends50s4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121349337/-/legends50s4.jpg","width":434,"height":392},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121349334/-/legends50s3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121349334/-/legends50s3.jpg","width":434,"height":392},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121349331/-/legends50s.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121349331/-/legends50s.jpg","width":434,"height":392}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":861851,"name":"T-Shirts","permalink":"t-shirts","url":"/category/t-shirts"}]},{"id":2813879,"name":"Legends of the 60s","permalink":"legends-of-the-60s","position":6,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/legends-of-the-60s","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-10-21T18:44:52.000Z","description":"Phil or Graham.
