Volcanoes erupt with hot magma that needs to escape from below the earth’s surface. The heat is unbearable yet lava is beautiful to view. Many people think of words to escape situations they know they must deal with. There is no form of escapism compared to the eruption of a Volcano. \r\n\r\n                                         Author Biography\r\nJamila Garrett is a native Washingtonian. Jamila began writing at age six and has continued this legacy over the years. Her love of fashion and literacy inspired her to include images that represent selected poems. She began creating the World Element Collection with her first book, Hurricane of Butterflies (AIR). Volcano (FIRE) is part two of the collection which will be followed by the remaining elements of the world: EARTH and WATER.
