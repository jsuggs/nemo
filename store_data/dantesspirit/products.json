This is an all natural, undyed, rare rose grey alpaca yarn, blended with just enough wool to add strength. THe result is a gorgeously soft yarn with a difinitive rose hue to it. \r\n\r\nThe centerpiece is a stunning raku fired, Lisa Peters ART button, from her 'Rusty & Crusty' line. The faint rose and light green tones blend beautifully with the kumihimo cord, while provinding just enough contrast to stand out. \r\n\r\nThe ends of this lovely cuff have been hand beaded in peyote stitch with Delicas in Matte Metallic Rainbow Turquoise/Light Green, again providing contrast against the kumihimo while drawing out the green hues in the raku button. \r\n\r\nAll handbeaded done with 6lb FireLine for strength and durability. \r\n\r\n <a href=\"http://dantesspirit.bigcartel.com/products\"> SHOP MORE HERE</a>","options":[{"id":45756186,"name":"Default","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":7.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125841996/-/100_3855.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125841996/-/100_3855.JPG","width":534,"height":450},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125841984/-/100_3852.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125841984/-/100_3852.JPG","width":450,"height":565},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125841999/-/100_3856.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125841999/-/100_3856.JPG","width":492,"height":450},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125841987/-/100_3853.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125841987/-/100_3853.JPG","width":454,"height":450},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125841993/-/100_3854.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125841993/-/100_3854.JPG","width":600,"height":450}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1652191,"name":"Kumihimo Cuffs/Bracelets","permalink":"kumihimo-cuffs-bracelets","url":"/category/kumihimo-cuffs-bracelets"}]},{"id":13357602,"name":"Fall Leaves, handmade kumihimo cuff","permalink":"fall-leaves-handmade-kumihimo-cuff","position":63,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fall-leaves-handmade-kumihimo-cuff","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-04T16:06:15.000Z","description":"Fall Leaves\r\nKumihimo cuff with beadwork\r\n5\" long x 1\" wide\r\n\r\nFits wrists 5\" to 7\" via extension chain\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * \r\n\r\nFall Leaves is a handmade, 24 strand kumihimo cuff, using 100% pima cotton yarn that was hand dyed in rich autumn colors of brown, rusty oranges and old yellows. \r\n\r\nThis piece has been handbeaded, in peyote stitch, across the ends with a mix of Czech glass seed reds in dark reds, deep oranges, bright oranges and vibrant yellows, in a mixture of opaque, transparent, silver lined and iridescent finishes. \r\n\r\nIt features 4 Czech pressed glass leaves in transparent brown, with gold veining, securely attached to the cuff itself via 8lb FireLine. \r\n\r\nThe clasp is a copper lobster claw and a handmade copper extension chain, ending in a sterling silver ball.
