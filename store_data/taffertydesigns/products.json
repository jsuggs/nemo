I used a gorgeous yarn that is a hand-dyed 100% lambswool that gives this unique one-of-a-kind rainbow effect. It is soft and it is warm, so it will keep your doll warm and cosy. I made it using a stitch that is hardly used these days. So trust me, you are unlikely to see many of these around. The tassels give it that bit of flare. The top edge has been left bare so that the tassels don’t get in your doll’s face. He or she might have a sneezing fit if they went up their nose! The yarn is a little fussy in that it prefers hand-washing. You only need to soak it for an hour or so in gentle detergent, rinse it and it will be nice and clean again. Never iron this and never tumble-dry it. It will get a bit grumpy and lose its shape. Now, we wouldn’t want that now, would we? \r\n\r\nSIZE:\r\nThis blanket measures 15” x 18” excluding the tassels, and will therefore be suitable for dolls from 10 inches tall all the way up to 18 inches tall. \r\n\r\nAVAILABILITY\r\nThis blanket will be made to order. Please allow 3-4 weeks for your blanket to me completed. \r\n\r\nComes from a smoke-free, pet-free studio.","options":[{"id":17980361,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54853237/-/rainbow_doll_blankets.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54853237/-/rainbow_doll_blankets.jpg","width":960,"height":720}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1631290,"name":"Doll Clothing and Accessories","permalink":"doll-clothing-and-accessories","url":"/category/doll-clothing-and-accessories"}]},{"id":5587253,"name":"SMALL Blood Red Roses Flower Garden Tea Cosy - Pure Wool - Cream Base","permalink":"listing-toolsedit-renew-promotecopy-deactivate-delete-stats-tea-for-one-blood-red-roses-flower-garde","position":2,"price":16.0,"default_price":16.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/listing-toolsedit-renew-promotecopy-deactivate-delete-stats-tea-for-one-blood-red-roses-flower-garde","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-03-01T07:16:18.000Z","description":"This is a lovely handknitted tea cosy in an ivory colour, decorated with crocheted deep red flowers and green leaves. The perfect gift for someone special or just for a special pot of tea any day. Great gift idea for the keen gardener, those into nature, those who love flowers and anyone who just likes pretty things! It makes a fantastic kitchen decoration as well as the perfect thing to keep your tea hot for longer. \r\n\r\nI make it using pure wool and is therefore nice and thick and will keep your tea hot for longer. The ribbed design is based on a vintage pattern but I have added my own personal touch of the arrangement of the flowers and leaves, which makes it very different from similar cosies on the market and therefore really unique.\r\n\r\nFits SMALL (1-2 cup) teapot. \r\n\r\nComes from a clean, pet-free and smoke-free home. \r\n\r\nAVAILABILITY:\r\nThis tea cosy is made to order.

It’s hand-knitted using a yarn of beautiful quality that is a luxuriously soft mixture of alpaca and pure wool. The alpaca gives it the distinctive fuzzy texture and since the yarns are natural fibres, they are so soft and a lovely to the touch. The sweater features cables, which I am a huge fan of, bobbles and diamonds. There are wooden buttons at the back, so that you don't have to stretch the neck when dressing your doll. This will look great on both boy dolls and girl dolls! :-) I really love making these sweaters, and I think that this is the stuff doll dreams are made of! :-)\r\n\r\n*NB: Due to the sweater having buttons, it is not intended for children under the age of three years*\r\n\r\nSIZE:\r\nThis will fit most 15-16\" dolls with measurements similar to those of Bamboletta dolls and Dragonflys Hollow Dolls (pictured). \r\n\r\nAVAILABILITY:\r\nThis sweater is ready to ship and will be shipped on the next working day.\r\n\r\nComes from a smoke-free, pet-free studio.\r\n\r\nWant to keep in touch?
