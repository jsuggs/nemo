By incorporating a unique multi-directional collimator specifically designed for cycling, the CherryBomb maximizes visibility by dispersing light to the sides of the rider as well as to the rear, effectively eliminating blind spots to upcoming automobiles. To further rider safety and visibility, the CherryBomb employs a custom made, built in reflector which allows the rider to be night time visible even when the taillight is in the off position. Clip and bike mounts are included, for flexible mounting options.

The large copper rivets at the nose and tail are also hammered by hand, commensurate with our usual high level of attention to detail. As is the case with all of our hand manufactured saddles, the Swift proudly sports a metal nameplate at the rear, and in addition two embossed graphic details on the sides featuring the saddle name and incorporating an icon of a Swift in flight.\r\nOn introduction the Swift was offered only with lightweight titanium rails.

The Wind is built using the most long-lived trainer technology out there: A weighted metal fan blade generates wind resistance as you pedal. The resistance is variable and it builds at a progressive rate with increased wheel speed. Just like riding on the road, gear down and you can spin on your rest days. If you want to suffer, grab the big ring and mash the pedals. At 30mph wheel speeds, the CycleOps Wind Trainer will generate in excess of 600+ watts of resistance.\r\n\r\nThe Wind Trainer is foldable and stows away easily. The rubber coated base pads are adjustable to level out crooked basement floors. The quick release locking mechanism can be adjusted to accommodate both mountain and road bikes. One practical note: Compared to Cycleops' other trainer models, the Wind Trainer generates more noise when you're riding it. If keeping things quiet when you train indoors is a priority, you should consider Cycleops' other models. It comes with a Race Day Training DVD to help get you started.","options":[{"id":13042528,"name":"Default","price":174.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38200788/-/12690_i_1.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38200788/-/12690_i_1.jpeg","width":300,"height":204}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2169292,"name":"Nutrition & Training","permalink":"nutrition-training","url":"/category/nutrition-training"}]},{"id":3916920,"name":"Voyager Deluxe Kids Seat","permalink":"voyager-deluxe-kids-seat","position":141,"price":134.9,"default_price":134.9,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/voyager-deluxe-kids-seat","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-06-13T23:12:01.000Z","description":"-3 position reclining seat, with a steel quick-release locking mechanism\r\n-Fully Adjustable footrests\r\n-Adjustable headrest, slightly offset to make way for child's helmet\r\n-High headrest with padded handles\r\n-Tubular alloy rack included\r\n-Removable and washable seat cover, 2 compartments under the seat\r\n-For kids up to 22kg","options":[{"id":13036518,"name":"Default","price":134.9,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38183948/-/830002.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38183948/-/830002.jpeg","width":900,"height":900}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2169388,"name":"Bikes - Kids","permalink":"bikes-kids","url":"/category/bikes-kids"},{"id":2167248,"name":"Accessories","permalink":"accessories","url":"/category/accessories"}]},{"id":3918794,"name":"Alan Peter-Klaus 2 Frameset","permalink":"alan-peter-klaus-2","position":142,"price":1599.99,"default_price":1599.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/alan-peter-klaus-2","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-06-14T04:03:44.000Z","description":"With over 20 World Championships to its name, the Peter-Klaus 2 is a proven cross racing machine.
