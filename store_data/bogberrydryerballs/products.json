The new heroes of the laundry room reduce drying time, wrinkles, and static, soften clothes naturally- keep harmful chemicals off of your family's laundry, and dryer sheets out of landfills.\r\n\r\nWhen not in use, display them in a basket or bowl on the table for a beautiful, tactile ( and non breakable!) accent. Apply essential oils and you have a lovely, soft scent diffuser, throw them in a bucket in the kids room and they'll be rolling these soft, bouncy, colorful balls under the couch in no time :) \r\n\r\nThe value in these dryer balls goes beyond the money you won't be spending on dryer sheets, and the savings on each month's electric bill ( or the quarters you won't be shelling out at the laundromat!) They're an investment in our planet, in the small family farms that this wool is sourced from, and in the health of your family. \r\n\r\nUnlike other dryer balls, Bog Berry dryer balls are NOT made of yarn, which eventually unravels . Bog Berry dryer balls are needle felted, and then wet felted. They take a little longer to make, but they are the best quality and will last you all of your laundry doing years. \r\n\r\nThese felted wool dryer balls are made with a core of beautiful, freshly carded wool batting sourced from a family farm in Lancaster County, PA. The colored sets are made with additional wool purchased from a small, eco-friendly company in Maine.\r\n\r\nThe colors in this range are the rich, saturated reds, golds, yellows, oranges and burgundies of the autumn with a deep ,bright hot pink thrown in for fun..\r\n\r\nEach dryer ball is roughly the size of a tennis ball and weighs approximately .5 oz","options":[{"id":41031141,"name":"regular size","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":41031144,"name":"extra large ","price":72.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122542629/-/maybe_3.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122542629/-/maybe_3.JPG","width":3264,"height":2448}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5043223,"name":"Dryer Balls","permalink":"dryer-balls","url":"/category/dryer-balls"}]},{"id":10486450,"name":"Wool Dryer Balls, 6 plummy purples FREE SHIPPING TO USA","permalink":"wool-dryer-balls-6-plummy-purples","position":2,"price":36.0,"default_price":36.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wool-dryer-balls-6-plummy-purples","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-11T16:45:44.000Z","description":"Felted wool dryer balls COMPLETELY REPLACE toxic dryer sheets.
