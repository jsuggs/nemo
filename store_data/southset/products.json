A bundle of five arrows represented the five founding tribes of the Iroquois League. To the Navajo, flint is a sacred stone and arrowheads are said to resemble the tips of lightning bolts thrown by Thunder. Sioux lore tells of Unktomi Tanka (a big spider) who spent his days making flint arrows for the tribe. A ticking sound in the grass indicates that a spider is busy making arrowheads. A Shasta legend relates how the people got arrowheads back in the days when arrowheads were made of pine bark instead of obsidian. Ground Squirrel tricked the arrowheads away from Obsidian Old Man and the sharp new arrows made hunting better. It's no surprise that arrowheads often signified alertness.

Kay, who journeyed from England to America and arrived in Oregon in 1863. It is a tribute to the generations of weavers that have continued his legacy of quality and excellence. The original blanket was discovered recently in a 19th-century European mill and included the designer's notes and calculations, handwritten neatly along the sides. Our modern Pendleton designers viewed this historic work of art with reverence and used it as inspiration for our Journey West jacquard design. The pattern underlines the universal appeal of geometric shapes and lines, images not unlike those seen in Native American art and often used in early Pendleton Trade Blankets. The hooked images seen inside the large diamonds are common symbols of luck and prosperity. This blanket, woven in our American mills, is robe size, the size preferred by Native Americans for ceremonial purposes and wrapping about oneself as a robe. Impressive as a wall hanging and practical when folded on a sofa or at the foot of a bed. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Pendleton Woolen Mills </b>is a well respected family business based in Oregon, USA since 1909, offering exceptional craftsmanship and classic, timeless style.","options":[{"id":34685676,"name":"Default","price":265.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108431841/-/JWestPW.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108431841/-/JWestPW.jpeg","width":280,"height":373},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108431937/-/jwbed.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108431937/-/jwbed.jpeg","width":748,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108431949/-/journeywest.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108431949/-/journeywest.jpeg","width":936,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108432015/-/cushionsonchair.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108432015/-/cushionsonchair.jpeg","width":758,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5253801,"name":"Pendleton Blankets","permalink":"pendleton-blankets","url":"/category/pendleton-blankets"}]},{"id":11026911,"name":"Pendleton Blanket \"Hacienda\"","permalink":"pendleton-blanket-hacienda","position":76,"price":265.0,"default_price":265.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pendleton-blanket-hacienda","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-08T12:00:29.000Z","description":"82% pure virgin wool/18% cotton.\r\n64\" x 80\" Unnapped & felt bound.\r\nDry clean. \r\nMade in the USA.\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>About the Hacienda design:</i>\r\nTimeless geometric shapes give universal appeal to this nine-element design blanket.
