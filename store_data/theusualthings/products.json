A break-up record implies that everyone's moved on,' says Shekey. He continues, 'It's dark, brutally honest, and all kinds of sad. I've never been more proud of a record.'\r\n\r\nWhile it highlights the softer side of a maturing band, Home Sweet Alone doesn't lose its hooks or its bravado. At once it drifts between acoustic interstitials and full-on telecaster thunder'a turning point in both the band's musicianship and lyrical content. Home Sweet Alone is a cohesive, measured effort.\r\n\r\n'Everything's out in the open on this one. My fear is it'll be hard for me, personally, to listen to it in a few years' time... but this record absolutely HAD to be made. It's the best work we've ever done.'\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>(For a Lifetime)</li>\r\n<li>Staring Down the Morning</li>\r\n<li>Say You Don't</li>\r\n<li>See Me Through</li>\r\n<li>I'll Be Around</li>\r\n<li>(To Be So Bold)</li>\r\n<li>Christmas Lights</li>\r\n<li>I Give Up</li>\r\n<li>Magic Shows</li>\r\n<li>Home Sweet Alone</li>\r\n<li>This Town</li>\r\n<li>(Coming Home Soon)</li>\r\n<li>Somewhere Else</li>\r\n<li>What Kind of Man</li>\r\n<li>The Rejects</li>\r\n</ol>","options":[{"id":50295267,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129156279/-/homesweetalone.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129156279/-/homesweetalone.jpg","width":1500,"height":1500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5361,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":3231183,"name":"Middle Coast","permalink":"middle-coast","position":3,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/middle-coast","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-02-03T19:48:37.000Z","description":"The debut record from \"The Usual Things.\" Produced by long-time influence on the band, Art Alexakis of Everclear.
