The line is actually a map of Friendship Road captured using Google maps. \r\n\r\nI was the eighth generation to live on the land located in the northern part of the road. Throughout the process of creating the piece, I thought about time I spent with my grandparents as a little girl. It was like I was reconnecting with my grandmother, who did handiwork while watching her stories, and my grandfather, who drove back and forth to Friendship, just a few hundred yards from our family farm. The twine references the tobacco twine that we used in the tobacco priming process. My grandma also had a spool that she kept on her basement steps and used it for various household chores. I later took the spool for myself.\r\n\r\nSee more photos of \"<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/carolinearmijo/sets/72157604596653183/\" target=\"blank\">Moon Over Friendship</a>.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the art work:\r\nTitle: Moon Over Friendship\r\nEdition: 3/25\r\nDate: April 2008\r\nMedium: Digital Photograph Printed on Piezo Pro Matte Canvas, stitched with cooking twine\r\nFinished Print Size: 16” x 20”\r\nIncludes Black Frame with Signed Mat","options":[{"id":1569971,"name":"Default","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3154783/-/moonoverfriendship.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3154783/-/moonoverfriendship.jpg","width":500,"height":375}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":163363,"name":"Mixed Media","permalink":"mixed-media","url":"/category/mixed-media"}]},{"id":438792,"name":"Dwellings Psalm","permalink":"dwellings-psalm","position":5,"price":24.0,"default_price":24.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dwellings-psalm","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-10-27T05:20:08.000Z","description":"a paper weaving using strips of 1930s sheet music and colored paper woven in hardware cloth","options":[{"id":1744859,"name":"Default","price":24.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3646564/-/3820856819_6d97ddbe78_b.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3646564/-/3820856819_6d97ddbe78_b.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":163363,"name":"Mixed Media","permalink":"mixed-media","url":"/category/mixed-media"}]}]
