All products are hand painted in Denmark.\r\n\r\nThe Blue Fluted MEGA pattern is a updated-classic created from an old Royal Copenhagen pattern.\r\n\r\nIt took the young Danish artist, Karen Kjældgård-Larsen, a strong vision and a lot of courage to put a modern twist to the iconic Blue Fluted pattern which has been in production in Denmark since 1775. \r\n\r\nShe beautifully modified elements of the original pattern and gave it a modern look. Since its introduction, Blue Fluted MEGA has become a major success with its fresh, updated look while still honoring the Blue Fluted 18th century design.\r\n\r\nCapacity: 3.5 oz\r\nMain material: Porcelain\r\nDesign by: Karen Kjældgård-Larsen\r\nProduction start: 2000\r\nDishwasher and microwave safe.\r\n\r\nHandmade by Royal Copenhagen in Denmark.\r\n\r\nFree shipping for US based customers.

(Or perhaps this necklace is about your best friend). Bigger hearts for adults. Smaller for kids. You decide the number of hearts. And, for example, if one person is extra tall, then Astrid will make that heart extra tall.

The plaque is handmade of plaster and fibreglass (for stability). The candle holder is hand forged iron.\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for this art piece is an original plaque from the 18th century hanging in the basement of an old building behind the Royal Theater in Stockholm. The monogram of the Swedish King Gustav III (1746-1792), adorns the plaque. Gustav III is among the more well-known of the Swedish monarchs, famous for his passion for theatre and architecture and culture in general.  \r\n\r\nMaria's version is very similar to the original plaque but the iron candle holder is her own design.\r\n\r\nThe candle holder is attached to the wall with two screws. The plaque is placed on top and hung with another screw. (3 screws enclosed).\r\n\r\nMeasurements: The plaque measures approx. 22 (h) x 13 (w) inches.\r\n\r\nHandmade in Sweden.\r\n\r\nWe only carry a small stock of sconces.
