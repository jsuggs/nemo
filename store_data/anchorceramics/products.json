Our shared ethos about design, materiality and making, makes us natural collaborators.\r\n\r\nAll Potter lights are handmade giving each light its own unique character. Thrown on a potter's wheel, the lights are carefully hand glazed inside and out in a range of simple, beautiful glazes. They're made with a white stoneware clay and then fired to 1280 degrees C, making them very tough. The lights are designed as a shade and come supplied with the necessary electrical fittings and cord. The 3m cord is available in gold, black, and black & white fleck.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\nPlease direct all enquiries about the Potter light directly to MAKE architecture by calling the MAKE office on <br />03 9853 4730 or <!DOCTYPE html><html><body><a href=\"http://www.makearchitecture.com.au/index.php?/products/potter-light/\" target=\"_blank\">via the MAKE website.</a></body></html>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":30370346,"name":"Charcoal Exterior/Off White Interior","price":0.01,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30377747,"name":"Charcoal Exterior/Bright Yellow Interior","price":0.01,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30377750,"name":"Gloss White Exterior/Gloss White Interior","price":0.01,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30377753,"name":"Charcoal Exterior/Off White Lip/Off White Interior","price":0.01,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30377756,"name":"Charcoal Exterior/Gloss Black Lip/Off White Interior","price":0.01,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95372705/-/Large-Charcoal.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95372705/-/Large-Charcoal.jpg","width":1000,"height":664},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95372717/-/Black-and-White-Stripe-Pendant.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95372717/-/Black-and-White-Stripe-Pendant.jpg","width":1000,"height":664},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95372729/-/Inside-detail.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95372729/-/Inside-detail.jpg","width":1000,"height":664}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4733951,"name":"Lighting","permalink":"lighting","url":"/category/lighting"}]}]
