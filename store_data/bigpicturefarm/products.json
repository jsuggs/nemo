We fancy that she, if given the choice, would probably smoke a fat cigar and write poems all day instead of being a goat. Instead, she's a goat. And she hangs out all day with her daughter and grand-daughter eating and getting her head scratched. Which is pretty swell, too.\r\n\r\nSo we're naming this gift after her. \r\n\r\nWe chanced upon these New England antique cigar boxes (Top Stone Bouquet out of Connecticut) at a great vintage shop in Bellows Falls. What we're going to do is fill them with caramels and goatfit them for the holidays. We've only got 4 of them, alas, so nab 'em while you can. If ever there was a limited edition Gertrude Stein the goat gift...this is it.\r\n\r\nIncludes 9 of each of the four flavors (sea salt & vanilla, chai, maple, cocoa latte) for a total of 36 caramels + a gift card.","options":[{"id":48544647,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127867470/-/cigar_boxes_IMG_6648.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127867470/-/cigar_boxes_IMG_6648.jpg","width":900,"height":725},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127867530/-/sq_gertrude_awaiting_a_head_scratch_IMG_9337.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127867530/-/sq_gertrude_awaiting_a_head_scratch_IMG_9337.jpg","width":2720,"height":2720},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127867452/-/cigar_boxes_caramel_IMG_6653.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127867452/-/cigar_boxes_caramel_IMG_6653.jpg","width":900,"height":1134},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127867584/-/summer_gertrude_IMG_2670.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127867584/-/summer_gertrude_IMG_2670.jpg","width":900,"height":581},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127867608/-/gertrude_IMG_5853.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127867608/-/gertrude_IMG_5853.jpg","width":900,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6665088,"name":"Gift","permalink":"gift","url":"/category/gift"}]},{"id":13482645,"name":"Individuals ","permalink":"individuals","position":4,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/individuals","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-10T20:51:08.000Z","description":"<b>***Christmas Order Deadline: Tuesday, December 17th at 10pm!

A fellow farmstead goat milk caramel producing operation, they boil the milk down from their own herd of goats to make an outrageously delicious goat milk caramel sauce. We thought a collaboration was a natural fit. Included in this awesome gift ensemble is one 8 oz jar of Fat Toad Farm's velvety goat milk caramel sauce along with a 12 piece farm box of our deliciously rich goat milk caramel candies. With this ensemble you are truly getting to taste the sweet treats that Vermont has to offer - so we made up this special limited edition tote bag 'Vermont is Sweet' to go along with it. All your friends will be wanting one too!\r\n\r\n<b>Free Shipping on all Orders over $75!</b>","options":[{"id":46888665,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126652836/-/ftf_bpf_photo1_IMG_6287.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126652836/-/ftf_bpf_photo1_IMG_6287.jpg","width":2579,"height":2631},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126652857/-/ftf_bpf_photo__2_IMG_6258.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126652857/-/ftf_bpf_photo__2_IMG_6258.jpg","width":3536,"height":2372},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126652887/-/ftf_bpf_photo_3_IMG_6243.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126652887/-/ftf_bpf_photo_3_IMG_6243.jpg","width":2720,"height":4080}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6665088,"name":"Gift","permalink":"gift","url":"/category/gift"}]}]
