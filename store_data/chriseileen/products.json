Craft and woodworking projects are very evident throughout the country. Couple this with the overall fascination with Medieval Times and Mysticism --the days of Knights, Dragons and Damsels in distress. The booklet being offered gives the woodworker step by step instructions on how to construct your own \"Dream Castle\". It is designed to intrigue the imagination of the romanticist yet provide a unique challenge to the everyday hobbyist and woodworker. The project will take considerable time but the end results will definitely be worth the time and effort. Construction of the \"Castle\" is divided into three basic parts: 1. Castle Structure 2. Courtyard (castle walls) and  3. The Base. Construction materials will consist of mainly wood components and tools that are readily available to the woodworker. The overall dimensions for all three sections are approximately: 36\" square by 27\" long x 18\" high.","options":[{"id":15314143,"name":"Default","price":9.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.25,"amount_with_others":3.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/45811639/-/Castle___1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/45811639/-/Castle___1.jpg","width":727,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2547075,"name":"Woodworkimg","permalink":"woodworkimg","url":"/category/woodworkimg"}]}]
