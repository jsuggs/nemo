This is the first in the world to house not just one but two SOG Assisted Technology™ blades. Start to open the main blades, which are available when the main tool is closed, and S.A.T. takes over to complete opening. When not in use, these blades lock closed using our patent pending side release. Flip open the tool and experience the precision of the heavy-duty plier capability and large wire cutters. Smooth handle surfaces promote comfort on even the toughest jobs. While open, five other components are also included.\r\n\r\nCompound Leverage has become a SOG patented trademark for folding tools. With the same hand pressure you will generate twice the wire cutting and gripping power than all other conventional designs.\r\n\r\nSOG Assisted Technology works through the balance of opposing high-tension coil springs. As one opens the blade the force to propel the knife open becomes greater than the closing force and the blade will open on its own. The end result propels the blade out once the operator has initiated the one-handed opening action.\r\n\r\nSOG's Double Tooth Saw design is truly cutting edge! The alternating tooth design allows the saw to grip while at the same time reducing friction for optimal performance.

Originally developed for the severe conditions endured by wildland firefighters, LP protects, preserves, and restores boots, saddles, motorcycle leathers, tool pouches, gloves, baseball mitts, and more. It is especially useful for any leather that gets worked hard and is regularly exposed to harsh environments.\r\n\r\nThree natural oils are suspended in Beeswax and Propolis. In the leather these oils gradually seep out of the Beeswax/Propolis suspension formula. If exposed to heat or flexing the oils are released faster so leather gets oiled instead of parched and cracked. This Beeswax/Propolis* Suspension Formula provides a time release lubrication to inner fibers while the surface is reinforced against scuffing, and the leather still breathes. The result is Obenauf's Heavy Duty LP:\r\n\r\nRepels water better and longer.\r\nRepels acids, petroleum, salt, and chemicals.\r\nRestores dried leather to a soft and supple condition and protects it from further damage.\r\nPrevents dry rot and resists mildew.\r\nResists premature cracking in flex areas.\r\nIs odorless after applied (very important for hunters)\r\nRestores sun-faded leather.\r\nResists scuffing and dry rot.\r\nApplies easily with with a clean cloth.\r\nPenetrates deeply into leather.\r\nCan be buffed to shine or polished over.\r\nContains no harmful silicones, petroleums, solvents, or neatsfoot.","options":[{"id":40358361,"name":"Default","price":9.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122071587/-/obenaufs.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122071587/-/obenaufs.jpg","width":380,"height":380}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5859345,"name":"Rugged Clothing","permalink":"rugged-clothing","url":"/category/rugged-clothing"}]},{"id":12677301,"name":"Stanley Thermos","permalink":"stanley-thermos","position":17,"price":38.0,"default_price":38.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/stanley-thermos","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-30T20:29:01.000Z","description":"Vacuum insulation keeps drinks hot or cold 24 hours\r\n18/8 stainless steel won't rust; naturally BPA free\r\nInsulated lid doubles as 8oz/236mL cup\r\nLeak proof and fully packable\r\n1.1QT / 1L\r\n","options":[{"id":40334148,"name":"Default","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122052858/-/stanleythermos.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122052858/-/stanleythermos.jpg","width":554,"height":554}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5859348,"name":"Gear","permalink":"gear","url":"/category/gear"}]},{"id":12671628,"name":"CRKT K.I.S.S.

The Original K.I.S.S.®, with its Tanto-inspired blade and bead-blast finish, is the revolutionary high-tech statement by Knifemakers' Guild member and K.I.S.S. designer \"Daddy K.I.S.S.\" Ed Halligan. It stands for \"Keep It Super Simple.\" It's one honey of a knife, precision fine blanked for superior fit and smooth operation. \r\n\r\nLike all folding knives in the K.I.S.S. family, Ed Halligan's unique two-piece construction features an integral frame lock, and a breakthrough design which seals the cutting edge against the handle. \r\n\r\nA thumb stud is used to one-hand open the blade, and as the blade is fully rotated open, the frame lock snaps crisply in behind the blade to give a sound lockup. The blade can be closed with one hand, simply by releasing the frame lock. \r\n\r\nThe design of the K.I.S.S. series pocket/money clip permits them to be used in a variety of ways: clipped to the pocket; as a money clip knife; and with split-ring or lanyard, as a key chain knife. \r\n\r\nIn the wake of the success of the K.I.S.S., a flock of imitators has appeared; none offers the simple elegance of Ed Halligan's original design, and none offers the value of CRKT quality manufacturing. In fact, the more Ed's design is imitated, the better it looks.
