Nonetheless, it's time for Guts to move onto his forever home, as I have no space left in my studio. \r\n\r\nWould you like to adopt Guts? Let me tell you about him. Guts was created using a fine acrylic paint, layered onto an 100% recycled skate deck that was tinted green. His face was originally a plastic bumper attached to the board, which started to fall apart; I sealed it with wood putty and sanded it back, to create babysoft cheeks for his acrylic rhinestone eyes to sit in. You can see all his guts, and some irregularly located bones lined in golden metallic paint, covered in glitter. He is a special fellow, and is sealed, weatherproof and ready to hang as soon as he finds his forever home. \r\n\r\nYou can see a clearer photo of his body here:\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=135502293190788&set=a.135502273190790.33951.121728241234860\r\n\r\nI will consider overseas adoptions for Guts.

This lady was paraded all over town, from High Street Northcote to Spring Street in the CBD! She's got mileage on her, as well as a lot of gold thread and a couple rhinestones. \r\n\r\nThe Ukulele's face has been drawn with pencils and watercolour onto the soft wood, with acrylic paint on both the sides and back of the piece. Stars have been cut out and sanded in the body of the Uke, creating the dusky sky for the princess to pluck stars from.\r\n\r\nMore photos can be seen here: http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.135502273190790.33951.121728241234860\r\n\r\nThis piece is UNSEALED, which means you can't take her outside, or bathe her, or drool on her (sorry).
