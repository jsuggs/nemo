(FYI: ORAC is the scale used to measure the total antioxidant level of a food)\r\nSUPERBLAST: antioxidant tests at 6,000 ORAC units per GRAM, or twice your minimum daily requirement, so a teaspoon has 15,000 ORAC units - shazam!\r\n\r\nNutritional scientists are just beginning to understand what ancient cultures always knew - the constellation of nutrients and free-radical fighters in superfoods are not just super-delicious, but super-nutritious too!\r\n\r\nPollution is an unavoidable fact of life, and NO ONE is immune to it! Experts recommend at least 3000 ORAC per day to guard against oxidantive damage (or more if stressed & hey, who isnt stressed these days??)\r\n\r\nWholefood nutrient sources are considered preferable to popping a pill, so for your convenience, we've combined FOUR of the strongest known antioxidant superfruit powders all together to make it easy to boost your daily diet and 'blast' off the effects of this millenium's environmental influence.\r\n\r\nNutritional Benefits\r\n\r\nMAQUI (aristotelia chilensis): Havent yet heard of it?? You will - this Patagonian Superfruit with a super deep purple colour and mild berry taste is native to Chile and regularly consumed by the Mapuche Indians. With an ORAC antioxidant score that's 3 times HIGHER than even Acai berry, it has the added punch of anthocyanins (like blueberries), polyphenols, antioxidant Vitamins A & C, iron, potassium and Omega-6. Our Maqui is raw, wild-harvested and freeze-dried (not spray-dried) for maximum nutrient preservation, and has NO fillers or sweeteners (eg. maltodextrin).\r\n\r\nPOMEGRANATE (punica granatum): Ever actually tried eating the juicy ruby red seeds of this Persian Superfruit? It's delicious, yet messy, inconvenient and stains everything! But it has been cultivated for 1000+ years and is included in everything these days from cosmeceuticals to candy for a good reason! Along with the ellagic acid (like strawberries), tannins, anthocyanins and polyphenols, it contains Vitamin C, iron and potassium - with lots of research ongoing, the discovery of this superfruit's benefits has surely only just begun! Sourced from India and freeze-dried and RAW for maximum nutritional punch.\r\n\r\nGOJI (lycium barbarum): This Tibetan Superfruit is sometimes referred to as 'red diamonds' with a strong history in traditional Asian culture, and ours is vine-ripened, freeze-dried and RAW. Goji is a famous macronutrient powerhouse of carotenoids, vegetarian protein and 20 trace minerals, but best known for the combination of antioxidant Vitamins A, C, & E within.\r\n\r\nCamuCamu (myrciaria dubia): Another rarity, this remarkable raw red berry powder from Peru boasts the highest naturally occurring mega-vitamin C content of just about any food on the planet! (thats 30 to 60 times more Vitamin C than an orange) and also contains antioxidant rutin, ellagic acid, anthocyanins, beta-carotene AND the mineral potassium, with the amino acids valine, leucine, & serine for good measure.

It is sometimes known as lucmo. In English it is known as the \"eggfruit\", a common name also given to the closely related canistel. The name \"eggfruit\" refers to the fruits’ dry flesh, which is similar in texture to a hard-boiled egg yolk. The lucuma has particularly dry flesh which possesses a unique flavor of maple and sweet potato. It is a very nutritious fruit, having high levels of carotene, vitamin B3, and other B vitamins. The round or ovoid fruits are green, with a bright yellow flesh that is often fibrous, but bears an aftertaste that some find odd and unappealing. The largest concentration of this fruit is found in Chile and in the Peruvian regions of Cajamarca, Ancash, Lima, and Ayacucho. Fruits grown in the Peruvian highlands are considered to be of superior flavor, and are culturally revered. \r\n\r\nIt has recently become popular as a dried powder flavoring, and production of Peruvian fruits dried for export is increasing on a large scale. Lucuma is a popular flavoring for ice cream in its native range, and in Peru even exceeds the demand for more globally popular flavors such as strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla.\r\n\r\nIt is especially abundant in beta-carotene, niacin and iron with significant amounts of calcium and phosphorus. Discover the flavorful sensation of lucuma. Enjoy it by itself or mix it in your favorite treat. For an extra special treat, make sure to combine it with some raw cacao nibs, vanilla bean, and coconut butter. Blend into a creamy delight.

Ground mesquite powder taste like an aromatic blend of cinnamon, chocolate, and coffee.\r\n\r\nFor 2000 years, mesquite flour was a staple food of Native Americans from the Texas to California area, because mesquite trees thrive in arid climates where other crops wither. Mesquite pods were one of the most significant foods of the desert Apache, Pima, Cahuilla, Maricopa, Yuma, Mohave, and Hopi tribes. Like many other desert plants, the mesquite tree super concentrates nutrients in its seeds to compensate for the harsh environment. Consequently, it is so nutritious and mineral-rich that many consider it a \"superfood.\" Mesquite powder is very high in magnesium, potassium, iron, calcium, zinc, fiber, and digestible proteins (including lysine). It also acts as an antioxidant, and its glycemic index is low in spite of its sweet taste. It can be used as either a gluten-free flour or a superfood seasoning.\r\n\r\nThe trees have small green leaves and yellow hanging seedpods. Mesquite flour is made by washing the pods with water, sorting them for quality, milling and sieving the pods to isolate the most flavorful portion of the pods in the same fashion that Indians did for centuries using stone mortars. The flour is 100% organic. The mesquite flour has a distinctive rich flavor similar to mocha coffee, cinnamon and chocolate. When the flour is heated in the oven, alone or in mixtures, a pleasant aroma appears that is somewhat similar to coconut. The most favorable and flavorful outcome occurs when it constitutes from ten to twenty percent by weight of total mixture.\r\n\r\nUse as ingredient in superfood blended drinks with cacao, maca, goji berries, real raw agave nectar, hemp seeds, and coconut oil. In raw food culinary preparations or cooking, mesquite meal can be used as either a spice or flour. As a spice, you can sprinkle mesquite meal on almost anything to add flavor. As a flour, you can mix mesquite with other flours to use in baking. Mesquite flour products can be used as a baking ingredient or a seasoning in many food and drinks. Add mesquite to drinks, soups, cakes, pie crusts, cookies, puddings, vegetables, pancakes, muffins, and ice cream.\r\n\r\n    USDA Organic, Kosher\r\n    Taste like cinnamon, chocolate, and coffee\r\n    From Argentina and Peru\r\n    Nutritious and mineral-rich\r\n    High in magnesium, potassium, iron, calcium, zinc, fiber, and  digestible proteins\r\n    Low on the glycemic index\r\n\r\n ","options":[{"id":28963547,"name":"Default","price":4.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/104411764/-/Mesquite4a.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/104411764/-/Mesquite4a.jpg","width":300,"height":261},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90937838/-/msqo2o.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90937838/-/msqo2o.png","width":400,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2848277,"name":"Super Foods","permalink":"super-foods","url":"/category/super-foods"},{"id":2848439,"name":"Raw Food Products","permalink":"raw-food-products","url":"/category/raw-food-products"},{"id":3500411,"name":"Gluten Free","permalink":"gluten-free","url":"/category/gluten-free"}]},{"id":9253970,"name":"Ojio Raw Maca Powder Organic 2oz","permalink":"ojio-raw-maca-powder-organic-2oz","position":24,"price":4.95,"default_price":4.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ojio-raw-maca-powder-organic-2oz","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-01T04:08:18.000Z","description":"Ojio maca is grown on a plantation at the genetic origin of true lepidium peruvianum. It is sourced in Peru's Junin plateau at 14,000 feet elevation, high in the Andes Mountains. Our maca growers in Peru have come to know and rely upon the regions specific highland Andean valleys, to offer them the most desirable growing conditions. Here, the growers were the first to develop and master the art of producing powerful strains of Maca root centuries ago, and these same families carry on and teach the traditions of highland farming to their ancestors in the modern day to produce the finest strain of them all. It is here that the world's first Maca was grown. At elevations above 14,000 feet (higher than any other cultivated crop in the world), the intense sunlight, rarified air, and organic soil of these highland valleys join together to produce the most potent and pure strain of Maca root on earth. \r\n\r\nThorough scientific analysis and chemical breakdown documents maca root to be a nutritional storehouse of vitamins and minerals. The phytochemicals of the root combined with Maca's full array of vitamins makes the Maca plant one of the most powerful plants on earth. \r\n\r\nChemical analyses of this brain-powering root reveal an astonishing profile of amino acids, vitamins, minerals, sterols, fatty acids, and glucosinates.\r\n\r\nVitamins: B1, B2, and C.\r\n\r\nVitamin B1 help the body's cells convert carbohydrates into energy. It is also essential for the functioning of the heart, muscles, and nervous system.\r\n\r\nB2 works with the other B vitamins. It is important for body growth and red cell production, and helps in releasing energy from carbohydrates.\r\n\r\nVitamin C (ascorbic acid) is involved in oxidation-reduction reactions.\r\n\r\nAlkaloids: 4 novel alkaloids: macaina 1, 2, 3, and 4. These are responsible for activating hormone regulators located in the brain that in turn regulate the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus in the blood.\r\n\r\nMacronutrients: Essential vitamins and minerals, nutritive properties help convalescent people or patients who are diagnosed with anemia.\r\n\r\nProteins: Rich in bio-available maca proteins with an average of 11gr % in the dry root.\r\n\r\nMicronutrients: Minerals which help with the production of antibodies.\r\n\r\nFiber: Loaded with cellulose and lignin which stimulate intestinal function.\r\n\r\nCarbohydrates: Rich in quality carbohydrates; combined with the alkaloids and other nutrients is the source for sustainable energy.\r\n\r\nCalcium: Higher concentrations of calcium than in milk; indispensable for the nerves and circulatory system and the formation for bones, teeth, and vital heart functions.\r\n\r\nPotassium: Participates in the regulation of osmotic pressure; its activity is carried out inside the cells.\r\n\r\nCopper: The probable participant in the formation of hemoglobin. Lack of copper can greatly decrease the amount of essential enzymes for the organism.\r\n\r\nZinc: Serves as a cofactor of dehydrogenises and carbonic anhydrite; its lack can cause skin rashes, taste disturbances, and mental lethargy.\r\n\r\nFructose: A sugar used by the seminal plasma for the production of semen/ or spermatozoa.\r\n\r\nPhosphorus: Regulates the transmission of neuromuscular chemicals and electrical stimuli. Important for the homeostasis of calcium and the reactions of lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins. The body's chemical energy is stored in phosphate compounds.\r\n\r\nIron: Vital component of hemoglobin and certain respiratory enzymes. Deficiency results in anemia, poor growth or difficult pregnancies.\r\n\r\nStarch: Calcium and iron, forming chemical compounds that influence the nutrition and health of the consumer.\r\n\r\nFatty Acids: Contains over 20 fatty acids.\r\n\r\nSodium: Along with potassium, it was discovered that an increase in the daily diet of the sodium-potassium relation helps reduce arterial pressure/ hypertension. Nevertheless, an excessive increase of this relation could give rise to a diminution of the susceptibility to the bascule-cerebral accidents that do not depend on arterial pressure.\r\n\r\nSilicon: Helps the connective tissues, including the aorta, trachea, tendons, bones, and skin.\r\n\r\nMagnesium: Essential for protein synthesis, and activities of muscles and nerves. Deficiency of quality magnesium can cause changes in heart and skeletal muscles.\r\n\r\nUses: Blend in smoothies, dessert recipes, cereals, soups, oatmeal, sprinkle on salads or anywhere you want to add the potent properties of this powerful member of the radish family.\r\n\r\nDosage: Amount to use varies based on body type, size, and constitution. An adequate dose to begin use of Maca Powder is 1-2 teaspoons. If you desire a more powerful effect 1-2 tablespoons is recommended.","options":[{"id":28963475,"name":"Default","price":4.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/104412040/-/maca_powder.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/104412040/-/maca_powder.jpg","width":345,"height":246},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90937610/-/MPRC2O.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90937610/-/MPRC2O.png","width":400,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90937622/-/Maca-Powder-NFP.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90937622/-/Maca-Powder-NFP.jpg","width":175,"height":369}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2848277,"name":"Super Foods","permalink":"super-foods","url":"/category/super-foods"},{"id":2848439,"name":"Raw Food Products","permalink":"raw-food-products","url":"/category/raw-food-products"},{"id":3500411,"name":"Gluten Free","permalink":"gluten-free","url":"/category/gluten-free"}]},{"id":5441301,"name":"Organic Coconut Palm Sugar 200g","permalink":"organic-coconut-palm-sugar-200g","position":25,"price":6.5,"default_price":6.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/organic-coconut-palm-sugar-200g","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-10T11:05:11.000Z","description":"Tastes like brown sugar, only better !! \r\n\r\nThis sun-kissed sweetener is the crystallized nectar of the tropical coconut palm tree blossom, harvested high in the swaying canopy by traditional farmers, then evaporated and crushed into a unique, unbleached, not-too-sweet sugar alternative.

Read on my friend....\r\n\r\nCold pressed virgin coconut oil is a highly functional food with numerous health benefits. Its saturated fat is much different from animal fat.

The only other abundant source in nature is found in human breast milk. Research has found that coconut oil also supports thyroid function, promotes weight loss, provides quick energy, rejuvenates skin (when used topically), and -- contrary to misinformation, is good for the heart and cholesterol levels. In addition to containing antiviral proprieties from lauric acid, it also has antibacterial, antimicrobial and antiprotozoal properties. Candida sufferers love coconut oil because it's a rich source of caprylic acid, making it a potent antifungal. \r\n\r\nA therapeutic dosage of coconut oil is 3-4 tablespoons a day.\r\n\r\nThe popular misconceptions about coconut oil can be traced to some decades-old flawed studies, some of which used hydrogenated (chemically altered, unnatural) coconut oils, and to misleading advertising campaigns generated by the edible oil industry. The industry instead promoted polyunsaturated fats (such as canola, soybean, safflower. and corn), which easily go rancid when exposed to oxygen and produce harmful free radicals in our bodies. Coconut oil was falsely accused of leading to coronary heart disease, a myth that has been refuted by a large body of research showing that consumption of natural coconut oil is beneficial to health, including cardiovascular health.\r\n\r\nTraditional wisdom also supports the regular use of coconut oil.
