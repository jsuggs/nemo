If I were to emulsify these together to make a cream I would have to use chemicals to do this.  By using the gel and the serum together at the point of application you get all the advantages of the oil and water based ingredients without the emulsifiers used in creams and therefore a skin routine that is totally natural.

It targets the skin’s internal structure to help reduce the signs of aging, while at the same time moisturising, nurturing and protecting the skin.\r\n\r\nAnti Aging Day Cream contains acetyl tetrapeptide-9. This peptide directly assists the creation and arrangement of collagen fibres within the skin, helping to maintain its integrity, thickness and appearance.\r\n\r\nTo complement this effect, caprooyl-tetrapeptide-3 is a peptide that boosts proteins between the outermost layers of the skin. Reliable studies have shown it to noticeably and rapidly firm the skin and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.\r\n\r\nThese two revitalising agents are joined by a host of natural moisturisers to keep the skin feeling softer. \r\nThese include: argan oil, a traditional healing skin tonic; shea butter, to enhance the skin’s elasticity and barrier function; dextran, to retain moisture and add fullness; jojoba oil, to soften and sooth, and sodium hyaluronate, a superb moisturiser that is itself a normal functional component of skin.\r\n\r\nGreen tea has free-radical scavenging properties to help the skin retain its zest. Tocopherols (vitamin E) and coenzyme Q10 add to this antioxidant function. Together, they boost the skin’s internal defences and protect against the aging effects of sunlight.\r\n\r\nAnti Aging Day Cream also has a feast of fragrance. Essential oils from apricot, lime, orange, vanilla, grapefruit, rosewood and coconut bring an enchanting aroma. And with their enriching properties they have their own conditioning and moisturising role.\r\n\r\nSoothing aloe vera and comfrey, refreshing white willow and Siberian ginseng ensure that this cream doesn’t just work hard; it will make your skin feel calmer and relaxed too.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\nAqua, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera), Glycerine, Symphytum Officinale (Comfrey), Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), Glycerol Stearate, Eleutherococcus Senticosus (Siberian Ginseng), Tocopherols, Salix Alba Extract (White willow Bark), Cetyl Alcohol, Argania Spinosa (Argan Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Mannitol, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9, Dextran, Caprooyl- Tetrapeptide-3, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa Butter), Coconut Alkanes, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Coenzyme Q10, Prunus Armeniaca Extract (Apricot fruit), Aniba Rosaeodora Extract (Rosewood), Citrus Aurantifolia Extract (Lime Peel), Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Extract (Orange Peel), Vanilla Planifolia Extract (Vanilla fruit), Citrus Grandis extract (Grapefruit Peel), Cocos Nucifera Oil (Coconut Oil).\r\n","options":[{"id":48320595,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127858473/-/alisonantiage.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127858473/-/alisonantiage.jpg","width":405,"height":405}],"artists":[{"id":247497,"name":"Alison Claire Natural Beauty","permalink":"alison-claire-natural-beauty","url":"/artist/alison-claire-natural-beauty"}],"categories":[{"id":6709785,"name":"Brands","permalink":"brands","url":"/category/brands"},{"id":6684243,"name":"Face","permalink":"face","url":"/category/face"},{"id":6700884,"name":"Face--Anti-Aging","permalink":"face-anti-aging","url":"/category/face-anti-aging"},{"id":6700935,"name":"Face--Moisturisers","permalink":"face-moisturisers","url":"/category/face-moisturisers"},{"id":6709788,"name":"Brands--Alison Claire","permalink":"brands-alison-claire","url":"/category/brands-alison-claire"}]},{"id":14903190,"name":"Lime Lip Balm","permalink":"lime-lip-balm","position":85,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lime-lip-balm","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-17T12:10:06.000Z","description":"Look after your lips with shea butter and cocoa butter in a balm that's fragranced and flavoured with lime and apricot oils to add anti-microbial and antioxidant properties.\r\n\r\nThis simple combination of active ingredients even has natural defensive properties against UV light.
