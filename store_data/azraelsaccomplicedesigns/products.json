Factory produced but still to our patterns and standards! Still a great fit and affordable for you!\r\n\r\nThis corset is overbust in style with a deep sweetheart neckline and pointed bottom front. Long-line in style.\r\n\r\nIt is made of lovely Burgundy Blood Red satin and is trimmed in contrasting boning casings and binding in black satin. It also has contrast trim over the hips, making a lovely shaping line.\r\n\r\nCorset is steel boned with flat and spiral steels, is interfaced, lined, and has a steel front busk closure. Laces closed up the back with heavy duty grommets and bi-directional black lacing.\r\nWill take your waist in 2-4 inches.\r\n\r\nWe recommend this corset for people with cup sizes up to D only, as the plunging bustline will not support larger busts as well.\r\n\r\nThis corset is great for a nice long-line smooth shaping fit, with just the right amount of curvature. Not recommended for the extremely curvy figure as the cut is not as hourglass as some of our corsets.\r\n\r\nSizes S-XXL (22-34 waists available) or upgrade your order to bespoke handmade custom sized for an extra fee:\r\n\r\nS=22 waist (fits natural measurements of Bust 31-34, waist 24-27, hips 31-34)\r\nM=24 waist (fits natural measurements of Bust 33-36, waist 25-29, hips 33-36)\r\nL=28 waist (fits natural measurements of Bust 37-40, waist 29-33, hips 37-40)\r\nXL=30 waist (fits natural measurements of Bust 38-42, waist 32-36, hips 39-42)\r\nXXL=34 waist (fits natural measurements of Bust 39-45, waist 35-40, hips 41-45) \r\nCUSTOM SIZED: $225.00 each  +15 days to make time added to the make time already stated.\r\n(we will email you for measurements for custom corsets, this will be made by hand by us which reflects the higher price).\r\n\r\nALLOW 7-14 days to ship.\r\n","options":[{"id":18318737,"name":"SMALL 22","price":115.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":18318739,"name":"MED 24","price":115.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":18318741,"name":"LARGE 28","price":115.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":18318743,"name":"XL 30","price":115.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":18318745,"name":"XXL 34","price":115.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":18387837,"name":"CUSTOM SIZED","price":225.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.99,"amount_with_others":18.99}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55999587/-/victorianvixen.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55999587/-/victorianvixen.jpg","width":509,"height":792},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55999603/-/victorianvixen5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55999603/-/victorianvixen5.jpg","width":517,"height":792},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55999691/-/victroianvixen4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55999691/-/victroianvixen4.jpg","width":480,"height":792},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55999595/-/victorianvixen3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55999595/-/victorianvixen3.jpg","width":534,"height":792},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55999627/-/victorianvixen6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55999627/-/victorianvixen6.jpg","width":442,"height":792}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2837125,"name":"Ready to Wear Corsets","permalink":"ready-to-wear-corsets","url":"/category/ready-to-wear-corsets"}]},{"id":5387631,"name":"Mina Vampire Gown , Many Color/Fabric Choices","permalink":"mina-vampire-gown-many-color-fabric-choices","position":61,"price":425.0,"default_price":425.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mina-vampire-gown-many-color-fabric-choices","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-03T02:06:31.000Z","description":"This gown was inspired by the gown Mina wore in the movie Dracula.\r\n\r\nGown is available in your choice of  size, materials, and color, listed below.

As almost all of our gowns this gown is not a reproduction, it is modern and wearable, while still echoing the past.\r\n\r\nThe gown is made of medium weight taffeta in your choice of colors lined with a satin contrasting lining on the bustle part, matching contrasting lace trim, and contrasting satin ribbon lacing. The corset is also lined with the contrasting color. You may choose from the below colors. (Deep purple with bright red is shown)\r\n\r\nThe gown is in two parts, a steel boned victorian styled overbust corset with a front busk closer (suitable for tightlacing) and a bustle style skirt. The skirt zips up the back and the bustle piece is hand tacked to the under skirt and snaps over the zip closer, the bustle piece is turned back and sewn at the corners of the train to show the contrast for added extra drama.\r\n\r\nWe suggest that you wear a petticoat, bustle pad, or small hoop with this gown to give it support and fullness (small hoop is shown). This is NOT included in the price of the gown. You can find these at bridal stores or froms other etsy sellers.\r\n\r\nCorset and skirt are custom sized to your measurements we will message you with needed measurements upon purchase.

Would be great for fans of 18th century, gothic, fantasy, vampire, or elegant gothic aristocrat clothing.\r\n\r\nThis gorgeous gown is made of 100% silk dupioni in your choice of colors and trimed with your choice of trims.\r\n\r\nThe gown has a steel boned corseted bodice with a beaded lace front panel (laces vary) and lovely flounced and lace trimmed sleeves, bodice laces up the back. Bodice is lined and interfaced for extra stability. Bodice is a real corset and takes the place of having to add an extra corset under the bodice as real 18th century gowns did, which makes it easier to wear with less layers.\r\n\r\nThe skirt is two layers, an overskirt and a underskirt, all sewn to one waistband, and zips closed up the back. There are over 12 yards of fabric in this amazing gown. Each gown takes massive hours of work and attention to detail is never overlooked. This is truly an exquisite piece to add to your high end clothing collection!\r\n\r\n18th century pocket hoops, which hold the gown out on the sides and are worn underneath are NOT INCLUDED but are available on this store. 18th century style neck ruffle is also NOT INCLUDED but can also be made upon request for an extra fee, prices vary.\r\n\r\nThe gown can be done in ONE color or in a two color combo.\r\n\r\nDupioni silk colors:\r\n Black, \r\nWhite, \r\nCream, \r\nGold (shown), \r\nSilver, \r\nBurgundy (shown), \r\nScarlett Red, \r\nDeep Purple, \r\nEmerald Green, \r\nBaby Blue, or \r\nLight Pink.\r\n\r\nWe can send you photos of the swatches of colors at your request.\r\n\r\nTrim options: Satin, taffeta, or Silk dupioni gathered trim on neckline (or a combo of two colors if you ordered the two color option) and skirt, bows down the front of the bodice or we can leave the front of the bodice plain if you do not want bows.\r\n\r\nWe are open to customizing this gown further, just message us for any ideas you may have, extra fees may apply.\r\n\r\nItem is CUSTOM SIZED.

The gown is inspired by The Blood Countess Elizabeth Bathory. We've fused Elizabethan and modern elements to make a gown that is wearable today but echoes times past.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis gown is made of your choice of rich high quality satin or silk dupioni (upcharge for silk).\r\n\r\nThere are over 13 yards of fabric in this gown. The gown consists of a renaissance styled corseted bodice with an attached skirt.  The bodice is fully steel boned.  Bodice is made in renaissance style which is flat fronted with uplifted cleavage. The bodice has an attached overskirt and underskirt, both of which have been hand gathered to it. The bodice is trimmed along the neckline with hand pleated trim. The most striking feature of this gown is the bodice detail. A hand beaded fire cut czech glass blood red cross adorns the front of the bodice. The same beads drape delicately across the arms, these beads are hand strung with heavy fishing line for stability. The gown laces up the back with satin ribbon, the dress has a modesty panel to cover any skin. This dress can cinch you in just as a real corset does about 2-4 inches.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gown is best worn over a large renaissance style hoop skirt that holds it out dramatically (not included). Looks good over A-line petticoats as well for a less full look.\r\n\r\nThis gown is a unique one of a kind piece, no two gowns ever come out exactly the same, and each one takes a long time to create. Please allow 6-8 weeks for delivery.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can make this gown in other color combos or with other beading colors, just message us!\r\n\r\nWe can also put extra details on your gown such as tucking and gathering the overskirt to look like a bustle. Please be aware that any changes incur an extra fee, email us with any added details/changing before placing your order for a price qoute.\r\n\r\n\r\nGowns are custom sized to your measurements, upon placing order you will be contacted by us with the list of needed measurements.\r\n\r\nGown is available in the following colors:\r\n\r\nSatin:\r\nBlack Satin with Red Beading (shown)\r\nWhite Satin with Red Beading\r\n\r\n\r\nSilk (+$100):\r\nBlack Silk with Red Beading\r\nWhite Silk With Red Beading\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are NOT responsible for ship times of international orders once they leave our country.","options":[{"id":17924355,"name":"Black Satin with Red Beading CUSTOM SIZED","price":750.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":17924357,"name":"White Satin with Red Beading CUSTOM SIZED","price":750.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":17924359,"name":"Black Silk with Red Beading CUSTOM SIZED","price":850.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17924361,"name":"White Silk with Red Beading CUSTOM SIZED","price":850.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54665731/-/bc.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54665731/-/bc.jpg","width":384,"height":576},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54665747/-/bc2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54665747/-/bc2.jpg","width":480,"height":720},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54665755/-/bc3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54665755/-/bc3.jpg","width":480,"height":720},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54665763/-/bc4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54665763/-/bc4.jpg","width":402,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54665771/-/bc5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54665771/-/bc5.jpg","width":402,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2837123,"name":"Gowns and Dresses","permalink":"gowns-and-dresses","url":"/category/gowns-and-dresses"}]},{"id":5413207,"name":"Deluxe Double Layered Elegant Belle Skirt","permalink":"deluxe-double-layered-elegant-belle-skirt","position":81,"price":89.99,"default_price":89.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/deluxe-double-layered-elegant-belle-skirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-07T02:44:00.000Z","description":"This is our deluxe version of our popular Elegant Belle Skirt.\r\n\r\nThis skirt is a great low priced alternative to some of our more expensive designs, but still just as decadent and lovely.

Hours of work go into each piece to give you a quality corset at an affordable price for handmade.\r\n\r\nEver tried to buy an off the rack sized corset and found that they just don't fit your curves right but you just don't have the extra cash to always buy a custom sized corset? We understand that problem, often times off the rack sized corsets are just sized too \"straight\" (not enough size difference between the underbust, waist, and hip measurements). That's why we decided to make an affordable off the rack style that caters more to people with hourglass or curvier figures.\r\n\r\nIntroducing the Curvy Girl Underbust.  This style offers a greater underbust/waist/hip ratio than standard off the rack sizes. We understand this style of corset might not suit every figure, it's especially for our curvier clients or those of you with more waist \"squish\", so please see the full size chart explained below when ordering as it is not the same as our standard corset sizing.\r\n\r\nWe offer this corset in waist sizes 20-34 in variety of materials with a option to add contrasting trim and binding for no additional price mark-up. This corset features 1/4 inch steel boning on each seam and by the grommets and busk, a flat steel busk, waist tape and bi-directional back lacing. Corsets are fully lined with heavy cotton and interlined for strength. Corsets are gently curved (almost straight) across the underbust and hips to give maximum control and none of that \"overhang\" and \"under pooch\" that pointed styles can give curvier figures. \r\n\r\nFinished garments feature a 11 inch front busk and are about 12 inches tall from top to bottom. This height suits people of most normal heights. If you are extremely long torso-ed or extremely petite inquire about us custom sizing this corset for you for an additional fee (just email us). If you choose the trim option trim will not only go around the binding and down each seam but will also curve over the hips with a hip gusset trim (curved hip piece with trim following the curve) which highlights your curves even more. \r\n\r\nWe think you'll enjoy this corset as much as we do!\r\n\r\nPictured is Hot Pink Satin with Light Pink Satin Binding and Trim.\r\n\r\nCorsets are meant to cinch 4-6 inches and can accommodate up to 8-12 inch waist to hip difference and a 6-8 inch waist to underbust difference (our normal off the rack sizing allows for a 4-6 inch difference from the underbust to waist and a 4-8 inch difference from the waist to hips). As so not to confuse what I mean by waist to underbust and waist to hip ratio let me give you and example. A Standard sized person might be said to have a natural measurements of underbust measurement 32, waist of 28, hip of 36. That's four inches in difference between the waist and the underbust and 8 inches between the waist and the hip. But curvier girls might have the same waist size but measurements more like this: underbust 34, waist 28, hip 40, which would make off the rack standard sizing hard to fit, but they would be ideal for our cuvry girl off the rack sizing.
