Size of actual print: (70cm x 70 cm)\r\nThe work will be send un-stretched.\r\n\r\n‘car park dazzle’    \r\nWith ‘car park dazzle’ I try to emphasise the dedication, patience, and resilience ordinary women have to possess while ‘being behind the wheel’ in their everyday lives.\r\nI use the car trip as a journey through a mother’s normal day. As the day goes on, it is filled up more and more with little chores and duties, it starts to feel as if everything is going too fast and sometimes this escalates so much, that some women feel out of control and not in charge of their own lives anymore. \r\nIn ‘car park dazzle’ I switch the story over to myself while entering the car park. I all of a sudden see interesting things around me. I notice light, colours and shapes. I start to see \r\nthe art in the everyday. At this point I realise that art is a powerful tool, I can use it to cope, to feel good and to thrive.\r\n\r\nI take the photo, go home, sit behind my computer, work on the image and feel totally at peace. I realise that I have had a great day and that there will be many more to follow.\r\n","options":[{"id":12896794,"name":"Default","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":15.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37703862/-/crompton_carla_car_park_dazzle_reduced.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37703862/-/crompton_carla_car_park_dazzle_reduced.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2128420,"name":"Digital print on 100% cotton twill","permalink":"digital-print-on-100-cotton-twill","url":"/category/digital-print-on-100-cotton-twill"}]},{"id":3809680,"name":"Bamboo 1 (Digital print on cotton twill)","permalink":"bamboo-2-digital-print-on-cotton-twill","position":2,"price":150.0,"default_price":150.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bamboo-2-digital-print-on-cotton-twill","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-05-25T07:41:26.000Z","description":"This is a large, limited-edition digital print on 100% heavy \r\ncotton twill.\r\n\r\nSize of actual print: (112cm x 70 cm)\r\n\r\nThe work will be send un-stretched.","options":[{"id":12730762,"name":"Default","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":15.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37135764/-/Large_blue_red_with_sticks_flattened.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37135764/-/Large_blue_red_with_sticks_flattened.jpg","width":850,"height":528}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2128420,"name":"Digital print on 100% cotton twill","permalink":"digital-print-on-100-cotton-twill","url":"/category/digital-print-on-100-cotton-twill"}]},{"id":3809652,"name":"Bamboo 2 (Digital print on cotton twill)","permalink":"bamboo-1-digital-print-on-cotton-twill","position":3,"price":150.0,"default_price":150.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bamboo-1-digital-print-on-cotton-twill","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-05-25T07:34:34.000Z","description":"This is a large, limited-edition digital print on 100% heavy \r\ncotton twill.\r\n\r\nSize of actual print: (112cm x 70 cm)\r\n\r\nThe work will be send un-stretched.","options":[{"id":12730684,"name":"Default","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":15.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37135812/-/Large_grey_black__splash_red_flattened.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37135812/-/Large_grey_black__splash_red_flattened.jpg","width":850,"height":528}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2128420,"name":"Digital print on 100% cotton twill","permalink":"digital-print-on-100-cotton-twill","url":"/category/digital-print-on-100-cotton-twill"}]},{"id":3804844,"name":"'Tasmania a woman’s view' -  Tea towel V1","permalink":"tasmania-a-womans-view-tea-towel-v1","position":4,"price":24.0,"default_price":24.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tasmania-a-womans-view-tea-towel-v1","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-05-24T12:30:57.000Z","description":"Tea towels by the 'stof&stuff' textile studio\r\n\r\nWith Tasmania a woman’s view I try to ‘advertise’ this island to the rest of the world as a sanctuary to be envied by outsiders.
