Penned by Each Passing Day’s chief songwriter Loren Radis, the tender ballad paints a soul-drenched narrative whose power is hard to deny. It’s the second award-winning track by this young composer.\"","options":[{"id":755263,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1064594/-/2765346277_788f856c92.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1064594/-/2765346277_788f856c92.jpg","width":500,"height":487}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":156947,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
