In all, they've done 17 tours, and have played almost 1000 shows in 41 states and a dozen countries. To date, they've released 9 albums, 20 singles, and have songs on more compilations than you can count. \r\n\r\n\"Solitary\", their first new album in over a decade, is a smorgasbord of short sharp songs played with precision and power that not only evoke the spirit of the Descendents and the Ramones, but also adds a generous helping of powerpop sensibilities to the mix. The result is a sweet as sugar, yet tough as nails concoction that goes down easy but still packs a punch. \r\n\r\nFor More information,

debut record from two of the finest, most hard-working musicians to grace their respective scenes. We are excited to bring you the first ever release by Atlantic/Pacific, the band formed by John Herguth (House & Parish) and Garrett Klahn (Texas Is The Reason, Solea).\r\n\r\nAtlantic/Pacific was originally conceived in the summer of 2008 and started life as an acoustic duo deep in the heart of Brooklyn. Its roots stretch as far back to the days of Texas Is The Reason when the two agreed to someday 'do something'. With an impromptu rehearsal and a shared desire to get back on the road, the stage was set and the first tour booked with Sergie Loobkoff of Samiam/Solea joining the band for the Winter 2008 tour.\r\n\r\nAtlantic/Pacific continues to shape their sound, at times borrowing from shoegaze of the 90s and, at times, drifting in and out of folk landscapes of all decades. This 10\" is a snapshot of the band during this formative period and serves as the perfect introduction to listeners all over the world.\r\n\r\nSpring 2009, back in the US and, with help of Ian Love, the beginnings of a debut LP are beginning to emerge. 2009 sees further US & European tour dates along with more recording. Atlantic/Pacific is in motion and chances are the tide will find its way to you sometime soon.\r\n\r\nFor More information,

copies on white vinyl\r\n300 copies on brown vinyl\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT ST LOUIS burst onto the scene with their debut album “FOREVER NOW” back at the tail end of 2006 and immediately the underground punk community stood up and took notice. Coming from unfashionable Bolton, with their rough yet melodic, powerful punk that sounded like the bastard offspring of LEATHERFACE and SOCIAL DISTORTION “Forever Now” was one of the releases of the last decade – but also probably one of the best kept secrets too outside of the punk community. Although the influence of LEATHERFACE and SOCIAL DISTORTION is plain to see, this is not a band just ripping off their peers, but a band capable of writing some of the finest, most hook-stuffed punk songs you're likely to hear. With new album “IN YOUR OWN TIME”, they have stepped things up a gear once again - It's almost hard to believe that this is only their second album, as there are many bands playing this sort of thing who don't achieve these heights in their entire lifetime.. but the two and half years gestation period of the album, in the bands own painstaking pursuit for perfection - with songs rewritten, re-recorded and/or discarded along the way - has been worth the wait. THE GREAT ST LOUIS don’t deal in filler – and “IN YOUR OWN TIME” proves it. It’s not only a classic punk album, but also a classic album of the finest songs. Now, the album is available on limited edition vinyl as a corelease with Boss Tuneage and JSNTGM. <b>Features 2 extra bonus tracks not on the CD Version!</b> \r\n\r\nTRACKLIST:\r\nSIDE A : \r\n1.

Unless You Try Records is proud to bring you the new release from the mighty Samiam! For those of you who haven't let this band's music enrich your life, they simply write some of <i>the</i> catchiest, melodic, guitar-driven tunes you will ever hear. Influenced by bands such as The Doughboys, Descendents & Husker Du, the band's sound has attracted a truly worldwide army of fans since the band's inception back in Berkeley, California circa 1988. Along with contemporaries Jawbreaker, they pretty much built the Bay Area pop-punk sound that many subsequent musicians owe so much to! \r\n\r\nCountless world tours with bands such as Blink-182, Leatherface, Green Day & Sense Field (to name a few) have led to a rollercoaster of highs & lows for the band. They have literally experienced every facet of the music industry since the band's birth, whilst never being content to fit into any of the genres that the music media deemed fashionable at the time! This <b>DOUBLE LP</b> showcases previously unreleased & rare tracks from this 20-year-plus career at the forefront of independent music, and contains a full-colour insert with stories & memories from the individual band members, past and present. We hope it will serve as a great introduction to new listeners as well as a solid reminder to existing fans of just how influential Samiam have been (& continue to be!)\r\n\r\nThis strictly-limited UK vinyl pressing comes on two different variants, both of which are derived from the band's previous vinyl releases:\r\n\r\n<b>2x12\"s 'SamStray' split colour</b>\r\n-\"Samiam\" LP originally pressed by New Red Archives on Transparent Purple\r\n-\"Astray\" LP originally pressed by Hopeless Records on Solid White\r\n\r\n<b>2x12\"s 'ClumDown' splatter wax</b>\r\n-\"Clumsy\" LP originally pressed by Bitzcore Recs on Transparent Red\r\n-\"Whatever's Got You Down\" LP originally pressed by Hopeless Records on Yellow Splatter\r\n\r\nFor More information, contact:\r\nwww.unlessyoutryrecords.com\r\n<b>sales@unlessyoutryrecords.com</b>","options":[{"id":9622813,"name":"'SamStray' split / 199 copies","price":10.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9622814,"name":"'ClumDown' splatter / 300 copies","price":10.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9622815,"name":"Both variants for £19.79 = 10% discount!
