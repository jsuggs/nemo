Each one is 2.5\"x3.5\" (trading card size) made with colored pencil on illustration board. The colored monsters come in an archival clear acrylic frame like a high-end baseball card. Each full color monster comes with an original blue sketch of a different monster, so you get two unique original drawings together at one time. The blue sketches have been randomly matched with the colored monsters, then packaged up and sealed. No one knows which monsters are in which pack. (Pairings may vary from what is seen in the photos.) You will receive a randomly pulled package, making them mystery monsters! Included are two drawings (one colored and framed and one blue sketch on bristol), two monster pin back buttons, and a bookmark! Which ones will you get?","options":[{"id":38014677,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.95,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.95,"amount_with_others":1.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/118342080/-/mmmpromo.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/118342080/-/mmmpromo.jpg","width":800,"height":849}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":261433,"name":"Illustrations","permalink":"illustrations","url":"/category/illustrations"}]},{"id":9455444,"name":"Anchored Heart Shirt","permalink":"anchored-heart-shirt-pre-order","position":2,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/anchored-heart-shirt-pre-order","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-12T22:44:22.000Z","description":"Only 100 of these shirts are made, so each size is very limited.\r\n\r\nThe shirts are light heather grey, ring-spun, super soft cotton polyester blend and are preshrunk.
