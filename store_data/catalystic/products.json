All of my moss terrariums make great gifts for YOU, or for someone else. They are all hand crafted at the time of order, and will be shipped straight to your door, and always packaged for safe delivery!!\r\n\r\nMoss is a plant that ANYONE can grow. You will find it in nature growing in shady, magical places. It is a plant that needs very little care or attention.\r\n\r\nAll of my mosses are home grown and native to the US. They come from my moss farm and are all hand cultivated by ME!!\r\n\r\nDo you remember learning about the weather cycles in Science Class? Condensation, Evaporation, and all that good stuff?? The terrarium environment creates it’s own little ecosystem, recycling the moisture in the jar by processes of Evaporation and Condensation. Once a terrarium is established, it will thrive for a very long time with little to no attention.\r\n\r\nMoss terrariums make great gifts, and people love to get them. It’s like their own little secret world contained in a jar. With an addition of some terrarium art (sold separately in some cases) , each terrarium can really be personalized for anyone.\r\n\r\nWith my 15 + years in the Horticultural Field, I have been around lots of plants….none of them are as whimsical, or magical as moss. I love growing it and am constantly amazed at how easy it is to grow, and how great it looks!!\r\n\r\nSuper Cute care tag is attached to each moss terrarium, and makes for great gift presentation.\r\n\r\nAdd green to your workspace or home! Very little effort is required for upkeep. With the lid in place and bright, indirect light peering through, there’s minimal watering necessary.\r\n\r\nTerrarium measures 5 x 5 x 5 1/2 inches. Cute mushroom included!\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please ask!!","options":[{"id":5258241,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/13529751/-/red_mushroom_moss_terrarium__garden_in_a_jar__home_decor__woodland__terrarium.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/13529751/-/red_mushroom_moss_terrarium__garden_in_a_jar__home_decor__woodland__terrarium.jpg","width":506,"height":517}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":1431921,"name":"Moss Terrarium Kit - DIY - Glass Not Included","permalink":"moss-terrarium-kit-diy-glass-not-included","position":5,"price":11.0,"default_price":11.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/moss-terrarium-kit-diy-glass-not-included","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-02-01T19:06:41.000Z","description":"How cute!!
