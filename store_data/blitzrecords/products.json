Long time friends Bastard Noise and Lack of Interest team for one of the most unforgettable split releases ever! The Bastard Noise side of the release was conceived and brought to fruition (after the unexpected departure of drummer Joel Connell in November of 2011) in just six months time. Aimee Artz and Eric Wood have teamed up with grind drummer extraordinaire Rich Hoak (Brutal Truth / Total Fucking Destruction) to create easily their most sinister skull session to date. This release is full of burning musical hooks, blazing drumming (Rich is a true skull on these sessions), \"Four Steel Girders\" soaked in nitroglycerin, sick electronics / keys and vocalist Artz' most powerful and convincing vocals ever. The Hoak Sessions, as they are aptly titled, are bound to pull in those seeking the ultimate in \"skull power\" and musical dexterity. The phenomenal Mitchell Luna (formerly of blitzing grind unit Maruta) makes a guest appearance and shares vocals with Artz on one track too! Again, produced by Michael Rozon (The Red List, A Culture of Monsters, and Skulldozer), The Hoak Sessions were created out of the endless passion that drives \"the skull\" and is dedicated to our amazing and loyal followers.\r\nBASTARD NOISE \r\n1.

The band’s earlier material largely takes after its name: short and high-strung. In fact, the songs are so short and fast that HOD packs in the same amount of songs onto a\t7-inch that some bands barely fit on a double-LP. That said, there isn’t much that largely distinguishes HOD’s particular brand of loud, fast screaming and snarling from other bands that have “of Death” tacked onto their names. HOD have never been a band that just sticks within the comfort zones of the genre, opting instead to experiment and push it into territories that most don’t dare to go, and they actually pull it off with great results. These songs are fast and furious the whole way through, but not spazzy and schizophrenic. It’s like the usually A.D.D. freaks took some chill pills and said to each other— “Hey guys, let’s actually play some of these riffs for more than two measures” \r\nwhile also showing some black-metal-sounding chord progressions, some death metal vocals thrown in at one point, and some thrashy crossover riffs.\r\nAustria’s COLD WORLD bring an abrasive hardcore/thrash/powerviolence attack to this release with plenty of speed and fury, taking influence from bands like SIEGE,\r\nNEANDERTHAL, CROSSED OUT and INFEST.\r\nA1\tCold World –\t Divine Sense\t\t\r\nA2\tCold World –\t House Of Man\t\t\r\nA3\tCold World –\t A Fool's Life\t\t\r\nA4\tCold World –\t Two Faces\t\t\r\nA5\tCold World –\t Loyal Servant\t\t\r\nA6\tCold World –\t Saddle The World\t\t\r\nA7\tCold World –\t The Nihilistic Rant\t\t\r\nA8\tCold World –\t Nine Out Of Ten\t\t\r\nA9\tCold World –\t Event Horizon\t\t\r\nB1\tHummingbird Of Death –\t Nothing's Happening\t\t\r\nB2\tHummingbird Of Death –\t Space Fish\t\t\r\nB3\tHummingbird Of Death –\t There's No Basketball Game Here\t\t\r\nB4\tHummingbird Of Death –\t Goodbye Cool World\t\t\r\nB5\tHummingbird Of Death –\t Here Today, Gone Later Today\t\t\r\nB6\tHummingbird Of Death –\t Shocker\t\t\r\nB7\tHummingbird Of Death –\t USA, Motherfuckers\t\t\r\nB8\tHummingbird Of Death –\t Easy To Judge\t\t\r\nB9\tHummingbird Of Death –\t Anal Linguist","options":[{"id":42762690,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123801069/-/cold_hod.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123801069/-/cold_hod.jpg","width":600,"height":606},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123949068/-/DSC01803.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123949068/-/DSC01803.JPG","width":4281,"height":2800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325217,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"},{"id":3325223,"name":"Deep Six Records","permalink":"deep-six-records","url":"/category/deep-six-records"}]},{"id":12805608,"name":"ACXDC/To The Point -  split 7\" EP - grey marble vinyl","permalink":"to-the-point-acxdc-split-7-ep-purple-splatter-vinyl","position":9,"price":5.99,"default_price":5.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/to-the-point-acxdc-split-7-ep-purple-splatter-vinyl","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-06T11:46:32.000Z","description":"ACXDC / To The Point EP  limited to 400 on purple splatter vinyl also so on GREY MARBLE vinyl limited to 50 copies only.\r\n\r\nin at long last - very limited copies as always with TTP - no wholesale again, so same price as their previous releases - cost you $22 to get a copy direct, that's the score now buying from the USA\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/zYmOLfkR-LE\r\n\r\nA1\tACxDC –\t Untitled\t2:16\t\r\nA2\tACxDC –\t Bone Claw\t0:40\t\r\nA3\tACxDC –\t Broken // Fixed\t0:36\t\r\nA4\tACxDC –\t Fiction Monger\t1:08\t\r\nB1\tTo The Point –\t This Is Los Angeles\t\t\r\nB2\tTo The Point –\t Pillow Over The Face Of Powerviolence\t\t\r\nB3\tTo The Point –\t Be My Neighbor\t\t\r\nB4\tTo The Point –\t Listen To Morrissey And Cry\t\t\r\nB5\tTo The Point –\t Photos Of My Food\t\t\r\nB6\tTo The Point –\t We Stand.

Caveman powerviolence. The musicianship here is tighter than a nuns nether regions, and the songs are crafted just  how you would expect seasoned veterans of this style to make them; perfectly. I just love hearing Bob bash the shit out of a drum kit. Dude really blasts like no other, he definitely has captured a sound that is uniquely his own, with the very dry drum tone and super hard attack. It's also great to hear Chris Dodge, Caveman almighty, front a band again. Again, very early Lack Of Interest style vocals; gruff, low, and kind of cheesy. \r\n\r\nACxDC stands for Antichrist Demoncore. The band was founded in 2003 by Sergio, Pablo, Jeff, and JC. Within 2 years of playing together they released the Jack Trippin’ Demo, He Had it Comin’ 7”, and had 2 tracks on the Signs Of An Impending Doom Compilation. They quickly made their mark in the power violence/grindcore scene by playing tons of wild shows all over Southern California. By 2005 the band had called it quits, but in the summer of 2006 they decided to have a reunion show with all original members for one night only. Since then most of them went their separate ways and started working on other bands and projects. After years of talk between Sergio and Jose from Shoes Of Cement (formerly Hitem Where It Hurts) they decided to bring ACxDC back. They played a comeback show in 2010 with the two new members Bobby and Jose at the Workmens Circle in Los Angeles, California. Pablo and Bobby recently left the band and ACxDC recruited Jorge from Asshole Assassination Squad/Ruptures to play drums. The line up now consists of Sergio, Jeff, Jose, and Jorge. So look forward to new shows, new songs, and new records.","options":[{"id":40808856,"name":"purple splatter vinyl","price":5.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43547073,"name":"grey marble vinyl","price":5.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":1.8,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.5},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122377869/-/DSC01623.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122377869/-/DSC01623.JPG","width":2737,"height":2711},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124352493/-/DSC01634.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124352493/-/DSC01634.JPG","width":4157,"height":2293}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325215,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":3325223,"name":"Deep Six Records","permalink":"deep-six-records","url":"/category/deep-six-records"}]},{"id":12634287,"name":"Cülo - My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down EP - 7\" clear red vinyl + badge","permalink":"culo-my-brain-is-hanging-upside-down-ep-7-red-vinyl","position":10,"price":3.99,"default_price":3.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/culo-my-brain-is-hanging-upside-down-ep-7-red-vinyl","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-28T19:41:58.000Z","description":"from my mates (is he a mate or not, I've forgotten) label \r\n\r\nCBR-55 CULO- My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down EP\r\n\r\nFIRST PRESSING limited to 398 copies on clear light red vinyl with a very limited 90 copies on black vinyl.\r\n\r\nCOMES WITH FREE CULO BUTTON BADGE\r\n\r\nThe big reason I pressed this on wax is because the 2nd demo was the 1st release done by the band I was actually into, plus its always held a place in my heart okay? The 1st demo showed some promise but left much to be desired and although Nuke Abuse was a good debut EP, I still always came back to this recording for listening of the pre-Deranged yrs. The 2nd demo filled in all the gaps for me to the 1st demo. Song writing got better, its still rough and also VERY fast and retains the punk edge. A lot of this reminds me of a scrappy but midwestern version of Negative FX. Sure the 'MY LIFE SUCKS' LP is their finest effort (you're kidding yourself to disagree) but this shows the band in the early stages and what I felt is the 1st true example of what Cülo can offer.

Hailing from Belfast, North Ireland, Bleeding Rectum has core members from Pink Turds In Space as well as Marty, a second devastating, teenage lead guitarist and Roy, the sickeningly, evil vocalist. Bleeding Rectum are the \"real deal\" in true, rogue, blitzing power and form. They define hardcore punk with their unduplicated musicianship and total system-hating lyrical concepts. Roy's violent and clear delivery is ferocious as it is brilliant. The lead guitar is wicked without being too \"rock.” By today’s standards, Bleeding Rectum slays the competition with the highest levels of rebellion and musical prowess. A MUST LISTEN !! \r\nOn their fifth release, Man Is The Bastard explore new liberating and socially aware territories though the classic line-up of Barnes (guitar/noise), Connell (drums), Kenyon (bass/vocals/lyrics), and Wood (bass/vocals/lyrics). Tracks range in length from under one minute (\"Idget Child\") to over eight minutes (\"Infibulation\"). Man Is The Bastard’s dual bass and drums nucleus paired with the utter genius of Barnes' home made \"caveman electronics” hold their own easily within the grooves of this platter. The Kenyon/Wood dual vocal compositions raise the bar to take hardcore to a new progressive level of writing. This is the height of the early stages of Man Is The Bastard and tracks like \"Kai Lai\", \"Son Of Thug\" and \"Man Is The Bastard\" only define the band's passion beyond expectations. \r\n\r\nA1\tMan Is The Bastard –\t Idget Child\t\t\r\nA2\tMan Is The Bastard –\t Kai Lai\t\t\r\nA3\tMan Is The Bastard –\t Son Of Thug\t\t\r\nA4\tMan Is The Bastard –\t Infibulation\t\t\r\nA5\tMan Is The Bastard –\t Man Is The Bastard\t\t\r\nA6\tMan Is The Bastard –\t She Boar\t\t\r\nB1\tBleeding Rectum –\t USSA\t\t\r\nB2\tBleeding Rectum –\t Scorched Earth\t\t\r\nB3\tBleeding Rectum –\t PGM\t\t\r\nB4\tBleeding Rectum –\t Bloodbath\t\t\r\nB5\tBleeding Rectum –\t Why\t\t\r\nB6\tBleeding Rectum –\t 668 Neighbor Of The Beast\t\t\r\nB7\tBleeding Rectum –\t Untitled","options":[{"id":34951842,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.6,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120808914/-/MITB.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120808914/-/MITB.jpg","width":250,"height":250},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120828654/-/DSC01597.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120828654/-/DSC01597.JPG","width":983,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325217,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"},{"id":3325223,"name":"Deep Six Records","permalink":"deep-six-records","url":"/category/deep-six-records"}]},{"id":11032113,"name":"Charred Remains aka Man Is The Bastard/Bastard Noise - First Music First Noise - 7\"","permalink":"charred-remains-aka-man-is-the-bastard-bastard-noise-7","position":14,"price":4.99,"default_price":4.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/charred-remains-aka-man-is-the-bastard-bastard-noise-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-08T17:05:16.000Z","description":"Charred Remains aka Man Is The Bastard/Bastard Noise - 7\"\r\nFirst Music First Noise\r\n\r\nVery limited mailorder only copies on blue vinyl with black swirls - limited to 50 copies worldwide - gatefold cover with two inserts.\r\n\r\nThe first sessions from each \"face\" of this dual personality unit feature the earliest recordings of the original line-ups of Charred Remains (S.

Missbrukarna are perhaps most famous for being a huge influence on Totalitär, and if that's the only way you know them you may be surprised how catchy and punk the material on this double LP is. While bands like Anti-Cimex and s***lickers were pioneering the raw punk sound in the very same country, Missbrukarna kept the catchiness of '77 punk and oi!, sounding quite a lot like their Finnish compatriots in bands like Appendix, Melakka, and (early) Rattus, or even more melodic Europunk like Ivy Green in places. Still, despite the presence of something almost resembling melody, this is blindingly fast, supremely catchy, and exhilaratingly intense. In terms of packaging, this is how a reissue should be done... gatefold sleeve featuring a TON of photos reproduced beautifully in full color, a rad essay by Andreas of Totalit\u0015är about the band's history and importance, and mastering that makes this sound just as good as any bigger punk releases of the day. Seriously, I cannot stress enough how essential this package is... highest possible recommendation!

The \r\n1st EP was amazing but the look about it turned a lot of people off, so I can only hope the cover for my record which isn't pixelated will dispell any negativity (which should have been minor at best) people had about the band prior.

Don't be fooled by the hilarious intro to the title cut--this EP hauls its load fast and furious in the new Swedish tradition. - Pushead (from Maximum Rock'n'Roll #13, April/May 1984) - The band is still active and I recommend this 5 piece of classic swedish hardcore tunes.\r\n-Special Thanks to Fredrik -\r\n","options":[{"id":35998152,"name":"Default","price":3.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":1.8,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112444026/-/EATER.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112444026/-/EATER.jpg","width":393,"height":388},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116621682/-/DSC01518.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116621682/-/DSC01518.JPG","width":944,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325215,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":5473029,"name":"Hardcore Survives Records","permalink":"hardcore-survives-records","url":"/category/hardcore-survives-records"}]},{"id":11014359,"name":"Krossa - S/T - 7\"","permalink":"krossa-s-t-7","position":34,"price":3.99,"default_price":3.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/krossa-s-t-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-07T21:16:21.000Z","description":"KROSSA – S/T – 7” \r\n\r\norange and yellow vinyl\r\n\r\nJapanese band influenced by Disarm, Avskum, Anticimex, S.O.D, etc. because of they are Japanese the sound is a bit more dirty, chaotic and crustier! comes on colored vinyl.","options":[{"id":34646283,"name":"Default","price":3.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":1.8,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108314493/-/degenerik_blog_krossa_original.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108314493/-/degenerik_blog_krossa_original.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108314613/-/DSC01320.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108314613/-/DSC01320.JPG","width":316,"height":186},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108314850/-/blogg_krossa_7.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108314850/-/blogg_krossa_7.jpg","width":567,"height":425}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325215,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":4830400,"name":"D-Takt & Råpunk","permalink":"d-takt-rapunk","url":"/category/d-takt-rapunk"}]},{"id":10305070,"name":"Institution - Domen Är Satt - 12\" red vinyl","permalink":"institution-domen-ar-satt-12-red-vinyl","position":35,"price":7.99,"default_price":7.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/institution-domen-ar-satt-12-red-vinyl","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-02T16:59:16.000Z","description":"Institution - Domen Är Satt - 12\" red vinyl Limited to 300 copies only worldwide on red vinyl.\r\n\r\nSold out everywhere in just a few days last time around - get it while you can - check it out -- \r\n\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/denihilrecords/institution-domen-r-satt\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/denihilrecords/institution-krossar-dig\r\n\r\nFine Swedish hardcore blended with crust -  Check out their very first gig     http://youtu.be/pDw9iAAU5Oo\r\n\r\nThe band that did one of the three best records of 2012 - I shouldn't have to go on about how much you need this.

The initial practicing lineup consisted of 10,000 Marbles (Guitar), Concentration Camp (Vocals), and Mustard Gas (Bass Guitar). Just prior to recording their demo tape, Concentration Camp moved to guitar and vocal duties were taken over by Pink Eyes (also known as Mr. Damian). Drums are played by Mr. Jo (also credited as G. Beat or J. Falco) and Young Governor was added as a third guitarist in 2007.\r\nFollowing the release of the demo, the band embarked on a long series of 7” vinyl 45 rpms. Unlike many of their contemporaries, the band shunned full length LP or CD formats, preferring to output their music two songs at a time. While some record distributors refused to carry the singles, they were generally released to broad appeal, receiving glowing reviews in many punk fanzines. The artwork and feel of the records was a tribute to the [Dangerhouse Records era of punk vinyl.","options":[{"id":35935338,"name":"Default","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":1.8,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112261194/-/fucc.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112261194/-/fucc.jpeg","width":499,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112261326/-/DSC01470.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112261326/-/DSC01470.JPG","width":1000,"height":859}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325215,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":4362143,"name":"Deranged Records","permalink":"deranged-records","url":"/category/deranged-records"}]},{"id":11109627,"name":"Phobia - Means To Existence - LP","permalink":"phobia-means-to-existence-lp","position":38,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/phobia-means-to-existence-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-12T16:46:50.000Z","description":" IN STOCK NOW\r\n\r\nPhobia - Means To Existence - LP - limited colour vinyl\r\nrepress with Poster.

This was proven by the fact that they were given a residency at the infamous Roxy club, and went on to become the band that played there the most times, a feat in itself!!\r\nThe Plague released a single, the brilliant ‘In Love’ on the cult ‘Psycho’ label in 1978—the first pressing of 500 copies sold out quickly and the single was re-issued on the ‘Evolution’ label in a pressing of 6000 copies, which also sold like Punky hot cakes!  The band released a second single, but there is some mystery surrounding this as it was thought for many years to have been withdrawn.  The band deny this, but there is no explanation as to why this single is so rare.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenal LP gathers together the bands entire recorded output, even including their first ever recordings made in a front room of one of the band members parents house in 1976.  Featuring many previously unreleased tracks and coming in packaging that features tonnes of rare and unseen photos this is a release that you cannot afford to be without.

Their first gig was at Walmer Castle in Peckham in South East London. The two main members of the group had pretty polar opposite views. Chubby was nigh on racism and Depford John was far from racist. There was a riot at one of their gigs on the Arena TV show in ‘82. The band sort of called it a day a while after.

They were punks at school, but the idea of forming their own band came when they saw The Adverts in Colchester. However, the three schoolboys couldn’t play and didn’t own any instruments. In spite on that, it didn’t discourage them. They decided to put Arrogant on vocals, Duty on guitar and Baker on Bass. With regard to their drummer, they had none, until that they asked to Stuart Bray, an 18 year old well respected punk of their region. Soon after that, they met Bart Povah who joined their group at the guitar. \r\n\r\nIn 1982 Arrogant decided to declare war to the anarcho-punk band Crass.They released an LP 77 in 82 which was followed by their biggest selling single “Bullshit Crass”. However, after that, their music’s leading distributors refused to stock their material. This censorship made life a burden for the band. In 1983 they released the single “Punk Rocker” who was not well distributed. In the same year, the group broke off.\r\nTwelve years later, the band was back on scene for the 1995’s Fuck Reading at the Brixton Academy. After that the group didn’t split again and now, they are still gigging and recording.\r\n\r\nSuperb near mint condition - cover has slight ringwear ","options":[{"id":35889735,"name":"Default","price":49.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112113966/-/aaa.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112113966/-/aaa.jpg","width":150,"height":150},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112114002/-/aa.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112114002/-/aa.jpg","width":750,"height":462}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325215,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":3761449,"name":"UK 70/80's Punk/Oi/Anarcho Punk/KBD/Powerpop","permalink":"uk-70-80-s-punk-oi-anarcho-punk-kbd-powerpop","url":"/category/uk-70-80-s-punk-oi-anarcho-punk-kbd-powerpop"}]},{"id":12277395,"name":"The Undertones - Teenage Kicks - 7\" Good Vibrations green cover","permalink":"the-undertones-teenage-kick-7-good-vibrations-green-cover","position":42,"price":109.99,"default_price":109.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-undertones-teenage-kick-7-good-vibrations-green-cover","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-10T00:25:34.000Z","description":"Good Vibrations Records ‎– GOT 4 - 1978 - original press out centre vinyl - green fold out cover has tiny 1mm split on top fold and usual slight edge discolour - genuine cover with 'hard-sized 64 mill' watermark imprinted in paper.","options":[{"id":38931816,"name":"Default","price":109.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120966510/-/un.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120966510/-/un.jpeg","width":599,"height":599},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120966786/-/DSC01539.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120966786/-/DSC01539.JPG","width":1000,"height":769},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120966990/-/DSC01540.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120966990/-/DSC01540.JPG","width":1000,"height":705}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325215,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":3761449,"name":"UK 70/80's Punk/Oi/Anarcho Punk/KBD/Powerpop","permalink":"uk-70-80-s-punk-oi-anarcho-punk-kbd-powerpop","url":"/category/uk-70-80-s-punk-oi-anarcho-punk-kbd-powerpop"}]},{"id":12150069,"name":"The Outcasts ‎– Justa Nother Teenage Rebel / Love Is For Sops - 7\"","permalink":"the-outcasts-justa-nother-teenage-rebel-love-is-for-sops-7","position":43,"price":89.99,"default_price":89.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-outcasts-justa-nother-teenage-rebel-love-is-for-sops-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-02T23:20:06.000Z","description":"Good Vibrations Records ‎– GOT3 - 1978\r\n\r\nMint unplayed - a superb copy as new off the shelf with press out centre and pink foldout poster cover - you won't find a better copy\r\n\r\nThe Outcasts were formed in June 1977 in Belfast by the three Cowan brothers, Greg Cowan (vocals / bass), Martin Cowan (guitar/vocals), Colin Cowan (drums) and their friend Colin ‘Getty’ Getgoog (guitar), playing their first gig two months later. ‘You’re A Disease’ / ‘Don’t Want To Be No Adult’ / ‘Frustration’ (It, 1978) is easily the roughest sounding early Outcasts single, ‘You’re A Disease’ stands out as the best track. ‘Frustration’ was later re-recorded for the 1982 LP ‘Blood & Thunder’. ‘Just Another Teenage Rebel’ / ‘Love Is For Sops’ (Good Vibrations, 1978) captures the Outcasts at their best, punk rock with a pop edge, both tracks are classics.

While they did receive airplay on the John Peel radio show in the UK, as well as recording some Peel Sessions for the program the band The Cigarettes only ever released an EP and a single while they were still active. The Cigarettes were a trio of musicians consisting of Rob Smith on guitar/vocals/piano, Steve Taylor on bass/vocals and Adam Palmer on drums. The band was also difficult to pinpoint due to the fact that they mixed a variety of styles and a public image that was not easily defined. Were they Punk? Were they Mod? Were they Power Pop? You could argue for either avenue of musical justification, but the truth is they were all of the above. They looked kind of like Mod’s their music mixed a variety of elements that at times sounded like Power Pop topped off with a Buzzcocks Spiral Scratch flare, but in other circumstances they also sounded like a straight up 77 era UK Punk band or a Mod Rock band.  \r\n\r\nIn 1979, The Cigarettes released a three track EP featuring the songs “They’re Back Again, Here They Come”, “I’ve Forgot My Number (Now I’m Telling You My Name)” and “All We Want Is Your Money”. This EP which was titled They're Back Again, Here They Come, mixed the previously aforementioned genres and proves to be the strongest release in the bands catalogue while they were still active. A single followed in 1980 called “I Can’t Sleep At Night”, it would be one of their last releases. The band split in 1981. The Cigarettes were also featured on a few compilations, which over the years kept them in the knowledge of the few underground musicologists. In 2002, The Cigarettes released a 30 track album compiling material from their 1979 EP, 1980 single, unreleased studio tracks, live tracks and John Peel Session tracks. The Cigarettes – Will Damage Your Health was released on Detour Records and is the definitive compilation of a short lived UK band that no matter what ingredients made up their recipe for music, the results speak for themselves. - many thanx to Revolution Rock.\r\n\r\nSuperb unplayed condition","options":[{"id":35887155,"name":"Default","price":99.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112106286/-/cigs.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112106286/-/cigs.jpeg","width":300,"height":306},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112106334/-/cigssss.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112106334/-/cigssss.jpeg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112106358/-/cigs1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112106358/-/cigs1.jpg","width":700,"height":700}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325215,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":3761449,"name":"UK 70/80's Punk/Oi/Anarcho Punk/KBD/Powerpop","permalink":"uk-70-80-s-punk-oi-anarcho-punk-kbd-powerpop","url":"/category/uk-70-80-s-punk-oi-anarcho-punk-kbd-powerpop"}]},{"id":14780112,"name":"Bored Teenagers Vol.5 - LP 15 punk originals 77-'82","permalink":"bored-teenagers-vol-5-lp-various-artists","position":45,"price":7.99,"default_price":7.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bored-teenagers-vol-5-lp-various-artists","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-11T22:25:08.000Z","description":"The bands featured are BLITZ who first found fame by playing more gigs than any other band at the famous ROXY CLUB in 1978.

Word is that the Center for Disease Control is gonna have to have Buck & Co. quarantined for causing everyone they come into contact with to jump around the room spazzily, playing air guitar. Stellar, super, spectacular, sensational, spendiferous... They self-released their first split single, record number 2 is out on Deranged Records from Canada, this is number 3, record number 4 will soon be out on Killer Records from Finland, then comes the album on Deranged in Canada again. They really are \"International,\" you see -- and they're in the process of taking over the world! This record is a must for fans of 1977-style Britpunk or early 1980s American power-pop, and fits in nicely next to bands like THE STATUES, CUTE LEPERS, and TRANZMITORS.

They cover a BEATNIK TERMITES song with authority, that'll tell you where they're at. Ultra smooth, dreamy thick vox over crunchy guitars. HIT TUNES!!! This is my new favorite band and I'm sure it will be the same for many of you as well. I think it is. First 500 on red vinyl. The plant ran out of red stock after just 203 copies and had to buy vinyl from another plant -- which came in a totally different shade! Imprint also ran the sleeve with a defective font with typos on the back and wound up redoing things. So the first 200 out the door are gonna be a little special -- the rare shade of vinyl in the typo sleeves... Yowza! And it's not only one of the best MP records ever. \r\n\r\nTHE LOBLAWS \"Won't Stop!\" Seriously, they won't. Dig the new breed, Mutant Pop 2.0: The Loblaws hail from Nashville, Tennessee, home of dumb country music and dumber country music fans. But don't hold their city against them, these guys aren't country in the least -- they have roots in a killer underground pop-punk band called The Robinsons, which toiled magnificently in New Orleans until a little storm called Katrina came along and scattered 'em... The three brothers and friend in this band (the latter a member of BACKSEAT VIRGINS) have been at it for a decade now in various groups and by now they have the songwriting and recording thangs down cold -- incredible pop-punk hooks and layer after layer of sugar sweet harmonies copped from THE BEACH BOYS. They cover the BEATNIK TERMITES on this four song debut record -- few bands can pull that challenging task off -- and they do it spectacularly. A taste of RAMONES downstroking, some of the catchiest originals you're ever gonna hear, and MASTERFUL vocal delivery makes for a very satisfying 4 song pop-punk rip... Another Mutant Pop record and a Mutant Pop CD are forthcoming in the next 12 months, jump on this train before it leaves the station! -- T.

After messed up test presses to start off with and then a long awaited 2nd set to arrive, the record def had its share of problems (not by the bands end nor mine). This also is the debut record of new vocalist Adam Jennings, whom you may know best from Winters In Osaka. Adam's brutal vocals devestate on this more lo fi but still shining recording and the fact that Robert quit the band which at the time was a downer, was almost a 'godsend' seeing they got Adam to replace him and not slow down a thing. I mean, you can't hear it but his presence breathed new life into this band and seeing them live and thus more lively in that setting is awesome. Still playing tight and well executed fast grindcore with 80's thrash, doom, death metal and punk elements interwoven into the mix. Yet with all the posi print they get despite being a hard working band they're still so underrated, maybe due to the fact they're hindered due to work not allowing em' to tour a whole lot. It'd be nice to see that change with the release of this LP, which is without a doubt the best release these guys have to date easily and to be so bold one of the best grind albums of 2013.

Then apart from his freakishly godlike guitar skills he showcases in his certain 3 piece band by the name of Tenement, that he remains more of a drummer. But I also knew about a band he drummed in called Harlequin Kid that his local Appleton friend Zacc Baehman was also in with him. They had released a demo/EP tape sometime in 2009 on their 'house label' and I want to say broke up in 2010. Then along came Technicolor Teeth-which was both Amos and Zacc again but also now with their friend Matt instead of Justin who was in HK. I am not certain if this is a continuation of Harlequin Kid, but I got the feeling it is unofficially. Well, TT released a tape only album 'Teenage Pagans' in 2012 (may or may not see its vinyl treatment via Houseplant in 2013?) on Lets Pretend based out of Bloomington, Indiana (and home to Paul Mahern!). I had seen the band in 2011 at a Bored Straight/Leather show and fell in love there, but it wasn't until I obtained the cassette album that I had asked to do a record then knowing these guys had done something of a release. These 3 Wisconsin lads play a great shoegaze/DIY indie rock hybrid but its also very catchy, not just mired in 'dreamy' territory like most bands of the genre and thankfully done very PUNK. I mean, you can probably gather something what they sound like just from those explanatory words I imagine so I'll leave that there. Each 1 of the 3 members wrote a song here on this 3 song EP too, where each has a different feel to it which makes it so much better.

Come sometime in later 2012, the band name 'THE ROPES' was already taken by some crap band from Rhode Island who of course threatened legal action since they couldn't cut it themselves and were too ego struck to let it be taken, so the guys went back to using the old REPOS moniker once more.

Later Rikard Olsson joined on bass and Pjär Karlman on vocals. After some rehearsals also Simon Frid joined on vocals and we were complete!\r\nThe plan was to record an album already in the fall of 2011 but it was not possible because of other bands and duties... Finally a full-length album was recorded in Studio Underjord, Stockholm 11-13 May 2012 with Joona. The full-length \"Välj Din Egen Bödel\" will be released in early 2013 by D-Takt & Råpunk Records(Swe) on LP! The CD will be released by Totalpunk Records(Rus) also early 2013. It will also be released on MC (Cassette) by Nuclear Terror Victims(Swe) as well.\r\nIn the end of 2012 our longtime axeman Kenneth Wiklund decided to leave the band because of undefined problems with his hands/fingers. Too bad that he have to quit but we hope he will get recovered very soon! So now Rikard have replaced Kenneth on guitar and the new bassplayer is Daniel Sandelin (Jailbreak Academy, ex Crossing Chaos etc.).\r\nA1\t\t Tala Till Punkt\t\t\r\nA2\t\t Radiation Sickness\t\t\r\nA3\t\t Jag Säger Det Igen\t\t\r\nA4\t\t Käppar I Hjulen\t\t\r\nA5\t\t Under Slaktarens Kniv\t\t\r\nA6\t\t The New Disease\t\t\r\nA7\t\t Infantil\t\t\r\nA8\t\t Narrow Minded Bastard\t\t\r\nB1\t\t Four Decades\t\t\r\nB2\t\t Legalized Crimes\t\t\r\nB3\t\t D-Beat Terrorist\t\t\r\nB4\t\t Välj Din Egen Bödel\t\t\r\nB5\t\t Ränderna Går Aldrig Ur\t\t\r\nB6\t\t Människohandel\t\t\r\nB7\t\t The Cove Of Slaughter","options":[{"id":31091071,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/97660315/-/para.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/97660315/-/para.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/97740823/-/parasit.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/97740823/-/parasit.jpg","width":567,"height":375},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/118972290/-/DSC01530.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/118972290/-/DSC01530.JPG","width":392,"height":257}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325217,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"},{"id":4830400,"name":"D-Takt & Råpunk","permalink":"d-takt-rapunk","url":"/category/d-takt-rapunk"}]},{"id":9921724,"name":"Deathraid / Desperat ‎– Split 12\"","permalink":"deathraid-desperat-split-12","position":65,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/deathraid-desperat-split-12","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-14T06:55:52.000Z","description":"500 pressed on 180 gram black vinyl. Gatefold sleeve and insert with English translations of Desperat lyrics.\r\nThis one, I know took forever to come to light, but its a FUCKING GEM and well worth the wait.  Both bands are at the top of their form.  DESPERAT were the first side I threw on and all I could think was, its really amazing that there are some guys out there that can just keep on coming up with catchy and straightforward guitar riffs that don’t sound generic, year after year and it seems that Ake from DESPERAT is just one of those guys.  Look back thru the mass of songs that he has cranked out over the years.  I might even like this better than the MOB 47 of his past(which is really saying something).  Raw and simple, just like you’d expect.  DESPERAT have proved again that they are in a class above most.  Catchy guitars carry forward alot of the speed of DESPERAT but Chrille (also an alum of MOB 47) lays down the pulse with cracking precision on the drums.  With Jocke from WARVICTIMS barking out lyrics about the close-mindedness of some punk scenes, the rich and privileged, and facing a modern world that may be beyond any hope.  And it all comes across as urgent and passionate as ever.  Maybe even more so, because they aren’t simply frustrated teenagers anymore.  They even have a song about this; the moment where you realize that you have become an adult with responsibilities that would have made you “boring” when you were a kid, and the fact that you gotta make extra effort as you get older not to align yourself to the systems of the modern world.  I also like the fact that the gatefold cover has the lyrics in Swedish, but with a little rant in English about the song and what it is all about.  DESPERAT may be some older dudes but they are still kickin ass and taking names.KILLER.    DEATHRAID kicks off the other side right were they left off after the “All Life Ends” LP from a few years back, which was a record that I would champion to anyone that would listen to me.  These songs were recorded back in 2010 not too long after that release and perfectly carries on.  All the tracks are so intense and powerful that I can’t stop listening!  The bass is so thundering and violent, the guitars so tight, the drums so furious!   Pick up the needle and start over.  Repeat.  Repeat….  DEATHRAID is the absolute best of HC punk today but with more confidence and swagger which only adds to its power.  To top it all off, Jay’s vocals are total savagery and it never sounded sweeter.  In a gatefold cover with a killer painting from Halsey gracing the cover.  World Funeral has yet another masterpiece on his hands here.   Find a copy today.

The tape caught the attention of Svart Records, and this cult album is now being reissued on vinyl, wrapped in gatefold covers and limited to 400.

For various reasons, however, even though the band gained cult popularity and played plenty of gigs, they did not end up in the studio until 1987. The resulting debut EP Maailmanloppu (reissued on Svart Records) is a Finnish hardcore mini classic. \r\n\r\nTerveyskeskus is perhaps best known for the extracurricular activities of its members, and Mana Mana in particular: band leader Tumppi is a founding member in Mana Mana, and MM guitarist Otra also plays in Terveyskeskus. While Mana Mana's music is built of layers upon layers of eastern-flavored heavy guitars and doomy moods, Terveyskeskus concentrates on the raw, primal energy of classic hardcore punk. \r\n\r\nWhile never actually splitting up, Terveyskeskus has been on the backburner for the past 20 years. In 2012 original members Tumppi and Salttu found themselves putting a new lineup together and recording a new album. The result is Omat koirat puree (\"Your own dogs will bite you\"), a furious 11-song burst. \r\n","options":[{"id":27777785,"name":"Default","price":7.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.6,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87023324/-/terveyskeskus-omat-koirat-puree-lp.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87023324/-/terveyskeskus-omat-koirat-puree-lp.jpg","width":900,"height":959}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325217,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"},{"id":3578991,"name":"Svart Records","permalink":"svart-records","url":"/category/svart-records"}]},{"id":8788301,"name":"Noisear - Turbulent Resurgence - LP pink vinyl","permalink":"noisear-turbulent-resurgence-lp-pink-vinyl","position":85,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/noisear-turbulent-resurgence-lp-pink-vinyl","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-04T18:31:43.000Z","description":"Turbulent Resurgence limited to 100 copies worldwide on pink vinyl\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=3cWHfuryDf8\r\n\r\nOne of the most forward-thinking grind acts in extreme metal today are returning with another album of spontaneous, off-the-wall, grindcore pandemonium!

The LP was a luxurious package for its time and genre, it featured a 12 page A4 booklet and a 12\" insert meant to be used as a graffiti stencil. Kohu-63 went on hiatus for a couple of years with Lättä in prison, so the buzz around the band died down and the album became one of the rarest Finnish hardcore LPs. Copies with both inserts intact change hands for sums up to 200 euros. \r\n\r\nThe Svart reissue is otherwise an exact repro of the original - with the booklet and the stencil - apart from the addition of a one-sided 7\". It consists of rare uncensored versions of two songs which appeared on the album in censored form: \"Poliisit on verisii persereikii\" (The police are bloody assholes) and \"Me ollaan jumalia\" (We are gods). When the label heard the recording sessions, the band were requested to change the profane lyrics of these blatant anti-authoritarian and anti-religious ditties. Kohu-63 recorded new versions of these tracks in later years, but the original -82 uncensored versions remained unreleased. Until now, that is. \r\n\r\nAvailable on standard black and limited red vinyl. \r\n\r\nA1\t\t Rakkaus On Sairautta\t1:47\t\r\nA2\t\t Lisää Verta Historiaan\t1:46\t\r\nA3\t\t Sotaa\t0:57\t\r\nA4\t\t Valtaa III\t1:27\t\r\nA5\t\t Turmellus\t2:45\t\r\nA6\t\t Ihmisii?\t1:46\t\r\nA7\t\t Teillä Ei Oo Maailmaa\t1:53\t\r\nA8\t\t Tulevaisuus Lohduttaa\t2:19\t\r\nB1\t\t Tääkö On Vapautta\t1:29\t\r\nB2\t\t Me Ollaan Jumalia\t1:15\t\r\nB3\t\t Olet Täydellinen\t1:51\t\r\nB4\t\t Valtaa IV\t1:30\t\r\nB5\t\t Kyllästynyt\t2:22\t\r\nB6\t\t Näytä Niille\t1:25\t\r\nB7\t\t Kaatakaa Rauhanjuna\t1:35\t\r\nB8\t\t Punakaartilaisten Marssi\r\n","options":[{"id":26226492,"name":"Default","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.6,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81915105/-/kohu-63-lisaa-verta-historiaan-lp-7.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81915105/-/kohu-63-lisaa-verta-historiaan-lp-7.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84559593/-/DSC01172.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84559593/-/DSC01172.JPG","width":985,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325217,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"},{"id":3578991,"name":"Svart Records","permalink":"svart-records","url":"/category/svart-records"}]},{"id":8329659,"name":"Loose Prick - Valkoiset sotilaat - LP white vinyl","permalink":"loose-prick-valkoiset-sotilaat-lp","position":92,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/loose-prick-valkoiset-sotilaat-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-02T22:21:09.000Z","description":"Limited to 300 on WHITE vinyl with gatefold cover.\r\n\r\nIN STOCK NOW\r\n\r\nLoose Prick, the classic punk quartet from Kouvola, Finland, kicked off their career with two seven inches at the tail end of the seventies and then put out the debut full length 'Valkoiset sotilaat' on Poko Records in the summer of 1980.

It was this or maybe a 1 sided 7'' and felt less dirty with this option. This was recorded a year ago and took a long time to come out on both ends, but it finally made it! I actually prefer this short record (3 minutes) most of all from the Toof as its short, nasty and sweet- no pun intended. And as far as a flexi recording sound goes, this works pretty good and actually sounds good for a flexi. All a matter of opinion of course. Comes in a regular cardstock foldover cover and even has an insert,, so its treated like a regular release and not just a flexi in a polybag. And there's even a COLOR option here- RED or BLACK. Red is more limited of course to 100, so please specify. This is a 1 time press of 400 flexis and not small pressed as a gimmick, just seemed right to not overdo it. -  Sick Nick Cowabunga Records.\r\n\r\nA1  Fuckhead    \r\nA2  Upside Down    \r\nA3  Smegs    \r\nA4  Weekend Punk    \r\nA5  I Am Blister  \r\n","options":[{"id":31487512,"name":"black vinyl","price":1.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":1.8,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.5},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/79806165/-/Sweet_Tooth_blister_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/79806165/-/Sweet_Tooth_blister_cover.jpg","width":707,"height":718},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/85508513/-/Sweet_Tooth_blister_1cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/85508513/-/Sweet_Tooth_blister_1cover.jpg","width":600,"height":603},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/85508549/-/Sweet_Tooth_blister_2cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/85508549/-/Sweet_Tooth_blister_2cover.jpg","width":600,"height":598},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/85508657/-/Sweet_Tooth_blister_3cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/85508657/-/Sweet_Tooth_blister_3cover.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325215,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":3325221,"name":"Cowabunga Records","permalink":"cowabunga-records","url":"/category/cowabunga-records"}]},{"id":8117196,"name":"Brown Sugar- Luvly EP - 7\" + badge","permalink":"brown-sugar-luvly-ep-7","position":94,"price":1.99,"default_price":1.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/brown-sugar-luvly-ep-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-21T14:51:32.000Z","description":"Black vinyl - includes free Brown Sugar logo button badge\r\n\r\nfrom my mates (is he a mate or not, I've forgotten) label \r\n\r\nHere's the Buffalo band's latest material and this is also some of their strongest output.

I've definitely narrowed it down to 3, this being one of them. I'm sure you've all heard of To The Point by now; the unstoppable group comprised of members of Actuary, Fetus Eaters, Lack Of Interest and Spazz. Caveman powerviolence. \"Success In Failure\" is their 2nd EP this year, a beautiful 1-sided 7\" in what will probably be a series of EP's of this nature (their previous EP was also 1-sided). Honestly, this new one blows the first completely out of the water for me. And I'm really not sure why. Maybe it's because now I knew what to expect, whereas with the first, the release really was kind of shrouded in mystery. No audio clips, not a nothing was presented before the release. Now, I know the type of noise To The Point bring, and it's a style that I just absolutely love. Total and complete Lack Of Interest-core. Everything that made LoI great is executed perfectly in To The Point, which is no surprise given the people involved. I guess it you could say that there's a distracting lack of originality here, but fuck that noise, because this EP is the jam. Just as the band name advertises, these guys don't fuck around and give you nothing but the best stop/start, hard blasting songs that you're likely to hear all year. The musicianship here is tighter than a nuns nether regions, and the songs are crafted just how you would expect seasoned veterans of this style to make them; perfectly. I just love hearing Bob bash the shit out of a drum kit. Dude really blasts like no other, he definitely has captured a sound that is uniquely his own, with the very dry drum tone and super hard attack. It's also great to hear Chris Dodge, Caveman almighty, front a band again. Again, very early Lack Of Interest style vocals; gruff, low, and kind of cheesy. This 7\" is nothing short of absolutely fantastic, and I highly suggest every single one of you to hunt it down and keep tabs on their upcoming releases.\r\nTo The Point - \"Success In Failure\": To The Point are one of my favorite new bands, a band that I will buy anything that they release. \"Success In Failure\" completely sold me on this band, it's a 7\" that I completely fell in love with at first listen. Old-school powerviolence runs through the veins of all the members of this band, and they bash out quality song after quality song with years of experience to back them up. Listen to this band immediately and if you find this record, buy it without any hesitation.\r\nhttp://grindtodeath.com/zine/time-to-grind-2012\r\nA1\t\t 25. No Friend Of Bill W.\t\t\r\nA2\t\t 15.

Faces Of Meth\r\n\r\nAnother superb review from  Grind To Death  http://grindtodeath.com/zine/review-to-the-point-success-in-failure-2012 \r\nLack of Interest 2.0 aka To The Point surge along that Chris Dodge Midas touch (Spazz, Despise You and Low Threat Profile to name but a few) and bankrupt the value of powerviolence gold by offering what has to be the most laconic yet steadfast powerviolence vintage to date. Success In Failure the second installment to the bands  rip-roaring plunder of one sided 7\"s is a good arms reach better than the first, not for better songwriting to which they are en par, but the frictionless dynamic between tracks and passages escalates quickly into one of the most big souled and inviting musical muck-a-rounds out there. In a one part booze to another part youthful ambition with no comprehension of self-restraint, they go head-charging in to some of the most gratifying and frisky bpm abuse out there. Hitting the ground running with what now is the greatest powerviolence sing along and tribute to ye olde faithful, Alcohol, opening track No Friend of Bill W, sets a cast iron bond between listener and music, yanking you into their fast paced world of adrenaline and back alley venues. This scamper is then followed by a duo of scene lecturing, In It For Life bashes all those scuttling rats to whom hardcore was just a phase they exploited for image and following track Free Ride vents against all those leeches who harass bands for free stuff on some perverse moral illusion that the bands owe you shit. Both rip forth in a great detonation of energy grooving in a strapping character as they glide those mushroom clouds of decibels, ending on a funky twirl before jumping back in with the regime of mosh to the sounds of Socially Inept Network. Following track Infected doesn't stray from the game plan, but offers a solid stomp around no less, but its chaser Decisions I Immediately Regret maddens itself into a state of bitter hostilities and sees those caveman howls reach climactic zeniths in their true environment. J Randellesque end note Faces of Meth see the band ending on a high note and you turning the needle back for another listen, a process which repeats itself at least a dozen times. The Achilles heel to this release is flagrantly its lack of length, something the band need not address alone, there is no shortage of bands and virgin material out there that could of filled the other half, sure only a handful of bands could offer something on a similar level quality wise, and perhaps fewer still offer something that plays around in the same general scope of activity, but as they say the more the merrier. However quality always trumps quantity, and the quality on offer here is legendary, completely worthy of its Slap a Ham patrimony. \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":25344918,"name":"Default","price":6.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":1.8,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.5},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/78913209/-/toThePointOrders042412.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/78913209/-/toThePointOrders042412.jpg","width":960,"height":959},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86423837/-/DSC01177.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86423837/-/DSC01177.JPG","width":903,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86423993/-/toThePointOrder042412.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86423993/-/toThePointOrder042412.jpg","width":960,"height":717}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325215,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":3325223,"name":"Deep Six Records","permalink":"deep-six-records","url":"/category/deep-six-records"}]},{"id":7692786,"name":"The Skeptix ‎– Return To Hell - 7\"","permalink":"the-skeptix-return-to-hell-7","position":97,"price":8.99,"default_price":8.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-skeptix-return-to-hell-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-26T09:37:52.000Z","description":"Zenon Records – Skep 003 - 1983\r\n\r\nAnother Day/Return To Hell/War Drum  \r\n\r\nThe Skeptix , punk band from Stoke on Trent, UK, was formed by Jacko (bassist), Chig (drummer), Stan (vocalist) and Fish (guitarrist) in 1978, their original name was The Vermin when they were at school, then Chaos and finally The Skeptix. \r\nStarting the eighties Stan and Jacko left the band and were replaced by Snotty (who was to be the manager) and Ush.

The music meant empowerment for many people to take chances and not worry about consequences. This was especially so for women like guitarist Marlene Marder and bassist Klaudia Schiff, the two constants/mainstays of the group. \r\nWhen punk groups began springing up in Zurich, it was a very small scene with a handful of bands that all knew each other, not many places to play and virtually no support from radio stations or the press there. Marder (originally a saxophonist) had played with a group called the Nasal Boys. Two experimental film-makers, Schiff and drummer Lislot Ha had been bouncing around the idea of forming group before hooking up with the appropriately-named vocalist Regula Sing and a male guitarist who had much more ambitious musician plans. Marder liked what she heard from the band and was glad to step in to replace him. Indeed, the group’s aim was to have fun, more than to become rich and famous. Armed with a repertoire of four-songs and three chords, Kleenex wowed the local crowds with their simple, child-like rock ditties, filled with joyful chants and nonsense words in the tradition of Little Richard’s “Tutti Frutti” but musically more in the noisy, exuberant spirit of their British comrades the Sex Pistols. \r\nKleenex had local friends who decided to start up a label (Sunrise) where the band put out their first (self-financed) EP in 1978, which included the same four songs from their live sets (“Beri-Beri,” “Ain’t You,” “Hedi’s Head,” “Nice”). The response was such that the first pressing sold out in weeks. A copy of the EP managed to get to John Peel, the famous English DJ, who fell in love with it and played it over and over for his radio listeners. Rough Trade got wind of their strange, wonderful music and signed the group to a record contract. Their first single (“Ain’t You” and “Hedi’s Head” from the EP) made a splash with the UK press and led the label to organize a group of dates around Europe with label-mates Scritti Politti and Red Krayola. Not even a year after their formation, the group was already an international sensation even though, at the time, they still held various clerical jobs back in Zurich. \r\nComing to England, they were unimaginatively dubbed the ‘Swiss Slits’ by the press and made their next single (“You”/”U”, 1979) with Krayola leader/Rough Trade producer Mayo Thompson. Soon, they were off headlining an English ‘package tour’ with local favorites like the Raincoats, Swell Maps, Subway Sect and Spizz Energi. \r\nAfter the tour ended in late ’79, Sing left the group to be replaced by Chrigle Freund, a recent high school dropout, much younger than the rest of the group. With the loss of their original singer and threats to destroy all their records by the tissue company which they took their name from, the group rechristened itself as Liliput in 1980, soon adding saxist Angie Barrack to their ranks. This five-piece line up recorded their next single ‘Die Matrosen/Split’ with its famous nonsense cheers/shouts (‘Hotch-potch, Hugger-mugger, Bow-wow, Hara-kiri!’), making a splash on the UK indie/alternative charts. \r\nDespite their success, Ha and Barrack left the group, reducing them to a trio. Their next single, 1981′s politically-motivated ‘Eisiger Wind’ (with its Hugo Ball parody sleeve) caught the attention of noted American rock critics Robert Christgau and Greil Marcus, who praised the innovative trio. By the time the single was released, the band was in the middle of another personnel crisis with Freund now leaving the group. Marder and Schiff closed ranks and assembled a new band with singer Astrid Spirit, drummer Beat Schlatter and saxist Christoph Herzog. After a successful German tour, the later two left the band (though Schlatter continued to help on drums) and the group was a trio again. \r\nAfter four years, the group finally released a full-length album (‘Liliput’) for Rough Trade in 1982, leading into another tour. After another single (‘The Jatz’/'You Did It’, 1983), Marder and Schiff were tired, not having fun anymore and ready to quit. Spirit rallied them to do another record with an advance from Rough Trade Germany. Their second album (‘Some Songs,’ which Marder thinks is some of their best work), with various guests helping out and Spirit now playing violin, turned out to be their swan song. Spirit decided that she wanted to raise a family instead of being in a band, spelling the end of the group in late ’83. Marder had her own record shop, worked at a jazz club and had a band in the late ’80′s called Danger Mice. Schiff returned to painting, which she had done for many flyers and sleeves for the band. - many many thanx to killrockstars.com.\r\n\r\n100% mint unplayed off the shelf shop stock\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":24109458,"name":"Default","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74972556/-/kl2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74972556/-/kl2.jpg","width":640,"height":634},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74972688/-/kl.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74972688/-/kl.jpg","width":401,"height":404},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74973036/-/kl1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74973036/-/kl1.jpg","width":416,"height":401}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325215,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":3761449,"name":"UK 70/80's Punk/Oi/Anarcho Punk/KBD/Powerpop","permalink":"uk-70-80-s-punk-oi-anarcho-punk-kbd-powerpop","url":"/category/uk-70-80-s-punk-oi-anarcho-punk-kbd-powerpop"}]},{"id":7635576,"name":"Jerks ‎– Cool - 7\"","permalink":"jerks-cool-7","position":105,"price":39.99,"default_price":39.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/jerks-cool-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-22T22:49:01.000Z","description":"Lightning Records – GIL 549 - 1978\r\n \r\nCool/Cruisin' (Again)  \r\n\r\nHaving witnessed the 1976 'Anarchy In The UK' tour, five teenagers from West Yorkshire met in an a dilapidated garage and plugged in to create their own blend of noise, attitude and disturbance.

Though the band never recorded an album and released just one single, it is well known in modern rock history for the later successes of its individual members.\r\nOn July 20, 1976 fellow Wythenshawe band Slaughter & The Dogs supported the Sex Pistols along with the Buzzcocks at Manchester’s Lesser Free Trade Hall. The Sex Pistols were returning to the Hall after a legendary June 4 concert that served as a catalyst for Manchester’s fledgling music scene.\r\nGarrity worked the July 20 gig as a roadie for Slaughter & the Dogs. When the crowd became violent and he and a friend were injured, someone said, “You’re a right bloody mob aren’t you? Headbanger here and him with a nosebleed,”  inspiring Wild Ram’s transformation into Ed Banger and the Nosebleeds.\r\nVini Reilly, later of The Durutti Column played guitar, Garrity (Ed Banger) sang, Tomanov played drums and Peter Crookes played bass.\r\nThe newly-christened group changed their image and sound to concord with the punk movement and released the single “I Ain’t Been to No Music School”/”Fascist Pigs” on Rabid Records. It sold 10,000 copies but failed to launch the band to success.\r\nAt the Roxy in London the band played the same two songs over and over. “The audience went absolutely beserk,” Reilly said, “and consequently we were asked to play again and again, because that was what was required.” The band began to argue over money and fired manager Vinnie Faal. Shortly thereafter, Garrity and Reilly left the band.\r\nManchester music fan Steven Morrissey, later of The Smiths, replaced Garrity and Billy Duffy, later of Theatre of Hate and The Cult, replaced Reilly. The new lineup played several gigs, one of which was well reviewed in the New Musical Express. “The Nosebleeds re-surface boasting a Front Man With Charisma, always an advantage,” wrote reviewer Paul Morley. “Lead singer is now minor local legend Steve Morrisson , who, in his own way, is at least aware that rock ‘n’ roll is about magic, and inspiration.” \r\nMorrissey’s compositions with the band included “I Get Nervous” and “(I Think) I’m Ready for the Electric Chair.”\r\nAfter The Nosebleeds folded, Garrity supported Penetration and The Fall as Ed Banger and His Group Therapy. In 1978 he released a song called “Kinnel Tommy” on Rabid Records, which was rereleased in 1979 by EMI. Also in 1979 he released a single under the moniker Eddi Fiction.

The band's name was taken from a single called \"Oo Oo Rudi\" by The Jook. After bass guitarist Johnny Stewart joined, the group adopted the new pop punk sound. The band wore a stage uniform of boiler suits, stolen by drummer Graham Marshall from his place of work. Original Stiff Little Fingers bassist Gordon Blair joined in 1977.\r\nThe band's debut release was the \"Big Time\" single, the first release for Terri Hooley's Good Vibrations label in May 1978, bringing positive reviews in the music press (it was later described by Henry McDonals of The Observer as \"one of the most perfect pop songs to come out of this island\") and prompting the band to relocate to London. They failed to secure a record deal in London, and suffered a further setback when guitarist Ronnie Matthews and drummer Marshall were jailed for a week after their Clapham squat was raided, and they returned to Belfast. In 1979 they contributed \"Overcome by Fumes\" to the Battle of the Bands EP, and they were offered a record deal by Polydor, on the condition that they replaced Marshall, but the offer was declined. A four-track EP of their own followed, and the band embarked on a tour of England. Blair was sacked, later joining The Outcasts, with Matthews moving to bass. A television appearance on BBC2's Something Else in 1980 showcased the band's proposed next single on Good Vibrations, \"The Pressure's On\"/\"Who You\", but the band left the label in frustration with Hooley. The band recorded a session for Mike Read's BBC Radio 1 show The Evening Session in June 1980, and a deal with Target Records was proposed but failed with the label's demise. They were offered a deal with Ariola Records by Pete Waterman, but instead decided to sign with the Paul Weller-funded Jamming! label. Sessions for John Peel and David Jensen's radio shows and two further singles followed between 1981 and 1983, the latter (\"Crimson\") being named \"Single of the Week\" by Sounds, and Rudi supported The Jam on their Transglobal Unity Express tour. When The Jam split up, the Jamming! label folded soon afterwards, and Rudi found themselves without a label, and also split up.\r\nMatthews, Young, and Marshall re-emerged with a new band, Station Superheaven, while Brian Young formed a series of bands including The Tigersharks, The Roughnecks, and The Sabrejets. In the 2000s, Young played in Shame Academy, along with Greg Cowan of The Outcasts and Petesy Burns of Stalag 17.\r\nA compilation CD of the band's recordings was released in 1996 on the Cherry Red label Anagram.\r\nRudi have influenced several later bands, including The Saw Doctors and Therapy?, both of whom recorded cover versions of \"Big Time\".\r\n\r\nVinyl is in great condition - few tiny nicks and age discolouring on folds in this rare fold-out sleeve","options":[{"id":24003353,"name":"Default","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":1.0},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74618033/-/rudii.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74618033/-/rudii.jpg","width":251,"height":250},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74621935/-/rudi1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74621935/-/rudi1.jpg","width":251,"height":250}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325215,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":3761449,"name":"UK 70/80's Punk/Oi/Anarcho Punk/KBD/Powerpop","permalink":"uk-70-80-s-punk-oi-anarcho-punk-kbd-powerpop","url":"/category/uk-70-80-s-punk-oi-anarcho-punk-kbd-powerpop"}]},{"id":7598583,"name":"Sex Pistols ‎– Pretty Vacant - 7\" Australia","permalink":"sex-pistols-pretty-vacant-7-australia","position":113,"price":39.99,"default_price":39.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sex-pistols-pretty-vacant-7-australia","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-19T13:12:46.000Z","description":"Wizard Records (5) – ZS-184 - 1977\r\n\r\nPretty Vacant/No Fun\r\n\r\nThe most famous (and infamous) band of the late 70s punk scene.

Our version is remastered for vinyl from the original tapes and features a gatefold jacket.\r\nRATTUS was formed in the spring of 1978 by Jake and Vellu who started to play mostly English punk bands´ songs just for fun (Sex Pistols, Damned, Clash,etc.). A few weeks later they asked Jake´s brother Tomppa to join the bandandso he did. The name RATTUS was taken from the first Lp of THE STRANGLERS, \"RattusNorvegicus\". RATTUS is latin meaning a rat,a very big rat. In the early days RATTUS did shows only in their hometown andnear of it. \r\nIn 1980 RATTUS released their 1st record, a 2-song 7\" on their own ´Hilipili records´ label. Only 200 copies were made and sold mostly to friends.\r\nThe 2nd record was recorded the same year and released in the beginning of 1981, again on Hilipili records. 200 were made in the 1st pressing and 100 more were made, including 50 of those, which were sent to England as a recordstore/mailorder called Bullet records really liked the band (also other early Finninsh punk bands!!!) and wanted to help out selling in England. After that Poko Records label (also a record store called Epe´s) signed the band and the next four records were released on Poko, they were all combined on one Cd (recorded works 1981 - 1984) which was released in 1993.\r\n\r\nIn november 1981 RATTUS supported The Exploited on their three date tour in Finland. RATTUS was also supposed to support the Dead Kennedys in december but somehow didn´t make it. (Jello Biafra heard about it years later and wasn´t very happy that RATTUS wasn´t the support band). At the beginning of 1983, the search for singer began, since Jake wanted to concentrate on playing guitar. At first rehearsals were done with band´s old friend Astro. At last, the band chose Annikki, who was the second choice after Astro. Annikki had been with band as roadie since the beginning so the choice was quite natural.\r\nThe 1st time RATTUS played outside of Finland was in Arhus, Denmark (1983). In the spring of 1984 RATTUS did a four week European tour playing shows in Sweden, Germany, Holland, Italy, Yugoslavia, Denmark and England.\r\nEUROPEAN TOUR 1984\r\nIn january of 1984 rattus recorded songs for \"Ihmiset on sairaita\" Ep and Poko records was supposed to release it but then the boss of Poko thought that punk wasn´t selling enough anymore and said that RATTUS should try to find another label to release it. That label wasn´t found until spring of 1985 when a new label called Ann & Archies records released it as their 1st release. Those tracks were included on Brazilian version of \"Uskonto on vaara\", which now has 15 tracks (well, I´d like count ´Medley´ as three tracks here...) and is a full killer Lp!!! One of these songs is on Maximum Rock´n´Roll ´Welcome to 1984´ compilation Lp. At the time members of RATTUS started to listen more and more metal (Metallica, Slayer and Venom) and songs also started to sound more metal. Annikki wasn´t good enough anymore in the new style and Jake took on the vocals in march of 1986. Anyway, two new, more metallic tracks, with Annikki doing the vocals, were released on \"Have a rotten chrismas Vol II\" compilation.\r\n\r\nSo, Jake started to sing again and band was also again a three-piece. In july RATTUS recorded a new Lp but the label Dekadenz, who also paid the studios, wasn´t too happy with new, more metallic material. Album \"Stolen Life\" was left to be released later in France and Brazil. A new member Kari joined band as a 2nd guitarist in december of 1986. \r\nFirst shows with new lineup took place in Sweden and Denmark in february 1987. Most of the crowd were expecting for old HC-punk sound and were disappointed to\r\nwhat they heard. In november 1987, RATTUS recorded a \r\n2-song 7\" which became their last official recording.\r\nRattus broke up in february 1988. Last show was in Jyväskylä 15th january 1988. Some bands were formed after the broke of RATTUS. Jake pushed forward with ZWANGIZER and Vellu & Kari continued with CHOREA. Those two bands were more into metal. Annikki had TIK-BLOODY TAK & BRATATTACK with Astro HILJAINEN KEVÄT and Jake.\r\nNew millennium, still going strong. Rattus played live on 14.4.2001 at Vernissa (Vantaa) with the original lineup! Tomppa, Vellu, Jake and Annikki made it after 13 years!!! RATTUS was still tight and furious as hell. And band´s old friend, Astro was there too, doing his part for ´Rumia ruumiita´ & ´Horror Business´.\r\nSecond gig of new Millennium took place at Hämeenlinna Ämyrock on 29.06.2002. If they kept a lesson how to play HardCore at the Vernissa 2001, now they really made some heads bang. \r\nRATTUS played live at YO-Talo Tampere (Finland) on 04.04.2003. The set consisted of good old HC-blasts, maybe Jake and Vellu had put some tricky touch to them, anyway, good as hell. Both three and four piece line ups did their parts and the crowd was doing their best on moshing and singing along. \r\nStory taken from Rattus-Fanzine and liner-notes of \"RATTUS-Täältä tullaan kuolema\" Cd.\r\nA1\t\t Sotahullut\t\t\r\nA2\t\t Uskonto On Vaara\t\t\r\nA3\t\t Eläinraadot Hintana\t\t\r\nA4\t\t Epäjumala\t\t\r\nA5\t\t Rock-Toimittaja\t\t\r\nA6\t\t Ei Vihaa, Ei Kateutta\t\t\r\nB1\t\t Vapaaehtoinen Kuolema\t\t\r\nB2\t\t Viinaa Suonissa, Kusta Päässä\t\t\r\nB3\t\t WC Räjähtää 2","options":[{"id":23955071,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74445533/-/rattus-uskonto-on-vaara-lp.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74445533/-/rattus-uskonto-on-vaara-lp.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325217,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"},{"id":3578991,"name":"Svart Records","permalink":"svart-records","url":"/category/svart-records"}]},{"id":7584257,"name":"Widows - Wall of Berlin - 7\"","permalink":"widows-wall-of-berlin-7","position":118,"price":3.99,"default_price":3.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/widows-wall-of-berlin-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-18T04:27:38.000Z","description":"Limited to 300 copies only on grey vinyl\r\n\r\nOriginally released in December 1979, this was the 2nd Widows 7 inch and their first for Poko Records.

The Svart reissue is fully authorised and is mastered for vinyl from the original tapes. Available on limited clear and standard black vinyl.\r\n\r\nYpö-Viis made history in Finnish punk scene. They were the first punk band to have a self-released record out.\r\n\r\nYpö-Viis was formed in Karhula in summer 1977. Originally the band was five-piece, but as they changed their style to new wave, the organ player and second guitarist were dropped off. The remaining trio was Miika Söderholm: bass & vocals, Mikko Holmström: guitar and Rabbe Johansson: drums. In the early days they only gigged locally (today Karhula is part of Kotka). The self-financed one-sided single (or is it an EP?) Energia on A ja O/Kotka palaa was released in late 1978. 200 copes were pressed, costing them 600 Finnish marks. The recording sounds really crappy, but the songs are pretty good. Energia is their own composition and the flipside is a cover version of The Clash's London's burning. The next step was to found a record company of their own, called Karva-Levyt. The new label's first release was naturally Ypö-Viis' next single Mari pogoaa/Mikkitelineestä on puolet minun, released in spring 1979. The A side is a catchy pop song, and the single was even seen on Suosikki's top sales charts! In spring they were also featured on Hilse compilation LP with their song Pelkään pimeää. That song was recorded with a new lineup, as Jari Räsänen had joined the band on bass, allowing Söderholm to concentrate on vocals, and occasionally on rhythm guitar. Pelkään pimeää is one of the best tracks on the album, a pop song of course.\r\nThen they signed a deal with a bigger label, Poko Rekords, and logically the first Poko release was called Me myytiin itsemme ('We have sold out'), b/w Kaupunki muistaa nuoria, released in fall 1979. The songs are good, and the most notable change is the improvement on the sound department. Despite the new recording deal they didn't bury Karva-Levyt (later releases on the label include singles by Pupukuusikko, Tommy & Teenagers and Zoint (pre-Saigon)), but released their first album Karhulan poikii live in late 1979. The LP is extremely fun, in fact it may just be the best live album that has been made in Finland. Covers include songs by The Clash and Sham 69. The band kept themselves busy as they were already recording a studio album in November. Unfortunately Halpaa lystiä LP is a disappointment. Kuvien kauniit naiset was also released as a single, with Ujona discossa (not on album) on the B side. Both the single and the album are boring. Two songs, Tänään kotona, the B side's opening track, and the following Ystävät kautta maan, are worth listening to more than once. The album was released in early 1980. In 1979 Söderholm also made a guest appearance as a backup singer on Kollaa Kestää's Jäähyväiset aseille LP. Fortunately Ypö-Viis' story didn't end there, instead in spring 1980 they made by far their best release, the single Hyvästi masentava maanantai/Rakkauskirjeet. The B side is sung by Räsänen. Both are catchy tunes, and everything looked good again. Then they visited a Turku studio to record songs (Steppaava hirvi and Muistoissani aina) for a future compilation (Eppu Normaali was supposed to be on it too), to be released on Karva-Levyt, but due to lack of bands and material the compilation was never released. However, despite the bright outlook, things weren't that good after all. Holmström quit the band in favour of his studies, and he was replaced by Pekka Stirkkinen. On their last single Keskiolut takaisin Alkoon/Kaunis poika Stirkkinen played both guitar and bass, because Räsänen was performing his compulsory military service at the time. Both songs are great, especially the latter. The band, or Söderholm and Stirkkinen to be exact, made a tour in Lapland with a temporary replacement drummer (Johansson was too busy with his school exams to join them), after which the band broke up. It's a good thing the last recordings were among their best.\r\ntext by Vesa Vahtera, translation by Jarkko Kuivanen","options":[{"id":23954501,"name":"Default","price":3.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":1.8,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.5},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74443009/-/ypo-viis-me-myytiin-itsemme-7.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74443009/-/ypo-viis-me-myytiin-itsemme-7.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/78149382/-/DSC01154.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/78149382/-/DSC01154.JPG","width":1000,"height":544}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325215,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":3578991,"name":"Svart Records","permalink":"svart-records","url":"/category/svart-records"}]},{"id":7582611,"name":"Cyanide ‎– Mac The Flash - 7\"","permalink":"cyanide-mac-the-flash-7","position":123,"price":59.99,"default_price":59.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cyanide-mac-the-flash-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-18T01:53:43.000Z","description":"UK 7\" 1978 (Pye 7N 46094)\r\n\r\nMac The Flash/Hate The State\r\n\r\nBob De Vries - vocals\r\nDave Stewart - guitar\r\nDave Thompson - bass\r\nMick Stewart - drums \r\nProduced by Ron O'Shea for Spook Productions \r\n\r\nCyanide are a little known English punk band.

They were formed by Dave Floyd in August 1979. They went through many line-up changes in the first few years, something which contributed greatly to them being almost unheard of outside their native West London. Their first two cassette albums, Musical Destruction (1980) and Crime Pays (1981) were only ever released in very small quantities, and only when they finally got the money together to release an EP in April 1982 (“There’s No Government Like NO GOVERNMENT”) did they make the jump to a wider audience. A track from that EP, “Death to Humanity”, was also included on the compilation album, Punk & Disorderly - Further Charges. It was with this compilation that Riot/Clone were to first show that they were different to most ‘punk bands’. They gave all their royalties from the release to the ALF, and had the record company state exactly that on the cover.\r\nTwo more EPs followed. August 1982 saw the release of “Destroy the Myth of MUSICAL DESTRUCTION” and after many unfortunate delays, their third EP, “Blood on Your Hands?”, finally came out in January 1984. Unfortunately this line-up had disintegrated months before.\r\nThat wasn’t to be the end, though. In 1992, Dave and Pete put together a project named Mad Dog. The band didn’t last long, but due to feedback from the tape release, the Riot/Clone EPs were reissued along with a book detailing the band’s history. This in turn led to the opportunity to record a Riot/Clone album, and the band were reborn.\r\nStill No Government Like NO GOVERNMENT was released in the summer of 1995. It was a mixture of re-recorded old material plus some new songs, showing that age had not tempered the band’s anger. The CD contained forty tracks in all, and most astoundingly came bundled with a 142 page booklet. 1996 saw the release of this LP on vinyl, with the original recordings of the EPs added on side four (it is a double album), but without the book.\r\nIn 1997 they released To Find a Little Bluebird, an album unrelentless in its ferocity but clothed in a truly bizarre cover. No one looking at the cover art alone would guess the type of music enclosed in the package, which was probably the closest to ‘hardcore punk’ Riot/Clone have ever achieved. The album was loosely themed around a short story that came printed on the lyric sheet of the blue vinyl release, and as a spoken word track on the CD.\r\nMore line-up changes ensued, and necessitated a longish wait for their next release. Their album, Do You Want Fries With That?, was a full on animal rights album with an horrific cover picture of a dead cow’s head. Many regard this as Riot/Clone’s best album to date.\r\nIn their early years, Riot/Clone played most of their shows in London, only venturing outside occasionally. Since reforming they have been more adventurous. While only playing a few UK shows, they have completed numerous tours of Europe and America.\r\n2004 saw the release of a new Riot/Clone ep, Mad Sheep Disease, on the Californian label Alternative Records, and the band hope to have a new LP released by the end of the year.\r\nIn May 2005, lead singer and founder member, Dave Floyd decided to move to the US and so the band had to call it a day, however, all the band members are carrying on with new projects. Daves new project is Wotnot. All the remaining members of Riot/Clone have formed a new band, Refuse/All. \r\n\r\nSuperb mint unplayed condition includes original inner white dust sleeve.","options":[{"id":23914105,"name":"Default","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74313817/-/rclo.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74313817/-/rclo.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74313881/-/rcl1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74313881/-/rcl1.jpg","width":365,"height":273}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325215,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":3761449,"name":"UK 70/80's Punk/Oi/Anarcho Punk/KBD/Powerpop","permalink":"uk-70-80-s-punk-oi-anarcho-punk-kbd-powerpop","url":"/category/uk-70-80-s-punk-oi-anarcho-punk-kbd-powerpop"}]},{"id":7533305,"name":"Destroyed In Seconds - Criticial Failure - LP","permalink":"destroyed-in-seconds-criticial-failure-lp","position":126,"price":7.99,"default_price":7.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/destroyed-in-seconds-criticial-failure-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-13T01:53:48.000Z","description":"MAILORDER ONLY RED VINYL LTD TO 100 \r\n\r\nD.I.S. is a brutal and belligerent, non-stop, swarm of punk rock “nihilism and grind that will dig you a 6-foot grave and bury you in it before you realize what the hell just hit you.\" A Classic Thrash, Death Metal, Grind, Anarcho, Crust firestorm of pure fury coming forth that even the beasts of Hell couldn’t muster.

Early in 1978, the fledgling band practised in Clive’s bedroom. Self-penned songs such as “Dear Deirdre”, “I Wanna Give You A ‘69” and “Who’s Chasing Who” were soon put together, and the foursome announced their presence in their home town of Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire that summer with spray-painted graffiti . Together with their name, they had a logo and a slogan - ‘Smash Guitar Solos‘ - which attracted my interest in a big way. I’d previously been guitarist with the band The Darlex, but as soon as I saw the Epileptics’ DIY publicity campaign I was impressed and wanted a part of their action. First, I had to find out who they were… \r\n\r\nThe Triad Centre was a great place to see bands and just hang around with other punks from Harlow, including members of the Sods and Newtown Neurotics, and surrounding areas. I asked around and was pointed in Col and Rich’s direction; I went over and said “If you ever need a guitarist, let me know.” Coincidentally, Clive was about to leave and go to college, so they told me to come along the following Saturday to one of their rehearsals. I did, and I was in! They had already played two gigs - one at Triad in August, and one at London’s Covent Garden with Crass - but needed new material. Col and I reworked some of the older songs and changed the lyrics and titles, and collaborated on some new material too, such as “Tube Disaster”, and our first gig together was at the beginning of November.\r\n\r\nIn January 1979 we got the chance to support Crass and the Poison Girls in Bradford, but the van we’d hired broke down on the way, and we reached the gig just as Crass were finishing their set. In March we recorded our first demo tape and started to attract a small following; thereafter we regularly played at Triad, as well as doing gigs in London’s Conway Hall with Crass. For a while we changed our name to Epi-X, but then reverted to the Epileptics; our line-up also changed briefly in summer, when Stan Stammers replaced Derek on bass. (Stan would later go on to Theatre of Hate and Spear of Destiny.) After playing one gig under the pseudonym Acid Experience, with Derek back in, the Epileptics decided to take a break as personality clashes had been surfacing. In August, we were approached by Stortbeat Records to record a single, and - with a dubious change of name to The Licks - did just that in September. \r\n\r\nSuperb mint copy with original white dust sleeve\r\n","options":[{"id":23703735,"name":"Default","price":15.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":1.8,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73600913/-/EPILEPTICS-LAST_BUS_TO_DEBDEN_EP_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73600913/-/EPILEPTICS-LAST_BUS_TO_DEBDEN_EP_.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73600979/-/epileptics-target-on-my-back-1981-3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73600979/-/epileptics-target-on-my-back-1981-3.jpg","width":576,"height":576},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73601065/-/epileptics-target-on-my-back-1981-5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73601065/-/epileptics-target-on-my-back-1981-5.jpg","width":576,"height":576}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325215,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":3761449,"name":"UK 70/80's Punk/Oi/Anarcho Punk/KBD/Powerpop","permalink":"uk-70-80-s-punk-oi-anarcho-punk-kbd-powerpop","url":"/category/uk-70-80-s-punk-oi-anarcho-punk-kbd-powerpop"}]},{"id":7499359,"name":"Amebix ‎– Who's The Enemy - 7\"","permalink":"amebix-who-s-the-enemy-7","position":130,"price":29.99,"default_price":29.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/amebix-who-s-the-enemy-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-10T00:39:01.000Z","description":"Spiderleg Records – SDL6 - 1982 \r\n\r\nCarnage/Curfew/Belief/No Gods, No Masters  \r\n\r\nInfluential English band considered to be the godfathers of the Crust Punk subgenre.

Many consider them to have started the subgenre crust punk, by mixing heavy metal with anarcho-punk. They established crust as being separate from thrash metal by mixing post-punk music with metal riffs and atmospheres, as opposed to thrash bands’ mixing of metal music with punk rawness and speed. Influential in the anarcho-punk genre, Amebix’ song “No Gods, No Masters” became a slogan for the movement worldwide. They were originally called The Band With No Name, and shared a squat in Bristol for part of their career. Their music, heavily influenced by Motörhead (and to a lesser extent Lemmy-era Hawkwind), Black Sabbath, Venom and early Killing Joke, combined with an ethos and worldview akin to Crass, represented their non-traditional lifestyles.\r\nAmebix had an early track called “University Challenged” which appeared on the first Crass Records “Bullshit Detector” Compilation LP.\r\nTheir music blended hardcore and heavy metal into a form of early thrash metal. Such notable talents as Nausea (NY), Extinction of Mankind, Sepultura, Choking Victim, Neurosis, Napalm Death, and Deviated Instinct have paid homage to these masters.\r\nThe band split in 1987 after release/distribution difficulties associated with the Monolith LP.\r\nMembers went on to perform in Zygote. Bassist/vocalist “the Baron” now lives on the Gaelic speaking Isle of Skye and makes ceremonial swords.\r\nIn 2008 they reformed with ex Nausea drummer Roy Mayorga and have made few tours since. Most notable the U.S. one. They are now going strong after the reunion, having released an EP of re-recorded old material called Redux in 2010.\r\nAs of 2011 they have released a new album Sonic Mass. \r\n\r\nSuperb  condition includes original white dust sleeve.","options":[{"id":23698867,"name":"Default","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73585245/-/amm.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73585245/-/amm.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73585297/-/amm1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73585297/-/amm1.jpg","width":354,"height":354},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73585679/-/amm2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73585679/-/amm2.jpg","width":550,"height":546},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73585745/-/amm3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73585745/-/amm3.jpg","width":550,"height":545}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325215,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":3761449,"name":"UK 70/80's Punk/Oi/Anarcho Punk/KBD/Powerpop","permalink":"uk-70-80-s-punk-oi-anarcho-punk-kbd-powerpop","url":"/category/uk-70-80-s-punk-oi-anarcho-punk-kbd-powerpop"}]},{"id":7497665,"name":"Anthrax ‎– They've Got It All Wrong - 7\"","permalink":"anthrax-they-ve-got-it-all-wrong-7","position":132,"price":29.99,"default_price":29.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/anthrax-they-ve-got-it-all-wrong-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-09T21:52:55.000Z","description":"Small Wonder Records – Small Twenty Seven - 1983\r\n\r\nP.P.B./Got It All Wrong/Exploitation/What Will Tomorrow Bring?  \r\n\r\nAnthrax were an anarcho-punk band formed in Gravesend, Kent, England in 1980.

Their songs released as singles were \"I am a Dalek/Neutron Bomb\" and \"Punk Rock Stars/Rat City\". The group was formed by Edwin Pouncey and Steve Spear, two students from the Royal College of Art, London for a one-off gig at the college. They were asked to do a gig at Wimbledon College of Art and this led to the bands' short career. They had two tracks on the, \"Live at the Vortex\" (NEMS) compilation album, (Frankensteins Heartbeat and Animal Bondage) and one on the \"Streets\" (Beggars Banquet) compilation album, (Arabs in Arrads). They played at most of the London punk club and pub venues including The Marquee, Nashville and Vortex supporting bands like Generation X, 999, The Motors and The Lurkers. They also played out of town at venues in the south and north east of England.

They possessed no equipment and had nowhere to rehearse. In line tradition of the times, enthusiasm overpowered these problems and within months the band saw themselves playing a dire set of cover versions and poor original compositions at local youth clubs. The band slowly progressed to the small Pubs' circuit and by early 1981, had gained a regular following. They were soon to meet Marcus Featherby (founder of Pax Records and local gig promoter) who was to invite them to support The Angelic Upstarts at Sheffield's Marples club - on the condition that they did not play their \"horrendous\" cover of The Upstart's \"Liddle Towers\". Overwhelmed by the reaction received at gigs, the band soon found that their egos were growing a lot faster than their musical capabilities, and found it quite disturbing when Featherby told them they were crap! Undeterred, they took to the rehearsal studios for the remaining part of 1981 until they left confident enough to invite Featherby to a session. Impressed by their determination he offered them a deal for a single with Pax, and gave them many support slots at the Marples Club with the likes of The Wall and The Enemy...\r\nApril '82 saw the band's first visit to a recording studio, where they recorded 8 songs which were recorded and mixed within 5 hours - for £5O! \"The Kill\" - taken from this session - appeared on the highly successful \"Wargasm\" compilation album and gave great exposure ta the band leading up to the release of the \"Society's Rejects\" EP, which spent 1O weeks in the Independent chart, peaking at No. 22. On the back of this the band were offered their first London gigs, where they played the legendary Skunx Club and the 100 Club, supporting The Angelic Upstarts and Charlie Harper's Urban Dogs. A fantastic night, but for the fact that the band didn't get paid! September 1982 saw the Mau Maus back in the studio for a new EP. With Lee Wilson of Infa Riot producing, 4 tracks were recorded at London's Matrix Studios - costing ten times as much as Ihe first single! From this session come the \"No Concern\" EP and then the track \"Give Us A future\" (plus \"Clampdown\" from the EP) which featured on the compilation \"Punk's Dead? Nah Mate..\" album. Released in November 1982, the EP spent 10 weeks in the newly compiled Punk chart in 'Sounds', peaking at No. 10, just behind G.B.H. and The Anti Nowhere League - with the compilation album reaching No. 2! Gigs with Infa Riot and The Dead Kennedys spread the word that bit further and the Mau Maus were now becoming a highly sought after ad, receiving well over 100 letters a week and being featured in all the UK's bigger fanzines. Yet not strangely in 'Sounds'. Nothing to do with Sounds' Garry Bushell haling Pax boss Marcus Featherby I suppose.... Maturing both musically and lyrically, the band stormed Manchester's Revolution Studio to record their critically acclaimed \"Facts Of War\" EP in May 1983. featuring the Oil-esque anti-unemployment anthem \"Just Another Day\", the blatantly antiwar title track and the show slopping, trendy conscientious, 'Running With The Pack', this single peaked at No. 6 in the U.K. Punk chart, and spent 17 weeks there.\r\nThe Mau Maus were then to achieve some of their finest moments: 3 Tracks on the \"Bollox to the Gonads\" compilation album, which reached No.1 in the Punk chart and No. 6 in the Independent chart, (and which floated there abouts' for 24 weeks!!) and, as support band to The Exploited an their \"Let's Start A War\" U.K. tour, at the tail end of 1983. To say things were looking good for the band would be understatement of the year! ~ Tragedy struck on the last date of The Exploited tour at Feltham Football cIub when Bass player, 'Bunny' collapsed, was rushed to hospital and was diagnosed as having cancer. In respect, the band had a lengthy lay off until Bunny was diagnosed, 'in remission', and then had to recruit a stand in bass player, Alf, from a local Punk band. Just as the band were prepared to go and give their all, the inevitable disaster happened! The 1984 U.K. Miners' Strike, Leaving virtually everybody in Yorkshire without a wage, as well as leaving women and children without food! This didn't help the band at all,as half the band were miners! And the other half unemployed! When this strike collapsed, the miners' were just 2 months away from a total exhaustion of coal supplies in the United Kingdom and just weeks away from seeing the complete collapse of the British Government - not something many U.K. Punk bands can claim to be an adive part of! And not a weil known fad!! Again ironically, during this time Pax Records released the band's debut album, \"Live At The ,Marples\", recorded in September '83, which showed the band in their finest form - Live! Reaching No. 3 in the Independent chart, (slopped only by The Smiths and Billy Bragg!!!) the band had their finest chance for success. But, without Bunny, things took time. In this short space and happily cashing in, Featherby didn't waste any time compiling and releasing the Mau Maus' compilation Lp, \"Running With The Pack\", which features all the singles, radio plugs and an edit of the Live album.\r\nBy mid 1984, the band felt confident enough to venture back into the studio. Still without Bunny, and without a label after deciding the deal with Pax had run it's course, (again in line 80's tradition, Featherby had run off with all the money!) the band opted to start their own record label, Rebellion Records. The first release for them come in the form of the \"Tear Down The Walls\" EP. Produced by Simon Hinkier, (who went on to become 'The Mission' guitarist) at Fairview Studios, this 7\" hit the lower ends of the Indie charts, but effectively, was the end of the band as a serious recording ad. Live however, it was a different matter. The word had spread. They replaced Conflict on a tour of Germany and Holland with The Varukers, (thanks to new manager, Tony Perrin) and upon their return to the UK played many successful shows with the likes of The Fits, who by the time were a happening band. Although now being reviewed in the National press, things didn't look good! The band recorded their second album (first & only studio LP) \"Fear No Evil\" - which despite containing studio versions of live favourites such as \"Be My Baby\" and \"Rebellion\", was poorly received and effectively the end of the band. A U.K. tour with The English Dogs (who had now gone into their 'Metal' phase) and The Varukers (who were also playing more Thrash than Punk) didn't do much for the band's popularity - neither did changing the chorus to tracks such as \"Running With The Pack\"! As a last gasp attempt to keep the band going, they recorded the \"Nowhere To Run\" 12\" EP. With the pressures of the times', they also added second guitarist, Richard Hall. With Bunny back on bass, and Hinkler again at the helm of control, the band's most melodic plotter failed to inspire and after a further year's touring - the band called it a day. Chris bailed out first, as he felt his vocals - which were abrasive an the best of days - couldn't keep up wilh the direction that the band were going!\r\nWhere are they now? I hear you ask: Chris is a welder. Lev a van driver. Podge, a steel worker.\r\nAlf, owns a gardening firm, and Bunny's still on the dole! (And Richard? He's gone missing!) - \r\nWritten by Stuart Newman - Control!

They split up in 1981, but reformed in 1996.\r\nThe band was formed in 1977 by Neil Thompson (vocals, guitar), George Maddison (bass), and Kevin Heard (drums) (all three had played together since 1974 in Brown Sugar),[1] although Heard had already been replaced by former Young Bucks drummer Tim Wilder by the time of the band’s first album release, the Radio Wunderbar EP, released on the Walthamstow-based indie label Small Wonder. The band named their follow-up single “Small Wonder” in the label’s honour. They recorded two sessions for John Peel’s BBC Radio 1 show in 1978. In 1979, they signed to Beggars Banquet Records, who issued their debut album, Frustration Paradise, towards the end of that year, the band now associated with the Mod revival of the time. A second album followed in 1980, with a final single released in December that year, before the band split up in June 1981.\r\n\r\nThe band reunited in 1996 to perform at the first Holidays in the Sun festival, with Thompson and Maddison joined by Thompson’s brother Paul.[1] This led to a permanent reunion and the release of a new album in 2002, Fair Play to ‘Em. In 2005 Neil thompson Left the band and was replaced with Jimmy Devlin, a member of the Glasgow based Just Another Dream. A final album was recorded featuring Paul Thompson playing drums on several tracks and another Glaswegian, Jim Cosgrove on the rest of the album.

Things started early for The Disrupters with Crass including an early demo version of the song “Napalm” on their 1st “Bullshit Detector” lp.\r\nIn 1981 the band entered Whitehouse Studios in Norwich to record their 1st real recording session. The 3 tracks laid down that day became the “Young Offender” 7”. The record was a surprise hit in the indie charts and far outsold the bands expectations. This initial release began a working relationship with Backs Records in the running of Radical Change Records, a label dedicated to the promotion of punk/anarchist bands.\r\nInitially The Disrupters had a few hiccups finding the right combo of band members but from 1983-88 they settled with founder members Bangkok Steve (aka Steve Hansell) (Vocals) and Kevin Wymer (Drums) along with Paul Greener (Guitar). Steve Hough (Bass) and Prem Nick (spoken word tracks).\r\nThe band liked to mix actions with words and were actively involved in various elements of direct action, sometimes ending in arrest and court appearances.\r\nThe Disrupters called it a day in late 1988, dissalusioned with the ever\r\ngrowing divide and bitching within the scene, Steve (Vocals) quit to\r\nconcentrate on other things and the rest of the band followed suit.:\r\nOriginal Line Up:\r\nSteve - Vocals\r\nDave - Bass\r\nKev - Drums\r\nGibbon - Guitar\r\nThe band reformed in 2007 after Steve Ignorant requested they play his Feeding of the 5000 gig.\r\n\r\nFrom my own collection, near mint vinyl, played once, cover has slight storage wear, includes original insert \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":23469971,"name":"Default","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72844683/-/disssss.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72844683/-/disssss.jpg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72844707/-/dis3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72844707/-/dis3.jpg","width":225,"height":224},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72844755/-/dis4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72844755/-/dis4.jpg","width":606,"height":598},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72844779/-/dis5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72844779/-/dis5.jpg","width":609,"height":302}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325217,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"},{"id":3761449,"name":"UK 70/80's Punk/Oi/Anarcho Punk/KBD/Powerpop","permalink":"uk-70-80-s-punk-oi-anarcho-punk-kbd-powerpop","url":"/category/uk-70-80-s-punk-oi-anarcho-punk-kbd-powerpop"}]},{"id":7417671,"name":"Dry Rib ‎– The Dry Season - 7\"","permalink":"dry-rib-the-dry-season-7","position":140,"price":99.99,"default_price":99.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dry-rib-the-dry-season-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-02T01:51:50.000Z","description":"Clockwork Records – COR 001 - 1979\r\n\r\nAlaska/Cruelty Of The Victim/Quailseed \r\n\r\nDry Rib were a band formed in 1978.

The band thought they had to do something to stop the then scene being hi-jacked by people of questionable skinhead background that decided waiving a Union Jack flag was wrong and should be countered by political correctness via fake traditional skinhead identity. Straw Dogs thought bollocks to that and made what skinhead street music was all about, listen to Cheap Imitation for example.\r\nThe line up throughout was a mix of Rob and Antonella on guitars, Tony and Pat on vocals, Pat and Antonella on bass and Mark, Chris, Danny and Pat on drums.\r\nThe band had only been together for a few months before releasing their first 7” single Dead On Arrival and sold it mostly at their gigs. The band created their own record label via Pat to release and promote their work.

The band originally split in 1988 as the various members went their separate ways. But in 1993, vocalist Rat decided to reform the band. Stylistically, their music resembled the traditional uk82 style exemplified by bands like GBH and The Exploited. Since the band had former members of Discharge, a d-beat sound developed as time went on. The band has gone through many line-up changes over the years with the only constant member being Rat on vocals. They have recently released a retrospective CD on SOS Records. \r\nTo this day, they continue to tour rapidly all over the world, even with Rat splitting his time between them and Discharge.

A hastily made debut album was released later on same year for mixed reviews and then a couple of 7 inchers more, but nothing like the first single emerged and Sensuuri's career was over after only a year. Drummer Pasi Pakarinen joined later the Ramones style group Pojat and guitarist/songwriter Costello Hautamäki became a notable person in finnish rockscene, most known for his membership in \"The Rolling Stones of Finland\", Popeda.","options":[{"id":22404919,"name":"Default","price":4.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":1.8,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.0},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69450291/-/sensuuri-kirjoitan-seinaan-7-.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69450291/-/sensuuri-kirjoitan-seinaan-7-.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72515455/-/DSC01016.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72515455/-/DSC01016.JPG","width":1000,"height":598}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325215,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":3578991,"name":"Svart Records","permalink":"svart-records","url":"/category/svart-records"}]},{"id":6991533,"name":"Rational Animals - Gabrielle - Sick Nick Club Vol 2  - 7'' ","permalink":"rational-animals-gabrielle-sick-club-vol-2-7","position":157,"price":1.99,"default_price":1.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rational-animals-gabrielle-sick-club-vol-2-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-17T16:53:20.000Z","description":"Rational Animals- Sick Nick Club Vol 2  - 7'' limited to 500\r\n\r\nfrom my mates (is he a mate or not, I've forgotten) label \r\n\r\nPart of the newest output from Rochester/Brooklyn's RATIONAL ANIMALS and the 2nd volume in the Sick Club singles series. 2 new tracks that push their unique brand of HC punk/metal/hard rock into slightly new territory.

I see sometimes where someone without a brain calls them 'generic' but I fail to see it. To me its maybe a little simplistic, but its done so well and there's just something on the brink of genius about these depraved and disgusting lyrics. Maybe because it speaks my language? Who knows for sure, but these Lowell, MA guys just play great, sick HC punk is what you need to know. The follow up to the already awesome 'Fucks Your Ears' LP from last year, this 4 song rager is a little more punk and memorable but just as intense if not more so. PJ totally emulates Jerry A in his own way vocally on this record and the music is just bursting with raw power. I know that sounds lame to say, but you can't listen to this and not be blown away I feel. Comes in folded and hand glued covers to boot, this is as nice to look at as it is to hear. Reason the color wax is a little bit more is because it was considered a 'custom vinyl experiment' and I can break even at this cost. Sucks because the experiment was so iffy, some records came out a really light Clear Orange like watered down Kool Aid and some are a bit darker, either way this is a solid EP to own no matter the mark up. I have around 10 on color, so act fast! \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":21563761,"name":"Default","price":2.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":1.8,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.5},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66677605/-/dry.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66677605/-/dry.jpg","width":724,"height":725},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66677645/-/dryhumpcolor.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66677645/-/dryhumpcolor.jpg","width":489,"height":486},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67343877/-/DSC00889.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67343877/-/DSC00889.JPG","width":1000,"height":969}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325215,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":3325221,"name":"Cowabunga Records","permalink":"cowabunga-records","url":"/category/cowabunga-records"}]},{"id":6791025,"name":"Weekend Nachos - Punish And Destroy - LP colour vinyl","permalink":"weekend-nachos-punish-and-destroy-lp-colour-vinyl","position":165,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/weekend-nachos-punish-and-destroy-lp-colour-vinyl","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-25T21:41:25.000Z","description":"from my mates (is he a mate or not, I've forgotten) label \r\n\r\nWeekend Nachos - Punish And Destroy - LP colour vinyl\r\n\r\nOkay, so here's the scoop. I was called by Bill Smith Records a few weeks ago if I'd take some scrap color to not cause waste, since I gave them instructions years back to always let me know about that or just do it. I had no clue what I'd get but he predicted about 50. Well, I got 115 and half is to the band and the other half to me. ALL PROCEEDS of sales of my 55 copies for sale of these go right into bailing my sorry ass out of debt, thanks expensive car and rip off mechanic! Look at the pic and that's what there is and most are of 20 copies a piece, 2 were about 5 each. I can't guarantee anything to you so order and see! \r\n\r\nThe Debut LP from Chicago's Weekend Nachos, and was easily one of 2007's best! It has a few similarities of the 7\", but it stands in a league of its own. This album shows the bands' personal taste of music/hardcore they listen to as the obvious choices of influence on this record. Its somewhere between Infest, Think I Care, Cro Mags, Judge, Pentagram, Black Sabbath, Eyehategod and Youth of Today and they sure can bring on the mosh. I was beyond honored to be asked to release this record after Six Weeks could not follow through at the last second. Years later this is actually a pretty original sounding and fresh LP for the time it came out (still very enjoyable now) and if you like your hardcore varied in tempo from fast to plodding to a crawl, heavy down tuned riffs & angry, disgusted lyrics you need to check out this LP.

They changed their name to Riistetyt and released the Laki ja Järjestys in 1982. The line up for that ep was Lateri(vocals), Piise (Bass), Raipe(Guitar) and Stydy (drums). Piise left the band soon after the release of the ep and Perry came back on guitar, as Raipe moved to the bass. Throughout the year they provided tracks on the Propaganda compilation “Russia Bombs Finland” and “Hardcore 83”. Around the time of the new year, The band hit the studio to record the Valtion Vankina LP. The LP contained new versions of songs from the previous eps and compilation tracks, as well as about 5 new songs and a Varukers cover. This made it a total of 22 tracks. Soon, Raipe leaves the band and Piise comes back to play bass, Restoring the original line up from the Cadgers split with Kaaos. The band then records the Essential “Skitsofrenia” MLP, widely considered as one of the best records to ever come out of the Finnish Punk scene in the 80s. but soon, Piise and Stydy(the Rhythm section of the band) leave the band leaving Lateri and Perry. They soon recruit Nappi and Jaska of Kaaos, who were not very active at the time on Bass and Drums. This line up Records the “Tumiopäiva” ep which does not see the light of day until 1991 (reasons unknown) soon, Perry joins the army and Bastards guitarist Rike joins. They record the studio Section of the “Nightmares in the Darkness” lp , the live side being from the Puntala Rock set (with the Skitsofrenia line up). Next, the band records the “Raiskattu Tulevaisuus” LP, although Nappi gets fed up with Rike and leaves the band to form Kuolleet Kukat with Jakke (Kaaos). Make and Miki on 2nd Gtr and Bass. The band tours the US but soon afterwards they disband to focus on the “Lords of the New Church” style project called Pyhät nuket. The style of this new band was very popular in Finland at the time. \r\nThe band Reforms in 1999 with Lateri and Make to Record new songs for the “Preloaded Millenium” compilation CD on Propaganda, and the band officially reforms for the Funeral of the Great Finnish Punk Venue called Leppakko (in Helsinki) where many 80s hardcore bands played shows. The Venue was Destroyed by Nokia after the Funeral gig, Where bands like Kaaos and Riistetyt played. soon the band was active again and released material that was more Hard Hitting and Crust style. They released the Tervetuola Kuolema ep in 2001, then the Kuka Valahtee? LP 2001, Orjat ja Kurjat 10’’ in 2003 and the Kahleet EP in 2005.

Adding Bill Chamberlain of the Pist/React/Broken on guitar solidified their line up. Tragedy struck when their first drummer was injured in a car accident and was no longer able to play drums. Enter a borrowed drummer from Submachine (later to become the permanent drummer) and the result is a band whose components are some of the most experienced and dedicated punk musicians in the Eastern US. Corey gave me a Caustic Christ demo when he was in town with the Unseen and I liked it. But when I saw them open for DS 13 at Mr. Roboto in Pittsburgh I knew I had to put out a record by this band. Caustic Christ play sick heavy hardcore that I would best describe as a cross between early Corrosion of Conformity and Swedish crust core like Wolfbrigade and Skitsystem. Fans of crust and fast 80's style hardcore will no doubt both like this 7\" as it bridges the two genres perfectly.

Formed by Boyd Farrell and Paul Cleary of Snitch (Cleary was also in Trenchmouth), with Keith Campbell of D. Ceats and Tommy Carr from the Penetrators. In 1986, Ian MacKaye of Minor Threat recorded what would have been their second LP. When the band couldn't find a label to release the album they broke up, playing a farewell gig in January 1988. They loosely re-formed in 1993, playing the occasional show and recording sparingly before calling it quits again in 1997.(Wiki ) \r\n\r\nUnlike many of the bands of the time, Black Market Baby were not a speedy hardcore band, instead they had a bit more of a 1970s punk influence that came through their songs, but still had a bunch of energy and really wrote some great punk songs that sadly went overlooked by many. As time went by, BMB went in a bit more of a rock direction but never lost that punk feel and the later stuff was nearly as good as the early material. They are a band who never put out a record unworthy of the vinyl it was pressed on. \r\n\r\nDr. Strange Records, 2006 (compilation of 1980s recordings) \r\n\r\n1. Youth Crimes \r\n2.

The studio tracks were originally recorded by Skipp Groff at Inner Ear (Minor Threat, S.O.A., Teen Idles) and the live tracks by Government Issue's Tom Lyle. For fans of Minor Threat, Government Issue, Bad Brains, and Necros. \r\n\r\nBlack Market Baby from Washington DC were around in the late 70's and early 80's. Unlike most DC bands they played pretty straight forward punk rock instead of hardcore. They were pretty overshadowed by local hardcore bands, but had a great sound and style all their own and mixed well with the hardcore crowd. Their sound was more influenced by the Stooges/Dolls/Heartbreakers and UK Punk than hardcore. This 7\" re issue from Dr. Strange features the original two songs on the Limp Records ep plus two never heard live tracks. Because it was on some comps this gets labelled as \"KBD\" punk at times.

Imprint also ran the sleeve with a defective font with typos on the back and wound up redoing things. So the first 200 out the door are gonna be a little special -- the rare shade of vinyl in the typo sleeves... Yowza! And it's not only one of the best MP records ever. \r\n\r\nTHE LOBLAWS \"Won't Stop!\" Seriously, they won't. Dig the new breed, Mutant Pop 2.0: The Loblaws hail from Nashville, Tennessee, home of dumb country music and dumber country music fans. But don't hold their city against them, these guys aren't country in the least -- they have roots in a killer underground pop-punk band called The Robinsons, which toiled magnificently in New Orleans until a little storm called Katrina came along and scattered 'em... The three brothers and friend in this band (the latter a member of BACKSEAT VIRGINS) have been at it for a decade now in various groups and by now they have the songwriting and recording thangs down cold -- incredible pop-punk hooks and layer after layer of sugar sweet harmonies copped from THE BEACH BOYS. They cover the BEATNIK TERMITES on this four song debut record -- few bands can pull that challenging task off -- and they do it spectacularly. A taste of RAMONES downstroking, some of the catchiest originals you're ever gonna hear, and MASTERFUL vocal delivery makes for a very satisfying 4 song pop-punk rip... Another Mutant Pop record and a Mutant Pop CD are forthcoming in the next 12 months, jump on this train before it leaves the station! -- T. Chandler, Mutant Pop Records. \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":21339985,"name":"Default","price":2.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":1.8,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.7},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65899293/-/lobss.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65899293/-/lobss.jpg","width":600,"height":596},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65899341/-/lobb.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65899341/-/lobb.jpg","width":600,"height":590},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122638950/-/LOBSL.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122638950/-/LOBSL.jpeg","width":600,"height":598}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325215,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":3424241,"name":"Mutant Pop Records","permalink":"mutant-pop-records","url":"/category/mutant-pop-records"}]},{"id":6712001,"name":"The Automatics - Karaoke Party - 7\" white vinyl","permalink":"the-automatics-karaoke-party-7-white-vinyl","position":198,"price":1.99,"default_price":1.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-automatics-karaoke-party-7-white-vinyl","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-16T15:25:51.000Z","description":"The Automatics - Karaoke Party - 7\" ltd white vinyl\r\n\r\nThe Automatics was reviewed in MRR as \"sounds like kids trying to make a hit record in their garage,\" which is spot-on perfect. An equal joint-partnership between Bassist Jesse Kimball and Guitarist Jesse Sutherland (later of THE EPOXIES, who were fronted by Jesse K's ex-live in girlfriend, photographer Meredith DeLoca). Both were Ramones-loving punk rockers throughout the 1980s. The basic idea of the band was SHORT SONGS, so that \"by the time people figured out they didn't like one song, we'd be on to the next,\" as my friend JK told me. Lyrical retards in the best way, think Ramones, MRR said of one release that \"The Automatics make The Queers sound like Shakespeare.\" In their earliest phase, the Autos were very much in the vein of the Queers -- very poppy, not afraid of harmonies, tuneful, ballsy, gritty, and a little bit sloppy. They consciously tried to write underground pop hits, were goofy enough to record a song in Finnish (with horns!), and loved to tour and play basement shows in front of 10 people who really cared. Later left MP for my friend Jason Duncan's label, Just Add Water Records, because they were tending to the garage punk end of the spectrum and wanted to distance themselves from pop punk. \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":21339845,"name":"Default","price":1.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":1.8,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65898709/-/AUTO.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65898709/-/AUTO.gif","width":216,"height":216},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65898773/-/DSC00578.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65898773/-/DSC00578.JPG","width":997,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325215,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":3424241,"name":"Mutant Pop Records","permalink":"mutant-pop-records","url":"/category/mutant-pop-records"}]},{"id":6711973,"name":"The Impulse Int'l - Saturday Suzie - 7\" pink vinyl + UK only signed insert","permalink":"the-impulse-int-l-saturday-suzie-7-pink-vinyl-uk-only-signed-insert","position":199,"price":1.99,"default_price":1.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-impulse-int-l-saturday-suzie-7-pink-vinyl-uk-only-signed-insert","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-16T15:20:09.000Z","description":"The Impulse Int'l - Saturday Suzie - 7\" ltd pink vinyl + UK only signed insert\r\n \r\nBRIGHT PINK OPAQUE VINYL 7\" WITH RARE UK ONLY INSERT LIMITED TO 50 COPIES ONLY-THIS INSERT IS HAND SIGNED AND COLOURED BY ALL THE BAND-EACH ONE IS INDIVIDUAL \r\n\r\nTHE IMPULSE INTERNATIONAL are the new power-pop/'77 sound punk band featuring Dirt Bike Adam of the late and great DIRT BIKE ANNIE in new clothes as guitarist \"Julius Buck.\" As with DBA before them, this veritable triple-A-side 7\" is fast and catchy and lyrically cool, daddio.

The 3 song recording they made came in over the time limit for safety at 33 rpm, so I decided to make sure I had SOMETHING cool out of the project, so I wound up pressing two different B-sides and using two different colors of vinyl. The record sold out pretty fast because most people bought two copies and I decided to let the title go into the night rather than print new sleeves and press up another 1000 on black.

They did a song called \"I Sing About Girls.\" Yet, over time, we have craftsmanship and lyrical excellence emerging. This band's first release was a SRCD, THEN the vinyl, then another SRCD... When I fucked the pooch on MP, they took the album to an MP-fan named Matt, who put it out on his bedroom label. They did a split with The Proteens on Imperfekt Records also. Originally from Pennsylvania, the band is now located in Portland, Oregon and has an extensive discography. Forthcoming MP record; back ON the label.  - T.

AJ plays bass now and Nathan and Sean of Culo still hold down the fort on guitar and drums and the guitar tone you loved is still present if not more raw here. Plus Nathan again adorns the world with his art and I feel this is his greatest work yet. I'd like the music to be remembered too, but even if the art only was I'd be content with that. Musically we share more in common with Modern Warfare, Secret Hate, Zero Boys, Social Unrest and Fatal Rage and the Freeze a little lyrically but I also make strange lyric arrangements. BUT, I think we sound like us at the same time and not just sounding like yesterday's tunes. Pressed at Erika and comes with a full color cover, screen printed dust sleeves, hand stamped center labels and a 20 x 20'' full color poster, nothing about this record was cheap. This dark blue marbled vinyl, truly to me one of the best looking color records the label has created. 100 were made, you can only get this version from Blitzrecords or from the band on tour!\r\n - Sick Nick Cowabunga Records","options":[{"id":21226197,"name":"Default","price":5.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":3.0},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65532325/-/birth_dd.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65532325/-/birth_dd.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68600739/-/DSC00961.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68600739/-/DSC00961.JPG","width":1000,"height":991}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3442123,"name":"10\"","permalink":"10","url":"/category/10"},{"id":3325221,"name":"Cowabunga Records","permalink":"cowabunga-records","url":"/category/cowabunga-records"}]},{"id":6640109,"name":"The Impulse Int'l - Saturday Suzie - 7\" pink vinyl Japan only + poster","permalink":"the-impulse-int-l-saturday-suzie-7-pink-vinyl-japan-only-poster","position":213,"price":1.99,"default_price":1.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-impulse-int-l-saturday-suzie-7-pink-vinyl-japan-only-poster","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-07T22:52:37.000Z","description":"The Inpulse International - Saturday Suzie - ltd pink vinyl for export to Japan only with poster insert.\r\n\r\nTHE IMPULSE INTERNATIONAL are the new power-pop/'77 sound punk band featuring Dirt Bike Adam of the late and great DIRT BIKE ANNIE in new clothes as guitarist \"Julius Buck.\" As with DBA before them, this veritable triple-A-side 7\" is fast and catchy and lyrically cool, daddio.

Pop punk poetry set to crunching guitars, sung by an ubernasal vocal contortionist. Words don't do justice. Utterly unique in sound. For my money one of the 4 biggest pop-punk bands of the 1990s (along with Screeching Weasel, The Queers, and MTX). You might add Jawbreaker and make it 5. Brandon Tussey \"Dung\" is a troubled soul and a great artist. The songs are upbeat and catchy, and heartfelt. The lyrics, first rate. Early material was cartoonish, later material much more serious and poetic in a Jets to Brazil/Weakerthans sort of way. This was one of the biggest bands \"on\" the label from 1996-2000. Brandon changed the band name to A Radio With Guts and made one more album after my 5. There is some chance he'll be back on MP someday; the probability of a new 7\" is very, very high.--T.

They have released several albums, including the 1996 Melon (BYO Records) produced by the legendary Blag Dahlia, and the 1999 No More Room in Hell (Recess Records) which was effectively an album of unreleased demos. \r\nJon Cougar Concentration Camp was formed in January 1994 in San Diego, California by Chris Fields, Clint Graham, Travis Spatter, and Travis Milligan. “There were a lot of people coming and going back then. We were just the four people that happened to be jamming together that night we came up with the name,” said Chris Fields, speaking of the punk house he dwelled in at the time. They played their first show at The Casbah on January 31, 1994. Less than two months later they released their first 7” EP on their own label. JCCC toured up and down the West Coast over the next 6 months. Word of the band traveled fast and before they knew it they were releasing their first full length album. They juggled drummers over the following year, and when asked to tour the entire US, Dave Swain came in to replace Clint and Travis. JCCC were a three piece when they signed to BYO Records. \r\nDuring a break between tours and recording in 1996, Chris joined The Queers to support their album Don't Back Down. Chris jumped between The Queers and JCCC for a year before bringing fellow JCCC member Dave Swain into The Queers as well. Fields said, “I felt bad putting JCCC on hold all the time and leaving Dave hangin.” For a while, both Chris and Dave played in both bands. JCCC even went out in support of the Queers on a US tour, and filled in for them in Italy. During the recording of JCCC’s Melon the band brought in punk rock legend Blag Dahlia (Dwarves) to produce the album. Blag was impressed by Chris’s talent and asked him to join the Dwarves. After being overwhelmed by all three bands, Chris left the Queers and ended Jon Cougar Concentration Camp in 1999. He played in the Dwarves over the next three years and still has close ties with them. Dave is still with The Queers. \r\nFrom 2000 to 2006, JCCC occasionally played shows in San Diego with the original members. \r\nChris' newest project is called End Of Power and is still a current member of The Dwarves. Dave Swain is a member of The Queers, and has a new band called The Bugs. Fields produced and played drums on their debut album. During the recording of The Bugs, Dave and Chris along with other musicians recorded Screeching Weasel's My Brain Hurts album as Jon Cougar Concentration Camp.

The original lineup was Katon W. De Pena (vocals), Bob Savage (guitar), Gary Monardo (bass), and Brian Keith (drums). They released a four-song demo in 1984. Their songs at the time were more similar to the metal bands such as Saxon, Tygers of Pan Tang, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden and the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal period. This demo was widely circulated and the band became known and respected worldwide through the metal tape trading underground. Later in '84, guitarist Scott Owen and drummer John Tabares replaced Savage and Keith. Influenced by such great acts as Motorhead, Anvil, and Venom, Vocalist De Pena wanted the band to go in a heavier and faster direction musically; and HIRAX's thrash metal style was born.

Fans of Bolt Thrower, Terrorizer, Daughters, Ed Gein and Assuck will soon be suffering from a case of headbanger's neck. \"Wounded\" was recorded by Ryan Butler @ Arcane Digital (Impaled, North Side Kings) and mastered by Dave Shirk @ Sonorus (Mastodon, Converge, Nasum).

Its progressed a little but not to the point where its evil to punks. Its like its more refined and the band knows which direction to take this musically. Lyrically it tackles similar angry topics as the demo did-being pro anti-religion, questioning politics (NOT preaching) and also a song about trying to not think of everything in a negative way, to be positive for a change. It's kind of like stuff you've heard before but really can't make comparisons to other bands with this record as they've developed a sound all their own &t its clearly midwestern.

The band is now back with Andrew who was their guitarist on the 'Torture' EP but don't think for a second the band has reverted back to the sounds of that record. On this 2nd full length record the band still has some of that unique mix of NYHC, YOT and Infest sound as shown on the Punish LP but it also incorporates a bit more HHIG, Tragedy and Deathside influence of hardcore creating almost melodic angry hardcore tunes here but they also continue to add the influence of deeper and heavier hardcore to their sound that they'd previously hinted at in their evil blend of hardcore. There's even this early Hatebreed and Blood For Blood sound but fear not for where they got that sound down a little, there's more semblance lyrically to those bands. This is the most HATEFUL material the band has done to date and I've never in my life seen a band continue to write such angry and despising lyrics like this and to actually make them more pointed and just get better in time astounds me. The tracks off the This Comp Kills Fascists were already in the red but this really takes it. Basically John hates all of us and you have to accept that.

I remember getting a demo at random one day last year from Jeff (vox) and being very impressed by said demo tape, which is rare for me as I normally hear a band for myself (as in not getting a demo sent to me) & ask them myself to do a release. Well, this EP mops the floor with that demo stuff. The lyrics more pertain to typical angry topics of hardcore (growing out of the music, being hateful and just not getting along with everyone) than just being straight edge fare, which is rather enjoyable & reminded me of Cold Shoulder in that regard. I mean its like ''yeah, I already know you're drug/alcohol free so tell me something else too in your lyrics'' which is what's so refreshing about these sorts of sXe bands! Musically its of course hardcore punk, doesn't sound like any set band but is def influenced by bands like DYS and the Abused-but only influenced, not a ripoff. Also takes cues from modern edge bands with a huge penchant for punk! MRR said 'if punks were playing youth crew', think along those lines. Jeff's voice also is unique and that's another thing that makes this stand out-his voice has been compared to Craig of the Degenerics and I sort of agree. I'm also guessing by the cover its a subtle reference to their home state's Chronic Sick perhaps? A current fave of mine out of the east, if you really like straight edge HC and general hardcore punk check this out! This is the limited color vinyl for this EP,  We asked for RED w BLACK swirls but got DARK MAROON with a RED stripe for the majority of the copies, stripes vary in size and some are more of a clearish BRICK RED without a stripe.

A paramount product of composition, sonic-rendering and package, this second volume of bass / percussion / electronics structured work realizes the full, true power of \"THE SKULL\" as a critical force in contemporary musical expression. Here \"spun-steel-girder\" virtuoso Eric Wood and Trogotronic \"electronic-ace\" WT Nelson are joined by original Man Is the Bastard master-drummer Joel Connell for what could become the most interesting T.B.N combination to date following the departure of Danny Walker and his unmatched performance in the previous lineup. Both LP and CD formats feature unhinged brutish imagery: The LP clad in full-color gatefold album jacket and poster; the compact disc is manufactured as a miniature LP with an all-paper, baby-gatefold album jacket and full-color twelve-page booklet. Both formats contain complete documentation including lyrical content and wry \"skull-commentary\" for every cut. A Culture of Monsters will pleasurably submerge sonic desire until it is abruptly crushed under extreme pressure of singular execution and stunning complexity. \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":20461145,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.6,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63113125/-/BAST.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63113125/-/BAST.jpg","width":400,"height":405},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63113197/-/bn.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63113197/-/bn.jpg","width":210,"height":252}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325217,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"},{"id":3325223,"name":"Deep Six Records","permalink":"deep-six-records","url":"/category/deep-six-records"}]},{"id":6618111,"name":"B-Lines - S/T - LP","permalink":"b-lines-s-t-lp","position":277,"price":5.99,"default_price":5.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/b-lines-s-t-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-05T02:52:20.000Z","description":"B-LINES s/t 12” \r\n\r\nB-Lines follow-up their sold out debut 7\" with nine more short, sharp odes to awkwardness, alienation, and their hometown of Vancouver.

I hate saying this still and I think they're bored of it by now but Adam was the 1st Weekend Nachos drummer (demo up to the split w CBS) and Kirk was in MK Ultra, who was always one of the few 90's HC local bands I ever liked. Cover art done by Alex of White Walls if you need to know who came up with that, Mr McCoy did the logo which adorns the back cover (and has resurfaced on each release since the demo). Here is the LIMITED Mailorder version! 100 were done on WHITE/BLACK wax Blend and I have 80 copies,, its basically GREY wax with slight WHITE swirls, these actually look pretty damn cool. \r\n","options":[{"id":20570129,"name":"Default","price":2.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":1.8,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.5},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63484205/-/sick_20tired_20st.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63484205/-/sick_20tired_20st.jpg","width":1000,"height":995},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63484693/-/sicc.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63484693/-/sicc.jpg","width":800,"height":532}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325215,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":3325221,"name":"Cowabunga Records","permalink":"cowabunga-records","url":"/category/cowabunga-records"}]},{"id":6463205,"name":"Burning Love - Demo - 7\" Purple vinyl","permalink":"burning-love-demo-7-purple-vinyl","position":285,"price":3.99,"default_price":3.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/burning-love-demo-7-purple-vinyl","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-16T01:27:32.000Z","description":"Burning Love - Demo 7\" - ltd purple vinyl - UK only\r\n\r\nhttp://derangedrecords.bandcamp.com/album/demo\r\n\r\nTrack list--LIVES OF THE SAINTS/ALIEN VS CREDITOR/MONEY SHOTS/I DONT LIKE YOU(Battalion of Saints)/BURNING LOVE \r\n\r\nTHIS IS THE UK ONLY RELEASE ON CLEAR PURPLE VINYL LIMITED TO 250 \r\n\r\nIncludes free button badge and postcard \r\n\r\nALREADY OUT OF PRINT \r\n\r\nThe first vinyl offering from Toronto’s BURNING LOVE featuring Chris Colohan (CURSED, LEFT FOR DEAD, RUINATION) on vocals. Originally released as a limited cassette demo in 2009, now available on vinyl. Definitely more punk than CURSED but still rooted stoner / doomy metal hardcore. 4 originals and one cover. 2nd 7” and LP coming out soonish on DERANGED and a full USA and Canadian tour later this year. Review from EXCLAIM ‘While the name may deceive, there's no love ― just burning ― on this Toronto, ON-based quintet's energetic and completely grimy debut recording. Comprised of six tracks blasted out in ten minutes, the garage-based endeavour is shockingly debaucherous and unkempt. Essentially comprised of former Cursed vocalist Chris Colohan and Hamilton doom-y hardcore outfit Vatican Chainsaw Massacre, this sinister collaboration spawns a dirtier punk'n'roll-based hardcore outfit than one would anticipate. Their drive elicits comparisons to Disfear, Holland's the Spades, back in their Learnin' The Hard Way era, and of course, Colohan's deep-rooted adoration for Winnipeg, MB's dearly departed Kittens, offering an element of downbeat-heavy tracks bathed in primal angst. Keenly restrained enough to be melodic but still abrasive and loud, Burning Love offer up what's best described as the pelvis-driven distillation of their feeder bands. And that is great but pretty frustrating when such an awesomely primitive, rudimentary style can be so inspiring and brusque yet ephemeral.’ \r\n","options":[{"id":20566703,"name":"Default","price":3.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":1.8,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63472589/-/burninglove_demo_hi.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63472589/-/burninglove_demo_hi.jpg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63472669/-/bu.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63472669/-/bu.jpg","width":494,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325215,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"}]},{"id":6428973,"name":"Looking For An Answer - Eterno Treblinka - LP colour vinyl /100","permalink":"looking-for-an-answer-eterno-treblinka-lp-colour-vinyl-100","position":286,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/looking-for-an-answer-eterno-treblinka-lp-colour-vinyl-100","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-12T13:04:02.000Z","description":"Looking For An Answer - Eterno Treblinka - LP ltd colour vinyl\r\n\r\nThe second full length, killer Spanish grind in the old school vein full of pissed off riffs.

For years we had been planning to record a definitive full length follow up with different songs than the previous EP, but we finally made it - only16 years later. We chose a selection of the Italian Punk/Hardcore/Thrash bands that influenced us most in the early days and helped forge our sound, and it's also our homage to those whose members have become our friends throughout the years.\" The cover art of the album was drawn by Andrei Bouzikov (Municipal Waste, Voetsek, Violator, Deadfall, Cannabis Corpse etc).

LP - mailorder only of 100 on green vinyl \r\n\r\nDo you fancy powerful tunes? Do you like violent music? If the answer is YES, therefore you are a powerviolence hound! If so, these lads sure will appeal to you. Australia’s Extortion has got the idea of powerviolence pretty good- fast riffs, and even faster beats with a minimum of mid tempo or even slow parts. The only three slow songs are: Bedridden, Body failure and Rot (a teeth grinding instrumental), which are not to be doubted about their fuss and energy. \r\nThe matter of this very review is Extortion’s latest record, named SICK. And some sick album this is. An issue of Deep Six records, this purple vinyl features tracks in the vein of bands such as Infest, Lack Of Interest, Crossed Out, No Comment. The album cover is something that catches your attention right away- a suffering little girl with tears of pain in her eyes vomiting black fluid. Quite remarkable. The songs are conceptual and describe the slow and excruciating death of a person infected with the H5N1 virus. Each next song’s lyrics describe a different stage of the illness (Infection… Fever… Medication… Bedridden… Last Breath). What a ferocious idea, eh?

Brutal Truth was active mainly from 1990-1999, releasing four studio albums during that time including the classic Need To Control. They reformed in 2006, toured the world and released the new album Evolution Through Revolution in 2009. Besides the five studio albums the Brutal Truth discography includes several EPs and rare split singles . \r\n\r\nSpazz was an influential American powerviolence band active between 1992 and 2000. The trio released numerous records within this time, many of which are now highly collectible due to their relative rarity. The band's releases often showcased their unusual sense of humour: absurdly long and nonsensical song titles, audio samples from b-movies and kung-fu films between songs and the occasional use of hip hop beats as well as saxophones, banjos and other instruments rarely associated within hardcore punk. All three of the members shared vocal duties, usually changing in sequence from line to line. \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":20453751,"name":"Default","price":3.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":1.8,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.5},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63086663/-/BT.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63086663/-/BT.jpg","width":800,"height":778},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63086847/-/spazz.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63086847/-/spazz.jpg","width":491,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3325215,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":3325223,"name":"Deep Six Records","permalink":"deep-six-records","url":"/category/deep-six-records"}]},{"id":6422893,"name":"Fucked Up/Haymaker - Split 7\" - green vinyl + badge","permalink":"fucked-up-haymaker-split-7-clear-vinyl-badge","position":293,"price":3.99,"default_price":3.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fucked-up-haymaker-split-7-clear-vinyl-badge","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-11T22:08:13.000Z","description":"Fucked Up/Haymaker - Split 7\" - ltd green vinyl + badge\r\n\r\nFUCKED UP - BLACK IRON PRISON/DOVE OF WOOD/DOVE OF WOOD/THE BLACK RATS/SURROUNDED BY BOYS-RECORDED AT 'SIGNAL TO NOISE STUDIO' TORONTO, 22/7/2002. \r\n\r\nHAYMAKER - HERE LIES THE FUTURE / IN HOME SURVEILLANCE / NO ONE ASKED ME / I DONT NEED IT / FIND YOURSELF-RECORDED AT 'THE MUSIC GYM' 31/2/2002 \r\n\r\nLIMITED PRESS 10 TRK SPLIT 7\" SINGLE EP ON CLEAR VINYL WITH PLAIN BLACK LABELS IN FOLDOUT COVER FROM THE CANADIAN HARDCORE GIANTS. \r\n\r\nFucked Up - To my mind this is one of the best punk bands of the 21st Century thus far.

More than a few things kept this sucker from coming out for sometime but it finally sees the light of day! You may remember them from their early demos, split tapes or of course the split 10'' w Hummingbird of Death which are all fine and good recordings, but they really need to be heard on this record. Harsh, brutal and hate filled east coast grind-violence from these straight edge guys. Violent lyrics & imagery remains the usual theme for this band on this EP (like any of their past material) and its all done in a very non-gimmicky kind of way, which is refreshing. Recording is very punk and the sound is lo-fi,, which is perfect for a record like this. This style of harsh, real 'power violence' is NOT for everyone, so wimps and poseurs need not apply since this is for the real cult freaks. 19 songs in all on this EP, they're influenced by such greats as Plutocracy, Assuck, No Comment and Excruciating Terror who are all bands I'd say if you like and listen to, you should get this record. We have 1 color vinyl EXCLUSIVE to us and the band also has a color vinyl EXCLUSIVE to them. This isn't some collector scheme, it was done to help them sell their records locally and make that color an 'east coast' exclusive.

I (like others) raved about the demo & can only say if you enjoyed the demo that this one will knock your socks off. I sound like a used car salesman here! Anyways, its 6 well written short HC songs that are chock full of power. Erik is a great guitarist as his riffs hold a significant bit of importance to their sound and Kevin is a frantic frontman. Comparisons are indeed stupid and I'm guilty as charged, but elements of numerous sources can be culled here- Jellyroll Rockheads, Deep Wound, Siege, VOID, the Futures, Cold Sweat (esp in vocals) etc. Like a lot of stuff done on this label, this is for the cultist nuts for HC. It's never intended this way but I think those heavily involved or obsessed with crazy and intricate HC (like me obviously) will 'get this' the most.

I'll admit that other 10%, yeah these are what I've realized to be bad calls that I've kind of come to regret in a number of ways that will remain unmentioned, but this is one of my favorite records I've done and it was done by my favorite current band. It's NOT HARDCORE so I will just say that now. You only want super fast and have a closed in mind, you'll def not enjoy this. The band plays catchy punk but it's not pop punk. It's indie rock influenced but not indie rock. I can't describe this band exactly as its so spread out except they play their style extremely well and their songs stick in your head from one to the next. The sound they have now is a bit different from where they started. At 1st they had a Dinosaur Jr heaviness done to a Greg Ginn riff feast, a Husker Du wall of sound all crossed with a Descendents catchiness sort of way to their music. And yes, all of that still applies to the band to a degree but they incorporate more middle era Beatles, soul, early Kinks and post Let It Be later Replacements to the mix and that's Tenement's latest masterpiece. 11 stellar songs (the 1st 6 appeared on the rough mix tour tape release 'the Blind Wink' last winter) mastered by their guy Justin Perkins who's worked the knobs on the majority of their records. I would highly suggest this to those who actually listen to what I would consider good music as well as punk in general.

Regulars should know how much I love this band, so I won't get into it. On this their 3rd record, the band brings you their best tracks to date! These 6 tracks still follow the same path as the other 2 records of 1980'81 influenced punk rock that's fence riding hardcore (with so subtle rock influence), but if you ask me the band has an even grittier influence to it this time from Solger to early PI flowing thru the riffs. Of course Black Flag whether they like it or not remains a comparison note and plus on this one you can actually make out some of Luke's vocals on here. Mastered by Dan Randall for maximum effect making it their finest effort to date.

This band keeps a low profile most likely to not giving a damn, but anyway their demo made some rounds but seemed to only make it into the hands of well researched demo collectors. Well this is their debut EP and if you didn't know the band they play a rowdy style of east coast hardcore punk that's ready for you to skank & bedroom mosh to. When I first heard the demo in 2009 I immediately thought of stuff like CFD era Necros meets early NYHC injected with a real dose of PUNK and it totally stomped my nuts. This debut EP is more of that same greatness but maybe add in some grittier elements like Nihilistics, make it more tough, mid tempo yet a little faster & again more punk. And yet, they still sound so distinctly Canadian and I mean that in the best way. Boasts members of the lovely OMEGAS and Naughty Girls for those sorts of people who buy records based off that unimportant 'members of' crap.
