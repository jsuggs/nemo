They are not wrapped yarn or wool roving (which could unravel over time). \r\n\r\nThe wool used in these dryer balls has not been carbonized, like commercial yarns and rovings. Carbonization is the process of removing vegetable matter (like hay or grass) from the fiber using sulpheric acid and other toxic chemicals to break down the hay and grass from the wool. This process leaves a chemical residue on the fiber. \r\n\r\nJust throw 3, 4, or more dryer balls (the more the merrier) in your drying load and watch your drying time decrease by at least 25%. The more balls you use the more you save on drying time. You also no longer will need dryer sheets--the wool rids your clothing of static.\r\n\r\nThey are a small investment for something that lasts so long and saves money on electricity and toxic dryer sheets (have you read the MSDS sheet on dryer sheets...shudder). Keep your family and pets safe and use non toxic dryer balls and last a long, long time, saving you money in the long run.\r\n\r\nThey come from the earth and return to the earth\r\n\r\n(Although these are being advertised as dryer balls, they could also be used in craft projects. Make a snowman, or draw lines to make them look like baseballs or soccer balls.

(I am not thrilled with the appearance of these remaining bars. They are felted well, still smell super yummy-handmade soap-I just ran the wool through my carder too many times and the colors are too well blended, IMO. So...they are now 50% off!)\r\n\r\nWhat is felted soap? (Each bar weighs 3.5-4 ounces)\r\nFelted soap is basically wool wrapped around a bar of soap and then the wool is felted to insure it stays put. It acts as a built-in washcloth around the soap. It functions as a gentle exfoliator and will shrink with the soap as the soap shrinks. Plenty of suds are still able to get through the wool and the wool helps the soap last longer. This wool is naturally anti-microbial so no worries about mold or mildew. After each use simply squeeze out the excess water and leave it propped on its side so it can dry completely--don't leave it sitting in water and you won't be left with a messy puddle of soap (like what happens with naked soap). When the soap is gone you're left with a wool cloth that will remain scented. Put the yummy smelling fiber in your dresser drawers to keep clothes smelling fresh, or in smelly shoes to keep the odor away!\r\n\r\nI dyed this wool myself, carded it and then felted each bar by hand. The fibers used on these bars is merino wool (the softest most gentle wool) and alpaca (unbelievably silky soft). The colors are blended bright pink, yellow, green, peach and a bit of black. Each bar has a fun tie-dyed look, you just need to choose your desired scent.\r\n\r\nIngredients in handmade soap: coconut oil, palm oil, olive oil. Scented with pure essential oils. Colored with natural herbs.\r\n\r\nFeel free to message me with any questions.","options":[{"id":43614426,"name":"Oatmeal/Lavender","price":3.5,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.55,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":8.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124394766/-/Felted_soap1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124394766/-/Felted_soap1.jpg","width":570,"height":570},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124394781/-/Felted_soap2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124394781/-/Felted_soap2.jpg","width":570,"height":570},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124394790/-/felted_soap3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124394790/-/felted_soap3.jpg","width":570,"height":570}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6228813,"name":"Felted Items","permalink":"felted-items","url":"/category/felted-items"},{"id":6334176,"name":"SALE ITEMS","permalink":"sale-items","url":"/category/sale-items"}]},{"id":14158239,"name":"Royality","permalink":"royality","position":62,"price":23.5,"default_price":23.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/royality","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-14T00:55:52.000Z","description":"This is a single plied, bulky weight skein.
