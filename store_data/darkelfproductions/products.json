The beetle is known for coming out of the sand backwards dragging its ball of dung behind it along the ground before depositing it in underground tunnels as a source of food for its larvae, therefore symbolizing the sun’s daily journey across the heavens from East to West. Because the young beetles seemed to emerge spontaneously from these tunnels, the Egyptians worshipped the scarab under the name Khepri: “He who came forth from the earth” or “He who came into being”. Thus the beetle was equated with the creator Got Atum from early times. Scarabs thus became potent amulets and were often placed upon the breasts of mummies in the position of the heart as a symbol of new life and were then weighed against the feather of truth in the final judgment. They were usually inscribed with part of chapter 30 of the Book of the Dead.","options":[{"id":21388961,"name":"X Small ","price":70.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21242557,"name":"Small","price":70.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21242559,"name":"Medium","price":70.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21242561,"name":"Large","price":70.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21329463,"name":"X Large","price":70.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65849141/-/Isis_Dress.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65849141/-/Isis_Dress.jpg","width":1000,"height":751},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65979045/-/Isis_Dress_Ava_FRBK.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65979045/-/Isis_Dress_Ava_FRBK.jpg","width":1000,"height":751},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66078413/-/Isis_Dress_Pic_FRBK.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66078413/-/Isis_Dress_Pic_FRBK.jpg","width":1000,"height":751},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65985645/-/Isis_Ankh_Design.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65985645/-/Isis_Ankh_Design.jpg","width":1000,"height":751},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65975421/-/Scarab_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65975421/-/Scarab_2.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":269197,"name":"Dresses","permalink":"dresses","url":"/category/dresses"},{"id":269199,"name":"Female","permalink":"female","url":"/category/female"}]},{"id":6679201,"name":"Temple Of Zen","permalink":"ava-coat-2","position":2,"price":70.0,"default_price":70.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ava-coat-2","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-12T09:28:30.000Z","description":"This is a women's regular-fit tank dress with an inset pocket on each side seam and five-inch vents at sides of bottom hem.

Then the victory is yours. It cannot be taken from you, not by angels or by demons, heaven or hell.\" (Buddha) \r\n\r\nGautama Buddha was born in 563 b.c. in northeast India. The Buddha was the son of the King of the Sakyas. Suddhodana, who ruled at Kapilavastu, on the border of Nepal. His mother was Queen Maya. He was named Siddhartha. He lived amidst the pleasures of palace life and at age 16 he was married to Princess Yasodhara. They had a son named Rahula. After seeing a decrepit old man, an invalid, and an ascetic beggar, he learned of suffering and decided to embrace asceticism. Soon afterward, at age 29, Siddhartha left the palace and his family and went to a hermitage where he became the monk Gautama, or, as he is still called, Sakyamuni (The ascetic of the Sakyas). One day, meditating under a sacred fig tree, he attained perfect illumination (Bodhi). He had become a Buddha. From there on he traveled and preached for 44 years what was to become one of the main religions of the world. He died at Kusinagara at age 80.","options":[{"id":21242731,"name":"X Small","price":70.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21388999,"name":"Small","price":70.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21389001,"name":"Medium","price":70.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21389003,"name":"Large","price":70.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21389005,"name":"X Large","price":70.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65855285/-/BUD_Dress.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65855285/-/BUD_Dress.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65981253/-/Bud_Dress_Ava_FRBK.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65981253/-/Bud_Dress_Ava_FRBK.jpg","width":1000,"height":751},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66166925/-/Bud_Dress_Pic_FRBK.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66166925/-/Bud_Dress_Pic_FRBK.jpg","width":1000,"height":751},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65984893/-/Bud_Fr_Bk_Designs.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65984893/-/Bud_Fr_Bk_Designs.jpg","width":1000,"height":751},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65975997/-/BUD_Stat_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65975997/-/BUD_Stat_2.jpg","width":750,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":269197,"name":"Dresses","permalink":"dresses","url":"/category/dresses"},{"id":269199,"name":"Female","permalink":"female","url":"/category/female"}]},{"id":6688511,"name":"The House Of Bathory","permalink":"ava-dress-test-3","position":3,"price":70.0,"default_price":70.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ava-dress-test-3","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-13T10:09:13.000Z","description":"<img src=\"http://www.evilempiremarketing.com/darkelfproductions/Images/Store%20Images/aboveslidesbannerBATHORYsmxx.jpg\" width=\"\" height=\"\" border=\"\" alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  align=\"\"  />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.behance.net/gallery/The-House-Of-Bathory-Screen-Printed-Bo-Tank-Dresses/6874871\" target=\"_blank\" >SEE MORE ABOUT THIS PIECE ON OUR PORTFOLIO</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://darkelfproductions.com/neversleep/?p=244\" target=\"_blank\" >READ ABOUT THE ARTWORK DETAILS AND BACKGROUND</a>\r\n\r\nThis is a women's regular-fit tank dress with an inset pocket on each side seam and five-inch vents at sides of bottom hem.

The Buddha was the son of the King of the Sakyas. Suddhodana, who ruled at Kapilavastu, on the border of Nepal. His mother was Queen Maya. He was named Siddhartha. He lived amidst the pleasures of palace life and at age 16 he was married to Princess Yasodhara. They had a son named Rahula. After seeing a decrepit old man, an invalid, and an ascetic beggar, he learned of suffering and decided to embrace asceticism. Soon afterward, at age 29, Siddhartha left the palace and his family and went to a hermitage where he became the monk Gautama, or, as he is still called, Sakyamuni (The ascetic of the Sakyas). One day, meditating under a sacred fig tree, he attained perfect illumination (Bodhi). He had become a Buddha. From there on he traveled and preached for 44 years what was to become one of the main religions of the world. He died at Kusinagara at age 80.","options":[{"id":21243003,"name":"X Small","price":80.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21389007,"name":"Small","price":80.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21389009,"name":"Medium","price":80.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21389011,"name":"Large","price":80.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21389013,"name":"X Large","price":80.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65856363/-/BUD_Shirt.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65856363/-/BUD_Shirt.jpg","width":745,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65983445/-/Bud_Shirt_Ava_FRBK.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65983445/-/Bud_Shirt_Ava_FRBK.jpg","width":1000,"height":751},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66166865/-/Bud_Shirt_Pic_FRBK.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66166865/-/Bud_Shirt_Pic_FRBK.jpg","width":1000,"height":509},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65984853/-/Bud_Fr_Bk_Designs.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65984853/-/Bud_Fr_Bk_Designs.jpg","width":1000,"height":751},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65976993/-/BUD_box_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65976993/-/BUD_box_2.jpg","width":750,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":269199,"name":"Female","permalink":"female","url":"/category/female"},{"id":3457931,"name":"Shirts","permalink":"shirts","url":"/category/shirts"}]},{"id":6806349,"name":"Lord Buddha","permalink":"bud-scarf","position":6,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bud-scarf","status":"sold-out","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-07-27T10:26:50.000Z","description":"This is a a large beautiful scarf that is perfect for fall or winter.

I have 2 of these (I had 3, but messed up the print on one of them! Grrrrr......) that I purchased at an estate sale. Im not sure when they were made..... the 60's, 70's or maybe the 80's.... ive looked online and cannot pinpoint it. The coats have shoulder pads... yes, shoulder pads.... but it makes them look very 'retro'.\r\n(you could rip them out if you want I suppose)\r\nFloor length..... a nicely tapered waist..... bright sexy red with black velvet cuffs & collar will definitely turn heads. 10 big black velvet buttons adorn the front of this coat. Worn unbuttoned its nice & 'cloak' like...... buttoned up its form fitting, classy yet sleek & elegant. \r\n\r\nTacky yet classy.\r\nCool & retro.\r\nA little 'Vampire Darkness' printed artwork mixed with an older looking 'Hollywood Flair' ......\r\nWear it to the club and I promise that someone will buy you a drink, or your money back!\r\n\r\nPlease read more about the artwork & it's inspiration <a href=\"http://darkelfproductions.com/neversleep/?p=252\" target=\"_blank\" > HERE.</a>\r\n\r\nDo NOT iron directly on top of printed design!
