'MELBOURNE' (PF145)\r\n\r\nIt is with great pleasure to be releasing the debut album titled 'Melbourne' of North Carolinian pop prodigy Jackson Scott.\r\n\r\nA college dropout with a 4-track recorder and a one-track mind. A listener and a conceiver. His voice, whether pitched up or androgynous, speaks of a still life. But painting is meaningless, songs irrelevant, aura outdated if you're a revivalist. Jackson is not.\r\n\r\nThe upcoming debut Melbourne shows we’re all alone together, sharing the same tragedies, ecstasies and phenomenon. He conspired it out of isolation, deprivation and hunger…you can’t survive on candy after all.\r\n\r\nJackson’s trans mutative live act is to that of the occultist – achieving eternal perfection. A trio that is liquidating the senses, seeking the perfect elixir, channeling kraut, punk, surf and pop as one psych rock solvent.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n1. Only Eternal\r\n2. Evie\r\n3.

The restless trend of changing gears dramatically continues on Antenna to the Afterworld, which marks a significant musical and narrative shift from last year’s Longtime Companion.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:  \r\n01.\tDark Corners\r\n02.\tMutilator\r\n03.\tPalmreader\r\n04.\tPath Of Orbit\r\n05.\tNatural Acts\r\n06.\tGirl On The Street\r\n07.\tDeath Scene\r\n08.\tPrimitive\r\n09.\tVoid\r\n10.\tEarth Girl\r\n11.\tGreen Blood","options":[{"id":36126339,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.3,"amount_with_others":2.2,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":4.4}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112836918/-/00554_Sonny-Sunsets-Antenna-1425.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112836918/-/00554_Sonny-Sunsets-Antenna-1425.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123621375/-/Sonny-website-pic1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123621375/-/Sonny-website-pic1.jpg","width":500,"height":335}],"artists":[{"id":205770,"name":"Sonny & The Sunsets","permalink":"sonny-the-sunsets","url":"/artist/sonny-the-sunsets"}],"categories":[{"id":943851,"name":"New","permalink":"new","url":"/category/new"},{"id":908361,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":943881,"name":"Album","permalink":"album","url":"/category/album"}]},{"id":11464080,"name":"FRENCH FILMS - WHITE ORCHID","permalink":"french-films-white-orchid","position":10,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/french-films-white-orchid","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-05-30T04:27:20.000Z","description":"FRENCH FILMS - WHITE ORCHID\r\n\r\nFormed in 2010, French Films is a five-piece indie rock band hailing from Finnish capital Helsinki.

The aim wasn’t simply to resuscitate and record old songs; in fact, many of them hadn’t become proper songs in the first place, existing only as basic ideas or undeveloped parts. Rather, the objective was to approach that unrealized work as an oblique strategy, a potential springboard for Wire’s contemporary, forward-looking processes – a possible point of departure for new compositions.\r\n\r\nThis took place with Wire firing on all cylinders, as a four-piece studio entity again, the core line-up of Colin Newman, Graham Lewis and **Robert Grey now enhanced by guitarist **Matthew Simms**. Simms had played a key role in helping the band to cultivate and shape its new sonic landscape throughout the preceding year’s live work. Out of the exploratory Rockfield session and subsequent, extensive development and production at Newman’s Swim Studio, the ostensible source material became, in the classic Wire tradition, something quite other than what it may have once been – or what it might have become if it had been pursued in 1980.\r\n\r\n1.

Funnily enough, this lackadaisical approach has come to form the foundations of the band’s debut LP. \r\n\r\nBetween the song writing of Nathan John Roche and Alex Kiers, ‘Couldn’t Be Better’ epitomizes the band’s enchantment with Sydney’s urban suburbia, whilst also romanticizing about the opposite gender, Sunday roasts and holding down a steady job. It’s about as smooth and easy-going as a road trip down the Princes highway – with a couple of bumpy, yet winning melodies thrown in along the way.\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\n1. Manly\r\n2.

Her solo project not only reflects the aesthetic earmarks of both those groups, but it also reveals her as a fully-formed artist in her own right. \r\n\r\nMs. Rose’s music is haunted by the ghosts of 60s girl group, Brill Building, and 80s and 90s noise pop in equal measure. It’s a spooky, lovely sound — Frankie’s ethereal yet affectation-free voice swirling in a sea of church-like harmonies over a bed of tambourines, bells, and propulsive drumming. Recalling in spirit such groups as The Aislers Set and Black Tambourine, Frankie’s music is both timeless and immediate, both deeply personal and completely universal.\r\n\r\nPitchfork cited her song “Where Do You Run To?” as one of the best of 2008, and now with much anticipation, Popfrenzy Records are excited to be releasing Frankie’s sophomore effort **Interstellar**.\r\n\r\n1.\tInterstellar\r\n2.\tKnow Me\r\n3.\tGospel/Me\r\n4.\tDaylight Sky\r\n5.\tPair Of Wings\r\n6.\tHad We Had It\r\n7.\tNight Swim\r\n8.\tApples For The Sun\r\n9.\tMoon In My Mind\r\n10.\tThe Fall","options":[{"id":22681785,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.4,"amount_with_others":3.3,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70300857/-/Interstellar-cover-dispatch.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70300857/-/Interstellar-cover-dispatch.jpg","width":750,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70300905/-/Frankie-dispatch.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70300905/-/Frankie-dispatch.jpg","width":725,"height":827}],"artists":[{"id":138511,"name":"Frankie Rose","permalink":"frankie-rose","url":"/artist/frankie-rose"}],"categories":[{"id":943851,"name":"New","permalink":"new","url":"/category/new"},{"id":908361,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":943881,"name":"Album","permalink":"album","url":"/category/album"}]},{"id":6215013,"name":"BEST COAST - THE ONLY PLACE (WITH FREE BEST COAST SUNNIES!!!)","permalink":"best-coast-the-only-place-with-free-best-coast-sticker","position":20,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/best-coast-the-only-place-with-free-best-coast-sticker","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-05-17T19:46:01.000Z","description":"BEST COAST - THE ONLY PLACE\r\n\r\n*WITH FREE BEST COAST SUNNIES!!!*\r\n\r\nThe Only Place, Best Coast’s follow-up to 2010’s acclaimed Crazy For You finds the proudly Southern Californian duo of Bethany Cosentino and Bobb Bruno maturing in both their sound and perspective.\r\n\r\nWhile Crazy For You was a nostalgic tribute to teenage feelings, The Only Place finds front woman Cosentino starting a transition into adulthood. “I’m trying really hard to grow up,” she says. “I’m trying to let go of my bad habits and the immature things I still drag around with me.” Of course this adjusting comes with uncertainty and self-doubt, two feelings at the emotional center of an album that also\r\nfeatures a love song to her home state of California in the title track.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n1.

As children of the 00's they're lucky enough to have a vast history of pop and indie rock to draw upon. Like the best of their peers they're omnivorous musical consumers, as enamored of classic Brit Pop gems as they are of 90s slacker indie rock. \r\n\r\nLed by two very gifted singer/song-writers in Alex Craig and Ian Drennan, Big Troubles are that rare beast: a band with two distinctive musical voices that smoothly mesh to create one integrated personality.\r\n\r\nRomantic Comedy kicks off with \"She Smiles For Pictures,\" a brilliant slice of jangle-pop marked by an ear-tugging guitar lead and gorgeous choirboy vocals. \"Misery\" is a perfect 2:23 of teen angst, fired by a huge bassline and echoed, chorused riffs that are as much 90s Brit Pop as they are 00s indie rock. First single \"Sad Girls\" is a lovely slice of updated power-pop based on a catchy stop-start verse that gives way to an indelible, spiraling chorus; this tune is as big and bright as they come. \"You'll Be Laughing\" gears down for a nuanced meditation on suburban ennui, showing that this band had more up its collective sleeve than just kicking out pop anthems.\r\n\r\nAnd so the record continues, through sure-fire entries into the noise-pop canon like the Boo Radleys-esque \"Minor Keys,\" the lovely rush of \"Softer Than Science\" and the glam-tinged feedback-fest that is \"Time Bomb.\" Romantic Comedy wraps up with the dreamy \"Engine\" and the driving \"Never Mine,\" adding two more gems to this excellent album. Big Troubles have that very rare combination of taste, skill and talent, and aided by Mr. Easter's recording acumen they've created a virtually perfect modern pop album -- one that tips its hat to choice bits of pop past and present, but at the same time creates something totally fresh.","options":[{"id":15536573,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46564483/-/Big-Troubles-Romantic-Comedy-500x500.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46564483/-/Big-Troubles-Romantic-Comedy-500x500.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46804429/-/BigTroubles-horizontal-web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46804429/-/BigTroubles-horizontal-web.jpg","width":500,"height":335}],"artists":[{"id":89363,"name":"Big Troubles","permalink":"big-troubles","url":"/artist/big-troubles"}],"categories":[{"id":943851,"name":"New","permalink":"new","url":"/category/new"},{"id":908361,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":943881,"name":"Album","permalink":"album","url":"/category/album"}]},{"id":4352091,"name":"SLOW CLUB - Paradise ","permalink":"slow-club-paradise-released-september-16","position":23,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/slow-club-paradise-released-september-16","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-08-31T08:00:54.000Z","description":"SLOW CLUB - Paradise\r\n\r\nParadise is the follow up to Slow Club’s critically acclaimed full-length debut Yeah, So, which won major attention from Paste and Venus to Bust and Pitchfork, who wrote that the \"Sheffield boy-girl duo nail precious, vulnerable feelings over the course of their sweet (but not twee or saccharine) indie pop debut.\"\r\n\r\nThe new album itself bears the touch of a songwriting unit who share and divide. Songs begin and end with Rebecca Taylor and Charles Watson swapping verses, even when the song itself is deeply personal to one of them. On Never Look Back, which bubbles into existence with cooing two-part harmony, Charles delivers the startling lines: “Baby brother in the next room, trying to bring him back to life”. It sees the 23 year-old singer recalling a dream in which an imaginary brother lays dying in the next room. On Two Cousins, Rebecca imagines that life is simply a journey which ends in our return to childhood when we die. “Hold on to where you’re from, it’s where you heart goes when you’re done”.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\nDISC ONE\r\n01.

All throughout, the undulating moods of the record are guided by a haunted three-part instrumental titled Heart: Attack, Heart: Decay, and Heart: Release. Once completed, the layers were then thawed and reassembled by Dave Fridmann (The Flaming Lips,\r\nMGMT), who mixed the album and did additional production with Palomo at his upstate Tarbox Studios.

SONGS (2 x LP)\r\n\r\nAVAILABLE ON DOUBLE VINYL AND LIMITED TO ONLY 200 COPIES!!\r\n\r\n**FOR A LIMITED TIME YOU'LL RECEIVE A FREE COPY OF SONGS S/T DEBUT EP AS WELL**\r\n\r\nSongs are walking the hard path back to modernism with a shrug.\r\n\r\nThe Sydney based band make echo heavy drone pop that gives modern music the cold shoulder. Squeezing into the gap between pop, minimalism and no wave, the sound of Songs is deceptively simple, friendly and willfully careless. They simulate the best of the 'New' music: New York during the 70's and New Zealand in the 80's. \r\n \r\nEchoing the repetition and minimalism of John Cale and La Monte Young, the guitar work shimmers and sprawls into long summer drones.  With the same attention to simplicity that inspired The Clean, the rhythms are stark and mechanical. Lead singer Max Doyle rambles, even chants, over the top, at times invoking a laissez-faire Tom Verlaine offset by the aching, morning after voice of Ela Stiles.\r\n\r\nGalaxie 500, sun drenched pop, and the most nihilist acid folk make a glorious union. But no influence is as strong as The Clean, New Zealand's greatest exponents of the Dunedin sound. Their ghost is felt in Songs’ dead pan humor, simple experimentation, and crystal tone. \r\n \r\nNo one has made “we don’t care” sound so friendly. \r\n\r\nTrack Listing:   \r\n01.  Farmacy \r\n02.

It was recorded by and mixed with Jason Loewenstein (Sebadoh) at the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 in New York City. Jason also played bass and Robert D’Amico played drums. All songs were written together by Eleanor and Matthew Friedberger, except for the title track, which is “trad. Arranged by.” Eleanor wrote most of the lyrics; Matt wrote most of the music and also produced the album. \r\n\r\nAll rock music is a sort of dramatic music. And since the times are tough, it makes sense to have that “drama” be something more like a version of Taxi than something like a version of Titanic. We like Taxi better than Titanic anyway. So we hope that some of the songs on this record can be used as theme songs to folk’s own personal versions of Taxi. Because-ideally-the dramatic setting of the music isn’t provided by the story or image of the given act or band. It’s provided by the lives of the people who use-listen to-the music.

And like their fellow Statesmen Guided By Voices (who they’re toured with), they’ve won fans and praise galore for beautifully brash, creative, loud lo-fi indie pop punk.\r\n\r\nDancer Equired is a return to the hive, even if the record’s creation was out of their usual boundaries. It should be known that for the first time the trio escaped to a studio to record anything. Between Columbus Discount Recordings and the famed Mus-i-col (closest thing to Muscle Shoals we got) during the Summer of Violence.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Adam Smith and Dustin White, Times New Viking produced and recorded and album that sounds like a mellow night out. Though it abandons pissy histrionics of the past, it remains loud and brash, with mammoth guitars still piled on. The result is a cleaner production that magnifies the beautiful traits the band has nurtured from the beginning while retaining their endearing authenticity.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\nIt's a Culture\r\nEver Falling In Love\r\nNo Room To Live\r\nTry Harder\r\nCalifornia Roll\r\nWays To Go\r\nNew Vertical Dwellings\r\nDowntown Eastern Bloc\r\nMore Rumours\r\nDon't Go To Liverpool\r\nFuck Her Tears\r\nWant To Exist\r\nSomebody's Slave\r\nNo Good","options":[{"id":11811568,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/34168014/-/Times-New-Viking-small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/34168014/-/Times-New-Viking-small.jpg","width":500,"height":496},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/34168078/-/TNV2_news.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/34168078/-/TNV2_news.jpg","width":700,"height":450}],"artists":[{"id":58438,"name":"Times New Viking","permalink":"times-new-viking","url":"/artist/times-new-viking"}],"categories":[{"id":943851,"name":"New","permalink":"new","url":"/category/new"},{"id":908361,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":943881,"name":"Album","permalink":"album","url":"/category/album"}]},{"id":10660465,"name":"The Fiery Furnaces - The End Is Near (EP Vinyl)","permalink":"the-fiery-furnaces-the-end-is-near-ep-vinyl","position":36,"price":16.0,"default_price":16.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-fiery-furnaces-the-end-is-near-ep-vinyl","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-20T04:19:03.000Z","description":"The Fiery Furnaces - The End Is Near (EP Vinyl)\r\n\r\nThe End Is Near is a limited edition 12” EP coming out one month before The Fiery Furnaces brand new studio album I’m Going Away.\r\n\r\nFans and critics alike have long been waiting for the Friedbergers to make their ‘simple’ record, as it’s always been clear they had a knack for the infectious melodies and great arrangements that classic pop requires. \r\n\r\nThe title track, a catchy, melancholic pop song kicks off the single, instantly giving tantalizing affirmation that the new album I’m Going Away is set to be the most exciting, accomplished and consequently accessible album The Fiery Furnaces have ever made.\r\n\r\nA radio edit of ‘Lost At Sea’ and a slower version of ‘Charmaine Champagne’ (both album tracks in their original forms) underline the masterful melodic work of the album’s new songs to breathtaking effect.\r\n\r\n‘Teddy’s on Kent’ is an otherwise unavailable new recording.","options":[{"id":33416983,"name":"Default","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.6,"amount_with_others":3.3,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":8.8,"amount_with_others":5.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/104800624/-/12.32_Cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/104800624/-/12.32_Cover.jpg","width":984,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/104800708/-/Fiery-Web-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/104800708/-/Fiery-Web-1.jpg","width":500,"height":335}],"artists":[{"id":29601,"name":"The Fiery Furnaces","permalink":"the-fiery-furnaces","url":"/artist/the-fiery-furnaces"}],"categories":[{"id":943891,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":3488830,"name":"SEEKAE - +DOME","permalink":"seekae-+dome","position":37,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/seekae-+dome","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-03-26T13:31:17.000Z","description":"SEEKAE - +DOME\r\n\r\n+Dome is percussive, loud and exciting at times – reserved and laid back at others, but every track oozes a warm feeling that could only be described as Seekae.

Those who clocked the band’s transition from 2006’s debut Kid City to 2008’s startling tropical-punk Skeleton should know the LA quartet aren’t ones for repeating themselves. To Skeleton’s hot-hot-hot template, they now add glassy shards of ‘cold wave’ pop, with synthesisers, sequencers and altogether broodier beats. Scorching temperatures, icy currents... CRUSH is a thermal column of vertiginous brilliance!\r\n\r\nBut let’s not get bogged down in categories. Just as Skeleton was difficult to define, Crush is a similar collision of sound, another helter-skelter joy ride through four boys’ private party. Even so, there was a thought process behind this new surge. In 2009 Dane Chadwick replaced drummer Reggie Guerro, introducing a new style of regimented beats as well as other musical ideas to the table. “More than just rhythmically, Dane helped with melodies and most of the electronics on the album,” says vocalist Michael Vidal.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, guitarist Juan Velasquez had already posted the fact he dug UK dreampop and goth. To which Vidal adds, “My favorite kind of music is instantly nostalgic and emotionally confusing. And reverb has always been a big part of our sound. We were definitely inspired by cold wave and minimal wave stuff, as well as Arthur Russell.” \r\n\r\nFrom the pell-mell pop of \"Sequins\" to the New Romantic crush of \"Throwing Shade\" and the title track’s MBV scree, Crush feels a long way from the Smell Club band scene of AV’s roots. For one, they’ve added so much emotion to their sonics, to which the album title bears testament - crush meaning both the infatuation kind of love and the\r\nact of destroying something.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n1. Sequins\r\n2. Dream Of My Love (Chasing After You)\r\n3. Throwing Shade\r\n4. Beverly Slope\r\n5. Crush\r\n6. November\r\n7. Pure Violence\r\n8. Repeating Angel\r\n9. To Tears\r\n10.

A gleaming new cosmos of hotel accommodation opened up for me and in an instant I was seduced by the free product available in the rooms. I hoarded these objects in a rush of mild kleptomania.  Every room in my house began to amass these plastic bottles and various, hotel-related things from every continent on earth (except Antarctica). Having never kept a journal these items have become like diary entries, triggering memories of all those buildings and random people I've met and inspiring some of the songs on the album.\r\n\r\nAs an act of revenge against the colonisation of our house, I vowed to build a hotel out of the items and sleep in it. The resulting Hotel Shampoo creation serves as a monument to the waste that’s produced in our disposable age and to catalogue my transient existence.”\r\n\r\nFeatures 'Shark Ridden Waters' and the single 'Sensations In The Dark'.\r\n\r\nTracklisting Hotel Shampoo:\r\n\r\n1.\tShark Ridden Waters\r\n2.\tHoney All Over\r\n3.\tSensations In The Dark\r\n4.\tVitamin K\r\n5.\tTake A Sentence\r\n6.\tConservation Conversation\r\n7.\tSophie Softly\r\n8.\tChristopher Columbus\r\n9.\tSpace Dust\r\n10.\tAt The Heart Of Love\r\n11.\tPatterns Of Power\r\n12.\tIf We Were Words (We Would Rhyme)\r\n13.\tRubble Rubble\r\n","options":[{"id":11207913,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/32026239/-/GruffRhys_175px.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/32026239/-/GruffRhys_175px.jpg","width":175,"height":175},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/32026247/-/gruffrhys_web_small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/32026247/-/gruffrhys_web_small.jpg","width":400,"height":287}],"artists":[{"id":52759,"name":"Gruff Rhys","permalink":"gruff-rhys","url":"/artist/gruff-rhys"}],"categories":[{"id":943851,"name":"New","permalink":"new","url":"/category/new"},{"id":908361,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":943881,"name":"Album","permalink":"album","url":"/category/album"}]},{"id":3300817,"name":"Jonny - Jonny","permalink":"jonny-jonny","position":41,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/jonny-jonny","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-02-17T16:08:26.000Z","description":"JONNY - Jonny\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to bring you the self-titled debut album from Norman Blake (Teenage Fanclub) and Euros Childs (Gorky's Zygotic Mynci) together as Jonny!\r\n\r\nInter-twining the musical DNA of two of Britain’s most gifted songwriters, Jonny’s debut album proclaims the advent of an irresistibly infectious new strain of psychedelic pop\r\n\r\nOver the past couple of years Norman and Euros convened when time and schedules allowed to play the odd show and produce an impressive cache of new songs that contain all the warmth, wit and melodic magic that you would expect from such a pairing.\r\n\r\nThe album artwork is also revealed to be the inspiration behind their unusual name.

Formed in Auckland’s Mt Roskill, they’ve been making a racket around the garages and practice rooms since 2004. Locally, it wasn’t long before they were filling the basement bars and urban hang outs with their warm fuzzed up and strummed down frenetic tones. It was a sound pioneered in the early 1980s by New Zealand bands like The Clean and The Bats. But, Surf City were moving the sound forwards into the new millennium.\r\n\r\nThey were giving the sound their own new contemporary twist. It wasn’t long before this sound garnered them some tidy gigs. These included support slots with Interpol, Dinosaur Jnr, Battles and MGMT, the Big Day Out and the Laneway Festival.\r\n\r\nBetween all this touring the band have come up trumps with an amazing debut album.

Freya Berkhout and Alyx Dennison have a distinct songcraft that yields the most magnificent results, a distinct style and sound that intersperses vibrant melodies amid vast soundscapes. It’s pop as much as it is experimental, ornate as it is raw, classical and contemporary in equal parts.\r\n\r\nStarting making music together only a year ago, kyü have managed more than most in 12 months. They’ve shared a stage with some of the world’s more interesting pop experimenters (Patrick Wolf, Why?, Tenniscoats, and Australia’s finest at Homebake 2009), won two prestigious competitions (Sydney Uni band comp and the Hopetoun Incentive) and then, above all this, they’ve recorded an album.\r\n\r\nBut it’s not just an album. Its ten mind-bending tracks that will change the way you listen to pop music.\r\n\r\nBuilding whole other-worlds out of a suitcase of instruments, kyü combine percussion, samples, beats, synths and the most comprehensive musical appetite to create vignettes of a parallel pop universe, intertwined with harmonies to keep both your heart and head whirling with excitement. Encyclopaedic in its musical references and energetic in its delivery, kyü have created a musical masterpiece that goes beyond their year together, and their years as individuals.\r\n","options":[{"id":9430280,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.4,"amount_with_others":3.3,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.6,"amount_with_others":4.4}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25783913/-/kyu-cover-site.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25783913/-/kyu-cover-site.jpg","width":210,"height":210},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26614716/-/kyu-small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26614716/-/kyu-small.jpg","width":709,"height":472}],"artists":[{"id":44862,"name":"Kyü","permalink":"kyu","url":"/artist/kyu"}],"categories":[{"id":943851,"name":"New","permalink":"new","url":"/category/new"},{"id":908361,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":943881,"name":"Album","permalink":"album","url":"/category/album"}]},{"id":2623813,"name":"Best Coast - Crazy For You","permalink":"best-coast-crazy-for-you","position":44,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/best-coast-crazy-for-you","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-06-21T06:12:34.000Z","description":"BEST COAST - CRAZY FOR YOU\r\n\r\n\"Crazy For You\" is a 12-track, twenty-nine minute collection of genuinely romantic sandy jams. Hazy, dreamy and genre-defining, Crazy For You proves that the impressive amount of press hype for Best Coast is more than warranted, especially coming off of her previous sold out singles on Group Tightener, Atelier Cuseaux, Art Fag, Black Iris, PPM and Eskuche.\r\n\r\nThe band’s much-awaited debut album was recorded at Black Iris, a studio in LA’s Echo Park neighborhood, by Lewis Pesacov of the bands Fool’s Gold and Foreign Born. The result is a collection of maudlin and magical songs that approach relationships with a pure heart, a cloudy mind and pair of gas station sunglasses.\r\n\r\nLooking for a way to get a taste of her native land all the way in Brooklyn, Cosentino was drawn to the ‘50’s and ‘60’s aesthetic of The Beach Boys and The Everly Brothers, which, she says, “made me happy.” Creating her own little Southern California in her bedroom wasn’t enough, however, and one weekend Cosentino decided enough was enough. “One weekend I just decided to leave New York. Two days later I was back in LA,” Cosentino says matter-of-factly. She started making music almost immediately, recruiting Bobb Bruno, to help get the vibe just right. “Bobb’s from California, he grew up here, he understands,” Cosentino says, adding that “he really, totally just gets it.” Together Cosentino and Bruno have made Best Coast the band on the tip of everyone's tongue—they have become hometown heroes to their fellow Angelinos and the band to watch according to the music media—and they only continue to garner new accolades and new fans. \r\n\r\nBest Coast sounds the way music sounds when it comes over the beach from the parking lot, where the cutest boy in school is getting out of his car. The perfect combination of that naïve and nervous excitement of a youthful crush and the fuzzy, think reverb of having been around the block at least once before, Best Coast evokes a nostalgia for the California of Gidget and dates at the soda fountain without forgetting that it is that same California that would later spawn Charles Manson. \r\n\r\nTrack Listing:  \r\n1.\tBoyfriend\r\n2.\tCrazy For You\r\n3.\tThe End\r\n4.\tGoodbye\r\n5.\tSummer Mood\r\n6.\tOur Deal\r\n7.\tI Want To\r\n8.\tWhen The Sun Don’t Shine\r\n9.\tBratty B\r\n10.\tHoney\r\n11.\tHappy\r\n12.\tEach And Every Day\r\n13.\tWhen I’m With You (bonus track)","options":[{"id":9284285,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25277466/-/Best-Coast-album-site-pic.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25277466/-/Best-Coast-album-site-pic.jpg","width":210,"height":210},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25277470/-/Best-Coast-In-and-Out.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25277470/-/Best-Coast-In-and-Out.jpg","width":500,"height":334}],"artists":[{"id":44194,"name":"Best Coast","permalink":"best-coast","url":"/artist/best-coast"}],"categories":[{"id":943851,"name":"New","permalink":"new","url":"/category/new"},{"id":908361,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":2796239,"name":"Summer Camp - Young","permalink":"summer-camp-young","position":45,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/summer-camp-young","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-10-12T04:10:37.000Z","description":"SUMMER CAMP - YOUNG\r\n\r\nOne of the most enduring qualities of music lies in its ability to be transportative – the very best songs can take you, almost instantly, to a specific moment in time, or perhaps a particular location, even evoke a specific emotion. It is an immutable relationship we have with the music we listen to, and it is one which the London duo of Elizabeth Sankey and Jeremy Warmsley, aka SUMMER CAMP realise so perfectly, crafting twinkling, pristine pop gems which sound as though they could have been discovered in a trunk in an attic, glinting and glittering like jewels at the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nWe first saw evidence of this on their debut single \"Ghost Train\", which reappears on their new, six track EP (appropriately titled \"Young\") and sounds as yearning, melancholic and beautiful as ever. It also contains the sweetly soaring forthcoming 7\" single \"Round the Moon\", which plays out, essentially, like Summer Camp in miniature, sounding like the best end-of-prom tune never written, complete with whirling, Magnetic Fields-esque keyboards.\r\n\r\nForget any notions of revivalism – Summer Camp have no truck with that. Their commitment to perfect pop craftsmanship is not in service to the history of music; but rather, to the listener, capturing exactly why the potency of a great pop song remains untouched.\r\n\r\n“The Young EP comes crashing on, bristling with gems from a bygone era where the permanence of relationship drama has been sieved out. The duo’s love for the fuzzy world of 1980s John Hughes movies is paraded for all to see.” – BBC Music","options":[{"id":9793796,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27046135/-/Summer-Camp-cover-low-res.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27046135/-/Summer-Camp-cover-low-res.jpg","width":591,"height":591},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27046155/-/82950024.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27046155/-/82950024.JPG","width":1000,"height":694}],"artists":[{"id":46654,"name":"Summer Camp","permalink":"summer-camp","url":"/artist/summer-camp"}],"categories":[{"id":943851,"name":"New","permalink":"new","url":"/category/new"},{"id":908361,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":943871,"name":"EP","permalink":"ep","url":"/category/ep"}]},{"id":2774476,"name":"Casiokids - Topp Stemning Ps Lokal Bar","permalink":"casiokids-topp-stemning-ps-lokal-bar-available-october-22nd","position":46,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/casiokids-topp-stemning-ps-lokal-bar-available-october-22nd","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-09-29T08:48:21.000Z","description":"CASIOKIDS - TOPP STEMNING PS LOKAL BAR (double disc)\r\n\r\nNorway's CASIOKIDS debut Australian album Topp Stemning Ps Lokal Bar is made up of the kind of bubbling, relentlessly upbeat danceable indie pop that might scare off people who hate feeling giddy, but will bring happiness to all those who prefer to dance with big, goofy grins on their faces. Or in animal costumes. \r\n\r\nThe record is made up of songs the band previously released as singles and of remixes with artists like Lo-Fi-Fink and Captain Credible ramping up the songs for maximum dancefloor impact. It also features Casiokids versions of songs by James Yulli and Familjen, the former a sweet ballad, the latter a percolating jam that could fill a dancefloor in seconds. It's an often stunning example of a band that's mastered the ability to craft songs made for dancing but with enough melody and imagination to stand alone as perfectly sculpted pop gems. The songs are built around cheap bubbling synths, propulsive beats, and Ketil Kinden Endresen's gorgeous (sung in Norwegian) falsetto vocals, and draw from classic house, dance-punk, and disco influences, yet remain wonderfully ramshackle and inauthentic. \r\n\r\nCasiokids may grow up and get serious someday, but until then their innocent and happy brand of pop will do just fine for warming hearts and filling dance floors.\r\n\r\nTOURING AUSTRALIA THIS SUMMER!!\r\n\r\nDecember 29 - Melbourne\r\nRevolver with Neon Indian (USA) and Strange Talk\r\n\r\nDecember 31 - Lorne\r\nFalls Festival\r\n\r\nJanuary 1 - Sydney\r\nField Day Festival\r\n\r\nJanuary 3 - Busselton\r\nSouthbound Festival\r\n\r\nTRACKLISTING\r\n\r\nDISC 1\r\n01.

Forged after a hazy winter gathering in Texas, this initial batch of tracks was the result of field recordings, record samples, and a collection of bizarre synth sounds. Soliciting the visual acrobatics of video artist Alicia Scardetta, this project is setting out to be a multimedia maelstrom. Orbiting around the themes of drug-induced heartbreak, weary afternoons, and lost chances, this music provides a lush soundtrack to the deadbeat exploits of teenage ennui.\r\n\r\nNeon Indian's bedroom ballads have already forged Psychic Chasms.

But, in an effort not to overthink their new material (and because drummer Jon Wurster lives a couple hundred miles away from the rest of the band), Superchunk approached Majesty Shredding the same way they approached their early records: McCaughan provided skeletal demos to his bandmates, who in turn fleshed out the songs during a brief period of rehearsal and recording. This sense of purpose is enhanced by the presence of Scott Solter, an engineer and producer (The Mountain Goats, John Vanderslice, St. Vincent) known for coaxing exceptional performances out of the artists he works with.\r\n\r\nMajesty Shredding is a powerful document of Superchunk as a band, augmented as needed with well-placed harmonies, keyboards, and guitar overdubs (and some backing vocals courtesy of the Mountain Goats’ John Darnielle).\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n1.

The British press froths, the underground buzzes, hysteria ensues. This narrative could apply to the Rogers Sisters, but it wouldn't do them justice. Drawing on a range of sounds that includes new wave, no wave, punk, post-punk and garage rock, the Rogers -- real life sisters Jennifer and Laura, plus honorary Rogers, Miyuki Furtado -- forge a completely original sound on their new mini-LP, \"Three Fingers.\" It is a record full of twitchy guitar lines, call-and-response vocals, and swaggering beats, reminiscent of bands like ESG, the Bush Tetras, B-52s, and the Slits. Yet songs like \"Fantasies Are Nice\" and \"Secrets of Civilization\" -- with its string accompaniment -- are as pretty as they are snotty. The seven-track album (produced by Tim Barnes) does one helluva job of proving that the Rogers Sisters indeed aren't just another hot NYC act -- they are quite possibly the best unsigned band you'll hear this year.\r\n\r\n1\tFreight Elevator\t\r\n2\t45 Prayers\t\r\n3\tFantasies Are Nice\t\r\n4\tSecrets of Civilization\t\r\n5\tCheck Level\t\r\n6\tFive Months\t\r\n7\tYou Won't Believe It","options":[{"id":16505189,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49927209/-/imgres-3.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49927209/-/imgres-3.jpeg","width":225,"height":225}],"artists":[{"id":31731,"name":"The Roger Sisters","permalink":"the-roger-sisters","url":"/artist/the-roger-sisters"}],"categories":[{"id":908361,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":943881,"name":"Album","permalink":"album","url":"/category/album"}]},{"id":2623816,"name":"Beach Fossils - Beach Fossils","permalink":"beach-fossils-beach-fossils","position":51,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/beach-fossils-beach-fossils","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-06-21T06:16:10.000Z","description":"BEACH FOSSILS - BEACH FOSSILS\r\n\r\nThe story of Beach Fossils starts with frontman Dustin Payseur writing and recording songs for their debut self-titled LP out of his tiny Brooklyn apartment in the U.S. autumn of 2009. His recent move from North Carolina that year had left him with a sense of longing to reconnect with his past and the lush open landscape he left behind. During that year Dustin experimented with innovative methods of self-recording (using a Tascam four-track and Logic Pro) and composing. He drew his inspiration from improvisational jazz, classical and shoegaze artists, such as Anthony Braxton, pre-Stereolab project McCarthy and Giuseppe Tartini. Playing all his own instruments (keyboard, drums, bass, guitar), he soon emerged with a shimmering array of sun drenched pop songs.\r\n\r\nDustin eventually linked creative forces with John Pena (bass), Sennott Burke (guitar) and Cole Smith (drums) who joined the band and helped collaborate on the songs Wide Awake and Gathering. The full bandʼs immediate chemistry and unforgettable stage presence radiate with a wild, youthful-sincerity.\r\n\r\nBeach Fossils offers warm and inviting melodies that evoke the haunted sounds of another era: straightforward guitar riffs, a kaleidoscope of psychedelic rhythms, and distant, faded vocals all come together to make the perfect soundtrack to an endless summer afternoon.\r\n\r\nIn late 2009 the band were signed to Captured Tracks (home of Dum Dum Girls, Wild Nothing, Thee Oh Sees amongst others). Not long after they joined the Popfrenzy family. Over the last year, Beach Fossils have played CMJ, SXSW, toured the U.S. and are planning a European summer tour. They’re currently on a month long tour with Here We Go Magic and Small Black.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:  \r\n1. Sometimes\r\n2. Youth\r\n3. Vacation\r\n4. Lazy Day\r\n5. Twelve Roses\r\n6. Daydream\r\n7.

An album with the same sense of melody as THE RONETTES (those references in “Is He Really Coming Home?” and “The One Who Left Me”), the ability to acquire the youthful irreverence that the marvelous Grease soundtrack boasted, the imaginative arrangements of greats like Phil Spector or Jack Nitzsche, all updated with an impressive vision.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, is that Liz Hunt and company have made one of those albums where  all of the songs are definite hits, where listening is agile and so ephemeral (and not because it’s short; the disc is close to 40 minutes long), and the euphoria it creates is so great that we are totally incapable of taking the CD out of the stereo, so that we can keep listening to its intoxicating essence. \r\n\r\nWith the cherry on top that Ian Catt (SAINT ETIENNE, TREMBLING BLUE STARS, THE FIELD MICE, SHAMPOO, THE BOO RADLEYS, KAHIMI KARIE) has always given them, they were able to assimilate the whole pop tradition and reproduce it with their own personality, mastery and inspiration.\r\n“Loveless Unbeliever” seems to be the story of a love that fades away: we would almost confirm that conceptually, it moves through unease, melancholy, the disappointment of that impossible love, but at the same time it knows that it will mark us for life; it’s a compilation of those moments that, behind the sadness, hide a tremendous beauty, because those are the moments that give us the true feeling of being alive. And that lust for life, the energy that pushes each and every of those instants is the vitality that THE SCHOOL’s songs openly show us, with their hummable choruses, their doo-doo-wops and their catchy arrangements.\r\n\r\nThis is definitively a disc that confirms them as the latest example to follow in the pop music scene that matters, direct heirs of the girl-groups from the sixties (THE SHIRELLES, THE MARVELETTES, THE SUPREMES...) and the ambassadors of the best melodies and most unforgettable choruses, with that elegance so suited to the best Scottish pop.

He said the music scene was better in NYC and I said the surfing was better down here so Jon moved to Florida and we started The Drums.\"\r\n \r\n\"We just wanted to start a band that sounded like The Wake.\" say The Drums, \"We heard their song 'Pale Spectre' and went crazy! Maybe our music didn't turn out sounding too much like The Wake but we're really just like everybody else, chasing that perfect pop song. And that's not so bad right?\" \r\n\r\nNot so bad indeed! The Drums have a sound that pulls together years of obvious influence by the Factory records sound and a sudden fascination with 50's surf culture. A combination that maybe doesn't seem logical, but when you hear it you'll know you need it, you've gotta have it and it's what has always been missing.

Squeezing into the gap between pop, minimalism and no wave, the sound of Songs is deceptively simple, friendly and willfully careless. They simulate the best of the 'New' music: New York during the 70's and New Zealand in the 80's. \r\n \r\nEchoing the repetition and minimalism of John Cale and La Monte Young, the guitar work shimmers and sprawls into long summer drones.  With the same attention to simplicity that inspired The Clean, the rhythms are stark and mechanical. Lead singer Max Doyle rambles, even chants, over the top, at times invoking a laissez-faire Tom Verlaine offset by the aching, morning after voice of Ela Stiles.\r\n\r\nGalaxie 500, sun drenched pop, and the most nihilist acid folk make a glorious union. But no influence is as strong as The Clean, New Zealand's greatest exponents of the Dunedin sound. Their ghost is felt in Songs’ dead pan humor, simple experimentation, and crystal tone. \r\n \r\nNo one has made “we don’t care” sound so friendly. \r\n\r\nTrack Listing:   \r\n01.  Farmacy \r\n02.

Mel Draisey’s contributions on piano and violin add beautifully to Alasdair MacLean’s timeless, eerie songs.\r\n\r\nInstantly identifiable, The Clientele sound like no one else despite being cited as an influence by bands as diverse as Spoon and Fleet Foxes. It’s been said that the greatest bands always create their own individual sound; The Clientele have gone one further and created their own world.\r\n\r\n“Like Felt before them, The Clientele have completed a commercially neglected yet conceptually immaculate decade, mapping, across four albums and a couple of compilations, a twilit suburb of English pop, as though a young TS Eliot had fronted The Zombies.”– Uncut Magazine\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n01.

Okay, so now that the timeline is out of the way, let's talk about the new album. For starters, Grand was recorded at Matt's parents' house in Vermont that Kim describes as \"being near nothing and surrounded by three cow pastures.\" Or as Matt says, \"I had a friend from New York come up once and he was like 'How did you even find out about college?’” In other words, it's pretty desolate.\r\n\r\nHowever, Matt's childhood bedroom—which was still covered with skateboarding posters and show flyers ultimately turned out to be the ideal environment to record Grand. \"While our album is different from our things in the past, it's what I would have always done if we had the time and means to do it, which we did this time around,\" Matt explains, adding that the band sporadically spent nine months on their new record as opposed to the nine days in which they recorded their debut. After the tracks were laid to tape the band returned to Brooklyn where Matt spent his summer sweating, stressing out and mixing Grand in the duo's apartment.\" \"I would never record our whole album ourselves again,\" he adds, \"but it came out exactly how I wanted it to.\" \r\n\r\nThe result is an album that takes the band's musicianship and songwriting to the next level and also serves as a glowing representation of how far Matt Johnson and Kimberly Schifino have come since their debut. From the anthemic opener \"Daylight\" to the harmony–rich, atmospheric ballad \"Turn This Boat Around\" and demented pop of \"I Wanna,\" Grand is quite literally the sound of the collective discovering their voice. \"All of the songs on the last album we wrote the first year we learned how to play our instruments,\" Matt acknowledges, \"but this one is much more diverse and instead of thinking about the songs we thought of the album as a whole, too.\" \r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n01.

All songs were written together by Eleanor and Matthew Friedberger, except for the title track, which is “trad. Arranged by.” Eleanor wrote most of the lyrics; Matt wrote most of the music and also produced the album. \r\n\r\nAll rock music is a sort of dramatic music. And since the times are tough, it makes sense to have that “drama” be something more like a version of Taxi than something like a version of Titanic. We like Taxi better than Titanic anyway. So we hope that some of the songs on this record can be used as theme songs to folk’s own personal versions of Taxi. Because-ideally-the dramatic setting of the music isn’t provided by the story or image of the given act or band. It’s provided by the lives of the people who use-listen to-the music.

The animals are either picked off or captured as they panic and flee for safety. It's a brutal, terrifying practice, but Of Montreal have adopted the technique -- albeit in a strictly metaphorical sense! -- on their new album, Skeletal Lamping. \r\n\r\nOver the course of the record's fifteen tracks, Kevin Barnes, the band's singer and songwriter, shines a light on the deepest, darkest corners of his psyche. He uncovers his freakiest fantasies, revisits his past, and explores seemingly contradictory aspects of his personality. The music is both startling in its specificity and inviting in its universality.  \r\n \r\nSkeletal Lamping may be bizarre, complicated, and dense, but it's also packed with slinky grooves that demand a physical response. Whereas most contemporary pop music is comprised of instrumental and lyrical phrases that feel so familiar that a listener can practically complete the singer's sentences, the songs on the album are refreshingly non-linear. Instantly ingratiating hooks abound throughout.   \r\n \r\nTrack Listing:  \r\n01. Nonpareil of Favor \r\n02. Wicked Wisdom \r\n03. For Our Elegant Caste \r\n04. Touched Something’s Hollow \r\n05.

However, when it came to making this album, they knew they needed to slow down. A temporary sabbatical from gigs was taken and the band wrote material in New Orleans’ Midtown district, where their rawboned compositions resembled the Katrina-pummeled surroundings. With their girlfriends with them in as close to a stable environment as they’d been in months, they were able to tap a darker, more personal side in songs like “As Noise,” and “Hunt You Down,” with its mournful, organ-drenched air belying Monotonix’s typical “good-time Charlie” posturing, while fulfilling the album’s need for a climactic, balladic moment. Where Were You When It Happened? finds Monotonix visiting a greater diversity of places within their sound while still retaining their minimal appeal.\r\n\r\nWhere most bands refine their production sound as they go forward, Monotonix have reverse-refined themselves, playing dirtier and more energetic to capture the lightning they are known for.

Although they have been labelled by some as \"psych-folk\", we can assure you that Au is not another group of dudes with bandannas sitting around doing acid, but rather immensely skilled musicians who put great detail into every aspect of their sound. \r\n \r\nVerbs (Au’s sophomore record) is flanked at one of its ends by the blissful bombast of a 20-plus person vocal chorus, and concludes some forty minutes later in the hushed strains of a wistful lullaby.

They were newly married and lived in a very small house. The closet was the only place to put the computer that they used for recording. They eventually formed a musical group to play David's songs. Meredith figured out the piano, and their friends Kyle Gladden and Jessie Conklin learned to play the bass and drums, respectively. In the ensuing years, the four have learned to deftly spin those threads which inevitably weave their way through \r\nevery Bodies of Water song: ebullient group singing, melodic invention, thundering polyrhythms, and sublime dramatic tension. \r\n\r\nOne year after self-releasing the acclaimed Ears Will Pop & Eyes Will Blink, Bodies of Water have created another full-length offering. A Certain Feeling, their first record for Popfrenzy (through Secretly Canadian).  \r\nThe strains that one can hear running through all of Bodies of Water's music are fully exhibited here; instantly familiar melodies, rich harmonic color, expansively deft arrangements, and compositions that ebb, flow, and double back on themselves in cathartic synchronicity. Though no two songs sound entirely similar, it's a cohesive collection that comes out feeling like the anthemic prog/gospel/psychedelic/kraut-tribal movie score that Ennio Morricone and Phil Spector never got around to collaborating on. The choral hugeness that typified Ears Will Pop still rears it's emphatic head, only here its more often held in reserve as we marinate in each movement before being pulled along into the next passage of the narrative.   \r\n\r\nTrack Listing:  \r\n01.

In September of 2005, that claim was anything but an exaggeration. With an acute pop sensibility, an arsenal of hooks, and an energy that left ear-to-ear smiles on the faces of audience members, the band’s endearingly spastic live set had more than earned them that title. Blood On The Wall were, however, quick to grow beyond their reputation as a \r\nlocal band. In the months that followed, they would be hand picked to play with the likes of Black Dice, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Ariel Pink, Dead Moon, The Kills, Sonic Youth, and Dinosaur Jr. as they criss-crossed the country and toured Europe under the wing of like-minded label Fat Cat Records. \r\n\r\nWhile you can take the band out of the locale, it’s impossible to pry that spirit from the band; Blood On The Wall charmed audiences far and wide with the same sincerity that had won them a die-hard fanbase in New York. \r\n \r\nLiferz finds the band expanding their sound and honing their aesthetic while staying true to their roots. Approaching the new material in the studio with the same earnest energy that characterizes their live shows, Blood On The Wall have crafted their best record to date. The raw energy is still there – tracks like album opener “Hibernation” and the relentlessly catchy “Rize” nearly bubble over with the band’s patent explosiveness. But Blood On The Wall are no one-trick pony, and Liferz is most definitely a diverse outing. The band balances their frenetic bursts with tempered songs like the slow-churning “Lightning Song”. \r\n\r\nTrack Listing: \r\n1. Hibernation   \r\n2. The Ditch   \r\n3. Liferz   \r\n4.

With sing-along-when-you-think-you're-alone types of refrains, it's as if the oldies station on the car\r\nstereo is playing at the same time as the urban party music station, with the occasional interfering sonic sway of an eighties keyboard refrain. That mash of sounds would come closest to describing Poor Aim's productional pitch, the sound of feeling fun and desperate and bravely romantically unsuccessful all at once; easy listening for difficult feelings.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n1.

As cartographers of the New Weird America before such a term came into marketing play, the Boggs have laid claim to territory well outside the usual indie imaginings and instead created a musical landscape that manages to be both achingly familiar and yet almost lunar in its strangeness—a field recording beamed in from a world in which boundaries and decades are irrelevant.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n1.

The album has been produced by former Altered Images mainstay Stephen Lironi, and features 12 songs that emanate a cinematic and literary glow that illuminates late night tales Glasgow’s West End.

Each succeeding track reinterprets, misreads or conflicts with the accounts that came before to collectively create an anti-portrait of the main character. The music ebbs and flows with the changing characters but never strays from the utterly satisfying sound we have come to expect from Clue To Kalo. \r\n  \r\nHailing from Adelaide, Clue To Kalo mastermind Mark Mitchell applies a lo-fi aesthetic to pristine computer- based production in which the technology is the means rather than the end.

The band convened last spring at Jupiter Studios in their Seattle homebase with producer Martin Feveyear (Screaming Trees, The Minus Five, Rosie Thomas) to record songs.  After recording 21 tracks that were intended to be a double record, the band pared the album down to 12 powerful songs of love, lost and found, illustrated by Bachmann’s heartbreaking yet newly hopeful lyrics. \r\n\r\nThe fourth proper Crooked Fingers full-length release, Dignity and Shame shows the band taking a decidedly new route. Their first three releases were filled with gorgeous portraits of the broken down and abused, the drunken and the melancholy, augmented by string arrangements and orchestral flourishes. In contrast, the beauty of Dignity and Shame lies in its simplicity and accessibility. Bachmann's vocals are at their most confident, while subtle lap steel surfaces from time to time to complement the standard guitar / bass / drums setup. The infusion of Latin influences that began on Red Devil Dawn has been taken to the forefront on Dignity and Shame - the bold Spanish guitar of the opening instrumental \"Islero\" to the hint of mariachi in the trumpet line of \"Twilight Creeps\" depicts a band expanding on their signature sound. \r\n\r\nTrack Listing: \r\n1.

The sound we heard coming through in stereo was that of our coming-of-age years screaming back at us - a faithful reminder that our beauteous days of bowing before pin-up rock stars and carving iconographic logos on desktops and in famous tree trunks have not passed us by. No, David Vandervelde is here to remind us that the truest, most primal and addictive properties of rock n' roll are ageless. Indeed, this Chicagoan (by way of West Michigan) started recording this debut full-length at age 19 yet he shows the maturity and swagger of a man much longer in the tooth. Bearing an immediate resemblance to Marc Bolan and David Bowie, deeper listening rewards the listener with a much broader musical universe. \r\n\r\nThe Moonstation House Band album captures the highlights from his two-year immersion in Jay Bennett's Clubhouse - as Vandervelde refers to the studio in Chicago - where he isolated himself to record this record virtually on his own, using the former Wilco multi-instrumentalist's studio as a big toy instrument, enjoying access to much of the same gear as used on Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and Being There. Self-taught on guitar, drums, bass, piano, synth, and other studio tools, the listener can hear that Vandervelde is an adventurous artist, who embraces classic rock songwriting and whose spirit is just banging at the door to get unleashed.  \r\n\r\nTrack Listing:  \r\n1.

I love you. I love you.” It’s almost impossible to talk about Irene’s debut without using ecstatic clichés.\r\n \r\nApple Bay is an album without a single weak moment. This is twelve timeless pop songs, each one good enough to be a single anytime, any year. It’s an album that would have sounded just as good in 1962 as it will do in 2012. You'll love it! \r\n \r\nFrom Gothenburg, Sweden Irene write songs that sounds almost like clichés of pop songs. Songs about love and heartache, girl group-style rhythm section, handclap, Beach Boys, soul, brass and songs that are evergreens from day one.  \r\n \r\n“Don’t you know, that it’s the crazy little things that always tear us apart? Du-du-du-du-du-du-du-du”. Like Bob Dylan on a Supremes diet Irene’s very own frontman, Tobias Isaksson (aka Bobby) stumbles ecstatically over the words with a euphoria that makes you wonder if the man is overwhelmingly happy or totally miserable.

Rather, the St. Paul, Minnesota singer-songwriter's musical vocabulary and songwriting prowess makes his oft-mentioned high voice seem like a moot point.\r\n \r\nHanson cut his teeth playing in Midwestern emo-rockers M.I.J., but opted to trade the Marshalls for Martins upon going solo. Jeff was signed to Olympia, Washington's influential Kill Rock Stars label based on a demo alone, to give you an idea of what kind of first impression the singer/songwriter leaves.\r\n \r\nHis first solo album, 2003's critically acclaimed Son, followed, to almost unanimously glowing reviews. While fan's of Son won't be disappointed to find any real departures on Jeff Hanson, they will be struck by the vast maturity the young songwriter has undergone since that album. No, he's not singing baritone now. But the new album's songs are more fleshed out than its predecessor, concentrated as ever on the craft of songwriting, sonically bolder, and more meticulously arranged. It also shows Hanson, having already paid his respect to his record collection, continuing to find his own songwriting voice.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing: \r\n\r\n1. Losing A Year \r\n2. Now We Know \r\n3.

A Place Where We Could Go is a statement of fiction and fact, exploring the shadowy depths of an attitude: the romance of life without the people and things that pull down the corners; create your own world. This universe may have a fairy tale look; it may be illuminated by streetlight. But it will definitely be a safe haven for the exploration of dreams. Think vast landscapes of reverberating storybook endings populated by the more charming characters from John Hughes' movies. Jeremy Jay: dancing, singing and playing guitar.

He walks where a winter theme pervades, where the backdrop for the scenes from his new album Slow Dance take place.\r\n\r\nFollowing a series of 7\" singles, Jeremy released his debut LP, A Place Where We Could Go on Popfrenzy in winter 2008. Currently he splits his time between living in Paris and Los Angeles, the dream cities of the French New Wave and Hollywood. Similar to films, Jeremy identifies with the visual stories of life and love, and touches on everything human; he is always in the process of writing and recording, playing the guitar and taking walks to new places. Jeremy draws much of his inspiration from American artists like Andy Warhol and iconic teen filmmaker John Hughes.\r\n\r\nSlow Dance starts with a bang. It navigates listeners through forests and over star streams as easily as walking through the streets, before it shifts to dance floor romance and night-time escapades. There is a consistent, mysterious sway; a strong will backed by noble guitars and shiny synths. Amidst, Jay is protective and candid, inviting listeners to dance with a whisper.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n01. We Were There\r\n02. In This Lonely Town\r\n03. Gallop\r\n04. Canter Canter\r\n05.

Remember That I Love You is the latest chapter in the Kimya Dawson picture book, with the picture its drawing being one of love, humour and sorrow. It represents not only Kimya’s continued personal adaptation to the tumultuous world around her, but also the growing relationship between the fans and friends she needs just as much as they need her. \r\n\r\nRemember That I Love You has the kind of intimacy that pop producers dream of, the kind of intimacy that’s impossible to imitate. Kimya continues to expose the subtle and sometimes serious pains we all face, in order to temper them with understanding and laughter.

It is an epic record that showcases the ambition of this young group, taking in elements of various genres and making them their own. At a time when the musical landscape seems inundated with derivative retrogressive guitar bands, or acts reliant on sequenced beats, Sian Alice Group’s more classical inclinations show their willingness to tread their own path.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n1.

Successful with one of the last Music for the Future grants from Arts Victoria, a full-length LP was recorded with Chris Scallan and Jed Palmer at Sing Sing and Soft Centre studios in Melbourne in the latter part of 2005.

Of Montreal is one of the stalwarts of the Athens, Georgia pop scene. Of Montreal is the recording and performing project of one Kevin Barnes. And Of Montreal is one of the many bands still in operation with a tie to the loose Elephant Six collective of the late '90s, a group of like-minded bands centered around that incredibly fertile Southern college town (others included Neutral Milk Hotel, Apples In Stereo and Olivia Tremor Cotrol). Of Montreal is not, however, predictable. And therein lies the appeal of a band that, over its past two albums, has exploded from cult appeal to \r\ninternational popularity.  \r\n \r\nHissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer? is their latest offering and first to be released locally. It's an irresistible and remarkable album, sounding like a logical extension of the erratic indie- disco sounds of their previous long-player, Sunlandic Twins . Recorded as a one-man operation in a tiny Norwegian bedroom and an attic in Athens GA, the album swings from swaggering guitar to moody synths, from exultant sing-along to curious combinations of sounds. Lyrically, you've got boisterous pomp, maddening depression and decadent indulgence. Hissing Fauna is strange, unexpected, entrancing and rewarding. And if not for the tumultuous year that nearly tore Kevin Barnes apart, it never would have existed. \r\n\r\nTrack Listing:  \r\n1. Suffer For Fashion \r\n2. Sink The Seine \r\n3.

Churning out shattered pop hits that few have the ears to comprehend, Portland’s Panther is a one-man disaster squad. Panther’s music is hard match of damaged soul, falsetto disco and broken synth fueled freakouts which is as addictive as it is challenging. This solo affair of Charlie Salas-Humara isn’t easily ignored for his unpredictable and energetic solo performances tainted with throbbing bass, minimalistic hooks and jittery dance routines. Panther’s influences run deep and take as much from Pop and R&B as Free Jazz and Punk.\r\n\r\nSecret Lawns is the eagerly anticipated full-length follow up from last year’s Yourself 12”. Listening to Secret Lawns you’ll discover Charlie knows no boundaries, not only in terms of genre but also social and societal. Panther recorded and played all of the instruments himself, excluding the guest accompaniments from members of Yacht, White Rainbow, Plants, Point Line Plane, and E*Rock on a few of the tracks.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n1.

Andrew Churchman and Sterling Bryant formed the band three years ago within the walls of a Boston art school, and have since released albums and singles aimed at the hearts of an international group of journal writers, unrequited lovers, liberal arts majors, and romantic adolescent daydreamers. Now with new drummer Casey Keenan from Major Stars (Drag City), Pants Yell! have shifted into a more confident, expansive form of chiming pop music. \r\n\r\nThe album title Alison Statton pays homage to the lovely young Welsh girl who fronted Young Marble Giants and Weekend. The songs deal with failed relationships and the uncertainty of youth via a batch of intelligently informed compositions; one that should appease fans of Jens Lekman, Orange Juice and the early Belle and Sebastian records. \r\n\r\nThe album was labored over for nine months throughout 2007 and recorded onto 2” tape in Analog Divide, the same studio responsible for their previous albums Songs for Siblings (2003) and Recent Drama (2006). On Alison Statton, female vocals float through the back drops as trumpets and saxophones spurt lost Stax lines, a glockenspiel chimes, guitars feedback, drums flail and a young man sings sweetly about all the things young men should sing sweetly about. \r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\t\r\n1.More Purple\r\n2.Reject, Reject\r\n3.Tried to Be Good\r\n4.Evan's Way\r\n5.A New City Life\r\n6.Magenta and Green\r\n7.Shoreham Kent\r\n8.Alison Statton\r\n9.The Royal We\r\n10.For Dee\r\n11.Two French Sisters\r\n12.When Your Friends Aren’t Looking (Aust & NZ bonus track)\r\n","options":[{"id":6547931,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/17579421/-/PantsYellCoverWebreize.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/17579421/-/PantsYellCoverWebreize.jpg","width":400,"height":400}],"artists":[{"id":31281,"name":"Pants Yell!","permalink":"pants-yell","url":"/artist/pants-yell"}],"categories":[{"id":908361,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":943881,"name":"Album","permalink":"album","url":"/category/album"}]},{"id":1674071,"name":"Pink Mountaintops - Outside Love","permalink":"pink-mountaintops-outside-love","position":105,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pink-mountaintops-outside-love","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-02-21T03:56:48.000Z","description":"PINK MOUNTAINTOPS - OUTSIDE LOVE\r\n\r\n\"Outside Love\" is ten songs of love and hate that read like a Danielle Steele romance novel but that would probably make for bad television.\r\n\r\nOutside Love is the third album by Pink Mountaintops, AKA Stephen McBean, who has slowly emerged as a distinctive voice and a very special contributor to the North American songbook.

As with a lot of what's been coming out of their city lately, that shit was weirdly compelling.\r\n\r\n\"Celebrate the Body Electric (It Came from an Angel)\" - the lead single from Ponytail's follow-up (and first release available outside of USA), Ice Cream Spiritual - stretches out the funfueled chaos to an epic seven minutes of crests, eddies, tsunamis, and hey wowie wow, even a few seconds of limpid tranquility. Giving a Deerhoof-like scissor kick to traditional song structure, the track jerks from No Age's loose, trilling ambience to wiry, explosive bursts, with spaghetti Western backing vocals and Sigel chirping something like, \"Awaywegonowawaywego!\" There's calm eventually, too, as Sigel's rooster crow turns into a canary coo, but before long everything goes berserk again.

An African influence also exerts a strong presence in the album.

Heavy hitters. Listen to the intricate intertwining strings of Sam Prekop and Archer Prewitt and you’ll hear the frontline of a working unit that has moved seamlessly from the stage to the studio and back. Historically, The Sea and Cake stayed the course since forming in Chicago in 1993, but over the last couple of years they have pulled in even tighter, recording hot and fast on the heels of a busy performance schedule without breaking for other projects. The sense of trust that is key to a working band – particularly in the rhythm section, where drummer John McEntire and bassist Eric Claridge create their intimate alchemy – is cultivated over the long haul, by means of an epoxy bond and preternatural antennae. Stop working together, and those connections go dormant, hibernate; keep on trucking, and they deepen and get sharper, allowing the band to reach for new things, experiment freely, evolve and develop and grow. The ground doesn’t have to be prepared; the canvas is already primed, ready for the first brushstroke. \r\n\r\nWhere in the past, they have disbursed between records to allow each member their individual pursuits – Prekop and Prewitt’s artwork and solo projects, McEntire’s production at his SOMA Studio and work with Tortoise, Claridge’s alternate identity as a painter – in this case they didn’t disband, but dove straight into Car Alarm. The quickness reflects a personal urgency, too, given the imminent delivery of Prekop’s first born. Thoughts of fatherhood may lend a kind of optimistic air to the record. It has the breezy, open, crisp sound that The Sea and Cake have spent 15 years crafting, but Car Alarm also has a palpable edge. That’s the edge of people who know each other well enough to push a bit harder, who aren’t worried about ruffling each other’s feathers or trying something different, difficult, intuitive, trusting. Something bracing. Here ‘tis.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n01. Ariel\r\n02. Fuller Moon\r\n03. On A Letter\r\n04. CMS Sequence\r\n05. Car Alarm\r\n06. Weekend\r\n07. New Schools\r\n08.

With just over 10 minutes worth of music, is this charmingly amateurish or restraint considered to it s fullest? \r\n\r\nEither way these are pop songs unashamedly stripped back, revealing the bands mutual appreciation for the subtle songwriting obscurities that bind together the early Flying Nun catalogue.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n\r\n01.\r\n02.\r\n03.\r\n04.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":6254531,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/16373311/-/songs_EP_cover_siteresized..jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/16373311/-/songs_EP_cover_siteresized..jpg","width":360,"height":360},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/16373391/-/Songs-site-pic-horizontal-09resize.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/16373391/-/Songs-site-pic-horizontal-09resize.jpg","width":360,"height":241}],"artists":[{"id":29551,"name":"Songs","permalink":"songs","url":"/artist/songs"}],"categories":[{"id":943851,"name":"New","permalink":"new","url":"/category/new"},{"id":908361,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":943871,"name":"EP","permalink":"ep","url":"/category/ep"}]},{"id":1810681,"name":"Supersystem - A Million Microphones/Always Never Again 2 for 1 deal","permalink":"supersystem-a-million-microphones","position":112,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/supersystem-a-million-microphones","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-03-03T06:09:43.000Z","description":"A Million Microphones\r\n\r\nRefusing to be satisfied by the familiar, Supersystem has always been ready to destroy a song in order to put it back together again. Hip-hop, electronica, punk rock, so-called world music a little bit of everything has gone into the architecture. This destruct/construct reflex is groomed and refined on the NY/DC quartets latest long player, A Million Microphones. The record's eleven startlingly original tracks are saturated with African-tinged guitar, complex polyrhythms, atmospheric synthesizers, jaunty, funk-fried bass, and infectious beats.\r\n\r\nTo complement Supersystem's tight-knit arrangements, vocalists Pete Cafarella, Rafael Cohen, and Justin Destroyer have transformed an effusive stew of off-kilter lyrical observations into the most potent melodies the band has yet to pen. “I think we’re spending a lot more time on vocals and melodies on A Million Microphones, says Justin, who also plays bass. I’d like to think we’ve improved as singers. We work harder to pull a melody out of a song instead of tracing Johnny Lydon's footsteps for the umpteenth time.” \r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n1.

Tired of the heavy avant-garde music that was prolific at the time Stoddard and Kennedy teamed up with Josh’s brother Jamie and Logan Collins to form the band. Originally called The Fibs and then Kill Surf City their fascination with fast guitar pop and the early 80’s sound of  Dunedin soon saw them develop their own unique and catchy sound. \r\n\r\nFollowing several tours of New Zealand, a couple of trips to Australia, numerous day jobs and flat evections Surf City are to release their debut self titled EP on Popfrenzy in  Australia. Following the NZ release in 2007, Surf City were nominated for ‘rock song of the year’ at the b-net NZ music awards. They also won a local Burger Fuel NZ music competition essentially labeling them the most exciting band in the land.

From there, the album moves on to his ode to Winona Ryder: “I was 7 years old you were 19 when I first saw you it was on the T.V.,” he sings over layers of keyboards and chugging guitar before declaring, “I’m not a high class retail outlet but I would love for you to steal my heart.” On the live favorite, “Cheerleaders vs. Drillteam,” Totally Michael splits his audience in two, dividing them in teams as he instructs, “Ok, split it down the middle, cheerleaders on the left, drillteam on the right, prepare for battle, show me what you got, we’ll settle this tonight,” – and just like that, it’s on. Totally Michael slows down the pace with “Orchestral Interlude,” an aptly titled song, sounding like the soundtrack to a wedding on Fantasy Island.\r\n\r\nDescribing his sound as a “mohawked angel with a hose full of holy water… blasting the wallflowers,” URB Magazine singled out Totally Michael for their annual “Next 100 Issue.” Citing Prince and Blink-182 as influences and bringing about comparisons to Andrew W.K., Dan Deacon and synth-punk pioneer Atom and His Package, Totally Michael revels in the forgotten joys of showmanship and booty shaking. \r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n01.

On lead single \"Ancestors,\" Reitherman spins a somber story into a pop song tour de force amidst gazing guitars, athletic fuzz-bass and a crystalline wall of synthesizers.\r\n\r\nPerhaps more sonically upbeat than its predecessor, Creaturesque's details are at times painted in both optimistic and sobering tones. Reitherman's scattershot poetics touch on an array of ideas; it's oppressive American machisimo and Suburbanite sexuality. It's soft drugs and convertible cars. It's the struggle for higher expectations within the mess of modern life, and when wrapped up in the structures of TMTS' sure-handed tunes it's an all too delicious combination.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n01.

The album depicts a band at its peak: no longer stressing about what people might expect, but rather wearing their influences better than one of Interpol's tailored suits. \"We live off of pop music,\" says singer/guitarist Ryan Allen. \"Some Beatles for breakfast, a little Smiths for lunch, and the Pixies for dinner. Further, \"making an album full of melodies, actual choruses, songs in major keys... it's something I think we all grew up with, so it was inevitable that we'd make a record like this. It's our chance to do right by our influences and by ourselves.\" \r\n\r\nTo document Make History the band convened in New York and Philadelphia with longtime friend John Schmersal, famous for his signature guitar skronk as a member of Brainiac and for his skewed-pop sensibilities with his current band Enon. Schmersal's ear for melody as well as unconventional sounds and structures helped TAN! find a perfect marriage between the straight-ahead and the peculiar. It's a coupling that can be heard all over Make History. Take the opener, \"Panthers in Crime,\" which starts off with an acoustic introduction and crashes to an end with keyboardist Scott Allen manning a Hammond organ and drummer Matt Rickle bashing his kit. Or examine \"The Veil Comes Down,\" a four-on-the-floor rocker that features bassist Howard Chang's steady rhythms and some of the most eccentric keyboard noises the band has ever cooked up. The twelve-song album (including the Australia exclusive “Dangerish”) culminates with live staple \"(The Making of...) Make History\" and its chorus of pop-centric \"ba ba da ba's\" singing the album to its triumphant close. It's all done with the utmost intent of separating themselves from the dance-rock and the post-post-punk pigeonholing that has plagued some of their contemporaries, making their own history along the way.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n01.Panthers In Crime\r\n02.The Veil Comes Down\r\n03.We Win (Ha Ha)\r\n04.Open Us Up\r\n05.Why We War\r\n06.Sound Issues/Smart Ideas\r\n07.Sleeping in The Lion’s Mouth\r\n08.Shit Gold\r\n09.Shake Them Awake\r\n10.PPLR ANMLS\r\n11.(The Making of…) Make History\r\n12.Dangerish (Australian bonus track)\r\n\r\nJustamustache is ripe with vocal harmonies and shout-a-long choruses, dual guitar parts, effects-laden bass and vibrant keyboard melodies. Songs like \"Eat this City\" and \"Harpoons of Love\" are steadfast and as close to perfect ‘pure pop’ as anything going around, while \"This World is Made of Paper\" and \"Cobra Feet\" show the band at their most powerful, precise and danceable. At ten tracks in all, Justamustache is a snapshot of a band finally comfortable in their own skin.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n1. Better Safe Than Safari\r\n2.

Live as on record, Charles and Rebecca enrapture audiences with the same involuntary joy and simplistic rush that they themselves imbue. Their highly developed partnership delivering sweet harmonious hooks, rockabilly beats and exuberant yelps and yips, that spill out across the album.\r\n\r\nAs with Slow Clubs early singles, Yeah, So. was recorded almost entirely within the bosom of their hometown Sheffield, with Richard Hawley’s long term live and studio engineer Mike Timm at controls. His involvement according to Charles, was vital “Being a duo its often difficult to ‘let go’ on certain decisions… Mike has been really important providing a ‘buffer state’ between us.”\r\n\r\nThese two are more than charming anti-folk troubadours or the lo fi acoustic end of the Sheffield scene; they are the real thing.  That spontaneous intangible ‘thing’ that comes jumping off records and crackling off the stage, hanging crystalline for fleeting moments to confound and intrigue.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:  \r\n01.

Sounds are used to rhythmically push some songs forward in a top-40 way, but with fewer straight beats. Noise restrictions also led to more use of single, quiet acoustic instruments.

Keyboards are used not as a novelty, but as a necessity, functioning as an instrument that provides everything from atmosphere to a song's main melody. Guitars are wiry and manic -- but still direct -- and not afraid of the occasional delayed part or barre chord. The bass rides an undercurrent, but also jumps out of the foray, delivering alternate melodies and power. Drums are never overcomplicated or flashy, but are instead used to generate a rhythmic pulse that carries throughout the song. Vocals dart in and out of the mix, sung with a sassy intensity.

The arrangements are multifaceted and rich in detail.\r\n\r\n1\tThat's Because You Drive Me\r\n2\tDo What You Wanna Do\t\r\n3\tThis Heart Is A Stone\t\r\n4\tLondon School of Economics\r\n5\t7 Days\t\r\n6\tI Write Summer Songs For No Reason\t\r\n7\tTonight Is Forever\t\r\n8\tSaturday Train\t\r\n9\tSleeping\t\r\n10\tWill You Love Me In The Morning?\t\r\n11\tA Long Term Plan\t\r\n12\tWipe Away Those Tears\r\n","options":[{"id":16507679,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49935793/-/imgres-12.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49935793/-/imgres-12.jpeg","width":225,"height":225}],"artists":[{"id":30181,"name":"Acid House Kings","permalink":"acid-house-kings","url":"/artist/acid-house-kings"}],"categories":[{"id":908361,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":943881,"name":"Album","permalink":"album","url":"/category/album"}]},{"id":5085879,"name":"XIU XIU - LA FORET","permalink":"xiu-xiu-la-foret","position":152,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/xiu-xiu-la-foret","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-12-15T04:47:35.000Z","description":"XIU XIU - LA FORET (PF019)\r\n\r\nTo hear Xiu Xiu is to be shaken, disturbed, and shown something original.

On 2012, recorded with Calvin Johnson at Dub Narcotic studio, bandmates Arrington de Dionyso, Aaron Hartman and Jamie Peterson continue the exploration of the subconscious iconography begun with Lost Light. The cacophony of 2012 extends down dimly lit paths and discovers jocular illumination in the darkest places of our psyche, and ultimately, a hand held catharsis. Some of the credit for the comfortable thunder/agony/delight of 2012 revolves on the recently joined percussionist Jamie Peterson, formerly of the Curtains, St.Andre, and Dada Swing. She has settled nicely into the throne formerly occupied by Bryce Panic, Phil Elverum and Rives Elliot (among others). Jamie blends splendidly with the double bass playing of Aaron Hartman to provide a seamless pedestal for the howl and guitar scratch bloom of Arrington de Dionyso. There is no remorse: 2012 is Old Time Relijun`s seventh collection of song making since 1996.

Produced this time by Paul Barker (Ministry, Revolting Cocks), the record is more sadness than joy with lonely lyrics and hauntingly echoed guitar persuaded by chorused basslines. The sound is coaxing and familiar, then howling and anguished. Reminiscent of latter-era Talk Talk; with the introspection also comes passion. \"Fear Is On Our Side\" isn't trivial or banal, trendy or futile.
