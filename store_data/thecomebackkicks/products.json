Isaac Arzate was a talented young athlete who pitched a no-hitter in baseball and savored an undefeated season in basketball. In January 2012 Isaac suffered a cardiac arrest at basketball practice and was sent from Salem to OHSU Doernbecher Children’s Hospital, where doctors discovered a previously undetected abnormality that is one of the most common causes for heart attacks in young people.   After recovering from open-heart surgery, Isaac was invited by OHSU Doernbecher to be part of the 2012 Freestyle program. During his rehabilitation from surgery, he began sketching designs for an Air Jordan 5 Retro, highlighting his interests and experiences. He also became well enough to don his jersey and watch his basketball team from the bleachers, occasionally getting to shoot around during breaks in the game. Then in April 2012, 12-year-old Isaac tragically suffered a second heart attack, and did not survive.   Deeply saddened by his tragic passing but inspired by his passion and spirit, Nike and OHSU Doernbecher invited Isaac’s family to work together to finish the design that Isaac had started. Using Isaac’s original sketches as a guide and some more his parents found, they created a design reflecting Isaac’s vision and incorporating design elements that represented the things that mattered most to him in his life:   Isaac’s jersey numbers, 9 for baseball on the upper of the left shoe and 31 for basketball on the right.","options":[{"id":49922367,"name":"Default","price":1200.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128553435/-/Air_Jordan_V_DBs-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128553435/-/Air_Jordan_V_DBs-1.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128553441/-/Air_Jordan_V_DBs-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128553441/-/Air_Jordan_V_DBs-2.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128553447/-/Air_Jordan_V_DBs-4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128553447/-/Air_Jordan_V_DBs-4.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128553444/-/Air_Jordan_V_DBs-3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128553444/-/Air_Jordan_V_DBs-3.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128553456/-/Air_Jordan_V_DBs-5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128553456/-/Air_Jordan_V_DBs-5.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5754390,"name":"KICKS","permalink":"kicks","url":"/category/kicks"},{"id":5746998,"name":"KICKS - Air Jordan","permalink":"kicks-air-jordan","url":"/category/kicks-air-jordan"}]},{"id":15227829,"name":"Nike Air Foamposite One Premium \"Doernbecher\"","permalink":"nike-air-foamposite-one-premium-doernbecher","position":2,"price":900.0,"default_price":900.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nike-air-foamposite-one-premium-doernbecher","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-30T20:12:03.000Z","description":"Release Date: November 23, 2013\r\nChallenge Red / Black\r\n641745-600\r\n\r\nElijah likes to play baseball and says he’s a pretty good pitcher. His baseball team actually won the state championship and his dad is quick to point out all the boards that have been knocked out of their garden shed by his son’s killer throw.

Months prior to the release, the Retro 4 “Toro Bravo” quickly received a big following.
