The fragrance is part foodie, part comforting, part sensual. Easily one of my favorites and will leave you wanting more.\r\n\r\n So whats so special about goats milk soap?  Well goats milk has many benefits.  First goats milk has many vitamins and other essential elements to help nourish skin. These include vitamins A, E, C, some of the B vitamins, amino and citric acids, unsaturated fatty acids and zinc.  \r\n\r\nGoats milk is also said to have an effect on troubled skin as soap made from goats milk has the proteins of milk products and these proteins kill acne producing bacteria.  Goats milk soap is also moisturizing as the natural creams in goat's milk soap help keep moisture in skin better than commercial soaps. This is because the commercial brands are mainly chemicals.\r\n\r\nGoat's milk soap contains caprylic acid which makes the product a low pH level because it is an alkaline product. This brings the pH closer to human skin and prevents dryness while allowing nutrients to enter the skin.\r\n\r\nGoat's milk soap benefits include the lack of alcohol, petroleum or preservatives. This has been thought to reduce skin irritation and itchiness for people with sensitive skin or eczema.\r\n\r\nWe make no medical claims. Our description should not be mistaken as such.  If you have any questions--please consult your physician. \r\n\r\nEach bar is handmade in small batches with loads of skin nourishing ingredients.
