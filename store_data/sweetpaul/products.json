Chocked full of food and crafts... and of course beautiful photographs! \r\n\r\nFeatures include: Chocolate!, DIY Halloween Masks, Fall Food, Mushroom Crafts, Apple Recipes and much more!\r\n\r\nWe're happy to offer our new lower retail price of $20.\r\n\r\nSweet Paul is a small and growing publication.  We produce a very high quality magazine with a small staff in small quantities and unfortunately printing and shipping costs are high. (The USPS recently raised shipping prices particularly for international mail 41% which makes it a very premium price)  We produce the magazine because there is a great demand for the print version.  If the pricing doesn't work for you we would love for you to read our online version!
