She stands 13 inches long from the tip of her nose to the tip of her tail, and 12 inches tall at the highest point of her hat. Her hair mane and tail are made from soft light yellow minky fabric and have red satin bows for tie accents. Her santa hat is made from soft red minky fabric with a white pom pom hand sewn onto the end and white faux fur trim, Hat is hand sewn into place. She has a removable red minky fabric scarf with white pom poms hand sewn onto the ends. \r\nShe is tightly stuffed with hypo-allergenic polyester fiber fill and stands free on her own without any wires or cages. The bottom of her feet have been filled with polyester plastic pellets for extra added weight and to help her stand. \r\nHer eyes, freckles and cutie marks have been beautifully machine embroidered to last a lifetime, her eyes and cutie marks will NEVER fall off or flake over time. She has cutie marks embroidered on both of her thighs. Her embroidered parts have been coated with a special clear glue in order to prevent any snagging of the threads.\r\nShe is mostly machine sewn, but her mane, tail, head, and hat have been sewn by hand, due to hand sewn elements she is not recommended for small children or rough play, but gentle cuddling is fine ^_^ \r\nSpot clean only. Do NOT machine wash, do NOT put in dryer. \r\nHandmade in Seattle Washington in a smoke free environment from all new materials.\r\nHoliday tree not included.","options":[{"id":50901225,"name":"Default","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United

Your pony will be finished within 2-6 weeks of payment being received.\r\nAll custom ponies are made from soft and luxurious minky fabric.\r\nChoose from a female or male head. Earth pony, unicorn, Pegasus, or alicorn body type.\r\nYour pony will have its own one of a kind machine embroidered cutie mark chosen by you. Cutie marks will be embroidered onto both sides of pony. It can be an image, word, or phrase. I have some designs to chose from or I can digitize any jpeg images into embroidered images on fabric.\r\nYour pony will have machine embroidered eyes. \r\nChoose from many eyes in stock or send me a jpeg image of an eye you desire, and I will embroider your design onto the pony for you.

is a hand made, fan made plush of the My Little Pony Pegasus Fluttershy, I am not associated with Hasbro in any way.\r\nShe has NOT been made yet, once your order is placed you will receive her in 4-6 weeks of payment. She will look identical to the pictures posted. Since each plushie is hand made, there will be slight variations between each plushie. \r\nFluttershy is made from high quality incredibly soft and luxurious yellow minky fabric. She stands 14 inches long from the tip of her nose to the tip of her tail, and 11 inches tall at the highest point of her head. Her hair mane and tail are made from soft light pink minky fabric. Details on her mane and tail have been machine stitched. \r\nShe is tightly stuffed with hypo-allergenic polyester fiber fill and stands free on her own without any wires or cages. The bottom of her feet have been filled with polyester plastic pellets for extra added weight and to help her stand. \r\nFluttershy's eyes and cutie marks have been beautifully machine embroidered to last a lifetime, her eyes and cutie marks will NEVER fall off or flake over time. She has cutie marks embroidered on both of her thighs. \r\nFluttershy is mostly machine sewn, but her mane, wings, and part of her head have been sewn by hand, due to hand sewn elements she is not recommended for small children or rough play, but gentle cuddling is fine ^_^ \r\nSpot clean only. Do NOT machine wash, do NOT put in dryer. \r\nHandmade in Seattle Washington in a smoke free environment from all new materials. Listing is for ONE plushie only.","options":[{"id":26472759,"name":"Default","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110961105/-/Flutter1.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110961105/-/Flutter1.JPG","width":1000,"height":718},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110961093/-/Flutter7.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110961093/-/Flutter7.jpg","width":813,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110961117/-/Flutter4.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110961117/-/Flutter4.JPG","width":589,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110961138/-/Flutter5.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110961138/-/Flutter5.JPG","width":1000,"height":696},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110961162/-/Flutter6.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110961162/-/Flutter6.JPG","width":1000,"height":562}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3671595,"name":"Plushies","permalink":"plushies","url":"/category/plushies"}]},{"id":7535639,"name":"Panda Spirit Hood-MADE TO ORDER","permalink":"panda-spirit-hood","position":51,"price":43.0,"default_price":43.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/panda-spirit-hood","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-13T07:28:44.000Z","description":"MADE TO ORDER.

I purchased the sewing pattern on Etsy.com shop site 'dolphinwing'. \r\nShe is made from super soft luxurious minky fabric. She has been tightly stuffed with non hyper-allergenic polyester fiber fill. She stands 13 inches tall including ears and 7.5 inches long from nose to tail. The bottom of her feet are filled with plastic pellets to help her stand. Her eyes have been completely machine embroidered from my own digitized pattern. Eyes will NEVER fall off or flake over time. Her mouth has been hand pulled. Inner ear details and bow details have been satin stitched into place. She is mostly machine sewn but her head, tail, ears, bows, and scarves have been sewn on by hand. Since she has many hand sewn elements, she is not recommended for small children or rough play.\r\nHandmade in Seattle Washington in a smoke free environment.","options":[{"id":41233056,"name":"Default","price":125.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122689986/-/Sylveon1.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122689986/-/Sylveon1.JPG","width":1000,"height":885},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122689992/-/Sylveon2.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122689992/-/Sylveon2.JPG","width":2620,"height":2176},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122689995/-/Sylveon3.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122689995/-/Sylveon3.JPG","width":1000,"height":941},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122689998/-/Sylveon4.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122689998/-/Sylveon4.JPG","width":1000,"height":826},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122690001/-/Sylveon5.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122690001/-/Sylveon5.JPG","width":1000,"height":892}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3671595,"name":"Plushies","permalink":"plushies","url":"/category/plushies"}]}]
