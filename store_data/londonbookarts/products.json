In addition to his own practice, he has been senior designer at the Walker Art Center since 2009. As with his work at the Walker and his work with collaborators—from furniture and landscape designers ROLU, to his sister Debbie, a Michigan-based artist/photographer—Carlos uses graphics, a wink and a nudge, and an economy of means to create visual entry points into different types of knowledge: from maths to dance, language to science and music, or as he puts it, \"from Peach Snapple to downtown beef, and everything in-between.\"\r\n\r\nCarlos uses the form and function of a calendar and creates a casual polemic and a reorganization of days. A calendar consisting only of Saturdays and Sundays, Art & Leisure... is a book that becomes an exhibition, a proposition, a utopia, and a joke. In a social climate where the simple act of taking time 'off the clock' and doing something without intrinsic market—but human—value becomes something unintentionally quixotic, Art & Leisure... re-imagines our relationship to time, labour and art practices. \r\n\r\nYou can find more images of the book at londonbookarts.tumblr.com","options":[{"id":35937324,"name":"Default","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127679838/-/P1013149.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127679838/-/P1013149.jpg","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114133002/-/P1013161.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114133002/-/P1013161.jpg","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114133122/-/P1013155.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114133122/-/P1013155.jpg","width":640,"height":480}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5400540,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":7565277,"name":"Friend of LCBA Membership","permalink":"friend-of-lcba-membership","position":8,"price":40.0,"default_price":40.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/friend-of-lcba-membership","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-16T14:22:44.000Z","description":"Support our mission and become a Friend of LCBA!\r\n\r\nThe London Centre for Book Arts is an open-access studio providing education programmes for the community and access to resources for artists, designers and makers.\r\n\r\nStarting at just £40 per year, Friends of LCBA support community \r\nprogrammes and development at LCBA.\r\n\r\nPlease choose from:\r\n\r\nFriend of LCBA\r\n£40 per year\r\n\r\nFriend of LCBA w/ Book binding tool kit\r\n£80 per year\r\n\r\nFriend of LCBA w/ Limited edition print by LCBA and friends\r\n£120 per year\r\n\r\nFriends of LCBA receive discounted rates on all workshops and talks at LCBA - along with a big thank you from all of us at LCBA!
