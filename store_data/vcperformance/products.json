These headers have even ran these at the 2010 La Carrera Pan Americana - a brutal seven day race on some of the most difficult roads in Mexico. The header performed flawlessly. \r\n\r\nSimply put, these are one of the best performance improving header systems you can buy. We have developed two types, one for two liter motors and one for 1600 and 1750 motors.\r\n\r\nWe didn't develop a generic \"one size fits all\" system because we wanted to focus on the needs for most performance improved engines. The primaries on the smaller displacement headers were modified to help improve torque where needed. Where as the two liter header would not help as much.... That's doing it right!  \r\n\r\nFor a little more we have the headers ceramic coated inside and out. This not only improves the performance, but drops the radiant temperature by nearly 200 degrees! \r\n\r\nThese headers will fit GTV's, Giulia spiders, and Giulia Supers.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Improved performance</li>\r\n<li>Single piece mounting flange</li>\r\n<li>Easy access to the exhaust studs</li>\r\n<li>Easy removal and installation</li>\r\n<li>O2 sensor bung on all units</li>\r\n</ul>","options":[{"id":13371883,"name":"1600/1750 Header","price":775.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48519597,"name":"2 Liter Header","price":775.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48519600,"name":"155/75 TS Header","price":775.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":50.0,"amount_with_others":50.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":80.0,"amount_with_others":80.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41373173/-/DarstanHeader1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41373173/-/DarstanHeader1.jpg","width":638,"height":477},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/39352321/-/DarstanHeader2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/39352321/-/DarstanHeader2.jpg","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/39352337/-/DarstanHeader3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/39352337/-/DarstanHeader3.jpg","width":640,"height":480}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2225983,"name":"Headers","permalink":"headers","url":"/category/headers"},{"id":1842417,"name":"1600 Alfa Romeo Parts","permalink":"1600-alfa-romeo-parts","url":"/category/1600-alfa-romeo-parts"},{"id":1842415,"name":"1750 Alfa Romeo Parts","permalink":"1750-alfa-romeo-parts","url":"/category/1750-alfa-romeo-parts"},{"id":1842413,"name":"2-Liter Alfa Romeo  Parts","permalink":"2-liter-alfa-romeo-parts","url":"/category/2-liter-alfa-romeo-parts"}]},{"id":3182585,"name":"Darstan Racing Exhaust","permalink":"exhaust-system-for-darstan-headers","position":13,"price":675.0,"default_price":675.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/exhaust-system-for-darstan-headers","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-01-25T05:50:37.000Z","description":"<div style=\"padding:6px;margin-top:10px;
