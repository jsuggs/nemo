Foreclosure Resistance in Portland” is a full-color over-sized poster (35″ x 22.5”) that unfolds in a map-style layout. Know Your City partnered with We Are Oregon and graphic illustrator Jesse Reklaw to create a visual explanation of what people are doing to resist housing foreclosure. The poster explains the policies of banking corporations since the onset of the economic recession and what people can do about it locally. The narrative is told through a comic-book format, featuring the stories of several Portlanders who have had their homes repossessed, and one that is currently resisting.\r\n\r\nWe Are Oregon chose to partner with Know Your City to address this problem with their City Works Poster Series. They wanted to create an outreach tool that would help homeowners understand their options. They also wanted a piece that could speak to the large numbers of Spanish speaking populations they work with, to help them understand banking policy and their legal rights.\r\n\r\nThis poster is being distributed by We Are Oregon to homeowners facing evictions. Copies can also be purchased below. The poster is also available for download as a PDF, <a href=\"http://knowyourcity.org/dontmoveout_english300RGB.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">in English here</a> and <a href=\"http://knowyourcity.org/dontmoveout_spanish300RGB.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">in Spanish here.</a>\r\n\r\nDon’t Move Out! is the first in a series of fold-out posters KYC is creating that aims to add vitality to crucial debates about Portland’s future, while creating opportunities for designers to engage with social issues. Each poster is the product of a commissioned collaboration between a designer, advocacy organization and KYC. The project is inspired by Making Policy Public, a program of the Center for Urban Pedagogy.\r\n\r\nARTIST BIO  \r\nJesse Reklaw is the creator of the nationally syndicated comic strip Slow Wave and author of Dreamtoons, The Night of Your Life, and Couch Tag. He lives in SE Portland.\r\n\r\nABOUT WE ARE OREGON\r\nWe Are Oregon is a non-profit organization that works with communities across Portland on issues that affect working people. With people coming together to fight foreclosures, our communities are doing what government has been unable to do: hold banks accountable for crashing our economy and profiting from the pain of our communities.

The book gives context to these vital works through interviews with artists Adriene Cruz, Henry Frison and Isaka Shamsud-Din, and and a transcribed conversation between history professor Reiko Hillyer and curator Robin Dunitz. Walls of Pride at once celebrates Portland’s African American art, while underscoring the need to preserve these oft-overlooked cultural contributions.  \r\n\r\n“If you know where to look, Portland is an art gallery. And somewhere amid this miles-wide showroom is a collection of African American mural art. But there's no glass or alarms to protect what artists have made here; no guards to tell people not to touch.
