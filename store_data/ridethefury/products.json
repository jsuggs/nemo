(NJ gritty pop punk rock n roll)\r\nhttp://notthebeesnj.bandcamp.com/\r\n\r\nand OF COURSE! The finest pro wrestling RTF has to offer with 5 Action packed matches!\r\n\r\n\"THE COLD HEARTED PLAYA\" DANNY DEMANTO vs \"RAW POWER\" CHRIS POWERS\r\n- \"THANKSKILLING DEATH MATCH\" Take violence you've grown to know from RTF and Thanksgiving and smash it together. What does that mean? Come to the show to find out! Demanto was not happy that Powers stole the show at RTF 2, Nov 23 he will attempt to dethrone the new RTF favorite. \r\n\r\nRIGHT TO PARTY vs BLACK HOLLYWOOD\r\n- RTP has made waves in the first two RTF events and are coming back for more against Black Hollywood who is making their RTF Debut. Must see tag team action!\r\n\r\n2 HOT STEVE SCOTT vs \"THE MASSHOLE\" MIKE MCCARTHY\r\n- Steve Scott has quickly become known as RTF's resident douchebag and is currently riding high off a cheap win from RTF 2. However, the RTF debut of Boston's own, Mike McCarthy, is something the NJ punks have been asking for and McCarthy is not one to disappoint. \r\n\r\n2 RUDE DUDES w/ MIKE MANNING vs JEFF CANNONBALL/???\r\n\r\n- 2 Rude Dudes have been instrumental in Manning's crusade against RTF and Jeff Cannonball. at \"D!\" they will happily attempt to finally put Cannonball out of action. Unfortunately, after the brutal matches Cannonball has been thrust into against members of the Manning family has turned off many from joining him. We find out who is crazy enough to join at RTF 3: D!\r\n\r\nKYLE THE BEAST vs \"MR. ENTERTAINMENT\" JD SMOOTH\r\n- Kyle The Beast with handler and double popped collar douchebag, Mike Manning has been a seemingly unstoppable threat to RTF. JD Smooth remains winless (and hated). JD wants to make an impression and so he sets his sights on Kyle. Not because he wants to help RTF...he is just Mr. Entertainment and he wants to shine. \r\n\r\n+ much more to be announced\r\n\r\nTickets will be $10 advanced and $12 day of\r\n\r\nTHIS SHOW MAY BE UNSUITABLE FOR CHILDREN, THERE WILL BE BLOOD, CURSING AN\"D VIOLENCE.","options":[{"id":46387410,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126288405/-/rtfrtf.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126288405/-/rtfrtf.jpg","width":625,"height":960}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":13829340,"name":"DEACON- ROTTEN WORLD CDS / TAPES","permalink":"deacon-rotten-world-cds-tapes","position":7,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/deacon-rotten-world-cds-tapes","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-27T18:49:26.000Z","description":"RTF is happy to distro the heavy hitting sounds of DEACON over here in the USA. \r\n\r\nRotten World has 4 tracks from this Japanese unit and you won't be disappointed.
