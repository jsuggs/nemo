This debut EP establishes a unique, dark and noisy take on hardcore, with almost indecipherable vocals, powerful crash cymbals, intricate rhythmic riffs and bassy digital processing. The influence of Noise and Black Metal is apparent in their intelligent approach to abrasive volume. The band’s self-described aims are to 'explore the inner extremes of music, aggression and anxiety.' For each of the four loud, aggressive songs, there is an equal measure of space left for noise, drones, loops, ambience and feedback.\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=465684510/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/artwork=false/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://massband.bandcamp.com/album/mass\">MASS by MASS</a></iframe>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nMASS:\r\nJonathan Baker\r\nClyde Bradford\r\n\r\nRecorded - Hilmar Árnason (2012).\r\n\r\nEdited, Mixed, and DSP - MASS (2012/2013)\r\n\r\n<a href= \"http://www.facebook.com/pages/MASS/172656066105090/\">[ MASS Facebook ]</a>\r\n\r\nFORMAT:\r\n4-track cassette tape\r\n\r\nTRACK LISTING:\r\nA—SIDE\r\n I. &nbsp;&nbsp;Bellum\r\n II. &nbsp;Numbing\r\nIII.
