Save a whopping 40% off our RRPs by buying a second quality item. The kind of things that can make Mellor Ware a second are small black specks, bumps in glaze, a wonky decal and slight dents in the bisque that have been glazed over. These 'faults' are purely cosmetic and will not effect the functionality of the product or the care e.g. still dishwasher & microwave safe!\r\n\r\n“Go to work on an egg” they say, and wouldn’t that be a pleasure if you had this pretty little egg cup to use every day! This would make the ideal gift for easter, filled with a chocolate egg, wrapped in ribbon and hidden in the garden for a jolly egg hunt!\r\n\r\nAfternoon tea may be the most exciting treat, but breakfast is certainly the most important meal! Now you can wake up with Mellor Ware with your very own breakfast set!\r\n\r\nAll items are bone china, and are dishwasher and microwave safe. To produce them, they are decorated by hand either in Sheffield or Stoke, using decals of Lianne Mellor’s watercolour illustrations.
