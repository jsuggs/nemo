The pounding drums lead into the rumbling guitar of the opener, “Run to You”. Lead vocalist Roslen is quite impressive as she alternates between a clean metal voice and an operatic style. Musically, Tothem is very much a guitar driven band. “Smile Again” is next and starts off with a serene piano intro and leads into some more heavy riffing. This song has a chorus that is undeniably catchy as hell. This would be a great choice for the next single, in my opinion. The overall production on “Beyond the Sea” is so sharp and crisp. The songs are definitely well written and Roslen has the right mixture between operatic and a more melodic style – she never overdoes it and is a huge asset for Tothem. “This is the Time” is another fantastic song and a pure highlight. “Light of Soul” is a stirring ballad and packed with plenty of emotion. “Rescue”, “Beyond the Sea” and “The Witch” maintains a high level on the CD and the closing number “Where Angels Lie” is a good way to end things. “Beyond the Sea” maintains its consistency throughout the 49-minutes worth of playing time.\" - Tony Cannella (Femme Metal Webzine)\r\n\r\n\"In perfect unison ravishing Roslen can change her vocal style without blinking, from Amy Lee alternative, to Sharon Den Adel semi operatic, to Tarja soprano, to all points between, from innocent child to grand opera dame. The songs sail from light reflection to rocking up a storm to operatic grandeur, making for an absorbing listening experience. They don't mess about with an intro, but launch into the raging riffage of opener 'Run to You', they then assail you with the more lilting lyrical but still powerful numbers 'Smile Again', and 'Still', big power ballads 'Light of Soul' and 'So Close So Far Away', songs that are a touch more 'folky' 'This is the Time' and lead single 'The Witch', mini epics that run the gamut 'Fight With You' and title song 'Beyond the Sea', and the catchy rocking 'Cross The Line', probably my favourite tune.  The eastern flavoured track 'Where the Angels Lie' closes out the opus. The sound is good and well produced but a bit guitar heavy which stops it from becoming fully symphonic.  Tothem have set sail with a terrific well crafted album that is sure to find an anchorage in the harbours of all discerning metal fans.\" - Ravenheart Webzine\r\n\r\n‘Beyond the Sea’ was produced by the band in the summer of 2012 at MM Studio in Rome, and mastered by Creative Mastering in Forli, Italy.\r\n\r\nDigipak artwork was beautifully designed by Adhiira Art in Rome.\r\n\r\nCheck-out the official video for ‘Run to You’, the lead off track to ‘Beyond the Sea’ streaming on YouTube !","options":[{"id":48309609,"name":"Default","price":12.98,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.95,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127706949/-/Tothem_-_Beyond_the_Sea_(2013).jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127706949/-/Tothem_-_Beyond_the_Sea_(2013).jpg","width":1465,"height":1465}],"artists":[{"id":250272,"name":"TOTHEM","permalink":"tothem","url":"/artist/tothem"}],"categories":[{"id":1647342,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":9242165,"name":"ECLIPSE PROPHECY - Days of Judgement (MMR012) NEW RELEASE \"Fall Clearance Sale\" ","permalink":"eclipse-prophecy-days-of-judgement-mmr012-new-release-shipping-now","position":3,"price":7.98,"default_price":7.98,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/eclipse-prophecy-days-of-judgement-mmr012-new-release-shipping-now","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-01-31T17:21:31.000Z","description":"Power metallers ECLIPSE PROPHECY may be Canada’s answer to Helloween or Stratovarius ! The band combines true crunching power metal, with progressive and thrash metal influences to create a totally new breed of metal, for a new generation.\r\n\r\nEclipse Prophecy’s use of piano and keyboards adds lush symphonic layers, and grand solos to their epic wall of sound.  The incredible vocal range of David Mc Gregor can go from baritone to tenor, to that of Halford-esqe screams with ease.  All the influences combined  produce a melodic and dynamic listening experience.  You can also hear progressive metal influences similar to their fellow countrymen RUSH (2112 era), in “The Shattered Mirror”, only the song boasts a more modern and aggressive approach, with the inclusion of blast beats.  Augury’s Patrick Loisel is a guest vocalist on the same track, contributing the guttural growls.  \r\nThe ten tracks that make up \"Days of Judgement\" are killer power metal classics that will stand the test of time !\r\n\r\nThe brainchild of David Mc Gregor (lead vocals, and guitars), Montreal, Canada based Eclipse Prophecy were formed in 2003, and went through a number of band member changes including keyboardist Frederik Dufresne, only to settle on their current line-up in 2010. Their new line-up that performed on \"Days of Judgment\" includes David Mc Gregor, brothers Martin Machado on lead guitar, Karlos Machado on bass guitar, and Landryx (Unexpect) on drums. \r\n\r\nEclipse Prophecy have performed with Epica, Stratovarius, Blind Guardian, Gamma Ray, Pagan's Mind, and Sabaton on the Quebec, Canada metal circuit.\r\n\r\nThe album cover artwork was created by Pascal Laquerre, who is also credited for his album covers with Kataklysm and Aeternam.\r\n\r\nIf you are disappointed with the music scene and not sure that music is going in the right direction, this epic album will motivate you again to be a ‘defender of the faith'. This is the comeback album that metal has needed !\r\n“Days of Judgement” is definitely a classic metal album that all die-hard metalheads can enjoy, and a must-have for your record collection ! \r\n\r\nTrack Listing: Total running time approx 52 min.\r\n1.

Crank up the volume, and FACE OFF will deliver a knockout punch with 9 tracks of pure doom / power metal with just a touch of goth !\r\nFACE OFF do have the commercial appeal to go very far in the metal world !\r\n\r\nWith Marija Kovacevic’s hauntingly melodic voice there is a striking contrast to the thundering rhythms and distorted chaos, produced by the other four members of the band. The guitars play a pivotal role in the recording, and help drive each track forward. With many different tempo changes, the drums, bass & guitars add power and variety to the mix, creating an epic wall of sound. FACE OFF bring to the table a refreshingly new sound to the melodic metal genre, and the music reminds us of a metallized version of Evanescence.\r\n\r\nBelgrade (RS) based FACE OFF have already won a few band competitions in their native homeland, toured across Serbia, been broadcast by national radio, and performed on Serbian national TV in their young career since 2006.\r\n\r\n\"This one is for the heavy metal heads, you want your guitars loud and penetrating, this is for you.

These bands wrote great songs and shredded on guitar! \r\n     \r\nKEMILON are a 6 member metal band from Montreal that were formed in 2008, and continue in that tradition of excellence of writing great songs with their debut ‘Twisted Storm’.  \r\n\r\nThe best way to describe the music of Kemilon is to imagine the progressive elements of Dream Theater, but revving it up to the speed of European power metal bands such as Helloween and Gamma Ray.  Kemilon are Canada’s answer to such acts like Symphony X and Stratovarius.  The debut album of KEMILON is definitely going to ‘shred’, but it will also have a few surprises; such as a power ballad, dueling keyboard & guitar battles, and catchy, fist-raising  metal anthems!\r\n     \r\n‘Twisted Storm’ was recorded in Montreal in 2011, and was mastered by Peter In De Betou at Tailor Maid Productions in Spånga, Sweden (Amon Amarth, Dark Tranquility, Meshuggah, Opeth, Thin Lizzy, etc) last October.\r\n      \r\nBRAVEWORDS describes KEMILON as “inhabiting a similar territory to KAMELOT, technical, yet majestic constructions relying on a healthy dose of keyboards and speedy guitars.“ \r\n\r\n“The Revolution’ is a full blown Rhapsody Of Fire whirlwind song!” \r\n - BRAVEWORDS\r\n\r\nTrack listing for ‘Twisted Storm’:\r\n1.

Korpius have done just that.

The band is rounded out by Félix Lampron-Dandonneau on bass and Paul Côté-Bérard on drums.  KORPIUS have released 2 EPs in the past: a 6 song self-titled EP, ‘Korpius’ in 2006, and the latter a 4 song EP entitled ‘Apocalyptic Vision’ was released by Cryogenic Records in 2007. \r\n\r\nThis quartet plays a blackened style of death metal, combining modern blast-beat brutality, progressive elements, epic riffs and melodic solos, to produce a fresh sound.  The mix of guttural and high-pitched vocals sung at the same time is one of the distinctive trademarks of the band.   KORPIUS show their versatility with a wide range of songs on this album, and that death metal can be musical while staying brutal and having that punch in your face.\r\n\r\nKORPIUS have also carved a name for themselves as being a stellar force and a ‘must see Live act’ on the Quebec metal circuit over their short career, having already played with Despised Icon, Neuraxis, Krisiun, Belphagor, and many more. \r\n\r\n‘Shades Of Black’ was self-produced by KORPIUS.  The album was recorded and engineered between July and December 2010 by Philippe d’Astous at Cheriborg Studio in picturesque Orford, QC.  The album was mixed and mastered by Mat Laperle at Red Dusk Studio, just outside of Montreal, Canada.\r\n\r\nTrack listing for ‘Shades Of Black’:\r\n1. Shades of Black \r\n2. On the Edge\r\n3.

From musicianship to production level, no other “new band” can compete with this. Its brutal, fast and in some way the riffs and play style reminds me of Fear Factory. This album is just awesome in every way and this is a great band producing music that everyone can enjoy.\"  Concrete Web (be)  (93/100)\r\n\r\n\r\n“Global Enslavement” is a revolutionary album in Modern Death Metal. It is a concept death metal album that explores some of the darkest parts of modern history; that caused the epic failures of our society today.\r\n\r\nMASSIVE SLAVERY blend everything metal has to offer; like extreme aggression, speed and brutality, to devastating technical riffs and melody.\r\n\r\nThis supergroup was forged by ex-members of Quebec death metal bands: Paroxysm, Descend Into Nothingness, and Decrepity.\r\n\r\n MASSIVE SLAVERY-Global Enslavement Reviewer’s Quotes:   \r\n\r\n“This is a great album from a very talented band; great production value and great performances.  Riff after killer riff Massive Slavery are laying down the smack.” - Metal-Rules  (3.5/5)\r\n\r\n“Global Enslavement is an album that delivers a quintessential death metal experience.  It combines a refreshingly unique mix of melodic, brutal and technical death metal.  Bravo!” - Bravewords (8.5/10)\r\n\r\n“This is just an awesome debut by an ambitious band that is not afraid to raise their voice!” – DeathMetal.be  (92/100)\r\n\r\n“Massive Slavery deliver a refined version of melodic death metal on steroids that grips you like a vice and beats you into submission.”\r\n - The New Review (4 / 5)\r\n\r\n“Massive Slavery could be the successor of DESPISED ICON!” -   Metal.de (Ger)  (7/10)\r\n\r\n“The band is practically as modern as they come.  The once established boundaries between melodic death metal and technical death metal have become heavily blurred, even a few deathcore influences get thrown in.” - Metal Storm (N/R)\r\n\r\n“When the band completely tunes in and embraces their melodic death metal influence it easily tops anything that DARK TRANQUILITY have done since Damage Done. Hell, a lot of it sounds better than anything that IN FLAMES has done in a decade.” - Metalreviews/Metal-R-Us (71/100)\r\n\r\n“However, even if this album may not completely revolutionize the world of Death Metal, it will still remain a beautiful work in all cases.” -  MetalShip (Fr)  (7/10)\r\n\r\n“Global Enslavement : the perfect balance between extreme and melodic.\r\nGood melodic death metal with hooks, brutality and groove.”\r\n - Boulevard Brutal (Que)  (9/10)\r\n\r\nPlay MASSIVE SLAVERY - 'Humanity's Last Hope' on the Rock Band Video Game NOW, for Xbox!
