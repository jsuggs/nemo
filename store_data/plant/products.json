This gives it some of the same qualities a marble cheese board would have—if you chill it in the fridge ahead of time, it will keep your cheeses fresh and cool on the table for longer than a wooden board. And one hole goes all the way through, for easy hanging.\r\n\r\nThe board is entirely non-porous, so it won’t harbor bacteria or odors, and it doesn’t require any special cleaning or maintenance techniques. Just wash it with hot soapy water or put it in the dishwasher, and it’ll be safe and ready for use.\r\n\r\nThe surface has just enough give that it won’t harm a fine knife blade, and any knife scratches can easily be removed with a good rub using a nylon scrubby sponge. For a totally new surface, simply sand the board lightly with some fine sandpaper.\r\n<a href=\"http://plantbrooklyn.com/?page_id=4&shopp_pid=8\">Visit PLANTbrooklyn.com to see more!</a>\r\n\r\nThe boards are made by a small, local CNC milling workshop in Brooklyn.\r\n\r\n<small>Design: Bjarke Ballisager\r\nAll rights reserved, design ©2011.\r\nDESIGN PATENT PENDING.</small>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.PLANTBROOKLYN.COM \"><b>All our products\r\nare at this time ONLY available at\r\nWWW.PLANTbrooklyn.com</b></a>","options":[{"id":16169933,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/48853259/-/DSC_0045-_3_-copy_softcrop.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/48853259/-/DSC_0045-_3_-copy_softcrop.jpg","width":1000,"height":856}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
