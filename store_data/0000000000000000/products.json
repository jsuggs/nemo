A loving family consisting of a young boy, a young girl, and two middle-aged parents lay fast asleep, with their minds corrupt by dreams of excitement and happiness. However, downstairs in the front room, there sat a Christmas tree. This Christmas tree was the same one which sat in the front room every single year, covered in tinsel which made the tree itchy, fairy lights which blinded the tree as well as candy canes and baubles which the tree was reluctantly covered with year after year. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis year he decided that enough was enough. His green arms burst out from beneath the tinsel, his eyes glowed red, and a huge dark gap forced apart the leaves, baubles, tinsel and candy canes, which formed a large aggressive mouth. His long hairy arms viciously grabbed the presents which surrounded the pot in which the tree stood in, and one by one he stuffed them all into his mouth. The more the tree ate, the more hungry he became, and he started to eat everything in the room. He ate the television, the family computer, the sofa, the telephone, everything. Eventually, all that was left was him. “Oh no!” thought the Christmas tree. “They are bound to suspect that it was me! They will chop me up and make paper out of me!”. So he desperately ran out of the front door as fast as a tree possibly could, with baubles falling off his leaves. Finally he was free from repulsive Christmas decorations, and disgusting pets who couldn’t tell the difference between a tree which you were allowed to urinate on, and a tree which you were not allowed to urinate on. The eager family woke the next day, and ran down the stairs, to find an empty living room. After a lengthy police report, it was concluded that their house had been burgled, but we all know different, don’t we…\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<b>Search Tags:</b>\r\nhands on clothing, t-shirt, tshirt, tee, christmas, tree, pine, xmas\r\n</center>","options":[{"id":875841,"name":"Small","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":875842,"name":"Medium","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":875843,"name":"Large","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1344326/-/frontprint.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1344326/-/frontprint.jpg","width":400,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":207107,"name":"Fridge Magnet","permalink":"fridge-magnet","position":3,"price":0.99,"default_price":0.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fridge-magnet","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-12-23T03:27:58.000Z","description":"58mm Fridge Magnet!","options":[{"id":911084,"name":"58mm","price":0.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1448971/-/fridgemagnet.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1448971/-/fridgemagnet.jpg","width":400,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":185166,"name":"Other","permalink":"other","url":"/category/other"}]},{"id":199265,"name":"Abandon Ship!","permalink":"abandon-ship","position":4,"price":14.99,"default_price":14.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/abandon-ship","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-12-08T00:45:57.000Z","description":"<center><img src=\"http://handsonclothing.net/sizechart.gif\" />\r\n<br><BR>\r\n<b>The monster of the lagoon..</b>\r\n<p>Here is a story that your history teacher didn’t want you to hear...</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA huge battle ship was out in the ocean, gracefully gliding along the waves with about two dozen men on board – each of which had loving families back at home, loving families who shudder whenever they are reminded of the terrible event that occurred that night. It was a moonless pitch-black night, and a bed of fog and mist lay on the surface of the freezing cold water. The sky was patterned with stars and the night was so silent that even with the powerful oars that were continuously being pulled to and fro, even with all the men running around on the wooden deck, the beautiful ripples of the ocean could still be heard. The men all agreed that it was time for a rest and so decided to go to sleep on their uncomfortable hammocks in their tiny rooms below deck which smelt of damp and sweat. The anchor was lowered and the whole ship shook as it hit the ocean floor with a huge thud – startling hundreds of sea urchins and fish around it. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut there was something mystical and powerful beneath the water, lurking through the seaweed and floating amongst the starfish that desperately clung onto rocks. Something mystical, powerful, and envious. This monster grabbed a large rock and began to angrily pound at the chain of the anchor. The monster was so strong and determined that each time the stone hit the metal chain the entire ship rocked violently, which made gigantic waves and splashes of water. Everything inside the ship was thrown around and tipped upside down. Bottles smashed against the ceiling and men were viciously flung from one side of the room to the other. The huge metal anchor was to remain at the bottom of the ocean forever more, whilst the ship wandered off into the distance, with all of the crew inside battered to a pulp, bleeding to death. If you’re ever out in the ocean at night, look out at the ripples of water and you can sometimes still hear the chain rattling beneath the calm and peace of the waves.\r\n</p>\r\n<b>Search Tags:</b>\r\nhands on clothing, t-shirt, tshirt, tee,abandon ship, overboard\r\n</center>","options":[{"id":883315,"name":"Extra Small","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":883312,"name":"Small","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":883313,"name":"Medium","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":883314,"name":"Large","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1393852/-/abam.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1393852/-/abam.gif","width":400,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":124471,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":207109,"name":"Keyring Bottle Opener","permalink":"keyring-bottle-opener","position":5,"price":0.99,"default_price":0.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/keyring-bottle-opener","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2008-12-23T03:36:02.000Z","description":"Here's one of our later products - a genious little invention - a bottle opener on a keyring!\r\n\r\n58mm!","options":[{"id":911096,"name":"58mm","price":0.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1448975/-/bottle.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1448975/-/bottle.jpg","width":400,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":185166,"name":"Other","permalink":"other","url":"/category/other"}]}]
