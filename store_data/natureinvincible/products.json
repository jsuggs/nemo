It is pro-biotic in several ways.\r\n\r\nFirst off, it provides a rad home for infusoria and fry.  See in the picture how it is all fluffy?  That fluffy holds alot of empty space and all the microguys live in there and are safe to breed.  This means higher shrimplet and fry survivability rates for sure but also, eventually, the infusoria travel out of this area and your bigger fish will eat them.  Catechu bark is essentially a live food generator inside your tank.\r\n\r\nCatechu bark is a powerful antibiotic and will reduce infections.  What that means in real terms is that if your fish gets a body scratch or your shrimp gets a crack in its carapace, both will be less likely to become infected because the biocomplexity of the tank includes these unique attributes.\r\n\r\nThe light from your aquarium will create a biofilm on the outside of the bark and shrimp, fry and microguys will all eat that too.\r\n\r\nThe bark is packed with tannins. You can use them or not.  If you want to make a blackwater environment this is pure gold.  Same if you want to lower pH for some species.  Most of the time we don't need the tannins so we soak the bark in water for a few days, changing water often, and then drop the bark in the tank after the water runs clear enough showing that the tannins have come out.\r\n\r\nVary rare.

Fuji on Honshu Island. The eruptions caused a red soil to form and mix with the native black soil and then was compressed for many generations.  Akadama clay is the result of this process.\r\n\r\nAll brands of akadama are no longer importable into the United States because it was found to have traces of root fibers in the naturally occurring clay.  When we our inventory runs out, we will have no more so buy and hoard it now.\r\n\r\nIt is our preferred substrate for shrimp tanks because it has the quality of balancing water chemistry.  If your ammonia or nitrates, for example, spike, the akadama will tend to absorb excesses buying you a bit more time to do a water change.  Eventually the soil will release whatever it absorbed but it acts like a buffer for spikes in the short term.  The varied surface of the individual pieces are very suitable for foraging shrimp, infusoria and shrimplet survival.\r\n\r\nOther folks use akadama for making wabi-kusa soil balls.  They appreciate the chemistry balancing as described above but are usually using it as a larger granual outside layer to a root ball.  Also, akadama holds ferts well and some aquarists supercharge the clay with ferts before wrapping it into the wabi-kusa.\r\n\r\n<b>Qty. </b>\r\nOne Quart Bag\r\n\r\n<b>Shipping</b>\r\nDomestic (USA): Shipped alone $5.50, with other items $5.50\r\nInternational: This item not available internationally.\r\n\r\nThis product can be shipped within the US only.","options":[{"id":43017738,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":5.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124667922/-/AkadamaClay_closeup_s.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124667922/-/AkadamaClay_closeup_s.jpg","width":300,"height":201},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124667925/-/AkadamaClay_main_s.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124667925/-/AkadamaClay_main_s.jpg","width":300,"height":201}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6939552,"name":"Habitat","permalink":"habitat","url":"/category/habitat"}]},{"id":10518190,"name":"Handmade Spawning Mops","permalink":"spawning-mops","position":16,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/spawning-mops","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-13T02:38:27.000Z","description":"Perfect for egg depositing fish like killies, danios, discus and many others.
