Deep Wound were one of a handful of great punk bands from the outer regions of Massachusetts who have been largely overlooked by HC history in favor of the \"Boston Crew\" bands who put out records on XClaim! or Modern Method. The four-piece recorded their one and only single with Lou Giordano and Frank Michaels (Proletariat) and released it on the Radiobeat label in 1982. The record is snotty teenage punk rock but played at lightning speed with totally manic singing. Drummer J Mascis and guitarist Lou Barlow went on to further greatness by forming the seminal indie rock band Dinosaur Jr., and bassist Scott Helland played in the Outpatients until their breakup in 1995.

In 1981 they recorded 11 tracks to tape for what would become their debut album. Oozing out shock waves of bad acid trips, decayed guitar, and the dull stomp of a tiny beatbox, Pain It Dark encompasses a sound the band dubbed ”Psycho Beat”, a blend of American garage and proto-punk filtered through some shadow-filled masterpiece of German expressionism.\r\n\r\nThe pair’s most obvious touchstones are Suicide’s crusted synths and the ragged stumble of Loaded-era Velvets – if fed through a particularly British lens of Swell Maps/basement-DIY whack-job-ism. Amongst the outsourcing, one can nevertheless detect a native Kraut heritage peeking through in the robotic beats and icy demeanor of “Twisted & Shouts” – as Dada and nihilistic an oldies cover as can be imagined.

Agnostic Front’s ‘United Blood’, Antidote’s ‘Thou Shall Not Kill’, Cause For Alarm’s self-titled release and The Abused’s ‘Loud and Clear’ all defined the sound and aesthetic of New York Hardcore for years to come with their sonic brutality and fervent lyrics.

That is, until now.\r\n\r\nRadio Raheem proudly presents the first fully authorized re-issue of the ‘Loud and Clear’ ep. Pressed in the LP format, this 21-track collection is rounded out by the band's 1982 demo and never before heard live material. Also included is a 24-page, full color booklet containing photos, lyrics and the band's infamous show flyers drawn by their vocalist Kevin Crowley, as well as a sticker sheet replicating original Abused sticker designs.\r\n\r\nFinally, the most arcane and collectible piece of the early 80’s NYHC puzzle is available for both the tight pursed nerd and curious onlooker alike!\"\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/d7LBm12Tgq4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","options":[{"id":47024586,"name":"Default","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":28.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126755184/-/abused.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126755184/-/abused.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6597696,"name":"PUNK / HARDCORE","permalink":"punk-hardcore","url":"/category/punk-hardcore"},{"id":3691489,"name":"VINYL","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":14058150,"name":"AFFLICTED MAN - OFF ME 'EAD LP","permalink":"afflicted-man-off-me-ead-lp","position":8,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/afflicted-man-off-me-ead-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-08T23:26:58.000Z","description":"Byron Coley: \"“Steve Hall's Afflicted (Man) project was one of the greatest mystery wobbles to come out of the Brit DIY explosion. Trying to figure out what the hell these records were about took years to unravel. We even thought there might be a Nurse With Wound connection when United Dairies released the Afflicted Man's Musica Box LP. We were stupid, but can you blame us?  The slurred psych blues of I'm Off Me 'Ead were so unlike anything else going on at the time, it almost seemed like the whole thing had to be a put-on of some kind. There had been those earlier records, sure, this one felt way different. The concept of UK stoner-punks had existed for a few years, but their output had tended towards the arty end of things before this. There's a latent brutality to Im' Off that truly lashed our feeble minds. But maybe that's only because L.A. was awash in very good acid right about then. Still, it remains extremely  difficult to place this music inside the contextual history of what was going on then. Jesus, I would have loved to have caught a gig or two. Unimaginable. I bought I'm Off Me 'Ead at the old Vinyl Fetish store on Melrose in '81, same year I finally managed to snag a copy of Randy Holden's\r\nPopulation II, and they were both records I'd play to anyone who dropped by our pad in Santa Monica for a listening session. The utterly fucked-up-ness of both guitarists never failed to astonish anyone who wasn't too wasted to acknowledge what they were hearing.

Five of the tracks on the album feature the voice of Alison Skidmore, Andy's onetime Piano teacher whom he hadnt seen since he was a teenager back in 1996. There was no grand gesture in mind, it just sort of happened - but after almost a year of studio work the result is really quite unlike anything you'll have heard from him before. 'Numb' opens the album with Alison's voice; layered and looped but essentially left bare and exposed, tumbling into a dense shuffle, sort of somewhere between Theo Parrish and Sade, but more f*cked. 'Lost and Found' follows and deploys a growling rave bassline and a disturbed vocal, the beat assembling itself around a squashed Linndrum like a submerged Prince/Cameo production, haunted and impenetrable, but full of funk. 'Sleepless' started life as an African drum edit that sooner or later succumbed to Stott's intense rhythmic shifts. It's a sound that's been imitated countless times since the release of 'Passed Me By', here re-tooled and re-built for its next evolutionary phase. 'Hatch The Plan' ends the first half of the album with some heavily treated location recordings and a low end grind that probably doesnt quite prepare you for the vocal arrangements that follow - it's just a beautifuly inverted pop song. The second half opens with 'Expecting', the most recognisably 'Stott' moment on the album: a wrecked, deliriously knocked-out 4/4 shuffle deployed at halfspeed; those heavy kickdrums sucking in everything around them. 'Luxury Problems' is next and offers up the album's most quietly euphoric and open 5 minutes; conventional arrangements and drumloops disrupted by sharp disco bursts that mess with what you know: it's straight and beautiful and unbalanced and damaged, somehow all at once. \"Up the box\" switches up the narrative and goes somewhere else entirely, an extended intro that seems to build continuously for 3 minutes before breaking off into a slowed-down Amen edit, creating a kind of narcotic Jungle variant that fragments everything and ends just at the point you think it's going to go off, before \"Leaving\" finishes the album with an almost unbareably beautiful arrangement of voice and synth and a final key-change that takes you from joyful to forlorn in an instant.\"\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F65811826\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nIf you live in Australia and want to purchase via bank deposit or cash, send me an email through the contact form.","options":[{"id":44353785,"name":"Default","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124937955/-/luxury_problems.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124937955/-/luxury_problems.jpg","width":333,"height":333}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6597699,"name":"ELECTRONIC / TECHNO","permalink":"electronic-techno","url":"/category/electronic-techno"},{"id":3691489,"name":"VINYL","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":15647370,"name":"APHEX TWIN - I CARE BECAUSE YOU DO 2xLP","permalink":"aphex-twin-i-care-because-you-do-2xlp","position":13,"price":32.0,"default_price":32.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/aphex-twin-i-care-because-you-do-2xlp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-19T00:07:09.000Z","description":"KIND HEARTED.","options":[{"id":50904225,"name":"Default","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129612066/-/aphex.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129612066/-/aphex.jpg","width":303,"height":303}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6597750,"name":"EXPERIMENTAL / NOISE / INDUSTRIAL","permalink":"experimental-noise-industrial","url":"/category/experimental-noise-industrial"},{"id":6597699,"name":"ELECTRONIC / TECHNO","permalink":"electronic-techno","url":"/category/electronic-techno"},{"id":3691489,"name":"VINYL","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":15647310,"name":"APHEX TWIN - SELECTED AMBIENT WORKS II 3xLP","permalink":"aphex-twin-selected-ambient-works-ii-3xlp","position":14,"price":38.0,"default_price":38.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/aphex-twin-selected-ambient-works-ii-3xlp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-19T00:03:24.000Z","description":"GLORY TO THE HIGHEST HOST","options":[{"id":50903949,"name":"Default","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129611925/-/atambient.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129611925/-/atambient.jpg","width":303,"height":303}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6597750,"name":"EXPERIMENTAL / NOISE / INDUSTRIAL","permalink":"experimental-noise-industrial","url":"/category/experimental-noise-industrial"},{"id":6597699,"name":"ELECTRONIC / TECHNO","permalink":"electronic-techno","url":"/category/electronic-techno"},{"id":3691489,"name":"VINYL","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":15611190,"name":"* NEW * BASIC HOUSE - OATS LP","permalink":"new-basic-house-oats-lp","position":16,"price":22.0,"default_price":22.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/new-basic-house-oats-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-17T10:22:42.000Z","description":"Alter: \"Basic House is the solo electronics project of Stephen Bishop, a mainstay of the DIY scene in the UK’s North East and the brain behind the label Opal Tapes.

In their day job as label managers, Stadsgaard and Rahbek have been instrumental in establishing the city’s prolific and exciting noise / punk community and outgrowing their humble beginnings in noise / industrial culture by attracting a cult / fanatical worldwide following of obsessive record hoarders, hipster bloggers, depressive punks and industrial maniacs. Working together as Damien Dubrovnik, they have published work across 2 LPs, a handful of sought after cassette releases, compilations and notched up numerous performances throughout Europe and Scandinavia. Their third LP, ‘First Burning Attraction’, draws explicitly from DIY minimal synth traditions and the canon of European Industrial music, resulting in the strongest manifestation of their sound so far. Consisting of 6 powerful and varied tracks, the album features more of the brooding synth parts and ominous bass throbs that dominated the highlights of previous LP ‘Europa Dagbog – Europa Diary’, yet it feels tenser and more atmospheric due to the application of new acoustic-based sound sources, primitive bass pulses and more disciplined dynamics. Rahbek’s vocals, which were previously guttural and wild, appear more restrained here giving the tracks an alluring air of ambiguity and suggestiveness – no undirected aggression, but something more thoughtful and introspective instead.\"\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/80765128&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":50783502,"name":"Default","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129520548/-/dd.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129520548/-/dd.JPG","width":683,"height":684}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6597750,"name":"EXPERIMENTAL / NOISE / INDUSTRIAL","permalink":"experimental-noise-industrial","url":"/category/experimental-noise-industrial"},{"id":3691489,"name":"VINYL","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":13059816,"name":"DAMIEN DUBROVNIK - THE VANITY SET LP","permalink":"damien-dubrovnik-the-vanity-set","position":42,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/damien-dubrovnik-the-vanity-set","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-20T00:14:52.000Z","description":"Posh Isolation: \"Damien Dubrovnik is a duo consisting of Loke Rahbek and Christian Stadsgaard, and was the first ever project to be put out on Posh Isolation.\r\n\r\nThe Vanity Set is an important recording in the Damien Dubrovnik discography and was bound to have a second release after the long sold out tape on Järtecknet in 2011.\r\n\r\nThemed around the fragility of beauty, the album presents three tracks of powerful synth-driven post industrial. From the monolithic A-side to the vocal driven B-side “The Vanity Set” is difficult as a whole to grasp the nature of. It is a recording that balances its feminine and masculine qualities to a point where the two start to blend and take on new faces. In many ways “The Vanity Set” finds itself very much in between the two latest Damien Dubrovnik albums; the aggression of “Europa Diary” and the emotional sustain of this year’s “First Burning Attraction”. The closing track has been reworked for this new edition – the result leaves the recording holding even more unfiltered emotion.\"\r\n\r\nPosh Isolation 105 / 300 copies\r\n\r\nIf you live in Australia and want to purchase via bank deposit or cash, send me an email through the contact form.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F103719334\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":41684430,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123019632/-/dd.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123019632/-/dd.jpg","width":250,"height":250}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6597750,"name":"EXPERIMENTAL / NOISE / INDUSTRIAL","permalink":"experimental-noise-industrial","url":"/category/experimental-noise-industrial"},{"id":3691489,"name":"VINYL","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":14229516,"name":"DARKTHRONE - TRANSYLVANIAN HUNGER LP","permalink":"darkthrone-transylvanian-hunger-lp","position":43,"price":35.0,"default_price":35.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/darkthrone-transylvanian-hunger-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-17T02:04:25.000Z","description":"STRONG. 2012 REISSUE ON TRUE NORWEGIAN BLACK VINYL.","options":[{"id":45963102,"name":"Default","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125991381/-/darkthrone.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125991381/-/darkthrone.jpg","width":224,"height":224}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6597702,"name":"METAL / GRIND","permalink":"metal-grind","url":"/category/metal-grind"},{"id":3691489,"name":"VINYL","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":13653552,"name":"DAWN OF HUMANS - BLURST OF THE BIRDFISH 7\"","permalink":"dawn-of-humans-blurst-of-the-birdfish-7","position":44,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dawn-of-humans-blurst-of-the-birdfish-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-19T00:16:54.000Z","description":"NYC\r\n<br><br>\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F84214488\"></iframe>\r\n<br><br>\r\nIf you live in Australia and want to purchase via bank deposit or cash, send me an email through the contact form.","options":[{"id":43794150,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124525074/-/dawn_of_humans.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124525074/-/dawn_of_humans.jpeg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6597696,"name":"PUNK / HARDCORE","permalink":"punk-hardcore","url":"/category/punk-hardcore"},{"id":3691489,"name":"VINYL","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":15235215,"name":"* NEW * DEAD LANGUAGE - DEAD LANGUAGE LP ","permalink":"new-dead-language-dead-language-lp","position":46,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/new-dead-language-dead-language-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-01T03:04:53.000Z","description":"IRON LUNG: \"20 minutes of pure, ear-crippling power violence played by members of IRON LUNG, SOLUTIONS, WALLS, PIG HEART TRANSPLANT and NO COMMENT.

Taking it out of the package I glommed the title, looked at who was participating and snorted appreciatively. Ego Summit – perfect! Don Howland, Jim Shepard, Ron House, Tommy Jay and Michael Hummel were all guys whose impact on the world of music (as it is known) was questionable, but all of them were well-known at the sub-underground level, and it was damn certain they all felt like kings! Between them they had created sounds and records that were legendary and influential, but the fact that they were all bums dedicated to living in Columbus, Ohio made the reality of their impact something that was hard to appreciate if you lived further away than Dayton (home of GBV). But as the years peeled away, oddball record collectors (and perhaps, even, the women who love them) have come to appreciate the insane form-moves this cabal of record collectors was up to. \r\n\r\nBy the time of this release, they’d been putting out records for years, with bands as diverse as Gibson Bros, Bassholes, Vertical Slit, V-3, Great Plains, Mike Rep & the Quota, True Believers (OH), and in various solo incarnations of one form or another. Each had evolved a dinstinctive sound, redolent of every goddamn record he’d ever heard – from Ramblin’ Thomas to the Twinkeyz to Armand Schaubroeck Steals to Destroy All Monsters, and they were ready to roll it all out. Ego Summit functions like a download of everything they’ve ever really loved, from the VU’s Live ’69 to Quicksilver’s cover of Buffy Ste. Marie’s “Codine”, all piled up in a beautifully loose garage band jumble. I’m never sure whether my fave track is Ron House’s “Rise Sherry” (with its lazy approximation of the original Contortions’ slide guitar/bass dualism), Jim Shepard’s abosultely blown talling-blues, “We Got It All” (the best experiment in the form since the Minutemen’s “History Lesson Part Two”), or Don Howland’s “Wife Blues” (a track that makes every motion by Spencer’s Blues Explosion extraneous), but the whole goddamn thing is great. A totally superior listen, by a bunch of clowns who were their own best fans. And knew why.

Rather than the distorted no-wave of NOTV’s original incarnation Suspension, the duo’s first release, finds them exploring a space occupied by abstract uneasiness. The level of investment in composition here puts it miles ahead of most recent ‘noise’ releases and, as a result, is vastly more interesting. Hopkins’ manipulated tape apparitions augment Phelan’s precisely modelled synth tones. The two are often difficult to isolate from each other, only becoming fully apparent when the keys sparingly achieve buoyancy. This is soundtrack music, but to what is not initially clear. It is the intangibility of Half High’s sound that lends it a sense of dread, appealing to the collective horror of the unknown. Fully realised in a live setting Half High’s music is accompanied by video work compiled by the two to apply further context, i.e. that this is inherently dark and intended to make the listener feel discomfort. Suspension is no longer available, but it can be listened to and e-dollars exchanged for its sound files online. They have a forthcoming casssette of live recordings coming on Eiderdown Records and a home-recorded 7” on my own label, Altered States Tapes in the next few months. Conflict of interest?

Informed by a taste for the most decrepit, cruddy tone and poised with a steadfast, stare-down glower, he hoofs clods of flinty drums comparable with the recent Wolf Eyes sound against oppressive atmospheres redolent of Kevin Drumm's 'Imperial Distortion' on 'Silencer', and slowly sinks into boggy marshland ambience under the peal of sustained foghorn brass performed by John Hannon ov Liberez in 'Mirrored Palms'. Flipside, 'Bergamo' inhabits a claggy tunnel of effluent, roiling drums and marrow-freezing atmospheres, and our favourite, 'The Haze' epitomises the EP's strange sense of detachment with insectoid, mechanical percussions and field recordings diffused to a visceral yet spacious sort of para-dimensional dread.

Following on from his previous remix on the Harald Grosskopf Synthesist / Re-Synthesist LP on RVNG last year, and a digital release for Leaving Records, this is his first full-length LP. Both his visual and aural oeuvre take the form of cut up and reformations in the manner of previous PAN stablemates like Joseph Hammer and Ghedalia Tazartes, remodeling the past in order to create something new out of the modern detritus, and nestles in nicely alongside the recent 'Diversions 1994-1996' release from Lee Gamble. The result is a baffling yet functioning head-on collision between early plunderphonics and an abstracted futuristic hip hop aesthetic. \r\n\r\nThe LP is mastered and cut by Rashad Becker at D&M, pressed on 140g vinyl. It is packaged in a pro-press color jacket which itself is housed in a silkscreened pvc sleeve with artwork by Kathryn Politis & Bill Kouligas.\"\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/54329844\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nIf you live in Australia and want to purchase via bank deposit or cash, send me an email through the contact form.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":44353647,"name":"Default","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124937784/-/jar_moff.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124937784/-/jar_moff.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124937841/-/jar_moff_sleeve.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124937841/-/jar_moff_sleeve.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6597750,"name":"EXPERIMENTAL / NOISE / INDUSTRIAL","permalink":"experimental-noise-industrial","url":"/category/experimental-noise-industrial"},{"id":6597699,"name":"ELECTRONIC / TECHNO","permalink":"electronic-techno","url":"/category/electronic-techno"},{"id":3691489,"name":"VINYL","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":13814775,"name":"JOHN WIESE - SEVEN OF WANDS CD","permalink":"john-wiese-seven-of-wands-cd","position":107,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/john-wiese-seven-of-wands-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-27T00:54:58.000Z","description":"Boomkat: \"We always know that PAN is going to treat us to something special, but seeing them team up with California noise veteran John Wiese is like having yer birthday and Christmas combined. He's popped up on the label before (with Evan Parker in tow) but 'Seven of Wands' is his first substantial work for PAN as a solo performer, and those of us familiar with his canon know that solo is really where Wiese brings the noise. That's not to say he hasn't enlisted some of his friends to help out; Angus Andrew and Julian Gross of Liars pop up to add voices, field recordings and percussion, and both add another layer of depth to the clouds of abstraction. Since his cacophonous early works, Wiese has been stripping down elements of the sound and introducing new obsessions, and 'Seven of Wands' might be his most successful 'quiet' record to date. Harmonies erupt out of clattering, scraping percussion and tones wrench themselves from Wiese's patented cut-and-paste tape manipulations. The backbone of the sound is still the laptop, but Wiese makes it breathe, cough and hiccup using it as a tool rather than allowing the algorithms to inform his creativity entirely. At times the album sounds like a digital counterpart to Red Horse's stunning self-titled album from earlier this year as skittering beats collide with haunted, wheezing strings - it's no surprise that Red Horse drummer Eli Keszler is another PAN alum. 'Seven of Wands' is decidedly computer music though, and each instrumental sound is piped through many layers of zeroes and ones. Wiese has reached a point in his career where he is informing the direction of the genre rather than following it, and these delectable selections of nouveau concrete sound as alien as they do referential. He knows his Xennakis, Ferrari and Hecker that's for sure, but 'Seven of Wands' is something all its own, and all the better for it. Needless to say, it's one of the most twisted pieces of sound manipulation you'll hear all year.\"\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F26743744\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nIf you live in Australia and want to purchase via bank deposit or cash, send me an email through the contact form.","options":[{"id":44353431,"name":"Default","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124937568/-/john_wiese.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124937568/-/john_wiese.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6597750,"name":"EXPERIMENTAL / NOISE / INDUSTRIAL","permalink":"experimental-noise-industrial","url":"/category/experimental-noise-industrial"},{"id":6597744,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":14325831,"name":"JUST URBAINE - EVERYBODY LOVES 7\"","permalink":"just-urbaine-everybody-loves-7","position":108,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/just-urbaine-everybody-loves-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-21T23:39:54.000Z","description":"OATH.","options":[{"id":46338351,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126252183/-/ju.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126252183/-/ju.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6597696,"name":"PUNK / HARDCORE","permalink":"punk-hardcore","url":"/category/punk-hardcore"},{"id":3691489,"name":"VINYL","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":15235500,"name":"* NEW * KIM PHUC - COPSUCKER LP","permalink":"new-kim-phuc-copsucker-lp","position":110,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/new-kim-phuc-copsucker-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-01T03:23:24.000Z","description":"IRON LUNG: \"For those unfamiliar with the KP sound, it lands somewhere near the idea of Warsaw era Joy Division on steroids with a distinct Pittsburgh edge.\"\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4173540228/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/t=5/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://ironlungpv.bandcamp.com/album/copsucker-lp\">Copsucker LP by Kim Phuc</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":49520160,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128575437/-/KimPhucCopsuckerWeb.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128575437/-/KimPhucCopsuckerWeb.jpg","width":400,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6597696,"name":"PUNK / HARDCORE","permalink":"punk-hardcore","url":"/category/punk-hardcore"},{"id":6597747,"name":"POST-PUNK / PEACE / WAR","permalink":"post-punk-peace-war","url":"/category/post-punk-peace-war"},{"id":3691489,"name":"VINYL","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":13059771,"name":"KOMMANDO R.J.F. - SWEET SLOW SUICIDE LP","permalink":"kommando-r-j-f-sweet-slow-suicide-lp","position":111,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kommando-r-j-f-sweet-slow-suicide-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-20T00:11:31.000Z","description":"Posh Isolation says: \"30 years ago R.J.F released their debut “Greater Success in Apprehensions & Convictions” as an LP limited to 300 copies, and by doing so released a piece of music unlike anything seen in Scandinavia before.

It has a concept so brilliant and simple we can't quite believe it hasn't been done before, taking the burning embers, breakdowns and ambient interludes off classic Jungle mixtapes and re-assembling them into a ghostly ambient-not-ambient mix that's at once hugely nostalgic and totally forward thinking - so so good* 'Diversions 1994-1996' is Lee Gamble's chimeric recollection of jungle's golden era. Using samples sourced solely from his cache of jungle mixtapes accrued as a raving teenager, Gamble creates a richly evocative, serotonin-depleted suite of morphing, diffuse and dusty moments, choosing to largely focus on the sensuous interzones between the rhythmic torque, rendering those sharply contrasting fragments of euphoric diva vocals, angelic techno pads and jazz fusion-aping chords as tantalising, ghostly immersions. However, while hypnagogic in effect, the processes behind Gamble's manipulations owe far more to his background in academic computer music - he's a founding member of Brum-via-London's CYRK collective and has previously released on the equally high-brow Entr'acte imprint - applying tactile, de/reconstructive software programming to emphasise the grain and weft of the source material, in turn yielding nano-fine layers of microtonal dissonance, fathomless amounts of space and timbral quirks that were always there, yet practically imperceptible in original form. It's effect is visceral, starkly compelling, bound to send shivers up the spine of anyone who's stood with their ears ringing at the end of a warehouse party and returned home in a state of near-shellshocked delirium after disengaging the soundsystem.

In contrast to Lee's challenging early work as co-founder of the CYRK collective and the sense of melancholic euphoria on 'Diversions…', there's also a playful sleight of hand at work on 'Dutch Tvashtar Plumes' in fine balance with eerier, eldritch themes. He beautifully captures that classic dichotomy of UK raving music, riding a wave between the physically psychedelic highs of aerobic mysticism and serotonin depletion's dark bliss, and quite importantly that mad bit in the middle when hooks are heard through cubicle doors, all smudged and mangled, lodged in your nut in the taxi home, or catching an unexpected lift from Gary on your monday morning headphone commute. The album's structure iterates the effect, blurring between shorter fragments such as 'Black Snow' and the filtered rhythms of 'Coma Skank (BinocConverge Mix)' (even ending on a sound like that Russian Rave in A Forest youtube clip, a post-party fave of ours) with something like the magical effect of Mark Leckey's 'Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore' or V/Vm's 'The Death Of Rave', and equally in the transition between 'Barker Spirals' head-fug dub and the teasing disco-tech compressions of 'Nowhen Hooks' leading into the Rephlexian melody of 'Tvash Kwawar' and the psychoacoustic stranding 'Kuang Shaped Prowla'. No doubt, it's hugely recommended to fans of everything from AFX to Markus Schmickler, The Connection Machine or Actress. Mastered and cut by Rashad Becker at D&M, pressed on 140g vinyl and packaged in a pro-press color jacket which itself is housed in a silkscreened pvc sleeve with artwork by Kathryn Politis & Bill Kouligas.\"\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F74508251\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nIf you live in Australia and want to purchase via bank deposit or cash, send me an email through the contact form.","options":[{"id":44353053,"name":"Default","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124937268/-/gamble_dutch.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124937268/-/gamble_dutch.jpg","width":333,"height":323}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6597750,"name":"EXPERIMENTAL / NOISE / INDUSTRIAL","permalink":"experimental-noise-industrial","url":"/category/experimental-noise-industrial"},{"id":6597699,"name":"ELECTRONIC / TECHNO","permalink":"electronic-techno","url":"/category/electronic-techno"},{"id":3691489,"name":"VINYL","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":10362976,"name":"LIFE STINKS I LIKE THE KINKS #1","permalink":"life-stinks-i-like-the-kinks-1","position":120,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/life-stinks-i-like-the-kinks-1","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-05T07:05:31.000Z","description":"<b>The Kinks </b>released, between 1965 and 1969, five exceptional albums from which the bulk of this magazine will be focused upon: <i>The Kink Kontroversy, Face To Face, Something Else, Village Green, Arthur</i>.

It offers a hearing of <b>The Kinks </b>that celebrates their status as outsiders and fuck-ups, for they express all that is sick about life, they concoct crippling tragic scenarios, the hateful, spiteful, miserable, evil, sadistic and cruel cunts that they were transfigured into songs of rare beauty, grace, sensitivity, elevation and power. It is my hope that this will provoke the band to release their merciless grip over my listening, that through excessive ruminations on their more horrific enterprises they might be ruined for me. A cure?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFor the first issue, I’ve taken some easy pieces and attempted to kick them around a little and show you where they bleed. There’s a lot to be said about well-researched journalist practice, about reading references tomes full of the historical event and its verifiable consequence, about knowing the slightest damn thing about your subject beyond a couple of hastily read interviews and throwaway lines in books with music as the general subject...

Five albums… a couple dozen singles… plenty of grist for the mill…\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasure to begin writing the new issue without feeling that I was committing some indecent act. I have the great fortune of having shed the obsession which prompted my first writings on the Kinks, and can write on the subject with a great deal more stability. \r\n\r\nI was cured. I’m not nauseated or paranoid or saturated with stupefied awe upon listening to ‘Big Sky’. The unhealthy impulse toward delight at the malicious qualities of Ray has been replaced with a slight mortification at the confessional quality of Life Stinks I Like The Kinks. \r\n\r\nI persisted because the fantasies expressed in many of these songs were a retreat from an intolerable reality that corresponded strongly with much of the reading that I was doing when I returned from tour with UV and Total Control. I found notes of songs that I would write about here, a certain power of the construction of fantasy as great as any masterful author: the loss of enchantment in the green light on the dock in The Great Gatsby, the urge toward a code of honour that provoked The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea. This is where I grounded my interest for the songs that I write about in this issue: an attempt at elevation from the status of an idiotic brute keeping score on the provocations and malevolence of a 60’s rock band.\r\n\r\nAlso in this issue, a contribution from Douglas P (Death In June) and cover art by Avi Spivak.\r\n\r\nWriting on:\r\n\r\nWONDERBOY\r\nAPEMAN\r\nTOO MUCH ON MY MIND\r\nSITTING BY THE RIVERSIDE\r\nTWO SISTERS\r\nLAVENDER HILL\r\n\r\nDistort subscribers: will be mailed with next Distort issue.","options":[{"id":49180425,"name":"Default","price":3.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128328885/-/kinks2web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128328885/-/kinks2web.jpg","width":640,"height":897}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3523509,"name":"MAG","permalink":"mag","url":"/category/mag"}]},{"id":14334753,"name":"LR  - THE FRAGILITY OF HAPPINESS CS","permalink":"lr-the-fragility-of-happiness-cs","position":122,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lr-the-fragility-of-happiness-cs","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-22T10:54:01.000Z","description":"This is the first full length recording from Loke Rahbek in years, and could best be described as a mix of his two latest releases: The heavy rythmical pieces of ”Brother” and the open ended sketches of  ”The Bull Fighters of Rhonda”.

Moreover, he also ventured into the realm of experimental sound recordings, particularly those of a style often referred to as musique concrète.\r\n\r\nBowles died in November, 1999, in Tangier, Morocco, where he had lived since 1947. Increasingly frail during the last few years of his life, he was unaware that Ramuntcho Matta and Emanuele Carcano had published, in 1998, an experimental piece of his music on Carcano’s Alga Marghen CD label without copyright and misattributed the work to the artist Brion Gysin.\r\n\r\nHowever, the CD, entitled The Pool K III, was composed and performed by Paul Bowles during the late 1950s, and is his most significant and extended creation of musique concrète, a part of his musical oeuvre least-known to his listening audience. It is Paul Bowles' most unfathomable musical work, one not yielding to easy interpretation and unique to even his own wide-ranging catalog of compositions. It is a realm of sound that creates a dreamlike journey without a clear point of origin or destination—a sojourn to be experienced in its entirety, without stopping.\r\n\r\nJon Carlson’s notes set forth all the particulars, followed by additional notes from Irene Herrmann and Jeffrey Miller. This Cadmus Editions/Dom America CD of The Pool K III reproduces the Alga Marghen release and restores the work to the music estate of its rightful author, Paul Bowles.","options":[{"id":48973272,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128178750/-/bowles.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128178750/-/bowles.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6597750,"name":"EXPERIMENTAL / NOISE / INDUSTRIAL","permalink":"experimental-noise-industrial","url":"/category/experimental-noise-industrial"},{"id":6597744,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":14233230,"name":"PHARMAKON - ABANDON LP","permalink":"pharmakon-abandon-lp","position":147,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pharmakon-abandon-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-17T07:08:21.000Z","description":"Sacred Bones: \"Margaret Chardiet was born and raised in New York City She has been making power electronics/death industrial music under the name Pharmakon for five years. As a founding member of the Red Light District collective in Far Rockaway, NY she has been a figurehead in the underground experimental scene since the age of seventeen. She points out that the environment there amongst so many other experimental artists (amongst them Yellow Tears & Haflings) inspired her to keep making increasingly challenging work. She describes her drive to make noise music as something akin to an exorcism where she is able to express, her “deep-seated need/drive/urge/possession to reach other people and make them FEEL something [specifically] in uncomfortable/confrontational ways.” Engineered by Sean Ragon of Cult of Youth at his self-built recording studio Heaven Street, Abandon is Pharmakon’s first proper studio album and also her first widely distributed release.\r\n\r\nUnlike other experimental projects, Pharmakon does not improvise when performing or recording. She is concise and exact; each song/movement is linear with a clear trajectory. Perhaps more than any other style of music, noise is a genre almost exclusively dominated by male performers. Spin Magazine is apt to point out that her,“perfectionism might explain why her recordings are few and far between — a rarity in a scene where noise bros are want to puke out hour after endless hour of stoned basement jams into a limitless stream of limited-edition tapes. Her music may be as cuddly as a trepanning drill, but it’s also just as precise: She glowers in measured silence as often as she shrieks, and every serrated tone cuts straight to the bone, a carefully calibrated interplay between frequency and resistance.” The songs on this album were all written and recorded during a turbulent three month time period during which several fundamental life changes forced her to begin living in a completely new way and in a new space. She describes the lyrical themes of this album as being about, “Loss. Losing everything. Relinquishing control. Complete psychic abandon. Blind leaps of faith into the fire, walking out unscathed. Crawling out of the pit.”\"","options":[{"id":45978426,"name":"Default","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126001155/-/11728.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126001155/-/11728.jpg","width":608,"height":608}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6597750,"name":"EXPERIMENTAL / NOISE / INDUSTRIAL","permalink":"experimental-noise-industrial","url":"/category/experimental-noise-industrial"},{"id":3691489,"name":"VINYL","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":14233041,"name":"PLASMID - S/T EP","permalink":"plasmid-s-t-ep","position":148,"price":6.5,"default_price":6.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/plasmid-s-t-ep","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-10-17T06:44:37.000Z","description":"PLASMID was the pre-HERESY band that only made a tape back in 1983.

And it is in the eagerness to experiment that the project really has its strength, not two releases has ever sounded the same. On “Success” her willingness to explore is presented in its most realised form so far, the album draws inspiration and sound from many different fields.

Here “The Journalist” lends his insights to a reappraisal of the harsher sides of early non-music, be it academic, underground, or decidedly above in nature, and discusses a few works in terms of the birth Hardcore Punk. Plus, a lengthy overview of Scott Foust’s career from the man’s biggest fan, himself, a long talk, rife with informed commentary on topics ranging from inept Japanese Prog. to Taylor Swift, with the duo that compromise what is currently Philadelphia’s most promising musical unit, Good Area, and a brief but poignant internet correspondence with one of Australia’s top exports of broken sound for over a decade strong, Matt Earle.

Those who've encountered his acclaimed albums for Type, or his NNA Tapes split with OPN, will hear a defined progress in 'Vanilla Call Option', whilst those new to his music should be prepared for a visceral, cerebral exploration of piercing timbres and sheer, hi-end computer sounds that in turn recall the evocative beatless treatments on Lee Gamble's incredible 'Diversions' set and Rashad Becker's more recent deviations from linear production templates on his 'Traditional Music Of Notional Species'. The fancier kosmic elements of his previous work are now all but junked in favour of a more subtle, underlying approach to melody giving prominence to experimental, probing psycho-acoustics. It's really one of the most physically affective records we've heard since Florian Hecker's last attempt to shave our inner ear hairs, and conducted with a similarly philosophical logic attempting to construct \"vertical narratives\" from a new language of timing and flight. Yet, whilst there's a rigour and discipline to 'Vanilla Call Option', we'd refrain from labelling it Academic music: there's a playfulness, however obtuse, most literally manifest in the title of 'This Is Chess' (he's a keen player, apparently) which sustains interest beyond any concepts, while the brooding, distant drone symphony, 'Merci cheri', or 'Furniture Music', have an innate emotional value. Ultimately, it's a beguiling record which is likely to perplex and draw reactions, no mean feat in itself, and another fascinating transmission from a label that's on fire right now.\"","options":[{"id":48555387,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127877715/-/rene_hell.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127877715/-/rene_hell.jpg","width":333,"height":333}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6597750,"name":"EXPERIMENTAL / NOISE / INDUSTRIAL","permalink":"experimental-noise-industrial","url":"/category/experimental-noise-industrial"},{"id":6597699,"name":"ELECTRONIC / TECHNO","permalink":"electronic-techno","url":"/category/electronic-techno"}]},{"id":14184207,"name":"ROYAL HEADACHE - S/T LP","permalink":"royal-headache-s-t-lp","position":163,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/royal-headache-s-t-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-15T04:07:48.000Z","description":"WHAT'S THE STORY MORNING GLORY?","options":[{"id":45809514,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125878458/-/Royal-Headache.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125878458/-/Royal-Headache.jpg","width":1344,"height":1360}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6597696,"name":"PUNK / HARDCORE","permalink":"punk-hardcore","url":"/category/punk-hardcore"},{"id":3691489,"name":"VINYL","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":14335098,"name":"RUBY RAY - FROM THE EDGE OF THE WORLD - PHOTO BOOK","permalink":"ruby-ray-from-the-edge-of-the-world-photo-book","position":164,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ruby-ray-from-the-edge-of-the-world-photo-book","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-22T11:26:25.000Z","description":"RUBY RAY - From the Edge of the World: California Punk, 1977-81 Hardcover Book + CD\r\n\r\nS.V. -\"Born in New York, RUBY RAY migrated to San Francisco in the mid-'70s. She entered the underground scene while working at Tower Records in North Beach. When she acquired her first camera, she quickly turned it into a weapon. RAY shot using a Nikon FM and Tri-X 400 film, the fastest film of its time. While documenting new bands and people for Search & Destroy magazine, she wielded her lens like many young DIY artists were brandishing guitars – bold, carefree and absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nAs a fixture on the first wave punk scene, RAY photographed with a stark intimacy. There are candid shots of THE SEX PISTOLS' fateful trip to San Francisco, Darby Crash slashed and bloodied, Exene Cervenka sitting amongst discarded tires like tombstones, and THE AVENGERS' Penelope Houston writhing on stage.\r\n\r\nFrom the introduction by Jon Savage: \"For a brief period, Los Angeles and San Francisco hosted vibrant subcultures that threw up sounds, noises, ideas and images that remain some of the 20th century's most vivid youth statements.

While intensely unpredictable singer Ricky Williams played in other bands such as CRIME and TOILING MIDGETS, THE SLEEPERS were on their own rock-n-roll planet somewhere between punk, post-punk, and psychedelic. As Joe Carducci wrote in Rock And The Pop Narcotic, \"THE SLEEPERS were an awesome powerhouse live. They were an appropriate refinement of THE STOOGES, and what JOY DIVISION might have developed into had they the balls.\"\r\n\r\n1981's Painless Nights is their only album. In fact, it is one of the few full-length LP's to come out of San Francisco during this era. From the opening tracks \"When Can I Fly?\" and \"Walk Away\" (featuring Alex Gibson and Tom Recchion of BPEOPLE), Painless Nights captures THE SLEEPERS' fluid and volatile sound. Guitarist Michael Belfer's (TUXEDOMOON) lofi-textures and incisive riff's serve as perfect counterpoint to Williams' improvisational lyrics. Perhaps if the band had not broken up for the last time soon after its release, this amazing record would be even more known today.\r\n\r\nFirst-time album reissue comes from the original analog source.

There’s fewer moments of expansive, contemplative guitar damage and it’s not as bleak (could there be a hardcore record that expresses the horrible suffering of the nihilistic?), but Society Nurse has that resolve, discipline and determination that characterized Cold Sweat at their peak, imposing the same heartless values with renewed vigor: life without hope, without truth, without an answer or a reason, life as a blind will, pushing against the void, but incapable of effecting it or making it more palatable. Not for children or the elderly, not for those who retreat from the challenge of thwarted ambitions, not for those who indulge delusions of grand purpose and eloquent design. The response to these thoughts pushed through the immediacy of shock and awe is generally madness and mania: this is the sonic accompaniment to losing one’s grip.\r\n\r\nIRON LUNG: \"Art by Matt Adis.

Within a few weeks of their existence they had recorded a promising demo of experimental noisy hardcore, played a few shows in UK and Spain and started working on their debut album. Barely 6 months later they give birth to \"Observant Com el Món es destrueix\". A 9 track LP integrally sang in Catalan and with a psychedelic approach to their previous bands  sound (GLAM/ ATENTADO/ DESTINO FINAL / INVASION/ CROSTA amongst others). Their primative anthems of nature seeking dreams are distorted, repetitive and heavy at times. With their boots firmly stuck in hardcore based while keeping the overall sound free of any boundaries and styles. The artwork by guitarrist  Guillem el Muro reflects the spirit of the album perfectly.

Mixture of crude private press and slick major label recordings; teenage thug sharpie rock, progressive folk musicians playing with and against the strains of bush music traditionalism, Bobb Trimblesque psych-folk, brief glimpses of West Coast singer songwriter beauty, alien flamenco guitar, baroque jazz, Hazlewood aping country artists, and the sound of people missing the mark.

None of the 8 tracks included have been released before on any other format. At a time when the scene is saturated with “Noise Techno” the album is almost celebratory by contrast, balancing caustic licks of distortion and oppressive bass with cleanly mixed synth tones and ricocheting claps in a shell-shocked, surreal soundsphere. WIth production assistance from Juan Mendez (Silent Servant), the album includes the most direct and propulsive Vatican Shadow material yet, continuing an evolutionary shift away from the complex, collage-based narrative of those cassette releases into more visibly direct contact with the listener.

The point was to reverse every punk stereotype and counter the pissweak idea of writing “dumb music” and lack of progression that seemed to dominate punk at the time. Influenced initially by the savage satire and suave of Geza X And The Mommymen, Black Randy And The Metrosquad and Fear to name a few, The Zingers looked far outside the square to take their music elsewhere. Crazed syncopated drumming, annoying guitar turned up to 11, hard driving bass and crude throat peeling vocals create an artificial world only they may populate. Combined with some extra instrumental licks (skinny slapping vibraphone a clear highlight) create a perturbing yet sophisticated concoction. The LP was recorded in 2011 and mixed over long arduous sessions. Sadly, they fell victim to their own concept, creating inner friction over creative control and ceasing the morph into a jazz fusion act that would bring hot fun back to the music industry. Twisted, aloof, unashamedly offensive, cocky, grandiloquent and downright zany, let Randy Richard, Swastika Sweatman, Wild Western and Chingford take you moonlighting through the cactus fields. The long awaited LP by The Zingers comes at you with a clang.\"\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/116816450\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":49265811,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128390445/-/zingers.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128390445/-/zingers.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6597696,"name":"PUNK / HARDCORE","permalink":"punk-hardcore","url":"/category/punk-hardcore"},{"id":6597747,"name":"POST-PUNK / PEACE / WAR","permalink":"post-punk-peace-war","url":"/category/post-punk-peace-war"},{"id":6597741,"name":"PROTO-PUNK / PSYCH / GARAGE","permalink":"proto-punk-psych-garage","url":"/category/proto-punk-psych-garage"},{"id":6597750,"name":"EXPERIMENTAL / NOISE / INDUSTRIAL","permalink":"experimental-noise-industrial","url":"/category/experimental-noise-industrial"},{"id":3691489,"name":"VINYL","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":14233218,"name":"ZOLA JESUS - VERSIONS LP","permalink":"zola-jesus-versions-lp","position":219,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/zola-jesus-versions-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-17T07:07:07.000Z","description":"Sacred Bones - \"On the heels of her Conatus world tour, Nika Roza Danilova was offered an opportunity to perform at one of the most prestigious modern art museums in the world, NY’s Guggenheim. Rather than doing her standard electronic set she decided she wanted to work with a classical composer who could arrange her songs for a quartet. She recruited legendary industrial pioneer JG Thirlwell (Foetus) to do the arrangements, who, since his work as Foetus, has been scoring and composing symphonic arrangements for a variety of projects including currently scoring Adult Swim’s The Venture Bros. series. Thirlwell’s oeuvre runs the gamut from orchestrations, big band, and cathartic noise-rock to abstract electronics, sound sculpture, and chamber music, thus making him the perfect collaborator to help realize Danilova’s vision. Danilova explains her intentions with this album,“Versions is about the bone of the music; taking approximations from past records and turning them inside out. With all framework exposed, the songs are given a new medium in which to evolve and bloom into their own tiny worlds.” Removing the bulk of electronics from these songs gives them the space to breath, thusly opening them up to be received by a much wider audience who perhaps haven’t previously ventured into the techno-pop/industrial arena.\"","options":[{"id":45978399,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126001104/-/Zola-Jesus-Versions.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126001104/-/Zola-Jesus-Versions.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6597747,"name":"POST-PUNK / PEACE / WAR","permalink":"post-punk-peace-war","url":"/category/post-punk-peace-war"},{"id":6597750,"name":"EXPERIMENTAL / NOISE / INDUSTRIAL","permalink":"experimental-noise-industrial","url":"/category/experimental-noise-industrial"},{"id":6597699,"name":"ELECTRONIC / TECHNO","permalink":"electronic-techno","url":"/category/electronic-techno"},{"id":3691489,"name":"VINYL","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":13796472,"name":"ZYANOSE - WHY THERE GRIEVE?
