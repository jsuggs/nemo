There are three Hebrew words that are translated wait. One means to be silent before God. Another implies dependence and expectation. The other is the concept of a servant and his master...an attitude of readiness and obedience. \r\n\r\nSo in today's world where we run and, in fact, are weary, where we walk and do faint, and the wings of our souls are anything but soaring, perhaps if we \"wait\" upon the LORD...if we are silent before Him in utter dependence and expectation with an attitude of readiness and obedience...then we will be able to receive this promise from God. \r\n\r\nThis beautiful pendant is a reminder of that promise. The front is pretty tiffany blue and red paper. The back contains Isaiah 40:31. The two images are sandwiched between two pieces of glass and soldered with lead free silvergleem solder. It is securely sealed but is not waterproof.
