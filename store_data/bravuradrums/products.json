So, the PEOPLES' snare drum was born.  This is a very versatile snare drum, giving you the option of a fatter tone by down tuning and a powerful crack by tuning up.  The PEOPLES' snare drum is currently used by Richard Shell of Triumph and Parade and is featured on their latest album.  It comes in a variety of satin stained finishes and is drowned in chrome hardware.  BRAVURA's contribution to those who drum on a tight budget.
