I chose this name because our little adventerous Hedgie is floating about in a (rather huge!) tea cup with an old Danish design. Looks exceptionally cute on pillowcases and cushions. Pindsvin would also be a great addition to any nursery as wall decoration.\r\n\r\nThe example embroidery of this pattern is my interpretation of the original pattern. I’ve chosen to use a combination of fill stitches and outline stitches. There is info on colours and stitches used, included with this pattern. \r\n\r\nFinished size is about 4 by 4 inches. But you can also adjust the size of the pattern to suit your own needs. Whatever you do, you will have a lovely Pindsvin embroidery in the end!\r\n\r\nWith your pattern you will receive the original version and a mirrored version of the pattern for easy transferring. I've also written a few stitch suggestions for this pattern.\r\n\r\nThis pattern will be available as a download after your purchase.
