They are made with double soles for added coziness. Perfect for those days you want to just wrap up in a fluffy duvet, drink hot tea and read in a window seat.

They're a perfect treat for yourself, your best girl friend, your mothers, sisters, aunts, grandmothers, wives, and daughters!\r\n\r\nNotes and Tips:\r\n- US women's sizes 5-10 are currently available. If you are a half size, we recommend ordering the size below the half - i.e. if you are a size 6.5, we recommend ordering a size 6.\r\n\r\n- To care for your slippers, simply wash in the washing machine in lukewarm water and dry in the dryer. As with most crochet slippers that contain cotton, after they've been worn a few times, they may feel like they have stretched a bit.
