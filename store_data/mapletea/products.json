I can customise the design shown for your wedding details, and you can get it printed yourself (using digital printing, or letterpress printing for example). Different colour combinations and different fonts can be used.\r\n\r\nCOST: \r\n£50.00 GBP for 2 options and 2 revisions. \r\n£74.00 GBP for 2 options and 5 revisions.\r\n\r\nTO BUY: \r\nPlease purchase using this listing; before I can begin I will also need to be emailed with this information: \r\n- Will you get these letterpress printed or digitally printed?

I can customise the design shown for your wedding details, and you can get it printed yourself (using digital printing, or letterpress printing for example). Different colour combinations and different fonts can be used.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Letterpress printing as well as design is also available. Please look at the 'Letterpress' section in this shop for listings that include both design and print.\r\n\r\nCOST: \r\n£50.00 GBP for 2 options and 2 revisions. \r\n£74.00 GBP for 2 options and 5 revisions.\r\n\r\nTO BUY: \r\nPlease purchase using this listing; before I can begin I will also need to be emailed with this information: \r\n- Will you get these letterpress printed or digitally printed? I need to know this so I can format the designs correctly. \r\n- Do you have any colour preferences? \r\n- If you prefer one of the fonts shown in the photos, let me know \r\n- Please give an email address so I can send files in different formats \r\n- Supply final version of text to go on your invitations \r\n- Which size would you prefer - 95x95mm; 105x105mm or 120x120mm?\r\n\r\nA note on size: \r\nYou may want to check before you order what size will be most convenient - in your region what are the standard sizes, and will you be able to find envelopes that fit your design? In the UK and Europe, ISO system sizing is prevalent (A6 size paper with C6 envelopes will be by far the easiest option allowing you a wide range of envelope options). I cannot proceed with a design until I know the size you need.\r\n\r\nFAQs: \r\nFor more information on pricing, delivery, turnaround times and the ordering process, please visit www.mapletea.co.uk/faqs\r\n\r\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\n\r\nHOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?: \r\n- I will respond within 3 working days of payment with a first draft, as long as all details have been supplied.\r\n\r\nView more Wedding Stationery design options - http://bit.ly/TLeGh1\r\n\r\nMore wedding stationery photos here - http://bit.ly/UvX8Zx\r\n\r\nFor a bespoke design (unique and designed from scratch to your specifications), please email me at mapleteapress@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nEmail me at mapleteapress@gmail.com for more information.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, you may find the answers in my SHOP FAQS - http://www.mapletea.co.uk/faqs\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGallery (archive of letterpress jobs) -- http://bit.ly/S03yis\r\n\r\nTumblr blog: http://mapletea.tumblr.com/\r\n\r\n© 2013 Maple Tea, all rights reserved.","options":[{"id":43479270,"name":"2 designs, 2 revisions","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43479273,"name":"2 designs, up to 5 revisions","price":74.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128098917/-/JONAS__pearl_DESIGN_ONLY.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128098917/-/JONAS__pearl_DESIGN_ONLY.png","width":850,"height":587},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124297515/-/wedding_stationery_set_fidelia_web_mapletea.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124297515/-/wedding_stationery_set_fidelia_web_mapletea.jpg","width":907,"height":605},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124297512/-/Taylor___Carlo_closeup.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124297512/-/Taylor___Carlo_closeup.jpg","width":739,"height":589},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124297506/-/Pearl_wedding_white_closeup_web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124297506/-/Pearl_wedding_white_closeup_web.jpg","width":907,"height":605},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124297500/-/Jonas2_wedding_invite_mapletea.co.uk.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124297500/-/Jonas2_wedding_invite_mapletea.co.uk.jpg","width":850,"height":567}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2703951,"name":"Weddings","permalink":"weddings","url":"/category/weddings"}]},{"id":11333832,"name":"Blind debossed (inkless) Save the Date Cards","permalink":"blind-debossed-inkless-save-the-date-cards","position":10,"price":85.5,"default_price":85.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/blind-debossed-inkless-save-the-date-cards","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-23T14:29:16.000Z","description":"Your save the date message (a maximum of four lines of text) blind debossed onto high quality thick cotton card.\r\n\r\nCard stock used: 425gsm 100% cotton, natural white, US-A5 size (89x124mm or 3.5 x 4.9 inches)\r\n\r\nPrinted by hand on a vintage press.\r\n\r\nPRICING:\r\n£1.90 each for the printed save the date cards, and 50p each for the accompanying envelopes.\r\n*** Order minimum of 45 items ***\r\neg.45 x save the dates without envelopes = £85.50\r\n\r\nENVELOPES:\r\nEnvelopes are available upon request (either jade green or brown kraft recycled), these cost an additional £0.50 each.

I can customise the design shown for your wedding details, and you can get it printed yourself (using digital printing, or letterpress printing for example). Different colour combinations and different fonts can be used.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Letterpress printing as well as design is also available. Please look at the 'Letterpress' section in this shop for listings that include both design and print.For now, I offer design services only.\r\n\r\nCOST:\r\n£50.00 GBP for 2 options and 2 revisions.\r\n£74.00 GBP for 2 options and 5 revisions.\r\n\r\nTO BUY:\r\nPlease purchase using this listing; before I can begin I will also need to be emailed with this information:\r\n- Will you get these letterpress printed or digitally printed? I need to know this so I can format the designs correctly.\r\n- Do you have any colour preferences?\r\n- If you prefer one of the fonts shown in the photos, let me know\r\n- Please give an email address so I can send files in different formats\r\n- Supply final version of text to go on your invitations\r\n- Dimensions required, for example A6 size, or 3x5 inches.\r\n\r\nA note on size:\r\nYou may want to check before you order what size will be most convenient - in your region what are the standard sizes, and will you be able to find envelopes that fit your design? In the UK and Europe, ISO system sizing is prevalent (A6 size paper with C6 envelopes will be by far the easiest option allowing you a wide range of envelope options). I cannot proceed with a design until I know the size you need.\r\n\r\nFAQs:\r\nFor more information on pricing, delivery, turnaround times and the ordering process, please visit www.mapletea.co.uk/faqs \r\n\r\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\n\r\nHOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?:\r\n- I will respond within 3 working days of payment with a first draft, as long as all details have been supplied.\r\n\r\nView more Wedding Stationery design options - http://bit.ly/TLeGh1 \r\n\r\nMore wedding stationery photos here - http://bit.ly/UvX8Zx\r\n\r\nFor a bespoke design (unique and designed from scratch to your specifications), please email me at mapleteapress@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nEmail me at mapleteapress@gmail.com for more information.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, you may find the answers in my SHOP FAQS - http://www.mapletea.co.uk/faqs\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGallery (archive of letterpress jobs) -- http://bit.ly/S03yis\r\n\r\nTumblr blog: http://mapletea.tumblr.com/\r\n\r\n© 2013 Maple Tea, all rights reserved.","options":[{"id":43478940,"name":"2 options, up to 2 revisions","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43478943,"name":"2 options, up to 5 revisions","price":74.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128098959/-/AINSLEY_DESIGN_ONLY.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128098959/-/AINSLEY_DESIGN_ONLY.png","width":850,"height":720},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124297236/-/Ains_closeup_letterpress_mapletea.co.uk.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124297236/-/Ains_closeup_letterpress_mapletea.co.uk.jpg","width":850,"height":638},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124297242/-/letterpress_wedding_invite_Ains_mapletea.co.uk.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124297242/-/letterpress_wedding_invite_Ains_mapletea.co.uk.jpg","width":850,"height":618}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2703951,"name":"Weddings","permalink":"weddings","url":"/category/weddings"},{"id":6622761,"name":"Design Only","permalink":"design-only","url":"/category/design-only"}]},{"id":7795491,"name":"Boxed Luxury Writing Set - 'Vertigo'","permalink":"luxury-stationery-gift-set-vertigo-letterpress-printed-notecards-envelopes-and-cahier-notebook","position":18,"price":29.0,"default_price":29.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/luxury-stationery-gift-set-vertigo-letterpress-printed-notecards-envelopes-and-cahier-notebook","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-02T10:15:50.000Z","description":"A letterpress printed stationery set including notecards and a moleskine notebook.

The title means \"Cliffs Above\".\r\n\r\nThis is a unique, hand-stitched book made with high quality archival, acid-free cartridge paper suitable for using as a notebook or a sketchbook. I use quality 130gsm Snowdon cartridge paper (from Shepherds Bookbinders in London), so the books can be used as sketchbooks if desired.\r\n\r\nIt is 12 cm x 8.5 cm in size, and has approximately 128 pages. The dust jacket features a faded pink palm tree design and the book is bound in red leather embossed with silver. The front and back flyleaf feature the original red and white design. This is a really unique little book with a Mid Century / Modernismo look, ideal for anyone who loves antique or unusual books. This edition is from 1963.\r\n\r\nI only use vintage books whose pages were previously damaged or missing.\r\n\r\n// Order by 17 Dec for Christmas (UK delivery) // \r\n\r\n>>FOR MORE PHOTOS and examples of similar items and customised notebooks that I have made, visit - https://picasaweb.google.com/100481729012170833347 or http://picasaweb.google.com/100481729012170833347 <<<<\r\n\r\nFollow me at: http://mapletea.tumblr.com/\r\n\r\n© Carly Jeffrey 2011.\r\n\r\nCopyright is not transferable with the sale of this item.
