Signed and dated on the front and back. The painting is sold in a simple natural wood frame.\r\n\r\nThe painting will be exhibited from November 6th - 27th, in the upcoming Cultural Arts Council of Douglasville 25th National Juried Competition. Juried by Angela Nichols, Director of Programming at the Hudgens Center for the Arts, Duluth, GA.\r\n\r\nIt may be available in early December and you may reserve it now; I will attach a NFS label on the work during the exhibition. Price reflects a 25% commission.\r\n\r\nThis painting was also shown at the Academy of Fine Arts, Lynchburg, VA this spring. Juried by George Billis, owner George Billis Galleries in NYC and LA. \r\n\r\nI made this panel myself - the masonite backing is rigid and heavier than most commercial panels. \r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\nI've sold hundreds of my original paintings, drawings and prints online, and you may buy with confidence.
