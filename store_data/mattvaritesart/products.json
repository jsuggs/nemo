It was where I caught my first wave, and where my love for surfing grew. \r\n\r\nOur beloved barrier island was devastated during Hurricane Sandy. Destroying the boardwalk, homes, vehicles, and infrastructure.  \r\n\r\nI'm calling this piece first wave, and donating 100% of all proceeds directly to Rebuild Barrier Islands and Rebuild Seaside Heights, and Restore the Shore. \r\n\r\n\r\nPrints still available!\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\"><tr><td align=\"center\"></td></tr><tr><td align=\"center\"><a href=\"#\" title=\"How PayPal Works\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open('https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-popup','WIPaypal','toolbar=no, location=no, directories=no, status=no, menubar=no, scrollbars=yes, resizable=yes, width=700, height=600');\"><img src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/mktg/logo/AM_mc_vs_dc_ae.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"PayPal Acceptance Mark\"></a></td></tr></table>","options":[{"id":25435056,"name":"11x14","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/79233213/-/first_wave.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/79233213/-/first_wave.JPG","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
