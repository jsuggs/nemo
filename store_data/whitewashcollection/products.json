This piece incorporates elements of both draping & tailoring to provide a beautiful intersection of these different forms of construction. Asymmetrical in cut & style, this vest features a one-button closure, at which the right side shows off its unique \"lapel.\" Shorter in the back, than in the front, this piece gives the wearer a wonderful shape. This piece will fit a women's size S. Wear it out over your favorite tee & you've got an outfit like no other! 100% Linen. Color is a blue-grey charcoal, with a textured weave.
