Also functioning like a breast, the non-free-flow nipple design means your baby has to actually latch onto the nipple and suckle in order to produce the milk. This replicates the breastfeeding experience like no other bottle on the market.\r\n\r\nThe bottles are easy to open and clean, and are top rack dishwasher safe. Integrated venting also helps prevent colic, and the bottle has a skid free base for those hard one-handed refills. \r\n\r\nAll mimijumi baby bottles are BPA and latex free, EA free, and exceed all Australian safety standards. mimijumi really is the Next Breast Thing.”\r\n","options":[{"id":47104317,"name":"The VERY HUNGRY is 240ml – $29.99","price":29.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47104320,"name":"The NOT SO HUNGRY is 120ml - $27.99 ","price":27.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":47104323,"name":"Twin Nipple Packs – $27.99","price":27.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":48773400,"name":"The Set - (3 Pieces)","price":84.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126811725/-/Mimilg_(2).jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126811725/-/Mimilg_(2).jpg","width":132,"height":250},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126811740/-/Mimimed_(2).jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126811740/-/Mimimed_(2).jpg","width":139,"height":214},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126811761/-/replacements.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126811761/-/replacements.png","width":194,"height":259}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6557484,"name":"Mimijumi - Revolutionary Baby Feeding Bottle","permalink":"mimijumi-revolutionary-baby-feeding-bottle","url":"/category/mimijumi-revolutionary-baby-feeding-bottle"}]},{"id":13034037,"name":"Blooming Bath Puddle Wash Cloths ","permalink":"blooming-bath-puddle-wash-cloths","position":2,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/blooming-bath-puddle-wash-cloths","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-18T15:43:39.000Z","description":"If the Blooming bath was a cake, this would be the icing!! \r\n\r\nEach Puddle Washcloth is 100% handmade from the plush polyester remnants of a Blooming Bath product, meaning they're individual and unique - no two are the same!
