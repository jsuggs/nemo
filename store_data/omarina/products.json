Our lucky in love talisman.\r\n\r\nHistory:  \"Lover’s eyes\" are one of the most captivating pieces of jewellery from the Georgian period. Believed to have begun with the Prince of Wales in the late 18th century and his secret lover, Mrs. Fitzherbert who exchanged eye miniature portraits rather than full miniatures so they both would have “anonymous” love tokens to cherish. (The bearers being the only one who could identify the sitter!)\r\nThis charming custom took hold and the aristocracy and wealthy soon began exchanging these tokens of love and affection. The fashion lasted from late 1790 until around 1825. Most take the form of brooches - like this one. They are often of women’s eyes which leads one to believe that ultimately they may have been given as tokens of affection for sisters and friends, as these brooches were not commonly worn by men. In fact, very few male eyes are found at all!\r\n\r\nImage trapped inside thick domed glass in the Georgian 'miniature lover's eye portrait' style.\r\n\r\nBrooch frame and clasp are both in matching 'antique bronze' finish metal.\r\n\r\nHand made by us, here in the OMARINA studio.

Believed to have begun with the Prince of Wales in the late 18th century and his secret lover, Mrs. Fitzherbert who exchanged eye miniature portraits rather than full miniatures so they both would have “anonymous” love tokens to cherish. (The bearers being the only one who could identify the sitter!)\r\n\r\nThis charming custom took hold and the aristocracy and wealthy began exchanging these types of tokens of love and affection. The fashion lasted from the late 1790’s though to about 1825. Most take the form of brooches - like this one. They are also often of women’s eyes which leads one to believe that ultimately they may have been given as tokens of affection for sisters and friends, as these brooches were not worn by men. In fact, very few male eyes are found at all! \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":27114813,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.99,"amount_with_others":1.99}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/85005009/-/P1390655.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/85005009/-/P1390655.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/85005021/-/P1390836.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/85005021/-/P1390836.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/85005078/-/P1390835.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/85005078/-/P1390835.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4238493,"name":"OMARINA","permalink":"omarina","url":"/category/omarina"},{"id":4249824,"name":"Under £10","permalink":"under-10","url":"/category/under-10"}]},{"id":8597244,"name":"\"The Polytitians\" Original Artwork on Cardboard","permalink":"the-polytitians-original-artwork-on-cardboard","position":33,"price":250.0,"default_price":250.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-polytitians-original-artwork-on-cardboard","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-18T01:29:23.000Z","description":"14 x 19\" \r\n(Framed) \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":26990982,"name":"Default","price":250.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":9.99,"amount_with_others":4.99}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84574233/-/__framed__250.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84574233/-/__framed__250.jpg","width":720,"height":496}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4238508,"name":"OMAR ZINGARO BHATIA","permalink":"omar-zingaro-bhatia","url":"/category/omar-zingaro-bhatia"},{"id":4238328,"name":"£200 - £300","permalink":"200-300","url":"/category/200-300"}]},{"id":8641614,"name":"Vintage College Emblem Blazer Patch in Black Felt with Gold / Silver / Red and Black embroidery.","permalink":"vintage-college-emblem-blazer-patch-in-black-felt-with-gold-silver-red-and-black-embroidery","position":34,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/vintage-college-emblem-blazer-patch-in-black-felt-with-gold-silver-red-and-black-embroidery","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-21T01:02:06.000Z","description":"65mm x 45mm\r\n\r\n\"Always keep your pencel sharp - and rubber at the ready!\".\r\n(Old OMARINA college motto)\r\n\r\nCurrently FREE UK mainland economy postage!\r\n\r\n(If you're in Glasgow and would like to collect in person, just email us immediately after checkout to arrange.)\r\n\r\nImages by OMARINA.
