You can do circular motions or up and down. Make sure you do this gently in the beginning as you are yet not used to it. The dirt and the dead skin cells will start coming off. Do not use soap during this process. Once you have scrubbed your entire face, rinse off with cold water to shrink your pores down.\r\nYou can now raise the temparature and soap up in the temperature you desire. Your skin cells die every seven days. Do not use Kese more than once a week. Exfoliating with Kese will help your skin be free of any growths, help circulate blood better.
