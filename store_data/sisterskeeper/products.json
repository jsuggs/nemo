My daughter decided to shampoo her own hair this morning (she's 11) without me being prepared to style it when she finished. I got out of bed and noticed her hair was wet, and got an instant attitude. I was NOT prepared to do hair right then. I knew that her hair needed to be managed right away, or else she and I would be crying when I finished. I don't like heat on our hair, so that made it a challenge to manage as well. I remembered that I had just purchased the hair butter and thought this would be the perfect time to test it out. I detangled and bantu knotted my daughter's hair within an hour!!! That is unheard of for us :D Her hair is moisturized without being greasy and it shines! Needless to say, I will be purchasing the large size very soon of So Chic Hair Butter.
