word hip-hop should not be tossed around lightly when talking about the duo of Pace Won & Mr. Green. The Newark tag team of DJ (Mr. Green) and MC (Pace Won) have a profound love for making hardcore hip-hop. The group claims that the likes of Gangstarr and Eric B. & Rakim inspired them to keep it real when fakeness is on the rise. Immaculate lyrics lain down by Pace Won perfectly complement Mr. Green s unique classical style of production. The duo has already created a buzz through their single Children Sing and seemingly more will come if the group makes a strong first push into the hearts of underground hip-hop fans. This awaited push may come in the form of their LP, The Only Color that Matters is Green. The introductory track Four Quarters shows Mr. Green s abilities as a producer by combining gritty violin strings with a simple drum line. Pace Won takes this opportunity to introduce himself to the mic with the hook, White Collar/Blue Collar/I Holla/You Holla/ Let s get together four quarters makes a dolla, explaining that all different people can come together to make music. This kind of substance is found throughout the rest of the album. The next track that happens to be their single Children Sing portrays the come up of the two, explaining that they are finally starting to get things together in their lives through making their music. To contrast this come up story is the song Let A Shot Go. Pace Won goes to the other extent by laying down cold lyrics straight from the streets explaining that he will do anything to get to where he needs to. The next track that relates to this style of a go-getter is the song I Need Money. This track samples the all too familiar line from the Junior Mafia track Get Money to set the tone of a go-getter s story. Pace Won uniquely puts a twist on this explaining how he needs money and the fantasies that would come with this cash. The duo then goes in a different direction with the lighter track She Be So Cold. Light symbols with a harsh but steady piano key hit combine to make a nicely laced track by Mr. Green. Pace Won explains the troubles of a relationship with catchy lines like, And even under/The spell that I was under/I wonder why she always called me from a block number. Each track pieces together to lead up to what I feel was the strongest song on the entire album, Hip Hop. This track seems to be an overview of the entire album in its own sense. Each element of the album from the dubs and ice to the M-I-C is equally explained through the one word that pushes the group to be hardcore, hip-hop. Pace Won explains what hip-hop is to the group through his lyrics while Mr. Green explains through the earthly classical beat. To tie everything together is the final track The Joker which utilizes an unearthly beat along with a whining electric guitar riff. Pace Won makes a joke into punch lines to finish off his lyrical massacre on the rest of the album. Between simplistic yet substance filled lyrics from Pace Won and the classical and gritty tracks by Mr. Green it is hard not to see success in the future of this duo. Only time will tell if the Newark natives can hold up in the game. This LP is more than a push into the game and will only be material for them to ride on into a successful career. Not giving this album a few listens would be a hate crime to real underground hip-hop.\" -ArtofRhyme.com","options":[{"id":13108186,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38430744/-/PaceWonMRGreene.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38430744/-/PaceWonMRGreene.jpg","width":393,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1823225,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":6853665,"name":"POSTER \"The Only Number That Matters is Won\"","permalink":"the-only-number-that-matters-is-won-poster","position":9,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-only-number-that-matters-is-won-poster","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-08-01T22:02:02.000Z","description":"Promo poster for \"The Only Number That Matters is Won\" \r\nby Pacewon and Mr. Green","options":[{"id":21741807,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67275661/-/536643_483197125025143_201556472_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67275661/-/536643_483197125025143_201556472_n.jpg","width":612,"height":612}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1823229,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":5561177,"name":"\"LIve from the Streets\" PROMO PACK ","permalink":"live-from-the-streets-promo-pack","position":10,"price":1.0,"default_price":1.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/live-from-the-streets-promo-pack","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-27T06:55:53.000Z","description":"\"Live from the Streets\"...
