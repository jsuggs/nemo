The record focuses on the entire Coffeeshower 14 year career, from their first lo-fi recordings in the veins of 90's core to their more recent rock style with punk roots, sharing with you the good, the bad and the ugly and putting together all on one album their very rare first ep's, the songs from their 2004 split cd with the Dutch band Dependent and 6 unreleased songs, two of them recorded exclusively for this release. A must-have item for all insane punk rock collectors and a special gift for all longtime Coffeeshower fans.
