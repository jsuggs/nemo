Each album in the project will delve into a specific concept or trait that makes up Joey Arroyo's musical persona. The goal of the \"Is...\" collection is to show how a musician can exercise their right to diversity while still provide a distinct and recognizable sound. This challenge will drive our creative abilities to lengths that our audience will appreciate and will develop an experience that will keep the music constantly flowing for the fans.\r\n\r\n\"Aggressive\" is comprised of songs that span across many harder hitting genres. What was especially exciting about this album is that we weren't solely focusing on making it heavy, but rather trying to bring a more in your face angle to the Singer/Songwriter world. We took influences from Southern Rock all the way to Hardcore and Metal yet thoughtfully intertwined them with our soulful approach. The end result is an album that I believe really sets us apart from other artists of our style; A noticeably experimental record that stretches the capabilities of what is considered catchy.","options":[{"id":5229651,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/13435061/-/Agressive-Cover-color-corrected.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/13435061/-/Agressive-Cover-color-corrected.jpg","width":970,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":225451,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":274058,"name":"Joey Arroyo Is...The Storyteller","permalink":"joey-arroyo-is-the-storyteller","position":2,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/joey-arroyo-is-the-storyteller","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-04-08T19:11:54.000Z","description":"This CD is the first of six releases for the \"Joey Arroyo Is...\" project.

What's ironic about storytelling is that it is likely much more personal than even an autobiography. They are often told to express the deepest emotions and experiences that the author finds are more comfortably expressed vicariously through the eyes of a fictional character. I believe that stories are even easier to put yourself in the character's shoes and learn something you may not have discovered about yourself before...So go discover something.","options":[{"id":1150213,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2038533/-/storyteller-cover-292x300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2038533/-/storyteller-cover-292x300.jpg","width":292,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":225451,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":2217961,"name":"The Joey Arroyo Band at The Hard Rock Cafe","permalink":"the-joey-arroyo-band-at-the-hard-rock-cafe","position":3,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-joey-arroyo-band-at-the-hard-rock-cafe","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-04-03T20:14:41.000Z","description":"Come rock out with The JAB at the famous Hard Rock Cafe in Phoenix, AZ.
