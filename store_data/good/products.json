When birds fly south for winter and salmon swim upstream to spawn, they are acting on a genetically coded imperative. When the human animal migrates, it’s not often instinctual. It is a daring foray into the unknown across lines, real and imagined. “It’s the journey, not the destination” is a sentiment that has inspired many a road trip and epic poem. But it’s not the journey, either. It’s the decision to take the journey, the impulse toward discovery. If there is one imperative we share with our finned and feathered friends, it is this: evolve or die. When we are free to move and adapt and change, we thrive.\r\n\r\n<b>Get even more bang for your buck...</b>\r\n\r\nThis issue is available in the <a href=\"http://shop.good.is/product/good-magazine-catch-up-bundle\">GOOD Catch Up bundle</a>:  $15 for our latest 3 issues.

That which can be counted and measured.  Incontrovertible truths.  As our collective obsession with data has intensified, so, too has our faith in numbers.  In the digital era, we're all data-hoarders, armchair statisticians who believe that the more we have, the more accurate our view of the world will be.  We've come to rely on the data, convinced that they reveal things about us that mere human observation cannot.  And in some cases, that's true.  Our expanded ability to track and quantify has yielded new insights into who we are.  But the data alone can't tell the whole story.\r\n\r\nWhen we search the numbers, we find reflections of ourselves, glimmers of the world we live in and the lives we lead.  We may learn immense amounts from this data, but make no mistake: Our search is what gives it meaning.

And as much as any city in the world, it's a product of the 20th century, from its infrastructure to its industries to its insistence on doing everything it does with the help of a car.  The challenges facing L.A. are the same as those facing any city in the developed world- just more so.\r\n\r\nIn this edition of GOOD, we study critical issues facing global cities by looking through the lens of Los Angeles.

But when inveterate wanderer Hans Christian Andersen wrote “To roam the roads of lands remote, to travel is to live,” he didn’t mean cruise ships and high-walled resorts. Vacations are nice, but they’re not the same thing as traveling: wandering through marketplaces, sampling food of indeterminate origin, and, most important, meeting new people. It’s an old-fashioned but effective way to remind us that we’re all in this together. Certainly, we would all be better off right now if a few people in the Pentagon had spent a little more time drinking tea with locals in Iraq. \r\n\r\nThis doesn’t require a transcontinental flight—a New Yorker could learn as much from a trip to Kansas as to India. All we require is a willingness to break out of the bubbles most of us live in, to be shocked and moved and a little bit scared.

After years of failure, the moon seemed far beyond reach. And yet, eight years later, Neil Armstrong took his first lunar steps.\r\n\r\nIt’s hard to imagine a recent U.S. administration making such a bold pledge (let alone succeeding), but countless people, organizations, and companies are working to come up with the next big idea that will reshape our world. Though many will fail, it is the striving and struggling to make real the seemingly impossible—“Pushing the outside of the envelope,” as NASA’s first astronauts liked to say—that leads us to watershed events.

In the following pages, we've collected a handful of people and ideas that represent media excellence:  what it has been, what it is, and what it can be.\r\n\r\nIncludes \"The 51 Best Magazines Ever\" and a custom set of \"Media Mogul All Stars\" trading cards.\r\n\r\n<b>Get even more bang for your buck...</b>\r\n\r\nThis issue is also available in the <a href=\"http://shop.good.is/product/good-s-first-year-5-limited-edition-issues\">GOOD's First Year bundle</a>:  $65 for 5 issues","options":[{"id":9086821,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":8.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/24680530/-/issue-003.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/24680530/-/issue-003.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1536795,"name":"Magazines","permalink":"magazines","url":"/category/magazines"}]},{"id":2563182,"name":"Issue 002: Change is Good","permalink":"good-issue-002","position":46,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/good-issue-002","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-05-07T02:11:49.000Z","description":"We inherited a broken future, so we're building a better one.\r\n\r\nIncludes \"Sleeping with Strangers\", an investigation of CouchSurfing.com; \"The Big List of New Year's Resolutions\"; and the GOOD Guide to Culture Jamming, a guide to methods of cultural disobedience.  \r\n\r\n<b>Get even more bang for your buck...</b>\r\n\r\nThis issue is also available in the <a href=\"http://shop.good.is/product/good-s-first-year-5-limited-edition-issues\">GOOD's First Year bundle</a>:  $65 for 5 issues","options":[{"id":9086811,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":8.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/24680506/-/issue-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/24680506/-/issue-2.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1536795,"name":"Magazines","permalink":"magazines","url":"/category/magazines"}]},{"id":2563113,"name":"Issue 001: I ♥ America","permalink":"good-issue-001","position":47,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/good-issue-001","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-05-07T01:37:53.000Z","description":"__________ like you give a damn. \r\n\r\nGOOD's first issue ever. \r\n\r\n\"I ♥ America.\"  Depending upon your perspective (or perhaps your zip code), that's either an ironic statement, full of doubt and self-loathing, or it's an earnestly patriotic one, imbued with the certainty of American infallibility.
