It is a story about his physical battle, his emotional pain, his opposition to dying, and his fear of the unknown. The four movements represent four nightmares: the man dreams these nightmares over the course of the last four days of his life. Each song is supposed to represent different aspects of these four nightmares.\r\n\r\nWith scattered clips of spoken audio as well as distinctive noises and sampled instruments thoughout, this album makes for a both interesting and evocative listen.\r\n\r\nIf you are hearing the band for the first time, Affiliates The is a one man band heavily influenced by Ooioo, Black Flag, and Wolf Parade. Most of the musical endeavors of this electroacoustic outfit are massively lengthy albums, such as The Return, which present stories through expressive sounds and complex musical phrases.","options":[{"id":11725390,"name":"Digital Download","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12710734,"name":"Physical Album","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/34391290/-/zWARAWARAcovfin.PNG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/34391290/-/zWARAWARAcovfin.PNG","width":591,"height":591}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1979760,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":3485932,"name":"Crow Chief \"Skeleton\" DIGITAL","permalink":"crow-chief-skeleton-digital-cd","position":5,"price":2.5,"default_price":2.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/crow-chief-skeleton-digital-cd","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-03-26T00:14:16.000Z","description":"Crow Chief is an experiment in electronics, percussion, and ambience.\r\n\r\nThis debut sounds like Kit Clayton or the band The Knife.","options":[{"id":11725488,"name":"Digital Download","price":2.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12710820,"name":"Physical Album","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36530652/-/crow1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36530652/-/crow1.jpg","width":478,"height":478}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1979760,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
