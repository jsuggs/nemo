Solid vintage synth work and body-rockin’ drum beats make it a sheer delight, and among the gems on this EP are the entrancing and dance-inducing Lucky Charm and Crystals.\r\n\r\nThe EP is also a shout-out to the East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh where each member cultivated their sound. Be on the lookout for more from this trio of Boogie makers who are always in pursuit of the funk.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-style:italic; font-size:12px;\">RSR-SE1ENE</span>","options":[{"id":14292865,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/42522929/-/eastllibertyquartersep_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/42522929/-/eastllibertyquartersep_1.jpg","width":400,"height":400},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/42522937/-/eastllibertyquartersep_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/42522937/-/eastllibertyquartersep_2.jpg","width":400,"height":400}],"artists":[{"id":79547,"name":"East Liberty Quarters","permalink":"east-liberty-quarters","url":"/artist/east-liberty-quarters"}],"categories":[{"id":2405073,"name":"-Music","permalink":"music","url":"/category/music"},{"id":2405079,"name":"--12\" LP","permalink":"12-lp","url":"/category/12-lp"}]},{"id":4346643,"name":"TJTC & Boogie Arkestra EP","permalink":"the-jupiter-tuning-center-boogie-arkestra-ep","position":3,"price":9.0,"default_price":9.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-jupiter-tuning-center-boogie-arkestra-ep","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-08-30T19:43:04.000Z","description":"Second release from Pittsburgh's Rotating Souls Records features Boogie Arkestra and Jupiter Tuning Centre. This 4 track EP is an eclectic mix of Disco, Boogie, Jazz-funk, and House sounds. \"Vodka Sour\", which starts off the EP, is a prime time stormer that is a tribute to jazz-funk keys and crunchy percussion. \"Tunnelwhip\" is the perfect complement to Vodka Sour; funky jazz guitar with a touch of class. On the Flip is \"Love & Fashion\" which takes elements of boogie, brazil, and detroit house, great for those late night dance affairs. Topping it all of is \"Don't Forget\" a sleazy slo-mo spacey-disco tune with big disco string sounds, thick basslines and honey smoked disco vocals. get in quick before they are gone!<br /> <br />\r\n\r\n<em>RSR-2YLIDIOMPH</em>","options":[{"id":14292789,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/42522953/-/JupiterTuningCenterBoogieArkestraEP_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/42522953/-/JupiterTuningCenterBoogieArkestraEP_1.jpg","width":400,"height":400},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/42522981/-/JupiterTuningCenterBoogieArkestraEP_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/42522981/-/JupiterTuningCenterBoogieArkestraEP_2.jpg","width":400,"height":400}],"artists":[{"id":79659,"name":"The Jupiter Tuning Center / Boogie Arkestra","permalink":"the-jupiter-tuning-center-boogie-arkestra","url":"/artist/the-jupiter-tuning-center-boogie-arkestra"}],"categories":[{"id":2405073,"name":"-Music","permalink":"music","url":"/category/music"},{"id":2405079,"name":"--12\" LP","permalink":"12-lp","url":"/category/12-lp"}]}]
