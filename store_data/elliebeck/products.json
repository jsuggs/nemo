The scratched up boards and original graphics make each piece unique.\r\n\r\nThe colours of each board differ depending on the brand and design of each skate company. Most skateboards are made from 7ply of Canadian Maple, and the rainbow colours are the way they're made!\r\n\r\nOur bracelets are cut to different sizes, to suit different wrist sizes. If you require assistance with sizing of your bracelet, please contact us. We have a regular (inside diameter is approx 65mm) and a large (inside diameter is approx 72mm).\r\n\r\nWe sell our bracelets based on the plain block colour on one side. The other side generally has scratched up images from the graphics on the skateboard. Please choose what main colour you would like, and we will select the backing images for you. It's a wonderful lucky dip! \r\n\r\nIf the colour you want is listed as out of stock, please contact us as we may have some more or can custom cut a colour for you.\r\n\r\nThe bracelets come in their own stitched paper bags, with care instructions. \r\n\r\nPAYMENT OPTIONS - Our webstore is set up to take payment via PayPal.

Each one is slightly different in size and shape, as well as the colours. This unusual method of sanding away the layers shows off the skateboards at their best - hi-lighting the colours and different ply. \r\n\r\nFinished with an antique-look chain, these triangles make a statement piece around your neck without weighing you down. Chain measures approx 55cm - custom lengths available, request in checkout. \r\n\r\nEach piece is crafted by hand and finished with an water-based solvent free coating to bring out the shine and protect your necklace from everyday wear. \r\n\r\nComes with a recycled paper pouch, stitched by us, and care instructions. \r\n\r\nCOLOURS AVAILABLE:\r\n#1 - Rainbow Shard - on left of last image\r\n#2 - Yellow & Blue Large - middle of last image\r\n#3 - Yellow & Blue Medium - right of last image\r\n\r\nPAYMENT OPTIONS - Our webstore is set up to take payment via PayPal.

We make them using the offcuts of our other skateboard jewellery pieces, making use of as much of each broken skateboard as possible. \r\n\r\nEach Wishbone Necklace is a one of a kind, as each piece used is a shard or offcut of other pieces. The skateboard shard pieces range in size from 2cm - 5cm (approx), and hang together in a cluster of 7 Bones. \r\n\r\nThreaded onto a beautiful smooth woven silk thread and finished with (recycled) sterling silver beads, the necklaces are designed to slip over your head with an adjustable bead to make hang any length from choker to approx 55cm long. \r\n\r\nThis listing is for one of the necklaces pictured, choose based on drop down menu below. If you are wanting a particular colour please leave a message in the notes to seller or email us and we'll see what shards we have. We welcome custom orders. \r\n\r\nMade by Sam Messina & Ellie Beck for Deadwood Creative, in our forest studio in Northern NSW, Australia\r\n\r\nPAYMENT OPTIONS - Our webstore is set up to take payment via PayPal.
