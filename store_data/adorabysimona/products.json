The multi-layered pendant features a Swarovski cosmic circle crystal from which hangs a darker and more opaque carnelian pendant (20x50mm) polished to capture the light and reflecting it in shades of deep orange and red. Copper, vermeil and 14K GP elements accentuate and brighten this beautiful combination of gemstones, pearls and crystals. \r\n\r\nThe 18\" (approx. 46cm) long necklace is completed by a round toggle clasp with a rope design and a tiny crystal accent added for a playful touch.

Its color varies from pale pinkish-orange to a deep rusty brown, though it is most known for its brilliant orange and red-orange crystals. Its bold energy brings a rush of warmth and joy that lingers, stimulating and empowering. Known as a stone of motivation and endurance, leadership and courage, Carnelian has protected and inspired throughout history.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Egyptians called Carnelian \"the setting sun.\" In its orange hues, they identified it with the receptive or passive female energies. In its red, red-orange to reddish brown shades, they considered it the active male energy stone, recognized by its glowing vibrant color. Carnelian is traditionally worn to enhance passion, love, and desire.","options":[{"id":48347481,"name":"Default","price":129.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.99,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.99,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127751877/-/IMG_3070.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127751877/-/IMG_3070.JPG","width":3254,"height":3456},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127751919/-/IMG_3076.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127751919/-/IMG_3076.JPG","width":2777,"height":3074},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127751856/-/IMG_3069.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127751856/-/IMG_3069.JPG","width":4689,"height":3126},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127751925/-/IMG_3084.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127751925/-/IMG_3084.JPG","width":2963,"height":2994},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127751904/-/IMG_3073.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127751904/-/IMG_3073.JPG","width":3980,"height":2557}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3647073,"name":"Earrings","permalink":"earrings","url":"/category/earrings"},{"id":3647075,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"},{"id":3647485,"name":"Sets","permalink":"sets","url":"/category/sets"}]},{"id":10139890,"name":"\"Mystère\" - Cultured Pearl and 18K Gold-Filled Necklace/Earrings/Set","permalink":"exquisite-freshwater-pearl-and-14k-gold-fill-earrings","position":5,"price":48.99,"default_price":48.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/exquisite-freshwater-pearl-and-14k-gold-fill-earrings","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-25T06:35:39.000Z","description":"Mysterious and exotic, this unique necklace and earrings set features excellent quality freshwater coin pearls (12mm) in an iridescent ivory color, accented by intricately textured 14K and 18K gold-filled rings and links.\r\n\r\nChoose between Necklace, Earrings or both pieces as a Set for a greater value:\r\nNecklace - $48.99\r\nEarrings - $48.99\r\nSet - $87.98\r\n\r\nThe necklace features three lustrous coin pearls hanging on an 18K gold-filled delicate chain, 18\" long (approx. 46cm), with a lobster claw closure and a tiny pearl drop detail for added playfulness.

Gold-filled is not to be confused with gold plating as filled literally has 100% more gold than gold plating. Gold-filled is much more valuable and tarnish resistant. It does not flake off, rub off or turn colors. As a matter of fact, anyone who can wear gold can wear gold-filled without worries of any allergic reaction to the jewelry. Gold-filled jewelry is an economical alternative to solid gold! \r\n\r\nGold-filled items are regulated by the government. These items are therefore so much better then gold-plated which has no regulations at all. \r\n\r\nGold-filled jewelry is made from solid gold and filled with other alloys such as rhodium (a member of the platinum family), brass, and sterling silver. Gold-filled wears, looks and lasts like solid gold because its outer surface IS solid gold. Everything you can see and touch is pure gold. In the jewelry industry the quantity of gold must be at least 1/20th by weight of the total product. Gold-filled items are generally considered lifetime products, and the gold layer will not wear off, as it will in electroplated products. \r\n\r\nGold-filled jewelry is often called the wave of the future because it offers all the same characteristics as solid gold such as strength, durability and beauty....but at a fraction of the cost! \r\n\r\nCaring for Gold Filled items is as easy as caring for any gold jewelry. Simply keep away from chemicals, clean regularly with mildly sudsy water, rinse well and pat dry with a non-scratching cloth. Polish gently with a jewelry polishing cloth.","options":[{"id":31731709,"name":"Necklace","price":48.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48892137,"name":"Earrings","price":48.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48892140,"name":"Set","price":87.98,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.99,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.99,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128118696/-/IMG_3163_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128118696/-/IMG_3163_1.jpg","width":2296,"height":1437},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128117205/-/IMG_3160.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128117205/-/IMG_3160.jpg","width":1280,"height":1052},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128117235/-/IMG_3164.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128117235/-/IMG_3164.jpg","width":1280,"height":1045},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128118267/-/IMG_3174.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128118267/-/IMG_3174.JPG","width":3773,"height":2919},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128118108/-/IMG_3173.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128118108/-/IMG_3173.JPG","width":3604,"height":2821}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3647073,"name":"Earrings","permalink":"earrings","url":"/category/earrings"},{"id":3647075,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"},{"id":3647485,"name":"Sets","permalink":"sets","url":"/category/sets"}]},{"id":14577780,"name":"\"Infinity\" - Pyrope Garnet Earrings","permalink":"infinity-pyrope-garnet-earrings","position":6,"price":36.99,"default_price":36.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/infinity-pyrope-garnet-earrings","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-02T20:22:47.000Z","description":"One of the most magical symbols, 'infinity' is thought to signify love without end, constantly recurring. It reminds us that love is in fact unlimited - the depth and vastness of this love is not bound by time or place. In ancient India and Tibet, the infinity symbol represents perfection, dualism, and unity between male and female. It is linked to magic and represents equilibrium, or the balance of various forces. \r\n\r\nCasual yet elegant, this beautiful pair of earrings features 18K gold-plated infinity circles in a soft satin finish with the larger circle encasing a deep red garnet drop (8x8mm), that dangles playfully as it reflects the light with every facet. The garnet drops are cut, faceted and polished by hand.  Garnet occurs in every color except blue, and most varieties are named for their color. Pyrope Garnet and is the most famous of the red garnets. Its dark, blood red color often resembles the color of ruby and it owes its color to a strong concentration of magnesium and aluminum. \r\n\r\n18K GP french hook style ear wires. \r\n\r\nOverall length of the earring is 45mm (approx. 1 3/4\"). \r\n\r\nHandcrafted - One of a kind. \r\n\r\nGarnet is the birthstone for January and the stone that celebrates the 2nd anniversary of marriage. The name “garnet” comes from the Latin word “Garanatus,” meaning “seedlike,” in reference to a pomegranate, much like the bright red seeds you find inside in a pomegranate. The garnet has been a popular gem throughout history. Garnets were found as beads in a necklace worn by a young man in a grave that dates back to 3000 B.C. This is proof of the hardness and durability of the stone.\r\n\r\nGarnets range from a 7.0 to 7.5 on the Mohs scale of hardness and are found in the U.S. (Arizona), South Africa, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Myanmar (Burma), Scotland, Switzerland and Tanzania. They are formed when high temperatures and/or pressure is a factor and geologists often use garnets as a gauge of the amount of temperature and pressure that was present during their formation.\r\n\r\nFolklore, Legend, and Healing Properties:  Garnet's powers include healing, strength, and protection and it is often worn to relieve inflammations of the skin.

Purple Amethyst has been highly esteemed throughout the ages for its stunning beauty and legendary powers to stimulate and soothe the mind and emotions. It is a semi-precious stone in today’s classifications, but to the ancients it was a “Gem of Fire,” a Precious Stone worth as much as a Diamond. It has always been associated with February, the month the Romans dedicated to Neptune, their water-god, and is the traditional birthstone of that month. It is the stone of St. Valentine and faithful love, and signifies ecclesiastical dignity as the Bishop’s Stone. It carries the energy of fire and passion, creativity and spirituality, yet bears the logic of temperance and sobriety.\r\n\r\nThe best varieties of Amethysts can be found in Siberia, Sri Lanka, Brazil and the far East.\r\n\r\nDrusy, druse, druzy, drusies - different spellings, but they all mean tiny quartz crystals that form within or on the surface of other stones.

The clear crystals often form on top of previously deposited minerals. This is called a drusy.  \r\n\r\nTitanium drusy is drusy that has been coated with titanium in a vacuum chamber.

It has been mined by early Egyptians since at least 6000 BC. Most specimens are cryptocrystalline, meaning that the crystals can only be seen by a microscope.

Created exclusively for this event, the \"Atlantis\" Necklace and several male leather wrap bracelets were prominently featured on display at The Artisan Group's exhibit. Actors, actresses, celebrity managers and members of the press had an opportunity to try on the showcase pieces supplied by ADORA by Simona, and took home in their gift bag the \"En Vogue\" earrings also designed exclusively for this event. \r\n\r\nThis necklace accompanied by matching earrings is now available for sale! \r\n\r\nA stunning necklace for the pearl lovers! Set in sterling silver and measuring 1 5/8\" (approx. 43mm) long and 3/4\" (approx. 18mm) at its widest point, the flawlessly faceted mystic topaz featured in this exotic pendant is sure to draw a lot of attention! Two strands of high-lustre ivory pearls (7-8mm), and a round sterling silver spring clasp (20mm) that closes in the front complete the design.  \r\n\r\nThe pendant can easily be removed from the clasp, making it possible to wear this versatile necklace multiple ways. By removing the pendant you can have a completely different necklace, a simple, classy two-strands of pearls which can be worn either with the clasp asymmetrically on one side, or with it concealed in the back.     \r\n\r\nOverall length of the necklace is 18\" (approx. 46cm) - add 1 5/8\" (approx. 43mm) for the pendant.  The weight of the pendant - gemstone and sterling silver together - is 12g (approx. 0.42oz).\r\n\r\nThe earrings are simple, meant to just complete the set and not take away from the dramatic effect of the necklace.  They feature a single lustrous freshwater pearl (approx. 11mm) accented by a tiny titanium-coated drusy agate bead shimmering in all colors of the rainbow (to match the colors in the pendant), and hang from a custom hammered sterling silver ear wire.  The overall length of the earring is 1 3/8\" (approx. 34mm). \r\n\r\nHandcrafted - One of a kind. \r\n\r\nBorrowing its name from Plato's mythical island Atlantis, the pendant in this unique necklace shimmers with the light of a thousand rainbows.  Mystic topaz is a relatively new type of enhanced gemstone, but its unique multicolored brilliance is making it one of the most sought after gems of today.  To create mystic topaz, high-quality natural colourless topaz is treated with a thin coating of titanium which is applied to the underside of the stone. It is the application of this coating that creates the stunning rainbow colours from blue, green and yellow to small bursts of red shades. This striking iridescent effect makes mystic topaz the perfect choice for unique jewelry.

Encased in sterling silver, the pendant measures 73mm (approx. 2 7/8\") in length (including the bail) and 1 1/4\" at its widest point.  The weight of the pendant including the gemstones is 19.1g (approx. 0.67oz). The stones are flawlessly cut and polished and the combination of shapes, colors and textures is gorgeous in every way! \r\n\r\nThe pendant is hanging on a hard sterling silver (solid 925, marked) neck wire. The v-shape of the neck wire wraps without flaw around the neck and measures 6 1/4\" from the clasp down to where it meets the pendant, and 5 1/2\" across, for a total circumference of 18\". The width of it is 5mm, and it weighs 20g (approx. 0.70oz). \r\n\r\nHandcrafted - One of a kind. \r\n\r\nConsidered \"The Stone of Spiritual Awakening\", labradorite gets its name from the region Labrador in Canada which is the main and original source of this feldspar stone. Even before the year 1000, the natives of Maine used this gem for decoration. However, it was only in the 1770s that the labradorite got its name, when it was found by Moravian Missionaries in Labrador.  Said to represent the \"temple of the stars\" , it brings clarity of thought, and the wisdom of other worlds and universes to us.  On an individual level, it brings forth each person's strengths to share with the world, and each other.\r\n\r\nNamed from the Greek \"ios\", or violet, Iolite is a rich violet blue gemstone that might remind you of better-known gems like tanzanite and sapphire. Although it is still not well known, iolite has a long history.\r\n\r\nWhen Leif Eriksson and the other legendary Viking explorers ventured far into the Atlantic, away from any coastline that could help them determine position, they relied on iolite to help them determine their location. They used thin pieces of iolite as the world's first polarizing filter. Looking through an iolite lens, they could determine the exact position of the sun, and navigate safely to the new world and back.\r\n\r\nThe property that made iolite so valuable to the Vikings is extreme pleochroism. Iolite has different colors in different directions in the crystal. A cube cut from iolite will look a violetish blue almost like sapphire from one side, clear as water from the other, and a honey yellow from the top. This property led some people to call iolite \"water sapphire\" in the past, a name that is now obsolete.\r\n\r\nIolite is mined in India, Sri Lanka, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Brazil. The Vikings probably mined iolite from deposits in Norway and Greenland. \r\n\r\nIolite is relatively hard, with a Mohs Hardness of 7 to 7.5, but should be protected from blows. Clean with mild dish soap: use a toothbrush to scrub behind the stone where dust can collect.\r\n","options":[{"id":36154491,"name":"Default","price":219.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.99,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.99,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112928418/-/IMG_2002.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112928418/-/IMG_2002.JPG","width":804,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112928886/-/IMG_1998.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112928886/-/IMG_1998.JPG","width":877,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112928466/-/IMG_2004.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112928466/-/IMG_2004.JPG","width":632,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112928502/-/IMG_2005.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112928502/-/IMG_2005.JPG","width":962,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112928454/-/IMG_2003.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112928454/-/IMG_2003.JPG","width":1000,"height":953}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3647075,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]},{"id":13996629,"name":"Golden Cubic Zirconia and Vermeil Earrings","permalink":"golden-cubic-zirconia-and-vermeil-earrings","position":20,"price":44.99,"default_price":44.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/golden-cubic-zirconia-and-vermeil-earrings","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-05T21:57:50.000Z","description":"Classic yet modern at the same time, this elegant pair of earrings features cubic zirconia teardrops (12x18mm) in a beautiful dark champagne color accented by a cluster of six smaller drops.

Gold-filled is not to be confused with gold plating as filled literally has 100% more gold than gold plating.  Gold-filled is much more valuable and tarnish resistant.  It does not flake off, rub off or turn colors.  As a matter of fact, anyone who can wear gold can wear gold-filled without worries of any allergic reaction to the jewelry.  Gold-filled jewelry is an economical alternative to solid gold!\r\n\r\nGold-filled items are regulated by the government.  These items are therefore so much better then gold-plated which has no regulations at all.  Gold-filled jewelry is made from solid gold and filled with other alloys such as rhodium (a member of the platinum family), brass, and sterling silver.  Gold-filled wears, looks and lasts like solid gold because its outer surface IS solid gold.  Everything you can see and touch is pure gold.  In the jewelry industry the quantity of gold must be at least 1/20th by weight of the total product.\r\n\r\nGold-filled items are generally considered lifetime products, and the gold layer will not wear off, as it will in electroplated products.  Gold-filled jewelry is often called the wave of the future because it offers all the same characteristics as solid gold such as strength, durability and beauty….but at a fraction of the cost!\r\n\r\nCaring for Gold Filled items is as easy as caring for any gold jewelry. Simply keep away from chemicals, clean regularly with mildly sudsy water, rinse well and pat dry with a non-scratching cloth. Polish gently with a jewelry polishing cloth.","options":[{"id":34858248,"name":"Default","price":42.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.99,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.99,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108957417/-/IMG_1818.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108957417/-/IMG_1818.JPG","width":1000,"height":478},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108957339/-/IMG_1817.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108957339/-/IMG_1817.JPG","width":924,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108957429/-/IMG_1819.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108957429/-/IMG_1819.JPG","width":1000,"height":896},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108957489/-/IMG_1821.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108957489/-/IMG_1821.JPG","width":985,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3647073,"name":"Earrings","permalink":"earrings","url":"/category/earrings"}]},{"id":12920670,"name":"\"Larissa Mar\" - Larimar, Rainbow Moonstone and Pearl Necklace","permalink":"larissa-mar-larimar-rainbow-moonstone-and-pearl-necklace","position":23,"price":199.0,"default_price":199.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/larissa-mar-larimar-rainbow-moonstone-and-pearl-necklace","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-12T16:14:29.000Z","description":"Feel the calm, deep blue of glowing Larimar!

The first mention of the stone is in a request to mine Larimar in 1916, however it wasn't until 1974 that the stone really made an appearance. Recognized by its blue color very similar to that of the tropical beach water, Larimar stones are thought to have formed years ago as a result of volcanic eruptions. It is theorized that as magma was forced from beneath the earth’s surface, it mixed with a variety of substances such as aluminum compounds, sodium, calcium and iron. This chemical mixture formed into what is known in geology as a pectolite that is essentially a mineral occurring in radiated or fibrous or crystalline masses. This is the cause for its unusual but beautiful bright blue color.\r\n\r\nThe gemstone was given its name by Miguel Mendez, a Dominican who discovered an abandoned gemstone mine in the southwestern part of the country around 1974. The word Larimar was created by combining the beginning of Mendez’s daughter’s name Larissa with the word “mar” which is the Spanish word for sea. Strangely enough, despite being in existence for so long, up until that point the largely ignored gemstone had not been officially named and the name “Larimar” stuck.\r\n\r\nBecause Larimar is indigenous to the Dominican Republic and because of its unusual beauty, there is naturally a lot of Dominican folklore surrounding it. It is often looked upon as a powerful, spiritual stone. It is said to soothe, heal and enlighten. It is supposed to enable one to view things from a different perspective. The stone itself represents peace, clarity and love and is recommended for people who are stressed. This is all undoubtedly due to its tranquil blue color.\r\n","options":[{"id":41206965,"name":"Default","price":199.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.99,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.99,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122668662/-/IMG_2539.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122668662/-/IMG_2539.JPG","width":3215,"height":3152},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122668698/-/IMG_2546.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122668698/-/IMG_2546.JPG","width":2921,"height":3166},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122668674/-/IMG_2540.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122668674/-/IMG_2540.JPG","width":2204,"height":2884},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122668683/-/IMG_2545.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122668683/-/IMG_2545.JPG","width":2634,"height":3282},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122668737/-/IMG_2548.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122668737/-/IMG_2548.JPG","width":3323,"height":3181}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3647075,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]},{"id":11363355,"name":"\"The French Connection\" - Antiqued Silver Wide Link Bracelet","permalink":"the-french-connection-antiqued-silver-wide-link-bracelet","position":24,"price":52.99,"default_price":52.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-french-connection-antiqued-silver-wide-link-bracelet","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-24T21:42:28.000Z","description":"Dark and beautiful, this elegant bracelet is handcrafted with wide interconnected links featuring a filigreed swirl design in an antiqued silver finish.

In the mix there is Mozambique Garnet, Red Sea Sediment Jasper and Mystic Topaz, all in various shades of beautiful, iridescent reds. Encased in sterling silver, the pendant measures 80mm (approx. 3 1/8\") in length (including the bail) and 34mm (approx. 1 3/8\") at its widest point.  The weight of the pendant including the gemstones is 22.6g (approx. 0.80oz). The stones are flawlessly cut and polished and the combination of shapes, colors and textures is gorgeous in every way! \r\n\r\nThe pendant is hanging on a hard sterling silver (solid 925, marked) neck wire. The v-shape of the neck wire wraps without flaw around the neck and measures 6 1/4\" from the clasp down to where it meets the pendant, and 5 1/2\" across, for a total circumference of 18\". The width of it is 5mm, and it weighs 20g (approx. 0.70oz). \r\n\r\nHandcrafted - One of a kind. \r\n\r\nThe gemstone Garnet is the official birthstone for January as adopted by the American National Association of Jewelers in 1912. It is also the stone for the Zodiac sign Aquarius. \r\n\r\nGarnets range from a 7.0 to 7.5 on the Mohs scale of hardness and are found in the U.S. (Arizona), South Africa, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Myanmar (Burma), Mozambique, Scotland, Switzerland and Tanzania. They form under high temperatures and/or pressure and geologists often use garnets as a gauge of the amount of temperature and pressure that was present during their formation. \r\n\r\nFolklore, Legend, and Healing Properties: Garnet's powers include healing, strength, and protection and it is often worn to relieve inflammations of the skin. It is also believed to regulate the heart and blood flow and aid in curing depression. In earlier times, garnets were exchanged as gifts between friends to demonstrate their affection for each other and to insure that they meet again.\r\n\r\nJasper was a favorite gem in ancient times and is referenced in Hebrew, Assyrian and Latin literature. It is a fine-grained chalcedony and comes in all colors. The name jasper comes from the Greek and means \"spotted stone.\" Found in many varieties and colors, Sea Sediment Jasper is a wonderful stone for helping one find inner peace, clarity, love and compassion, helps with the alignment of the physical and \"Light\" bodies and is an excellent stone for emotional healing.\r\n\r\nShimmering with the light of a thousand rainbows, Mystic Topaz is a relatively new type of enhanced gemstone, but its unique multicolored brilliance is making it one of the most sought after gems of today.  To create mystic topaz, high-quality natural colourless topaz is treated with a thin coating of titanium which is applied to the underside of the stone. It is the application of this coating that creates the stunning rainbow colours from blue, green and yellow to small bursts of red shades. This striking iridescent effect makes mystic topaz the perfect choice for unique jewelry.

The most common suggestion is that it may have derived from the Latin word 'spina' meaning a thorn, possibly referring to its fiery color or the sharp pointed crystals that are found within some Spinels. Spinels were often referred to as 'balas rubies' in ancient times. 'Balas' or 'Balascia' is a territory in Northern Afghanistan known as Badakshan where Spinels may have first been discovered. This area in the Middle Ages was an active gem-producing region that had discovered large beautiful red to pink Spinels that were thought to be rubies and considered the best rubies of their time.\r\n\r\nMany royal crown jewels thought to be rubies have actually turned out to be red Spinels. The Black Prince's Ruby on the British Imperial State Crown is a 170-carat red Spinel. The Timor Ruby that has the engraved names of the Mogul emperors on its face was once thought to be a Ruby as well. This magnificent 352-carat stone is in fact a red Spinel and is now owned by Queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nSpinels are associated with love and help the wearer to put their ego aside and become devoted to another person. Spinel also encourages passion and is said to increase the duration of one's life.\r\n\r\nBlack Spinel in particular is said to be a protective stone and helps re-establish relationships and resolve issues. It is also believed to relieve sadness.

This is because of its color's close resemblance to sea water.  Aquamarine was considered sacred to the god of the sea, Neptune. It is documented that it was used by the Greeks between 480-300 BC. They would wear Aquamarine amulets engraved with the water god Poseidon to protect them against perils and monsters of the sea.  Legend also says that Aquamarine was the treasure of the mermaids and for this reason, sailors would wear it to keep them safe on voyages out to sea and prevent seasickness.\r\n\r\nAquamarine is also said to have a soothing effect on married couples, helping husbands and wives work out their differences and ensure a long and happy marriage.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is said that Aquamarine will provide its wearer with everlasting youth and happiness, provide courage, cure laziness and quicken the intellect. Aquamarine can replace anger and negativity with mental peace and clarity, providing the wearer with emotional and mental balance. For these reasons it is said to be an effective treatment for anxiety. \r\n\r\nAquamarine is an effective gemstone for opening the fifth chakra, the throat chakra. Water in which an Aquamarine has been immersed can cure eye problems, swollen glands and helps to maintain healthy teeth and gums.  (Information provided through www.gemtradenet.com.

The Latin \"lapis\" meaning stone, and the word \"lazuli\" coming from the Persian/Arabic lazhward or blue (as in \"azure\") were put together to create a name that means \"blue stone\" or stone of azure.  \r\n\r\nLapis Lazuli is rare and only found in only a few places including Chile, Baffin Islands, United States, Siberia, and Afghanistan, where it occurs in large deposits. \r\n\r\nLapis has always been fashioned as beads and cabochons, carved into exquisite articles of ornament, or used in inlays and mosaics. In Egypt and Sumeria it was ground and used as eye shadow, or set in protective amulets and other jewelry. Romans ingested the ground lapis powder in food and drink as an aphrodisiac and as an antidote to poison.  \r\n\r\nAs an ancient gem, Lapis Lazuli has a facinating history.  This semi-precious mineral was usually used for artworks of great importance such as the funeral mask of Tutankhamun and the decoration of the Taj Mahal.  It was said to be the stone of rulers and to represent power, and some ancient cultures actually valued Lapis Lazuli as much as or more than gold.  \r\n\r\nLapis Lazuli was believed to give good judgement and insight, enhance wisdom, and stimulate inner vision and promote peace of mind.  It was also believed by some that wearing Lapis Lazuli would protect the wearer from evil. A saying of the ancient Sumerian priests states. \"He who carries with him into battle an amulet of Lapis carries with him the presence of his god.\" Legend tells that the 10 Commandments were carved on stones of Lapis Lazuli.","options":[{"id":27774386,"name":"Default","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.99,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.99,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87012737/-/IMG_1289.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87012737/-/IMG_1289.JPG","width":994,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87012881/-/IMG_1253.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87012881/-/IMG_1253.JPG","width":750,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3647073,"name":"Earrings","permalink":"earrings","url":"/category/earrings"}]},{"id":9101390,"name":"Freshwater Pearl and Oxidized Copper Earrings ","permalink":"freshwater-pearl-and-oxidized-copper-earrings","position":43,"price":28.99,"default_price":28.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/freshwater-pearl-and-oxidized-copper-earrings","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-23T20:52:51.000Z","description":"Earthy yet elegant, this modern pair of earrings features teardrop-shaped freshwater pearls in a vibrant bronze color hanging from a textured copper element (1x1\") with a square spiral design.

Lapis has always been fashioned as beads and cabochons, carved into exquisite articles of ornament, or used in inlays and mosaics. In Egypt and Sumeria it was ground and used as eye shadow, or set in protective amulets and other jewelry. Romans ingested the ground lapis powder in food and drink as an aphrodisiac and as an antidote to poison.  \r\n\r\nAs an ancient gem, Lapis Lazuli has a facinating history.  This semi-precious mineral was usually used for artworks of great importance such as the funeral mask of Tutankhamun and the decoration of the Taj Mahal.  It was said to be the stone of rulers and to represent power and some ancient cultures actually valued Lapis Lazuli as much as or more than gold.  \r\n\r\nLapis Lazuli was believed to give good judgement and insight, enhance wisdom, and stimulate inner vision and promote peace of mind.  It was also believed by some that wearing Lapis Lazuli would protect the wearer from evil. A saying of the ancient Sumerian priests states. \"He who carries with him into battle an amulet of Lapis carries with him the presence of his god.\" Legend tells that the 10 Commandments were carved on stones of Lapis Lazuli.","options":[{"id":24193791,"name":"Default","price":99.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.99,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.99,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75253992/-/Photos_-_691.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75253992/-/Photos_-_691.jpg","width":1000,"height":725},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75254076/-/IMG_1077.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75254076/-/IMG_1077.JPG","width":1000,"height":752},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75254112/-/IMG_1078.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75254112/-/IMG_1078.JPG","width":1000,"height":828},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75254142/-/IMG_1079.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75254142/-/IMG_1079.JPG","width":1000,"height":744},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75254172/-/IMG_1080.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75254172/-/IMG_1080.JPG","width":1000,"height":940}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3647075,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]},{"id":7605775,"name":"Oxidized Silver and Paua Shell Inlay Earrings","permalink":"oxidized-silver-and-paua-shell-inlay-earrings","position":51,"price":32.99,"default_price":32.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/oxidized-silver-and-paua-shell-inlay-earrings","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-20T04:50:07.000Z","description":"The eye of the storm is captured in the swirling pattern of the beautiful paua shell inlays that adorn this unique pair of earrings.

It is also the birthstone for the Zodiac sign of Gemini.\r\n\r\nDrusy, druse, druzy, drusies - different spellings, but they all mean tiny quartz crystals that form within or on the surface of other stones. When ground water carrying dissolved silica is forced into a porous area of the rock, rapid cooling often occurs, causing the formation of tiny crystals on the surfaces or in cavities of the rock. The clear crystals often form on top of previously deposited minerals. This is called a drusy.\r\n\r\nTitanium drusy is agate drusy that has been coated with titanium in a vacuum chamber. It produces a permanent metal coating in spectacular shades that are hard to reproduce in other ways.\r\n\r\nAgate is found all over the world including: the Africa, Asia, Brazil, Egypt, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Nepal, and the USA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":27782186,"name":"Default","price":175.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.99,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.99,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87031997/-/IMG_1339.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87031997/-/IMG_1339.JPG","width":947,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87031895/-/IMG_1152.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87031895/-/IMG_1152.JPG","width":1000,"height":998},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87031793/-/IMG_1149.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87031793/-/IMG_1149.JPG","width":649,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87031829/-/IMG_1150.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87031829/-/IMG_1150.JPG","width":928,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87031781/-/IMG_1147.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87031781/-/IMG_1147.JPG","width":861,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3647075,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]},{"id":7370359,"name":"Faceted Aquamarine Briolette Earrings","permalink":"faceted-aquamarine-briolette-earrings","position":53,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/faceted-aquamarine-briolette-earrings","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-27T06:32:06.000Z","description":"Faceted aquamarine briolette drops (8mm) in soft, muted tones of twilight sway beneath stacked copper rings of various sizes. \r\n\r\nCopper french hook style ear wire.  \r\n\r\nOverall length of the earring is 40mm (approx. 1 1/2\").  \r\n\r\nHandcrafted - One of a kind.  \r\n\r\nAquamarine is the birthstone for the month of March and is associated with the zodiac sign of Pisces.  \r\n\r\nHistory and Lore: The name Aquamarine was derived by the Latin words, aqua meaning “water”, and mare meaning “sea”. This is because of its color's close resemblance to sea water.  Aquamarine was considered sacred to the god of the sea, Neptune. It is documented that it was used by the Greeks between 480-300 BC. They would wear Aquamarine amulets engraved with the water god Poseidon to protect them against perils and monsters of the sea.  Legend also says that Aquamarine was the treasure of the mermaids and for this reason, sailors would wear it to keep them safe on voyages out to sea and prevent seasickness.  \r\n\r\nAquamarine is also said to have a soothing effect on married couples, helping husbands and wives work out their differences and ensure a long and happy marriage.  Additionally, it is said that Aquamarine will provide its wearer with everlasting youth and happiness, provide courage, cure laziness and quicken the intellect. Aquamarine can replace anger and negativity with mental peace and clarity, providing the wearer with emotional and mental balance. For these reasons it is said to be an effective treatment for anxiety. \r\n\r\nAquamarine is an effective gemstone for opening the fifth chakra, the throat chakra. Water in which an Aquamarine has been immersed can cure eye problems, swollen glands and helps to maintain healthy teeth and gums.  (Information provided through www.gemtradenet.com.

Each layer ends with a delicate faceted ruby rondelle that adds color and elegance to the chain.  \r\n\r\nOverall length of the earring is 77mm (approx. 3\"). \r\n\r\nHandcrafted - One of a kind.   \r\n\r\nThe Ruby was considered to have magical powers, and was worn by royalty as a talisman against evil.  The word Ruby comes from the Latin \"ruber,\" meaning red.  It is a variety of the mineral Corundum, and is found as crystals within metamorphic rock.  Corundum is the second hardest mineral, after Diamond.  It comes in a variety of colors, and is considered a Sapphire in any color except red, which is designated as a Ruby.  \r\n\r\nRubies range in hue from an orangey red to a purplish red, but the most prized gems are a true red in color.  Large sized Rubies are very rare and valuable. \r\n\r\nThe history of Ruby mining dates back more than 2,500 years ago.  The most beautiful crystals are thought to be from Burma, but quality Rubies are also found in India, Sri Lanka, Australia, Kenya, Tanzania, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the United States. \r\n\r\nIt has been said that the Ruby's red glow comes from an internal flame that cannot be extinguished, making a gift of this stone symbolic of everlasting love.  With its hardness and durability, it is a perfect engagement gem.  And if worn on the left hand, ancient lore has it that the Ruby will bring good fortune to its wearer, too!

The pearls thus formed are later framed and dyed in various shades. After they are baked and polished, they receive their final stringing. \r\n\r\nIn order to produce a good quality pearl, a key ingredient is what is called a 'mother of pearl bead'.

This is because of its color's close resemblance to sea water.  Aquamarine was considered sacred to the god of the sea, Neptune. It is documented that it was used by the Greeks between 480-300 BC. They would wear Aquamarine amulets engraved with the water god Poseidon to protect them against perils and monsters of the sea.  Legend also says that Aquamarine was the treasure of the mermaids and for this reason, sailors would wear it to keep them safe on voyages out to sea and prevent seasickness.\r\n\r\nAquamarine is also said to have a soothing effect on married couples, helping husbands and wives work out their differences and ensure a long and happy marriage.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is said that Aquamarine will provide its wearer with everlasting youth and happiness, provide courage, cure laziness and quicken the intellect. \r\n\r\nAquamarine can replace anger and negativity with mental peace and clarity, providing the wearer with emotional and mental balance. For these reasons it is said to be an effective treatment for anxiety. \r\n\r\nAquamarine is an effective gemstone for opening the fifth chakra, the throat chakra. Water in which an Aquamarine has been immersed can cure eye problems, swollen glands and helps to maintain healthy teeth and gums.  (Information provided through www.gemtradenet.com.

Inspired by royal jewelry, this elegant pair of earrings features a lustruous white freshwater coin pearl (13mm in diameter) accentuated by tiny faceted natural ruby rondelles.  The combination of the iridencent luminiscence of the pearl  and the fiery red of the ruby will grab everybody's attention for sure.  \r\n\r\nThe design is finished by an intricate dual-color (silver and gold) metalwork.  \r\n\r\nOverall length of the earring is 45mm (approx. 1 3/4\"). \r\n\r\nHandcrafted - One of a kind.  \r\n\r\nLike a perfect red rose, the Ruby's rich color speaks of love and passion.  Called the \"Rajnapura\" or \"King of Gems\" by ancient Hindus, July's birthstone is among the most highly prized of gems throughout history. The Ruby was considered to have magical powers, and was worn by royalty as a talisman against evil.  \r\n\r\nThe word Ruby comes from the Latin \"ruber,\" meaning red.  It is a variety of the mineral Corundum, and is found as crystals within metamorphic rock.  Corundum is the second hardest mineral, after Diamond.  It comes in a variety of colors, and is considered a Sapphire in any color except red, which is designated as a Ruby.  Rubies range in hue from an orangey red to a purplish red, but the most prized gems are a true red in color.  Large sized Rubies are very rare and valuable. \r\n\r\nThe history of Ruby mining dates back more than 2,500 years ago.  The most beautiful crystals are thought to be from Burma, but quality Rubies are also found in India, Sri Lanka, Australia, Kenya, Tanzania, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the United States. \r\n\r\nIt has been said that the Ruby's red glow comes from an internal flame that cannot be extinguished, making a gift of this stone symbolic of everlasting love.  With its hardness and durability, it is a perfect engagement gem.  And if worn on the left hand, ancient lore has it that the Ruby will bring good fortune to its wearer, too!

So here is this magnificent necklace and earrings set featuring Peruvian opals, freshwater pearls and 14K solid gold.  Peruvian blue opal is relatively rare and is only found in the Andes mountains near San Patricio, Peru. It is a very translucent stone with color similar to the Caribbean Sea. Depending on how the stone is cut it can be clear, scenic (showing varying degrees of color) or dendritic which has black fern like inclusions.  \r\n\r\nThe freeform opal nuggets in this set are faceted to capture the light and measure between 20mm and 25mm, varying in color from sky-blue to greenish-blue to golden-blue.  The pearls are of excellent quality, fairly large (10-12mm), and add contrast in beatiful ivory and gold color.  The design is completed by 14K solid gold rondelles and box clasp.  The overall length of the necklace is 19\".  \r\n\r\nFor the earrings I saved two of the most beautiful stones in the strand, in a very light blue color, measuring approx 15x20mm.  The earrings are also finished in 14K solid gold and are 38mm (approx. 1.5\") long. \r\n\r\nThe pieces can also be purchased separately with a price of $510.00 for the necklace and $85.00 for the earrings.  If interested in purchasing just the necklace or just the earrings, please contact me and I will make the arrangements.  \r\n\r\nHandcrafted - One of a kind.  \r\n\r\nDue to the high quality and high price, in addition to the delivery confirmation, this particular item will be shipped with insurance. The shipping charges displayed reflect that.\r\n\r\nI hope you will enjoy this set as much as I enjoyed creating it.

This is because of its color's close resemblance to sea water.  Aquamarine was considered sacred to the god of the sea, Neptune. It is documented that it was used by the Greeks between 480-300 BC. They would wear Aquamarine amulets engraved with the water god Poseidon to protect them against perils and monsters of the sea.  Legend also says that Aquamarine was the treasure of the mermaids and for this reason, sailors would wear it to keep them safe on voyages out to sea and prevent seasickness.\r\n\r\nAquamarine is also said to have a soothing effect on married couples, helping husbands and wives work out their differences and ensure a long and happy marriage.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is said that Aquamarine will provide its wearer with everlasting youth and happiness, provide courage, cure laziness and quicken the intellect. Aquamarine can replace anger and negativity with mental peace and clarity, providing the wearer with emotional and mental balance. For these reasons it is said to be an effective treatment for anxiety. \r\n\r\nAquamarine is an effective gemstone for opening the fifth chakra, the throat chakra. Water in which an Aquamarine has been immersed can cure eye problems, swollen glands and helps to maintain healthy teeth and gums.  (Information provided through www.gemtradenet.com.

Overall length of the earring is 50mm (approx. 2\").  \r\n\r\nHandcrafted - One of a kind.  \r\n\r\nCitrine shimmers and brings a hint of sunshine to those dull, cold November days and it is named after the French word \"citron\", meaning lemon. The color of citrine ranges from straw and sun yellow, to clay orange, to deep wine colored Madeira red, and like all crystal quartz it has a hardness of 7 on the Mohs scale which makes it insensitive to scratches. It is the official birthstone for the month of November as adopted by the American National Association of Jewelers in 1912, and it is also considered the Planetary stone for the Sun Sign of Virgo.\r\n\r\nThe majority of citrines available today are actually heat-treated amethysts from Minas Gerais in Brazil.  The naturally occurring stones tend to be cloudy in appearance, like the ones in used for this design, while heated stones will have fine stripes.\r\n\r\nCitrine is considered to bring happiness, joy and optimism, and it is one of only two minerals on the planet which do not hold or accumulate negative energy, but dispels and transforms it. Citrine energizes and invigorates, promotes warmth, comfort, and energy.","options":[{"id":22614993,"name":"Default","price":34.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.99,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.99,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70086273/-/Last_12_Months_-_49.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70086273/-/Last_12_Months_-_49.jpg","width":640,"height":509},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70086321/-/Last_12_Months_-_072.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70086321/-/Last_12_Months_-_072.jpg","width":640,"height":434}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3647073,"name":"Earrings","permalink":"earrings","url":"/category/earrings"}]},{"id":12402840,"name":"\"En Vogue\" Earrings - As Gifted to Celebrities at GBK’s 2013 Primetime Emmys Gift Lounge","permalink":"celebrity-gifts","position":100,"price":44.99,"default_price":44.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/celebrity-gifts","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-07-16T20:05:45.000Z","description":"ADORA by Simona, in association with The Artisan Group®, participated in an invitation-only luxury celebrity gift lounge hosted by GBK Productions on September 20-21, 2013 at an exclusive location in Hollywood, California, in honor of the The 2013 Primetime Emmys Nominees and Presenters.
