We don't use any food dyes, so our cherries have a delicate and pinkish golden glow.\r\n\r\nYou can also make the classic cherries with sour red marasca cherries for a bright red cherry. Sadly, the only farm in our area with sour cherries had a freeze this year and no sours were available.\r\n\r\nWe love the taste and flavor of these cherries by themselves or in a classic cocktail. Everytime we've opened a jar to taste test them, we manage to eat the entire jar (if that tells you anything).\r\n\r\nJar size: 6 oz.\r\n\r\nAdd a gift box to your order and your jams & pickles will come wrapped and ready for gift giving.  \r\n<a href=\"http://lemonbirdjams.bigcartel.com/product/lemon-bird-gift-wrapping\">Click here to purchase gift wrap!</a>","options":[{"id":24411291,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75941916/-/2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75941916/-/2.jpg","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75941952/-/4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75941952/-/4.jpg","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75942048/-/8.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75942048/-/8.jpg","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75942009/-/6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75942009/-/6.jpg","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75942114/-/10.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75942114/-/10.jpg","width":640,"height":640}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":8088384,"name":"Pickled Finger Limes with Maui Vanilla Beans","permalink":"pickled-finger-limes-with-maui-vanilla-beans","position":52,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pickled-finger-limes-with-maui-vanilla-beans","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-20T02:29:14.000Z","description":"One of our favorite farms grows the exotic finger lime citrus. A native to Australia, these tiny limes, are about a finger in size and length. They are filled with tiny lime \"caviar\" bubbles. When you eat the limes, the caviar burst on your tongue. The finger limes are a bright and flavor filled citrus that can be green or black skinned and pink or pale green on the inside.\r\n\r\nWe decided to pickle the very few we could get. The limes are cut into long halves and we added some Maui vanilla beans with a champagne vinegar for a fragrant sweet-tart flavor that's out of this world.\r\n\r\nTo our thrill, the entire jar turned a bright pink during the pickling process.\r\n\r\nThe finger limes can be mixed into your favorite cocktails or eaten straight out of the jar.

We added sugar and a little lemon juice and cooked this puree for an entire day to turn them into our fragrant spread.\r\n\r\nOur Membrillo is a sweet spread with an orangish, pink hue. The long cooking time for the quince gives the paste it's beautiful color, texture and flavor. The large amount of pectin in these quince gave the paste a perfect set.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, membrillo is served with a hard cheese, like Manchego. We put out a jar whenever we have a dinner party.

You'll find the sweet taste of orange blossoms, followed by the tart citrus taste of mandarinquats. We love the surprisingly sweet and tart flavors in this jam that leaves layers of flavor on your tongue.\r\n\r\nYou can eat this jam for breakfast, serve it for dessert with your favorite chocolate cake or have some as a lovely afternoon snack.\r\n\r\nJar size: 6 oz.\r\n\r\nAdd a gift box to your order and your jams & pickles will come wrapped and ready for gift giving.  \r\n<a href=\"http://lemonbirdjams.bigcartel.com/product/lemon-bird-gift-wrapping\">Click here to purchase gift wrap!</a>","options":[{"id":20079005,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67614237/-/17.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67614237/-/17.jpg","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67614141/-/14.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67614141/-/14.jpg","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67614205/-/16.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67614205/-/16.jpg","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67614167/-/15.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67614167/-/15.jpg","width":640,"height":640}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1683373,"name":"Sweets","permalink":"sweets","url":"/category/sweets"},{"id":1683374,"name":"Citrus","permalink":"citrus","url":"/category/citrus"}]},{"id":3826252,"name":"Kumquat and Fennel","permalink":"kumquat-with-tangerine-vanilla-bean-jam","position":79,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kumquat-with-tangerine-vanilla-bean-jam","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-05-28T03:21:28.000Z","description":"An amazing taste experience for your palate, the tiny citrus kumquat fruit is tart on the inside and have a sweet finish with the peel.

The taste is perfect and we could eat them all day! We decided to mix these beauties with a few whole Sichuan peppers that we picked up in Paris last spring. The sweetness of the plum is matched by the citrus and warm (not hot) flavor of the Sichuan pepper.\r\n\r\nWe love spreading some of this jam on chicken as we finish grilling to give it a sweet, crispy skin. We also serve the plums with cheeses and recommend Majon Reserva cheese for the best pairing.\r\n\r\nJar size: 6 oz.\r\n\r\nAdd a gift box to your order and your jams & pickles will come wrapped and ready for gift giving.  \r\n<a href=\"http://lemonbirdjams.bigcartel.com/product/lemon-bird-gift-wrapping\">Click here to purchase gift wrap!</a>","options":[{"id":12813108,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37417632/-/3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37417632/-/3.jpg","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37417640/-/4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37417640/-/4.jpg","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37417620/-/2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37417620/-/2.jpg","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37417592/-/1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37417592/-/1.jpg","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37417656/-/5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37417656/-/5.jpg","width":640,"height":640}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1683376,"name":"Savory","permalink":"savory","url":"/category/savory"}]},{"id":4800405,"name":"Lemon Bird Tea Towel","permalink":"lemon-bird-tea-towel","position":96,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lemon-bird-tea-towel","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-08T02:20:00.000Z","description":"Our new tea towel collection is inspired by our travels to the French countryside.

Our kitchen crew was over the moon, when a friend brought us a basket full of these tiny cucumbers - or gherkins as they are traditionally known. We couldn't resist the amazing cucumber flavor and burst of flavor from these tiny \"cucamelons\".\r\n\r\nWhen we found a local farm with the mexican sours in stock late this summer, we were thrilled to get some cucamelons to pickle. We've added a few spices and a sprig of tarragon for a wonderfully bright and flavorful pickle full of a slightly tangy and sour burst of cucumber.\r\n\r\nWe are thrilled to bring these pickles to you for the holidays. We think they are a perfect accompaniment to your favorite martini.
