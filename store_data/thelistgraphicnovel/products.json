The reader is challenged to piece together events and find clues as they search for reason amongst the prevailing insanity.\r\n\r\nThis 224 page perfect bound first printing comes to you signed, and encapsulates the entire story.\r\n\r\n<b>Critical assessment of The List</b><br /> <i>\"Simply put, the best graphic novel to have ever been published in Australia with the script and artwork combining to make a statement about what can be achieved when unrestrained talent is thrown at a project. 10 /10 Stars - Bedford, Pop, and Bonin, deliver a masterpiece.\" </i><br />Source: Scaryminds.com\r\n\r\n<i>\"The finale to The List was as harrowing a read as I expected from the set-up of the early volumes. Days later, Iâ€™m still digesting the symbolism of its emotionally-charged ending, dissecting events and reinterpreting their meaning over and over. A rare phenomenon these days for someone who finds it near impossible to remember from one month to the next what happened in the previous issues of the few super-hero books he still reads. Charged with a brutal, creative passion, The List is an unyielding, tenacious work that revels in immersing its audience in an orgy of uncomfortable, ghoulish voyeurism. Traumatic, disturbing, yet refreshingly honest, this is horror comics at their most unflinching.\"</i><br />Source: Brokenfrontier.com\r\n\r\n<i>\"...(The List) forces the reader to explore layers within layers within layers... This is a thoroughly dark and disturbing comic book, but it is also deeply intriguing and thoughtful.\" </i><br />Source: Comicsbulletin.com","options":[{"id":20087847,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.6,"amount_with_others":10.3,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":15.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61883495/-/TheList-Anthology-Cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61883495/-/TheList-Anthology-Cover.jpg","width":500,"height":643}],"artists":[{"id":60434,"name":"Script: Paul Bedford","permalink":"script-paul-bedford","url":"/artist/script-paul-bedford"},{"id":60436,"name":"Pencils: Henry Pop","permalink":"pencils-henry-pop","url":"/artist/pencils-henry-pop"},{"id":60438,"name":"Inks: Tom Bonin","permalink":"inks-tom-bonin","url":"/artist/inks-tom-bonin"},{"id":60440,"name":"Cover: Wayne Nichols","permalink":"cover-wayne-nichols","url":"/artist/cover-wayne-nichols"},{"id":123881,"name":"Layout/Lettering: Fleur Bedford","permalink":"layout-lettering-fleur-bedford","url":"/artist/layout-lettering-fleur-bedford"}],"categories":[{"id":2030926,"name":"Graphic Novel","permalink":"graphic-novel","url":"/category/graphic-novel"},{"id":2030928,"name":"Comic","permalink":"comic","url":"/category/comic"}]}]
