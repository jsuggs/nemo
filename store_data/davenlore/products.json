This is a big wine. The heady weight comes from Syrah and Durif. The 2010 Malbec was the ideal blending choice. Malbec can be overpowering, but here supports the Syrah and Durif . Raspberry and hazelnut aromas emerge first, followed by spiced meat, leather and anise. The medium plus toasted oak barrels produce a flavor of Mackintosh Toffee that I remember from childhood. As hefty as this wine is, the soft, pleasant structure is almost a surprise. Enjoy!

Alder Ridge is a fantastic growing location. The prolific winds and unrelenting sun make an extremely bold Cab. But hey, we are Washingtonians; we can handle it, we love big wines. Red plum, black raspberry and sharp juniper make a rich mix seasoned with cinnamon stick and black tea leaves. I get a serious lingering violet aroma when the glass is almost empty. The bold flavors continue to amaze when tasted over a 10 hour period. I suggest opening for a while to let this wine really hit its groove. I will keep my eye on how this Cab matures over time. I am confident it will show well for years to come. How cool is our wine industry?

Zephyr Ridge and Alder Ridge grapes, grown in sandy soils on a south slope overlooking the Columbia River, yield a bold and inky black wine. This year the wine has a raspberry jam and pomegranate quality. This wine's bold structure can handle all new oak barrels. I used half Minnesota American oak and half Hungarian oak. They impart a pleasant cocoa, cinnamon and vanilla quality. Like prior vintages, this Durif will bottle age well, likely 5-7 years, if you can keep it unopened that long.

In this vintage we blended 10% Cabernet Franc and a splash (5%) of Yakima Valley Malbec, adding a bit of lime citrus zest to the flavor profile. The wine is soft and approachable with rich chocolate paired with blackberry and red currant fruit. The cocoa finish lingers on the mid palate ending with a hint of fig and licorice for an eternity…well until the next sip. This is the reason I like Merlot. It’s solid, smooth, round, easy to drink and does not try to be something it’s not. Why should it? It’s comforting.

The Snipes Mountain fruit gives clear raspberry and blueberry notes. The jam and anise spice comes from the Horse Heaven Hills fruit. A good amount of oak structure brought out chocolate, coffee, and vanilla notes. Looking back in the barrel logs, the Odyse convection toasted and Seguin Moreau barrels played important roles in this vintage. The longer the wine is in your glass the more the aromas evolve. If you can, open this one up and taste over time. Syrah is back, kicking butt.

Year after year, the quality is exceptional. A very early ripening location, the fruit was already 27 Brix on October 7. I have made our Syrah Forté, a port style wine, from this vineyard since 2007 and love the result. It is rich and deep red-purple in color. There is plenty of mocha, vanilla and almond flavors to go with the dominant raspberry aroma; or, as I like to say, “Raspberry on steroids.” I stop the fermentation at 10% residual sugar by adding high proof grape spirits. Letting the grape skins soak for several days in this elevated alcohol blend integrates the flavors. They become well balanced between fruit and spirits. Sweet; but not too sweet.","options":[{"id":25259655,"name":"Default","price":27.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/78645597/-/2010_Syrah_Fort_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/78645597/-/2010_Syrah_Fort_.jpg","width":347,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":21272,"name":"Wine","permalink":"wine","url":"/category/wine"}]}]
