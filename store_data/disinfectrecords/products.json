This is the pummeling debut EP from SECTARIAN VIOLENCE, an intercontinental straight edge hardcore punk band comprised of members of bands from the US (COKE BUST), the UK (NEVER AGAIN), and Sweden (STAY HUNGRY). Fast, raw, pissed off hardcore drawing influences from 80's hardcore like THE ABUSED, LIFES BLOOD, NEGATIVE APPROACH, or early AGNOSTIC FRONT, with a contemporary take on the genre similar to more recent bands like VIOLENT MINDS or DEAD STOP. Raging fast parts combined with hard hitting breakdowns, all of which are executed with desperation and urgency of those classic 80's bands. Lyrically the topics cover a range of social and political issues, both globally and locally, seething with the frustration and anger that makes hardcore and punk still relevant in 2012.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F21999245&show_artwork=true\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":19056099,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58471707/-/sectarian_violence_cover_art.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58471707/-/sectarian_violence_cover_art.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[{"id":116603,"name":"SECTARIAN VIOLENCE","permalink":"sectarian-violence","url":"/artist/sectarian-violence"}],"categories":[{"id":2082960,"name":"7\" and tapes","permalink":"7-and-tapes","url":"/category/7-and-tapes"}]},{"id":11242833,"name":"SEX BEFORE SUICIDE #3 ","permalink":"sex-before-suicide-3","position":64,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sex-before-suicide-3","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-19T04:53:31.000Z","description":"Latest issue of this outstanding French zine, and as with the previous issues it's absolutely exploding with content.
