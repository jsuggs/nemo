He represents the earth and the element earth, though Earth is usually the goddess Prithvi rather than a god. Dhārā is a Sanskrit term used to refer to the flow of a stream or waterfall.\r\n\r\nI have named these scarves Dhara for their connection to the earth (made of cotton) and their flowing movement.\r\n\r\nJust in time for the changing seasons, these beautiful scarves are made of 100% cotton hand woven in Java and fair trade imported. They are then hand dyed by me in a variety of saturated colors using low immersion, painting, and Japanese Shibori techniques.  These scarves are wonderfully soft and light weight enough to wear indoors or with a sweater on warmer days.
