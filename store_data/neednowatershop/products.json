She's already had two successful 7 inch releases featuring songs focused purely on the sound of guitar and voice, she's been called “a classic example of DIY music at it's best” by Fact , and she also co-owns and runs her own record label; Need No Water . So it may be a surprise to those following her career so far that this release is the first in a trilogy of EPs with a new focus on collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe idea started by building on songs that Catriona had been writing with her friend Philippa Latimer. Catriona was so excited by the material that resulted from this approach that she decided to work with Dale Grundle of The Sleeping Years on two of these songs; title track \" Sitting On The Shelf Without Shelly \" and \" Untitled \" . Together they enrolled the talents of two other The Sleeping Years members ; Alex Beamont on Cello for \" Untitled \" and Tom Page on drums for \" Sitting On The Shelf \". Taking further inspiration from the collaborating sensibilities of Belgian friends Soy Un Caballo , who have released split singles with Tunng and This is The Kit on Catriona's label this year, Irving embraced the welcoming nature of fellow musicians in Europe. She recorded “ Untitled ” in Brussels with Thomas from Soy Un Caballo and put their vibes to good use for the track in the process.\r\n\r\nWhile the focus of these tracks is still firmly on Catriona's voice and her gift for melody, the extra layers of instrumentation show a progression into a different sound to her previous releases. Tom's drums on “ Sitting on the Shelf ” propel the song into a radio-friendly toe-tapper, while Alex's Cello on “ Untitled ” makes a delicate but wonderfully melancholic addition to the already fragile love song. Short but spellbinding track “ Measurements ” is included on the EP as a lone solo performance from Catriona, reminiscent of previous releases that fans will love.\r\n\r\nIn a further European connection, Paris-based DJ Julien Plaisir De France ( http://www.myspace.com/julienplaisirde ), picked up a copy of Catriona's first single, “ Running on Empathy” on a trip to London. He loved Catriona's voice and got in touch via myspace, and from then on they kept in contact, eventually leading to the idea of Julien remixing some of Catriona's songs. Catriona sent Julien the parts to one of her and Philippa's songs, \" Sitting On the Shelf Without Shelly \" and he returned with his remix of fantastically layered vocals, drums and synths, all centered around Catriona's original melody building up into a chopped-up french disco finale! Everyone involved loved the remix and immediately the decision was made to include it on the first of the EPs alongside the original version. The French seem to love the track just as much; thanks to the Parisian connection Catriona's popularity is already steaming ahead in France in advance of the release. Having already been picked up and featured on France 2's documentary \" Rendez-vous en terre Inconnue \", the “ Sitting On The Shelf ” remix has already had over 20,000 plays on Fairtilizer.com a very popular site with French music fans, so now it's time for the UK!

The French producer has been making music on the side since 2003 whilst carving out an incredible reputation for his mixes and remixes, including a recent guestspot on Ninja Tunes Solid Steel radio show. These have gained him a strong following within the alternative Hip-Hop scene, with fans including Glen Porter, DJ Pain, Electro4 (Bully) and Buddy Peace (Bully/2600) as well DJ Food's Strictly Kev (Ninja Tune). This is the first official release containing only his own original tracks with a sound akin to the leftfield beats coming from Anticon, Bully and Lex records.\r\n\r\nU-Point fuses DJ Shadow-esque drums with an ear for melody that propels his tracks into the same dusty electronica paths as Bonobo, or Rounds-era Four-Tet. He lists \"Conduit For Sale\" by Pavement an early influence, with the Headz compilations and the first Dj Krush album as his initial inspiration to produce his own material. What's abundant is U-Point's love of melodramatic, psychedelic and dark movies with the EP sounding like a soundtrack to a sinister film you've stumbled across at a charity shop.\r\n\r\nWhat people are saying about U-Point:\r\n\r\n\"Cinematic breaks and beats in the key of DJ Shadow, Bonobo and Four Tet\" - DJmag\r\n\r\n\"Could this be the French DJ Shadow that the world has been waiting for? Well, possibly, this first solo waxing far from disappoints, with all the atmosphere of a rain-soaked night drive through the dark part of town\". - Subba-Cultcha.com\r\n\r\n“His music tells a story, painting pictures in your head, taking you on a journey into his world. U-Point always comes through with dope drums, sick guitar licks, and moody atmospherics. What's not to like?” - Glen Porter (Project Mooncircle)\r\n\r\n“A healthy dose of vintage DJ shadow beats and Boards of Canada synth lines\" - Strictly Kev (DJ Food/ Ninja Tune)\r\n\r\n\"This is so far up my street it's my nextdoor neighbour!\" - SasQwax (Rhythym Incursions) ","options":[{"id":1571146,"name":"12\" vinyl","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3197787/-/needno003bigc.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3197787/-/needno003bigc.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[{"id":8912,"name":"U-Point","permalink":"u-point","url":"/artist/u-point"}],"categories":[{"id":310294,"name":"download","permalink":"download","url":"/category/download"},{"id":310305,"name":"12\" vinyl","permalink":"12-vinyl","url":"/category/12-vinyl"}]},{"id":390387,"name":"Catriona Irving - Running On Empathy (needno001)","permalink":"catriona-irving-running-on-emapthy","position":12,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/catriona-irving-running-on-emapthy","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-09-07T19:48:13.000Z","description":"1.

For a couple of years she's been building a reputation for her live show, playing  at venues such as 93 feet east, the 12 bar Club and the Borderline, and supporting the Espers and Emilie Simon along the way. Combining clever lyrics and sweet melodies that stick in your head for days, with a sweet and witty live performance, Catriona has been making a significant mark on the DIY scene.\r\n\r\nIn this first release from Catriona Irving are two lovely understated lo-fi lullabies, Running on Empathy and Hindsight. Recorded in a friends' house with just voice, guitar and some little keys, the release carries the same delicate style of her live show. With jaunty meandering melodies and sparse acoustic production it seemed silly not to put it on vinyl! This limited edition 7\" comes beautifully packaged in a hand numbered colour in sleeve complete with free colour pencils.

Al has been making music on the side since 2000 whilst carving out an incredibly successful career as an illustrator, finally producing this delightful first official release.\r\n\r\nUnder their former moniker Murphy Kid & The Bad Luck Band they shared the same bill as Bob Dylan, Athlete, and Tunng. On re-launching as Blacklands last year they played a triumphant come back show with Sons of Noel and Adrian, to be followed by more live shows in the upcoming months with artists including Alessi's Ark and Birdengine amongst others.\r\n\r\nTraditionally Al would self-record in the garden shed of his sister's house. These new tracks, however, were written in Berlin (where Al went for 3 months and came back a year later) and recorded on the North Yorkshire Moors, in an old farmhouse where Al got to live out his American Werewolf In London fantasies. The collection of tracks recorded there he appropriately titled; 'Beware The Moon'. Ever the nomad, Al is soon to be packing up and roaming again, this time returning to New York to pedal his wears and sing for his supper.\r\n\r\nAl is 32. His favourite desert is Tiramisu.\r\n\r\nWhat People are saying about Blacklands:\r\n\"The autumnal hues of the EP are slowly intoxicating, gently enveloping the listener in their texture. Blacklands have many forbearers, most noticeably Tunng, Iron and Wine, Elliott Smith and Nick Drake, yet they avoid being derivative and add to the always evolving, non-linear folk tradition by incorporating different elements and qualities within their work. There is a proliferation of acoustic troubadours currently vying for attention from the record buying public, yet few acts' handiwork will be as sophisticated and subtle as 'The Wytchwood EP'.\"\r\nClickmusic - 4/5 stars (full review here)\r\n\r\n\"very sparse, very folky and very delicate, the sort of thing you'd expect to be made after dark in a Moors farmhouse.\"\r\nsweepingthenation (full review here)\r\n\r\n\"The four songs here were indubitably influenced by the rural isolation of the moors, the rousing folk of the title track begging to be played in front of a crackling fire.

Originally hailing from Winchester, now living in Paris, by way of Bristol, Kate was discovered whilst touring and playing concerts with the likes of <strong>The National</strong>, <strong>Elysian Fields</strong>, <strong>Jose Gonzales</strong>, <strong>Clogs</strong> and <strong>Jeffrey Lewis</strong>. Playing everything from the banjo to the trumpet, Kate was too unique to be ignored, and soon found herself playing live sessions with <strong>Radio One</strong> and <strong>Resonance FM </strong>as well as touring widely across the UK, Europe and Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since then <strong>This Is The Kit</strong> has gained fans from all over the UK, in fact <strong>BBC Radio One&#8217;s Huw Stephens</strong> has called Kate one of the &#8216;rising female stars&#8217; of the modern folk movement, and her <strong>Two Wooden Spoons </strong>single, taken from last album <strong>Krulle Bol (</strong>produced by PJ Harvey collaborator <strong>John Parish</strong>), was released on <strong>Rob Da Bank&#8217;s</strong> label <strong><a href=\"http://www.sundaybest.net/site/releases/detail.php?articleId=377\">Sunday Best</a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Need No Water</strong> fans will also already know about <strong>This Is The Kit</strong> from our split 7&#8243; release with <strong>Soy Un Caballo</strong> last year, which included <strong>This Is The Kit&#8217;s</strong> original version of “<strong>Birchwood Beaker”</strong>, a much loved release of ours with fans including <strong>Jarvis Cocker</strong> and <strong>Marc Riley</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2010 sees the release of <strong>This Is The Kit&#8217;s</strong> second album, <strong>&#8220;Wriggle Out The Restless&#8221;</strong> on <strong><a href=\"http://www.dreamboatrecords.co.uk/\">Dreamboat</a></strong> records, from which the a-side of this single release, “<strong>Moon</strong>” is taken. This release forms an excellent sneak preview of what&#8217;s to come, paired with an exclusive track “<strong>Treehouse</strong>”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>“Moon”</strong> is a timeless piece of optimistic, upbeat indie-folk, showcasing both Kate&#8217;s voice and skill for writing a catchy song. While her previous release on Need No Water was a solo-sounding affair, “<strong>Moon” </strong>features a full band backing, comprising of Bristolian folk favourites<strong> Francois Marry </strong>and<strong> Amoury Ranger </strong>(of<strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/francoisinbristol\">Francois &amp; the Atlas Mountains</a></strong>), <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/roziplain\">Rozi Plain</a> and <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/rachaeldadd\">Rachael Dadd</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>“Treehouse”</strong>, an exclusive to this release, is the perfect soundtrack to a lazy summers day and a live favourite to boot. Featuring Jesse D Vernon of <strong><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/jessedvernon\">Morningstar</a></strong> on bass and demonstrating Kate’s trumpet skills, this sunny toe-tapper is an excellent accompaniment the album track on the a-side.</p>\r\n<p>As ever with <strong>Need No Water</strong> releases the 7” is beautifully presented, coming on <strong>white vinyl</strong> with included download code (or simply as a download for those without record players).</p>\r\n<p><strong>This Is The Kit</strong> will be doing a short tour of the UK in September and October, and will be performing live radio sessions during that time, starting with <strong>BBC Bristol Introducing</strong> on Sept 2nd.

Released on white 7” vinyl , this extra-special limited single has Soy Un Caballo's French version of This Is The Kits' Birchwood Beaker on the A-side, with the original version on the flip. Soy Un Caballo (Spanish for “I am a horse”) are Belgian couple Thomas Van Cottom and Aurelie Muller , who write and perform songs of exquisite fragility. They record them in Brussels with an amazing line up of musicians such as Bonnie ‘Prince' Billy (Will Oldham) and producer Sean O'Hagan (The High Llamas).\r\n\r\nThis is the Kit is the project of Kate Stables who was discovered whilst touring and playing concerts in Paris with the likes of the National, Elysian Fields, Jose Gonzales, Clogs and Jeffrey Lewis. BBC Radio One's Huw Stephens has called her one of the 'rising female stars' of the modern folk movement, and her Two Wooden Spoons single was released on Rob Da Bank's label Sunday Best. Birchwood Beaker is taken from Kate's last album Krulle Bol , which was produced by composer and PJ Harvey collaborator John Parish.\r\n\r\n“ We've had a kind of love at first sight with this song,” says, Thomas Van Cottom about  Birchwood Beaker , “It's magic, pure, and Kate's voice makes you feel close to a flying angel!” After translating the song into French they wanted to evoke wood and snow in their arrangements, “The idea was to build a movie scene,” says Thomas. It's fascinating to hear the two treatments – This Is the Kit's delicate autumnal warmth, and the Belgians' wintry atmospheric horn arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Soy Un Caballo have taken her song 'Birchwood Beaker' and made it their own. Its haunting arrangements and enigmatic vocals make for 4.43 minutes of pure music bliss.\" (SoundsXP)\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn’t say I prefer one over the other, because they’re almost entirely different songs, and it’s remarkable to hear the two versions in succession. This is a credit to both Kate, for the quality of songwriting, and Soy Un Caballo, for the quality of their musicianship and sensitive yet very different interpretation of her material.

She's already had two successful 7 inch releases featuring songs focused purely on the sound of guitar and voice, she's been called “a classic example of DIY music at it's best” by Fact , and she also co-owns and runs her own record label; Need No Water . So it may be a surprise to those following her career so far that this release is the first in a trilogy of EPs with a new focus on collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe idea started by building on songs that Catriona had been writing with her friend Philippa Latimer. Catriona was so excited by the material that resulted from this approach that she decided to work with Dale Grundle of The Sleeping Years on two of these songs; title track \" Sitting On The Shelf Without Shelly \" and \" Untitled \" . Together they enrolled the talents of two other The Sleeping Years members ; Alex Beamont on Cello for \" Untitled \" and Tom Page on drums for \" Sitting On The Shelf \". Taking further inspiration from the collaborating sensibilities of Belgian friends Soy Un Caballo , who have released split singles with Tunng and This is The Kit on Catriona's label this year, Irving embraced the welcoming nature of fellow musicians in Europe. She recorded “ Untitled ” in Brussels with Thomas from Soy Un Caballo and put their vibes to good use for the track in the process.\r\n\r\nWhile the focus of these tracks is still firmly on Catriona's voice and her gift for melody, the extra layers of instrumentation show a progression into a different sound to her previous releases. Tom's drums on “ Sitting on the Shelf ” propel the song into a radio-friendly toe-tapper, while Alex's Cello on “ Untitled ” makes a delicate but wonderfully melancholic addition to the already fragile love song. Short but spellbinding track “ Measurements ” is included on the EP as a lone solo performance from Catriona, reminiscent of previous releases that fans will love.\r\n\r\nIn a further European connection, Paris-based DJ Julien Plaisir De France ( http://www.myspace.com/julienplaisirde ), picked up a copy of Catriona's first single, “ Running on Empathy” on a trip to London. He loved Catriona's voice and got in touch via myspace, and from then on they kept in contact, eventually leading to the idea of Julien remixing some of Catriona's songs. Catriona sent Julien the parts to one of her and Philippa's songs, \" Sitting On the Shelf Without Shelly \" and he returned with his remix of fantastically layered vocals, drums and synths, all centered around Catriona's original melody building up into a chopped-up french disco finale! Everyone involved loved the remix and immediately the decision was made to include it on the first of the EPs alongside the original version. The French seem to love the track just as much; thanks to the Parisian connection Catriona's popularity is already steaming ahead in France in advance of the release. Having already been picked up and featured on France 2's documentary \" Rendez-vous en terre Inconnue \", the “ Sitting On The Shelf ” remix has already had over 20,000 plays on Fairtilizer.com a very popular site with French music fans, so now it's time for the UK! \r\n\r\nThe EP is also available from iTunes here:\r\n<a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?i=333181803&id=333181732&s=143444&uo=6\"><img height=\"15\" width=\"61\" alt=\"Catriona Irving - Sitting on the Shelf - EP\" src=\"http://ax.itunes.apple.com/images/badgeitunes61x15dark.gif\" /></a>\r\n","options":[{"id":1736037,"name":"Female T-shirt size S","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":1736042,"name":"Female T-shirt size M","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":1736043,"name":"Female T-shirt size L","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":1736045,"name":"Male T-shirt size S","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":1736046,"name":"Male T-shirt size M","price":17.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":1736047,"name":"Male T-shirt size L","price":17.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3664784/-/catTpack.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3664784/-/catTpack.png","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3664844/-/t-shirtpack.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3664844/-/t-shirtpack.png","width":397,"height":397},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3664876/-/catbadge_pack.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3664876/-/catbadge_pack.png","width":614,"height":614}],"artists":[{"id":8911,"name":"Catriona Irving","permalink":"catriona-irving","url":"/artist/catriona-irving"}],"categories":[{"id":310284,"name":"T-shirts","permalink":"t-shirts","url":"/category/t-shirts"},{"id":310292,"name":"7 inch vinyl","permalink":"7-inch-vinyl","url":"/category/7-inch-vinyl"},{"id":310293,"name":"7 inch vinyl with download","permalink":"7-inch-vinyl-with-download","url":"/category/7-inch-vinyl-with-download"},{"id":310294,"name":"download","permalink":"download","url":"/category/download"},{"id":310295,"name":"badges","permalink":"badges","url":"/category/badges"}]},{"id":390403,"name":"Soy Un Caballo & Tunng - Robin (needno005) DIGITAL ONLY - VINYL SOLD OUT","permalink":"soy-un-caballo-tunng-robin-needno005","position":21,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/soy-un-caballo-tunng-robin-needno005","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-09-07T19:57:54.000Z","description":"1.

Released exclusively on gold 7” vinyl, this extra-special limited single has Tunng's version of Soy Un Caballo's Robin on the A-side, with the band's original version on the flip.\r\n\r\n“We met Soy Un Caballo on tour in Belgium and France and ended up drinking wine and swapping numbers,” says Tunng frontman Sam Genders. “We kept in touch and they asked if we'd be up for doing an English version of one of their songs for a seven. I remembered Robin from seeing them play live and it was my favourite.”\r\n\r\nSam translated the song from a rough version that the band sent over, then recorded it at Tunng central in London. It's fascinating to hear the two treatments – Tunng's typical fireside warmth, and the Belgians' delicately trippy original.\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful Belgian lush pop, with Robin being 2009's best smoochy song so far.
