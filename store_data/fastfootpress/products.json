A REPRINT WILL BE AVAILABLE IN A WEEK. PLEASE EMAIL sales@fastfootpress.co.uk AND WE'LL CONTACT YOU WHEN IT'S AVAILABLE. \r\n\r\nA Lancaster Alphabet: Letterforms from the Stones of the City, is a study of Lancaster's hidden architectural lettering that uses these often negelcted and largely unseen elements to explore the social history of the urban environment. \r\n\r\nThe twenty-six letters of the alphabet span almost 1800 years of Lancaster's history, with each letter and its location providing insights into the development of Lancaster's industry and socio-political development, as well as discussion of the design features of the letters themselves and reproductions of historical documents.\r\n\r\nThe work was part of a two-year study of architectural lettering in  the city. The book includes photographs of each of the twenty-six letterforms, a guide map to their location, a glossary of architectural and design terms and suggested further reading.\r\n\r\nFormat: A5 (148mm wide x 210mm high), softcover with dustjacket\r\nBinding: perfect bound and stitched\r\nPages: 96\r\nISBN: 978-0-9571922-0-1","options":[{"id":24265017,"name":"Default","price":11.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":6.75,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/79460541/-/bc_portrait_alphabetCover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/79460541/-/bc_portrait_alphabetCover.jpg","width":566,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/77029320/-/bigcartelProducts_LAND_alphabet1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/77029320/-/bigcartelProducts_LAND_alphabet1.jpg","width":1000,"height":666},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/77030112/-/bigcartelProducts_LAND_alphabet3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/77030112/-/bigcartelProducts_LAND_alphabet3.jpg","width":1000,"height":666}],"artists":[{"id":153807,"name":"Si Hawkesworth","permalink":"si-hawkesworth","url":"/artist/si-hawkesworth"}],"categories":[{"id":3881274,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":10456327,"name":"The Winton Murder: A Tale of Crime and Punishment","permalink":"the-winton-murder-a-tale-of-crime-and-punishment","position":2,"price":3.5,"default_price":3.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-winton-murder-a-tale-of-crime-and-punishment","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-10T08:50:30.000Z","description":"During the nineteenth century the broadside ballad was a common form of popular entertainement an social comment. Produced on single sheets of cheap paper and sold in their thousands, these songs often commemorated events such as trials and executions. One such event was the notorious 'Winton Murder' of 1826. The slaying of Elizabeth Bate at the Jolly Carter pub in Winton, Cheshire, led to the capture of Alexander and Michael McKean. Tried and executed at LANCASTER CASTLE, the brothers suffered the fate of many who fell foul of the criminal justice system of the 1800s. \r\n\r\nThis pamphlet 'The Winton Murder: A Tale of Crime and Punishment'  looks at the events commemorated in the ballad, drawing on the original broadside and other historical documents, as well as considering the typographical and illustrative features found in this intriguing ephemeral remnant from the past.\r\n\r\nThis is our first in the series entitled the Ephemeral Editions that looks at the stories behind these often overlooked fragments of social and design history.\r\n\r\nSize: 148mm w x 210mm h\r\nStock: Fedrigoni paper\r\nBinding: Staple \r\nPages: 16pp ","options":[{"id":32749696,"name":"Default","price":3.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":0.6,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.6,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":0.6,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":0.6}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124685556/-/DSC_0736.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124685556/-/DSC_0736.JPG","width":3872,"height":2592},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124685562/-/DSC_0763.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124685562/-/DSC_0763.JPG","width":3872,"height":2592},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124685565/-/DSC_0767.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124685565/-/DSC_0767.JPG","width":3872,"height":2592}],"artists":[{"id":153807,"name":"Si Hawkesworth","permalink":"si-hawkesworth","url":"/artist/si-hawkesworth"},{"id":192538,"name":"Michael Murphy","permalink":"michael-murphy","url":"/artist/michael-murphy"}],"categories":[{"id":3881274,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":14713710,"name":"Sum of the Parts: Serif A - Handmade Booklet","permalink":"sum-of-the-parts-serif-a-handmade-booklet","position":3,"price":9.0,"default_price":9.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sum-of-the-parts-serif-a-handmade-booklet","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-08T18:44:56.000Z","description":"This handmade booklet is a study of the the interaction of letterforms found on the buildings and memorials of the city of Lancaster.
