Every day since then, Penn’s simple notes, created with nothing more than a pen and a sticky pad, have been photographed and then left in public—on a park bench, at a bus stop—anonymously and hopefully, to spread a little goodwill and brighten someone’s day.\r\n\r\nCollected in book form, they serve as a heartfelt reminder about what matters most.\r\n\r\n- perfect-bound paperback: 288 pages\r\n- product dimensions: 7.4 x 5.1 x 0.8 inches\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nPlease note that we ship from Singapore and items may take 5-10 business days to arrive :)","options":[{"id":48179739,"name":"Default","price":26.8,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127619316/-/J_J_Penn_Things_We_Forget_001.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127619316/-/J_J_Penn_Things_We_Forget_001.jpg","width":700,"height":525},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127619319/-/J_J_Penn_Things_We_Forget_002.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127619319/-/J_J_Penn_Things_We_Forget_002.jpg","width":700,"height":525},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127619322/-/J_J_Penn_Things_We_Forget_003.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127619322/-/J_J_Penn_Things_We_Forget_003.jpg","width":700,"height":525}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4111404,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":14863743,"name":"The Hunt Singapore","permalink":"the-hunt-singapore","position":12,"price":21.0,"default_price":21.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-hunt-singapore","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-15T06:03:33.000Z","description":"<u>// The Hunt Singapore</u>\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nAs the sun dawns over this tiny red dot, Singapore’s wet markets are already abuzz with the shouts and laughter of locals snapping up fresh fish, veggies and fruit for the day’s meals to come. Chickens pace and squawk in their cages, freshly caught fish splatter water about in plastic tubs and wrinkled old men sit idly by smoking, a game of Chinese chess just begun. This is the Singapore you don’t read about in the Financial Times, a marvelous food mecca bursting with Asian flavor and hidden gems, a wanderer’s paradise.\r\n\r\nWhile there may be a nugget of truth in what you hear about the heavy handed law, the Singapore we know is an easygoing town with clean streets, friendly locals and nonexistent crime. In our experience, the best way to explore Singapore is by foot. Though the days can certainly be warm (we’re on the equator after all), the sidewalks are generally shady and the most interesting areas of town are easily within walking distance of each other.

We seek to share Singaporean creative work in the form of prose, poetry, social commentaries, photography, and visual art. We wish to record and share these without inhibition, to celebrate these everyday musings.\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of this project are humble: whilst examining the local arts scene, we found many outlets for artistic expressions. However, most of these outlets concentrate on art or exclusively on one medium of expression over the other. Publications for local writing are even harder to come by, and cater mainly to professional and full time writers. Since then, it has been our dream to provide that space: a space that is neither too formal nor flippant, that combines word and form.\r\n\r\nConsequently, we exist to provide an informal space for experimental or up-and-coming writers and artists to express themselves—here we present to you interesting works outside of awards and accolades that are created by ordinary observers with a pen and a voice.\r\n\r\nEvery name has a back-story, and this is ours: Ceriphs are semi structural details on the ends of alphabetical fonts that make up letters and symbols. Likewise, we hope to be the book covers and endings of these Singaporean creative pieces, to provide structural support—but at the end of the day, we hope that they speak for themselves, for you, and to you.\r\n\r\n- staplebound paperback : 70 pages \r\n- product dimensions: 22 x 15.1 x 0.8 cm\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nPlease note that we ship from Singapore and items may take 5-10 business days to arrive :)","options":[{"id":47933937,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127433805/-/Ceriph__06_001_S.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127433805/-/Ceriph__06_001_S.jpg","width":700,"height":525},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127433814/-/Ceriph__06_002_S.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127433814/-/Ceriph__06_002_S.jpg","width":700,"height":525},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127433823/-/Ceriph__06_003_S.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127433823/-/Ceriph__06_003_S.jpg","width":700,"height":525}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4111404,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":4111434,"name":"Math Paper Press","permalink":"math-paper-press","url":"/category/math-paper-press"}]},{"id":14765853,"name":"BEIJING by Angeline Teo","permalink":"beijing-by-angeline-teo","position":14,"price":16.8,"default_price":16.8,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/beijing-by-angeline-teo","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-11T09:00:20.000Z","description":"<u>// BEIJING</u>\r\na photo publication by Angeline Teo\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nAngeline Teo is a passionate photographer whose love lies in black-and-white film photography.

A poet gazes upon his older partner, pondering the inevitable.

A band of swordsmen on a failed mission. The forbidden love of Zheng He, the great Chinese Admiral. A young daughter forming a strange bond with her deceased father’s cat. Presenting ten stories in his fifth collection, O Thiam Chin plumbs the joy and despair, hopes and fears of men and women caught up by their past and confounded by lost loves. Taut, dark and visceral, these stories reveal, once again, the mysteries that lie in the heart of man.\r\n\r\nPraise for <i>The Rest Of Your Life And Everything That Comes With It:</i>\r\n“Three qualities in particular make this collection noteworthy: the emotional precision with which O writes about a variety of human experiences, the incisiveness with which he depicts the darker sides of human nature and the way he unifies twelve disparate stories. These skills, combined with his economic writing style, do much to explain why his work is quickly generating acclaim... While the effect of O’s writing is sometimes uncomfortable, it is also memorable. His mastery of emotional detail leaves a lasting, and often haunting, impression.”\r\n— Cha: An Asian Literary Journal\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nPlease note that we ship from Singapore and items may take 5-10 business days to arrive :)","options":[{"id":47309307,"name":"Default","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126961566/-/Love_or_Something_Like_Love_001_S.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126961566/-/Love_or_Something_Like_Love_001_S.jpg","width":700,"height":525},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126961569/-/Love_or_Something_Like_Love_002_S.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126961569/-/Love_or_Something_Like_Love_002_S.jpg","width":700,"height":525}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4111404,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":4111434,"name":"Math Paper Press","permalink":"math-paper-press","url":"/category/math-paper-press"}]},{"id":14605746,"name":"The Monsters Between Us by Jason Wee","permalink":"the-monsters-between-us-by-jason-wee","position":23,"price":16.0,"default_price":16.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-monsters-between-us-by-jason-wee","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-04T07:03:22.000Z","description":"<u>// The Monsters Between Us</u>\r\npoems by Jason Wee\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nIn his debut poetry collection, Jason Wee returns to ‘1987’, the installation work he first introduced to art audiences at the first Singapore Biennale in 2006.\r\n\r\nThe monsters Wee renders are present creatures, some cruelly alive, each shadowed by a long tail of mastery and mortality.

By turns funny and sobering, playful and philosophical, <i>What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</i> is rich and revelatory, both for fans of this masterful yet guardedly private writer and for the exploding population of athletes who find similar satisfaction in athletic pursuit.\r\n\r\n- perfect-bound paperback : 192 pages \r\n- product dimensions: 0.6 x 5.1 x 7.9 inches\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nPlease note that we ship from Singapore and items may take 5-10 business days to arrive :)","options":[{"id":43671819,"name":"Default","price":29.8,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124436526/-/whatitalkaboutwhenitalkaboutrunning001.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124436526/-/whatitalkaboutwhenitalkaboutrunning001.jpg","width":700,"height":525},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124436532/-/whatitalkaboutwhenitalkaboutrunning002.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124436532/-/whatitalkaboutwhenitalkaboutrunning002.jpg","width":700,"height":525}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4111404,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":13617018,"name":"Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami","permalink":"kafka-on-the-shore-by-haruki-murakami","position":46,"price":29.8,"default_price":29.8,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kafka-on-the-shore-by-haruki-murakami","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-17T11:26:05.000Z","description":"<u>// Kafka on the Shore</u>\r\nby Haruki Murakami\r\n\r\n<i>Kafka on the Shore</i> is powered by two remarkable characters: a teenage boy, Kafka Tamura, who runs away from home either to escape a gruesome oedipal prophecy or to search for his long-missing mother and sister; and an aging simpleton called Nakata, who never recovered from a wartime affliction and now is drawn toward Kafka for reasons that, like the most basic activities of daily life, he cannot fathom.\r\n\r\nAs their paths converge, and the reasons for that convergence become clear, Haruki Murakami enfolds readers in a world where cats talk, fish fall from the sky, and spirits slip out of their bodies to make love or commit murder. <i>Kafka on the Shore</i> displays one of the world’s great storytellers at the peak of his powers.\r\n\r\n- perfect-bound paperback : 480 pages \r\n- product dimensions: 5.1 x 1 x 8 inches\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nPlease note that we ship from Singapore and items may take 5-10 business days to arrive :)","options":[{"id":43671408,"name":"Default","price":29.8,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124436283/-/kafkaontheshore001.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124436283/-/kafkaontheshore001.jpg","width":700,"height":525},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124436295/-/kafkaontheshore002.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124436295/-/kafkaontheshore002.jpg","width":700,"height":525}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4111404,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":13616931,"name":"Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami","permalink":"norwegian-wood-by-haruki-murakami","position":47,"price":27.8,"default_price":27.8,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/norwegian-wood-by-haruki-murakami","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-17T11:20:11.000Z","description":"<u>// Norwegian Wood</u>\r\nby Haruki Murakami\r\n\r\nToru, a quiet and preternaturally serious young college student in Tokyo, is devoted to Naoko, a beautiful and introspective young woman, but their mutual passion is marked by the tragic death of their best friend years before.

As his escapades unfold, we learn something of Allan's earlier life in which - remarkably - he helped to make the atom bomb, became friends with American presidents, Russian tyrants, and Chinese leaders, and was a participant behind the scenes in many key events of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nAlready a huge bestseller across Europe, <i>The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared</i> is a fun, feel-good book for all ages.\r\n\r\n- perfect-bound paperback : 400 pages \r\n- product dimensions: 19.8 x 13 x 3.2 cm\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nPlease note that we ship from Singapore and items may take 5-10 business days to arrive :)","options":[{"id":42392223,"name":"Default","price":21.8,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123532284/-/Jonas_Jonasson_The_Hundred-Year-Old_Man_001.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123532284/-/Jonas_Jonasson_The_Hundred-Year-Old_Man_001.jpg","width":700,"height":525},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123532290/-/Jonas_Jonasson_The_Hundred-Year-Old_Man_002.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123532290/-/Jonas_Jonasson_The_Hundred-Year-Old_Man_002.jpg","width":700,"height":525}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4111404,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":13105644,"name":"Ellice Handy's My Favourite Recipes","permalink":"ellice-handy-s-my-favourite-recipes","position":56,"price":49.22,"default_price":49.22,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ellice-handy-s-my-favourite-recipes","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-22T06:09:57.000Z","description":"<u>// Ellice Handy's My Favourite Recipes</u>\r\npublished by Landmark Books\r\n\r\nFirst published in 1952 and the subject of numerous reprints and editions, Mrs Ellice Handy's <i>My Favourite Recipes</i> is an acclaimed classic among cookbooks published in Singapore and Malaysia.\r\n\r\nThis fresh edition once again makes available Mrs Handy's time-tested and easy-to-use recipes for the modern cook.

The postwar years have brought him a fine marriage, two daughters, and an enviable career as the proprietor of two jazz clubs.

And a boyhood memory of a wise, lonely girl named Shimamoto clouds his heart. \r\n\r\nWhen Shimamoto shows up one rainy night, now a breathtaking beauty with a secret from which she is unable to escape, the fault lines of doubt in Hajime's quotidian existence begin to give way.

However, most of these outlets concentrate on art or exclusively on one medium of expression over the other. Publications for local writing are even harder to come by, and cater mainly to professional and full time writers. Since then, it has been our dream to provide that space: a space that is neither too formal nor flippant, that combines word and form.\r\n\r\nConsequently, we exist to provide an informal space for experimental or up-and-coming writers and artists to express themselves—here we present to you interesting works outside of awards and accolades that are created by ordinary observers with a pen and a voice.\r\n\r\nEvery name has a back-story, and this is ours: Ceriphs are semi structural details on the ends of alphabetical fonts that make up letters and symbols. Likewise, we hope to be the book covers and endings of these Singaporean creative pieces, to provide structural support—but at the end of the day, we hope that they speak for themselves, for you, and to you.\r\n\r\n- paperback with cover flap : 100 pages \r\n- product dimensions: 22 x 15.1 x 0.8 cm\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nPlease note that we ship from Singapore and items may take 5-10 business days to arrive :)","options":[{"id":41257086,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122707194/-/Ceriph_Issue_5_001.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122707194/-/Ceriph_Issue_5_001.jpg","width":700,"height":525},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122707203/-/Ceriph_Issue_5_002.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122707203/-/Ceriph_Issue_5_002.jpg","width":700,"height":525},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122707215/-/Ceriph_Issue_5_005.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122707215/-/Ceriph_Issue_5_005.jpg","width":700,"height":525},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122707227/-/Ceriph_Issue_5_006.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122707227/-/Ceriph_Issue_5_006.jpg","width":700,"height":525},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122707230/-/Ceriph_Issue_5_007.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122707230/-/Ceriph_Issue_5_007.jpg","width":700,"height":525}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4111404,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":4111434,"name":"Math Paper Press","permalink":"math-paper-press","url":"/category/math-paper-press"}]},{"id":12734952,"name":"What Not to Write by Kay Sayce","permalink":"what-not-to-write-by-kay-sayce","position":76,"price":22.0,"default_price":22.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/what-not-to-write-by-kay-sayce","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-02T09:09:34.000Z","description":"<u>// What Not to Write</u>\r\nby Kay Sayce\r\n\r\nAn invaluable, entertaining and information-packed A to Z guide that answers all those questions you might hear one person asking another in an office, such as :\r\n\r\nIs it 'a hotel' or 'an hotel' ?\r\nWhat are split infinitives, and should you avoid them ?\r\nDo you know when to use 'that' or 'which' ?\r\nIs a semi-colon like a comma ?

He draws inspiration from censored histories, subsumed myths and invokes imagined voices from the exiled, demanding of the reader to witness the ubiquitous ideological fictions that surround us.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most dissonant and penetrating voices in Singapore poetry.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nPlease note that we ship from Singapore and items may take 5-10 business days to arrive :)","options":[{"id":38779446,"name":"Default","price":20.88,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120577770/-/ahistoryofamnesia1.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120577770/-/ahistoryofamnesia1.png","width":715,"height":525},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120577782/-/ahistoryofamnesia2.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120577782/-/ahistoryofamnesia2.png","width":715,"height":525}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4111404,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":12195549,"name":"Malay Sketches by Alfian Sa'at","permalink":"malay-sketches-by-alfian-sa-at","position":84,"price":24.98,"default_price":24.98,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/malay-sketches-by-alfian-sa-at","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-05T09:53:34.000Z","description":"<u>// Malay Sketches</u>\r\nby Alfian Sa'at\r\n\r\n<i>Malay Sketches</i> is a collection of stories that borrows its name from a book of anecdotes by colonial governor Frank Swettenham, describing Malay life on the Peninsula.

Being creative makes life more fun and interesting. However, it is a common belief that creativity is something you are born with and others can only envy.\r\n\r\nIn <i>Change Your Mind</i>, Rod Judkins reveals that creative people are not especially that creative after all. Rather, their gift is that they believe they are creative, and because of this, they are. Many of these people lack traditional artistic abilities (Bacon couldn't draw, so he didn't; Warhol couldn't paint, so he didn't) but that doesn't stop them from thinking of themselves as creative. This self-belief accounts for 90 per cent of the reason why they became the best. Creativity is a skill that everyone can learn, and everyone can benefit from.\r\n\r\nWhether you're trying to start your own business, write music, come up with ideas at work, solve problems or just change your way of looking at the world. Follow the 57 insider tips, which include nuggets of wisdom like the importance of focus, why you should never wait for inspiration, and how you should always turn a failure into a success. With real-life insights into writers, artists and musicians including Cezanne, Lennon and McCartney, Picasso and more, <i>Change Your Mind</i> will unlock the creative genius you always had inside you.\r\n\r\n- hardcover : 128 pages \r\n- product dimensions: 18.8 x 14.2 x 2 cm\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nPlease note that we ship from Singapore and items may take 5-10 business days to arrive :)","options":[{"id":38632989,"name":"Default","price":22.2,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120170982/-/changeyourmind_001.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120170982/-/changeyourmind_001.jpg","width":700,"height":525},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120171006/-/changeyourmind_002.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120171006/-/changeyourmind_002.jpg","width":700,"height":525}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4111404,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":12178140,"name":"The End of Your Life Book Club by Will Schwalbe","permalink":"the-end-of-your-life-book-club-by-will-schwalbe","position":86,"price":20.88,"default_price":20.88,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-end-of-your-life-book-club-by-will-schwalbe","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-04T06:02:21.000Z","description":"<u>// The End of Your Life Book Club</u>\r\nby Will Schwalbe\r\n\r\nJoin Will and his mother Mary Anne in a very special two-member book club, as they read life-changing books from <i>Suite Française</i>, <i>Brooklyn</i> and <i>The Elegance of the Hedgehog</i> to discoveries life <i>Crossing to Safety</i> and <i>People of the Book</i>.

It's a joyful, industry-wide celebration of our bricks-and-mortar stores and a clarion call to readers everywhere at a time when the value and importance of these stores should be shouted from the rooftops.\r\n\r\nPerfectly charming line drawings by Leif Parsons illustrate each storefront and other distinguishing features of the shops.\r\n\r\n- hardcover with dustjacket : 384 pages\r\n- product dimensions: 14.5 x 22.8 x 3.5 cm\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nPlease note that we ship from Singapore and items may take 5-10 business days to arrive :)","options":[{"id":37061634,"name":"Default","price":36.8,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/115522554/-/Richard_Russo_My_Bookstore_001.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/115522554/-/Richard_Russo_My_Bookstore_001.jpg","width":700,"height":525},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/115522566/-/Richard_Russo_My_Bookstore_002.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/115522566/-/Richard_Russo_My_Bookstore_002.jpg","width":700,"height":525},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/115522590/-/Richard_Russo_My_Bookstore_003.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/115522590/-/Richard_Russo_My_Bookstore_003.jpg","width":700,"height":525}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4111404,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":11714058,"name":"Vagabond by A P Wolf","permalink":"vagabond-by-a-p-wolf","position":93,"price":28.0,"default_price":28.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/vagabond-by-a-p-wolf","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-11T08:56:06.000Z","description":"<u>// Vagabond</u>\r\nby A P Wolf\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nSet in 1960s Singapore, Vagabond is the story of twenty-four hour drinking, cock fights, mah-jong, and unsafe sex in the kampongs and back alleys of old Singapore.

Forty-seven years ago Singapore separated from Malaysia. Since then, the two countries have developed along their own paths. Malaysia has given preference to the majority Malay Muslims—the bumiputera, or sons of the soil. Singapore, meanwhile, has tried to build a meritocracy—ostensibly colour-blind, yet more encouraging perhaps to some Singaporeans than to others. How have these policies affected ordinary people ? How do these two divergent nations now see each other and the world around them ?\r\n\r\nSeeking answers to these questions, two Singaporeans set off to cycle around Peninsular Malaysia, armed with a tent, two pairs of clothes and a daily budget of three US dollars each. They spent 30 days on the road, cycling through every Malaysian state, and chatting with hundreds of Malaysians. Not satisfied, they then move on to interview many more people in Malaysia and Singapore. What they found are two countries that have developed economically but are still struggling to find their souls.\r\n\r\n- perfect-bound with cover flap paperback \r\n- product dimensions: 15.3 x 22.9 x 1.9 cm \r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nPlease note that we ship from Singapore and items may take 5-10 business days to arrive :)","options":[{"id":35130783,"name":"Default","price":37.8,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":6.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109804329/-/Sudhir_Thomas_Vadaketh_Floating_on_a_Malayan_Breeze.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109804329/-/Sudhir_Thomas_Vadaketh_Floating_on_a_Malayan_Breeze.jpg","width":700,"height":525},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109804473/-/floatingmalayan002.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109804473/-/floatingmalayan002.jpg","width":700,"height":525}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4111404,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":10905252,"name":"101 Things I Learned in Architecture School","permalink":"101-things-i-learned-in-architecture-school","position":97,"price":29.0,"default_price":29.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/101-things-i-learned-in-architecture-school","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-02T08:19:38.000Z","description":"<u>// 101 Things I Learned in Architecture School</u>\r\nby Matthew Frederick\r\n\r\nThis is a book that students of architecture will want to keep in the studio and in their backpacks.

Growing up suggests an inexorable shift to adult sensibilites, but this transition is fraught with countervailing tensions of moving on, letting go and leaving behind. Yet, the collection ends with an optimism that is both agonising and courageous in its desperation for hope.\r\n\r\nAlternately lyrical and experimental, confessional and incisive, Yam flexes his poetic versatility by combining ruthless introspection and hard-won catharsis. The ensuing redefinition of boundaries, between what must be left unsaid and what seeks reiteration, holds testimony to a voice that is unafraid of frankness—a voice ready to spearhead the next generation of Singaporean literature.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nPlease note that we ship from Singapore and items may take 5-10 business days to arrive :)","options":[{"id":26073423,"name":"Default","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81362469/-/Jerrold_Yam_CHASING_CURTAINED_SUNS_001_S.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81362469/-/Jerrold_Yam_CHASING_CURTAINED_SUNS_001_S.jpg","width":700,"height":525},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81362538/-/Jerrold_Yam_CHASING_CURTAINED_SUNS_002_S.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81362538/-/Jerrold_Yam_CHASING_CURTAINED_SUNS_002_S.jpg","width":700,"height":525},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81517581/-/chasing001.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81517581/-/chasing001.jpg","width":700,"height":525}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4111404,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":4111434,"name":"Math Paper Press","permalink":"math-paper-press","url":"/category/math-paper-press"}]},{"id":8275428,"name":"Unmarked Treasure by Cyril Wong","permalink":"unmarked-treasure-by-cyril-wong","position":154,"price":16.0,"default_price":16.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/unmarked-treasure-by-cyril-wong","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-29T16:15:59.000Z","description":"<u>// Unmarked Treasure</u>\r\npoems by Cyril Wong\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nA ghost steps out of its body after a suicide and looks back at it in wonder.

Determination though, is the last thing that gets her what she wants and the gods teasingly unveil themselves when she least expects it.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nPlease note that we ship from Singapore and items may take 5-10 business days to arrive :)","options":[{"id":26072787,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81359781/-/Vinita_Ramani_Mohan_PAVARTHI_DREAMS_ABOUT_HIS_SEX_001_S.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81359781/-/Vinita_Ramani_Mohan_PAVARTHI_DREAMS_ABOUT_HIS_SEX_001_S.jpg","width":700,"height":525},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81359805/-/Vinita_Ramani_Mohan_PAVARTHI_DREAMS_ABOUT_HIS_SEX_002_S.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81359805/-/Vinita_Ramani_Mohan_PAVARTHI_DREAMS_ABOUT_HIS_SEX_002_S.jpg","width":700,"height":525},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81504105/-/pavarthi001.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81504105/-/pavarthi001.jpg","width":700,"height":525}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4111404,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":4111434,"name":"Math Paper Press","permalink":"math-paper-press","url":"/category/math-paper-press"}]},{"id":8275164,"name":"a place on earth by tracey sullivan","permalink":"a-place-on-earth-by-tracey-sullivan","position":159,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/a-place-on-earth-by-tracey-sullivan","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-29T15:56:04.000Z","description":"Babette's Feast No. XII\r\n\r\n<u>// a place on earth</u>\r\na string of poems\r\nby tracey sullivan\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nThe world has never been smaller or easier to navigate.
