While these mixed coffees are still specialty grade and can taste wonderful, there is undoubtedly a difference between a specific, unblended Lintong and a blended Mandheling.\r\n\r\nThe coffee-growing process in Lintong is steeped in generations of tradition and central to the culture of the Batak people who farm this remarkable coffee bean. Chemical fertilizer is virtually unknown to the Batak and they use manual pulley systems to well the water feeding their Microlot farms using manure from their livestock as natural fertilizer. 'Organic' farming is simply the traditional method there.\r\n\r\nOnce their coffee is harvested, it is processed using a wet-hulling method called “giling basah” which gives the coffee more body and the character that makes it so appealing and unique. \r\n\r\nWe offer a medium roast for our Pure Lintong, exuding Grapefruit-Citrus, Heavy-bodied Treacle and zesty chilly characteristics.

This is incredibly kind to the coffee preserving the life and flavour in the beans. A slightly different, darker roast and we suggest slightly longer brewing/extraction times to achieve the same buttery sweetness, well balanced pleasing acidity in the cup and distinct Almond notes we enjoy in the unprocessed beans.\r\n\r\nWe stand by this 100% as gourmet coffee and you can drink it all day long. We guarrantee this will change all your preconceptions of 'decaf' \r\n\r\nSent securely via Next Day courier service, recorded & tracked.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPlease allow up to 48hrs for us to prepare your order fresh. \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n* Choose below to receive our coffee as fresh roast beans or have your delivery ground to order.\r\n","options":[{"id":25177596,"name":"Beans","price":6.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25177599,"name":"Grind : Espresso","price":6.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25177602,"name":"Grind : Aeropress","price":6.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25177605,"name":"Grind : Filter /French Press","price":6.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/78352596/-/Decaf_FRONT250.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/78352596/-/Decaf_FRONT250.jpg","width":369,"height":764}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2890867,"name":"Coffee","permalink":"coffee","url":"/category/coffee"}]},{"id":8076549,"name":"FOUNDRY No.1 ESPRESSO BLEND (1KG)","permalink":"foundry-no-1-espresso-blend-1kg","position":14,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/foundry-no-1-espresso-blend-1kg","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-19T15:46:53.000Z","description":"ARTISAN ESPRESSO BLEND\r\n\r\nRainforest Alliance Certified\r\n\r\n40% EL SALVADOR RFA SHG, 40% BRASIL SANTOS 2/3, 20% PURE SUMATRA LINTONG TOBA\r\n\r\nWe spent a long time selecting beans and refining various blends ahead of opening on Foundry Lane in 2012 and of course we won't ever stop exploring the world's coffee so this really marks the beginning of the OCC story.\r\n\r\nFOUNDRY No.1 is just that; our finest blend.\r\n\r\nAll 3 beans stand up as Single Origin Specials in their own right, offering excellent value for money.
