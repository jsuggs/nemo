The way we see it, if it's going to get destroyed between two pieces of cardboard and a ton of tape, a 7\" mailer wouldn't have done much better.  If you have any concerns regarding this, please email us at dwyer.records@gmail.com at the time of your order or leave us a note in the notes section of the paypal payment screen.  We will do the best we can to accomodate.  Please note the use of a 7\" mailer will raise the cost of shipping and you will be responsible for paying the difference.  7\"'s ordered with other records will of course be carefully packaged in an LP mailer.
