and Variations for Strings And Electronics\r\n\r\ni) The Shocking Reality of Reaching Midlife\r\nii) An Army of Narcoleptics That Swarm Upon Us\r\niii) The Jedi and the Selective Mute\r\niv) Sonata for Oscillator and Theremin - estinto\r\nv) Finale: Serenity in an Ocean of Storms\r\n\r\nPaul Catten first arrived on the scene in the late 90’s with hardcore lunatics Medulla Nocte and after two fierce albums, tour after tour, award nominations, he called it a day going on to form Murder One. Throughout the noughties Catten remained a prolific recording artist immersing himself in various styles of music. From the groove based metal of Murder One to the ultra doom of Lazarus Blackstar, taking in grindcore of his appearance on the Co-Exist album, his insane electronic noise project Stuntcock and the piano beauty of The Dark Half. Current band The Sontaran Experiment released their groundbreaking album in 2007, with cries of genius heaped upon it on its release. \r\n\r\nCatten has surrounded himself with his instruments of choice and morphed into the typical hermit (de)composer and has written his most haunting yet most beautiful music to date, “Themes and Variations….”. The album was written, recorded, mixed and mastered by Catten himself over the course of late 2010 to early 2011 resulting in a disturbingly dark amalgam of experimental noise and sumptuous classical compositions, recalling the likes of Ben Frost's acclaimed By The Throat album and Brian Reitzell's soundtrack for 30 Days Of Night. A truly impressive album.\r\n\r\nHand printed on an old victorian letterpress and limited to 200 copies\r\n\r\n\r\nStuntcock vs The Sontaran Experiment\r\n\r\nA split release between Stuntcock & The Sontaran Experiment. Stuntock brings an intense ride through harsh noise to ambience, via one person, a laptop and a whole bunch of effects.\r\nStuntcock then pushed the boundaries a little further in extremity with The Sontaran Experiment bringing together fellow Sontaran's to bring you crushing doom, blastbeats, harsh electronics/vocals and a beautiful prog feel combined. Immerse yourself into The Sontaran Experiment if you dare.

Cult – Run from the Light\r\n\r\nMonolith Cult debut album “Run from the Light” Heavy f**king rock fuelled by sounds of Goatsnake, Grief, Sabbath, Purple, Heep, Rainbow and Dio, described as “Good

I hope this is the start of many great things to come from this superb band. It is simply a stunning album I cannot recommend highly enough. – THE SLUDGELORD\r\n\r\n“And you can hear that clearly within this record. Not least in title track, Monolith Cult, a foot-stomping, fist-in-the-air rabble-rouser. Here the vocals are Joe Lynn Turner possessed by Ronnie James Dio, and, despite Bry’s candour, it works a bloody treat. The crooning rides beautifully atop Baines’ guitar, a tuned down riff machine that’s ever changing, ever-fluid and ever brilliant” - THE LAIR OF FILTH\r\n\r\n“Monolith Cult are able to accomplish throughout as one might hope, also giving a glimpse of where the foursome might be able to go with the sound their next time out. At around five and a half minutes in, it kicks into a steady thud that finishes the album with a moment of ultra-satisfying groove, giving a last-minute surprise to what’s already proven an impressive debut. - THE

Throughout the noughties Catten remained a prolific recording artist immersing himself in various styles of music. From the groove based metal of Murder One to the ultra doom of Lazarus Blackstar, taking in grindcore of his appearance on the Co-Exist album, his insane electronic noise project Stuntcock and the piano beauty of The Dark Half. Current band The Sontaran Experiment released their groundbreaking album in 2007, with cries of genius heaped upon it on its release. \r\n\r\nCatten has surrounded himself with his instruments of choice and morphed into the typical hermit (de)composer and has written his most haunting yet most beautiful music to date, “Themes and Variations….”. The album was written, recorded, mixed and mastered by Catten himself over the course of late 2010 to early 2011 resulting in a disturbingly dark amalgam of experimental noise and sumptuous classical compositions, recalling the likes of Ben Frost's acclaimed By The Throat album and Brian Reitzell's soundtrack for 30 Days Of Night.

legends in their Celtic homeland, Slomatics formed in Belfast in 2005, from the ashes of post-hardcore local heroes The Naut. According to the ‘Kalceanna’ album sleeve, Slomatics are “middle-aged professionals by day, agro-sludge losers by night”. They have names too: David (guitar); Chris (guitar) and new boy Marty (drums and vocals – he replaced long-time member Joe in 2011). It’s hard to pin their sound down. There is a more than a hint of a hardcore past and a good dash of the expansive sludge of early Melvins, but at the end of the day, Slomatics sound like Slomatics.\r\n\r\nCD Digi-Pack\r\n£8.00 UK

Walks is the first widely available cd release for Crucial Blast from Korperschwache after almost a decade of smaller, limited-run discs released through the label's Crucial Bliss sub-imprint. It's also the most focused work yet from this utterly demented Texas outfit that started out in the mid 90s as a pure noise project but gradually evolved into this weird, lumbering black-dirge that we hear now.\r\nThe eight songs that make up Evil Walks feature the signature Korperschwache moves: thumping minimal drum-machine pound courtesy of the relentlessly decisive Doktor Omega, droning dissonant riffs that veer from hypnotic noise to dismal quasi-black metal buzz, RKF's narcoleptic croaking and malevolent sneer bathed in reverb and amp skuzz, guitars humming and droning against cranked-up amps while creepy news sound bites, the distant sad howling of wolves and ear-piercing screams drift across the background...Strange post-punk reverberations rumble all throughout this disc, nothing new to those who are familiar with the myriad other Korperschwache discs that have come out since 2001 when RKF first began flirting with his odd mix of simple, mesmeric gloom-guitar and black mechanical slime, but it's never sounded better to my ears than it does here, when the music forms into this stoned blackened hypno-rock thing, the buzzing guitars and acid-scorched melodies looping over the skittery industrial beats and weird dubbed-out snares and concussive Godflesh-esque rhythms, turning into something that sounds remarkably like a mutant cross between late-80s British psych/drone rockers Loop and those notorious improv-black metal freakazoids Abruptum...\r\n\r\nCrucial Blast\r\n\r\n£7.00 UK (Including postage)\r\n£9.00 Non UK (Including postage)","options":[{"id":26545209,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/82995750/-/Crucial_Blast_CBR88a.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/82995750/-/Crucial_Blast_CBR88a.jpg","width":239,"height":211},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/82995789/-/Crucial_Blast_CBR88.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/82995789/-/Crucial_Blast_CBR88.jpg","width":483,"height":104}],"artists":[{"id":159807,"name":"Korperschwachek","permalink":"korperschwachek","url":"/artist/korperschwachek"}],"categories":[{"id":2415323,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":8439882,"name":"Sutcliffe Jugend - Blue Rabbit (CD)","permalink":"sutcliffe-jugend-blue-rabbit-cd","position":32,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sutcliffe-jugend-blue-rabbit-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-08T16:07:41.000Z","description":"Appearing in the early 80's as an offshoot of the legendary UK power electronics band Whitehouse, Sutcliffe Jugend soon went to to become an equally confrontational and extreme purveyor of the early PE/industrial sound, producing some of the most abrasive and violent electronics albums ever with their early Come Organisation releases We Spit On Their Graves and Campaign . Since then, Sutcliffe Jugend has continued to pursue a unique sonic vision that combines transgressive subject matter and dark, cerebral musings on violence and sexual perversion with explorations into the use of brutal feedback and synthesizer damage. In the past decade, however, the band has delved into darker, more restrained (at least on a sonic level) sounds alongside their harsher work, and Blue Rabbit is the latest such offering, unfolding like a night-terror across the album's eight tracks. You won't find any of SJ's trademark power electronics sound here, nor the dark throbbing industrial of their recent album With Extreme Prejudice for Cold Spring Records; this is a darker, more unsettling experience, heavy with an atmosphere of doom and smoldering violence, as if Sutcliffe Jugend sought to channel the creaking dread of Nurse With Wound's Salt Marie Celeste through a series if blood-freezing psychosexual nightmares...\r\n\r\nCrucial Blast Records\r\n\r\n£7.00 UK (Including postage)\r\n£9.00 Non UK (Including postage)","options":[{"id":26544945,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/82996017/-/Crucial_Blast_CBR95.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/82996017/-/Crucial_Blast_CBR95.jpg","width":225,"height":225},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/82996041/-/Crucial_Blast_CBR95a.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/82996041/-/Crucial_Blast_CBR95a.jpg","width":275,"height":183}],"artists":[{"id":159804,"name":"Sutcliffe Jugend","permalink":"sutcliffe-jugend","url":"/artist/sutcliffe-jugend"}],"categories":[{"id":2415323,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":6192697,"name":"Oxbow - The Luxury of Empire (DVD)","permalink":"oxbow-the-luxury-of-empire","position":33,"price":11.0,"default_price":11.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/oxbow-the-luxury-of-empire","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-05-15T12:00:17.000Z","description":"This DVD filmed on Oxbow’s European tour of 2009 and which coincided with their 20th anniversary follows the seminal band as they tour alone for the first time in many years.\r\n\r\nThe three complimentary parts give a rare 360 degree glimpse of the front and backstage realities of touring offers an intimate portrait of a band in full artistic maturity. It sees them undergoing the daily trails of touring with grace and provides sometimes touching and humorus insights into an otherwise mysterious band. The film’s dark cinematic aesthetic was inspired bt the atmosphere of Oxbow’s recent work. It echoes its title and is interlaced with live performances and candid interviews in which the band peel away layers of their processes and which bring the viewer as close as it’s possible to get to aband without being in it.\r\n\r\nBy contrast. The band’s long time sound engineer, Manual Liebeskind’s film “Still Before” is a road dairy filmed entirely on an iphone and covers the entire tour. It widens the cast introducing many more of the behind-the-scenes players involved in making such a tour happen much more raw in it’s style and making use of still photos as links between scenes, it’s loose, convivial style juxtaposes perfectly with the first film.\r\n\r\nThe final piece is the live performance in Paris, filmed in it’s entirety. Impressive in it’s execution, it serves as a document of the culmination of all the work and energy expended in the two accompanying films.\r\n\r\nA delight to watch of anyone, whether familiar with

the words of Ray Bradbury: \"Something wicked this way comes\". Recorded at Glasgow's Riverside Studios by the legendary Duncan Cameron (a man and a studio that has been the axis of the Scottish indie scene for more than 20 years – he's worked with Teenage Fanclub, Arab Strap and The Jesus and Mary Chain, to name just three) 'Twilight Of The Gods' rips your face off and replaces it with a charred black mask - eleven huge tracks of cataclysmic uber-rock, skilfully executed by the undisputed best band in the UK, two of which feature Oxbow front man Eugene Robinson on vocals. Black Sun, a name synonymous with a primal and uncompromising sound and an outfit that is universally respected by all bands on the extreme music circuit, have been steadily fermenting in their own foul juices for just over a decade now (this is their sixth studio album). TOTG is the 'mature' sound of a band on top of their game and at the zenith of their creative vision – a beast of a long player that deserves your attention NOW.\r\n\r\nInfamous Glasgow-based trio Black Sun exist in the centre of a universe of senseless human pain and brutality – their disturbing post-industrial doom is a gut-wrenching catharsis for the soul. Check out their recent interviews in Zero Tolerance and Rock-A-Rolla for proof of their gravitas. After several successful British and European tours, plus crowd-blitzing performances at Roadburn and Supersonic festivals last year, the awesome threesome of Russell McEwan (drums/vocals), Kevin Hare (guitar/vocals) and Graeme Leggate (bass) are poised to declare a full-scale war of terror with this jaw-dropping new album.\r\n\r\n£8.00 UK (Including postage)\r\n£10.00 Non UK (Including postage)\r\n","options":[{"id":14496189,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43248983/-/fun009-300dpi-sm.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43248983/-/fun009-300dpi-sm.jpg","width":150,"height":150}],"artists":[{"id":81661,"name":"Black Sun","permalink":"black-sun","url":"/artist/black-sun"}],"categories":[{"id":2415323,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":7510419,"name":"The Freezing Fog - March Forth to Victory (CD)","permalink":"the-freezing-fog-march-forth-to-victory-cd","position":35,"price":2.0,"default_price":2.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-freezing-fog-march-forth-to-victory-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-11T00:09:08.000Z","description":"The Freezing Fog - March Forth to Victory\r\n\r\nSongs like “Chimeric Visions,” “Crossing the Rubicon,” and “The Blacksmith's Lament” have a heavy NWOBHM influence (check out the Maiden gallop on “Rubicon”), but with a straightforward groove that's more akin to your average hard rock band. Elsewhere, “The Damnation of the High Wizard” and “Beast of England” take a more Sabbath approach, slowing it down and dooming it up. The latter's the best song; it's epic and heavy and just plain massive, sort of like what you'd hear when giants fought to the death. The above tracks are enough to make this appealing to fans of the mighty Orange Goblin, Blood Island Raiders, and other UK-based bands.\"\r\n(Arzgarth StonerRock)\r\n\r\n£3.00 UK (Includes postage)\r\n£5.00 Row (Includes postage)","options":[{"id":23733955,"name":"Default","price":2.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73766451/-/Freezing_Fog.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73766451/-/Freezing_Fog.jpg","width":200,"height":200}],"artists":[{"id":144893,"name":"The Freezing Fog","permalink":"the-freezing-fog","url":"/artist/the-freezing-fog"}],"categories":[{"id":2415323,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":7510373,"name":"Grifter - The Simplicity of the Riff is Key (CD)","permalink":"grifter-the-simplicity-of-the-riff-is-key-cd","position":36,"price":1.0,"default_price":1.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/grifter-the-simplicity-of-the-riff-is-key-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-11T00:05:46.000Z","description":"UK riff rockers Grifter understand.

It hasn’t always been so. The band initially started as a much different prospect centred around vocalist Sean Parkin’s darker but infinitely less rocking studio project that resulted in the 2004 album, “Mescaline” on the Shifty Disco label. Although well received, no sooner had Parkin got this album out of his system the urge to rock bubbled in his veins and a full band began to magnetically coalesce around him. Of course, as with any band, some people have fallen by the wayside where others have stayed true and the Domes of Silence of today is a tight knit, living, breathing rock and roll organism.\r\n\r\nCombining the low-slung, molasses thick fuzz of Fu Manchu with Queen’s Of The Stone Age’s innate melodic pop suss and topping it off with some shamanistic, Jim Morrison meets Iggy Pop bellicose yet edgy crooning, Domes of Silence create a unique, compelling and intriguing clash of riffs, tunes, elephantine low end and propulsive rhythms. Their impressive blend of brawn and brain looks set to topple the foundations of the stoner scene and the wider world of rock and roll.\r\nDeciding to grab a slice of the corporate pie, the band are stepping out on their own Silver Buddha label and have two recent releases under their collective belt; the driving buzz saw kick in the nuts of “Temple of the Wasp” and the more considered and beefed up “Hunter ST”, as well as tracks included on video games such as “Test Drive unlimited” and “Vietcong”. With the momentum now rolling like a fat kid going down a steep hill on a go-kart, Domes of Silence are preparing more libations to the Gods of rock in the studio and more chances to bask in the power of the riff on stages around the country…and if there is a God and justice prevails, beyond our borders to Europe and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn a music world bursting at the seams with mediocrity and unoriginality, Domes of Silence emerge from the mire as one of the few bands deserving of the term “vital”. The question is, can you afford not to take notice?\r\n\r\n£1.75 UK (Including postage)\r\n£2.50 Europe (Including postage)\r\n£3.00 RoW (Including
