To see more, please write me at Egilpatrart@aol.com  When I paint nebulas, I get to work with color and form as in an abstract painting, but within a realist context. \r\n\r\nThe Lagoon Nebula is in the southern constellation Sagittarius; and can be seen with the naked eye or binoculars. It is considered to be among the finest and brightest star-forming regions in the sky. A huge cloud of interstellar matter, it is undergoing active star formation. The central parts are extremely bright; and it is so large that this painting represents only a small part of the nebula. I am smitten with the GLORY of the nebulas. \r\n\r\nThe painting is based on a NASA photograph, is 16 inches high by 20 inches wide, acrylic on stretched canvas, on heavy duty stretchers, with painted sides.

The photo shows that Afghan women are not forced to wear the Burqa and can travel without a male family member, such as on this remote village road. But the Taliban and religious terrorist rule has influenced women to cover their faces with a Chadar (scarf). Before, women would only cover their heads, not their faces.\r\n\r\nI had permission to use the photo as a basis for my painting from the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC), which sponsored the exhibit.\r\n\r\nThis painting is 20 by 20 inches, gallery wrapped on heavy duty stretchers, with painted sides, so a frame is not necessary.
