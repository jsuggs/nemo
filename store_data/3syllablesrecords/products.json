The two share a tattoo the words Brothers Ralph surrounding an anchor, like two sailors navigating the same sea but you can also hear their brotherhood all over their music.  Andy's voice cascades and careens around and across James' almost impossibly hard floor tom hits, and when the two join together to shout a chorus or a particularly important lyric on their album Brotherface, the two create a sound that's much more than two boys playing songs together. \r\n\r\nThe songs on Brotherface are a unique combination of anthemic and psychedelic; not meandering, definitely structured, but also bubbling and swirling with layers of sound that seem far more complicated than what two guys can make standing alone on a stage.  The aquarium-sound of Miss Mermaid makes love into a slow swim, while the energetic gallop and brisk harmonies of Cash For Gold call to mind the feeling of driving across and empty expanse of highway with your friends late at night, shouting into the dark just to hear your own voice.  ","options":[{"id":23769451,"name":"Default","price":13.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":73,"name":"Bulgaria","code":"BG"}},{"amount_alone":8.49,"amount_with_others":1.49,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":91,"name":"Cyprus","code":"CY"}},{"amount_alone":8.49,"amount_with_others":1.49,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":89,"name":"Croatia (Hrvatska)","code":"HR"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":8.49,"amount_with_others":1.49,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":190,"name":"Russian Federation","code":"RU"}},{"amount_alone":8.49,"amount_with_others":1.49,"country":{"id":207,"name":"South Africa","code":"ZA"}},{"amount_alone":8.49,"amount_with_others":0.99,"country":{"id":18,"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HK"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":125,"name":"Hungary","code":"HU"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":19,"name":"Iceland","code":"IS"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":8.49,"amount_with_others":1.49,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":8.49,"amount_with_others":1.49,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":184,"name":"Poland","code":"PL"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":189,"name":"Romania","code":"RO"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":5.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":41,"name":"Turkey","code":"TR"}},{"amount_alone":3.49,"amount_with_others":0.74,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":8.49,"amount_with_others":1.49,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73808389/-/TSR007_WEB.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73808389/-/TSR007_WEB.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":145131,"name":"Writer","permalink":"writer","url":"/artist/writer"}],"categories":[{"id":1768699,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":3276783,"name":"White Arrows (CD) ","permalink":"white-arrows-cd-preorder","position":2,"price":4.99,"default_price":4.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/white-arrows-cd-preorder","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-02-12T22:10:58.000Z","description":"Mickey Schiff is a hip cat.

Before he could even play an instrument, he claims to have written many songs.  \r\n\r\nThen, at the age of eleven, Mickey miraculously regained his sight!  Can you imagine how insane that would have been!?  That’s gotta be better than any psychotropic drug!\r\n\r\nFast forward a few years and Mickey is in NYU studying a major in Shamanistic Ritual before moving back to LA to form a band with his younger brother Henry and his old friend JP Caballero - who then, he later finds out is in fact Mickey and Henry’s half brother courtesy of a sperm donation by his dad to help some friends conceive.
