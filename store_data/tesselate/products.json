After many meetings and lengthy discussions with the group, we have big plans going forward.\r\n\r\nED-IT are a group of technology based DJ's who have grown into a large force within the underground music scene. Ever since the 2068 'Law of Awareness' which granted all non human creations the same right as humans themselves, the group has gained a following and have rapidly taken their performances worldwide.\r\n\r\nBased in the UK, Toyko & Berlin, they have a residency at their underground clubs 'Ready Place', where they play at least once a month. All of the machines they use to create their music and also play music live, they have custom built.These devices will soon be available under the 'Accex' business branch.\r\n\r\nB5100 is one of the joint founders of the ED-IT group. Before the awareness law was passed, he was working on governmental architectural projects as an electrical maintenance droid, and then DJ'd in his off time in the then illegal 'fully auto' underground club nights.\r\n\r\nThe ED-IT DJ's are currently working on a new record label under the monicker 'Lolopext Recording', so make sure to keep an ear out for that.</em>\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Postage information:</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nUK:\r\n\r\nSpecial Delivery Next Day (from dispatch), fully insured for £100, requires a signature on arrival and can be tracked.\r\n\r\n\r\nInternational orders:\r\n\r\nTo keep costs down, International shipping will be sent via Standard Airmail, which is not tracked and is uninsured.
