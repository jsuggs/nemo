The world struggles to endure an affliction that has transformed half its citizenry into frenzied deviants. Major metropolitan areas have been (poorly) quarantined, as the afflicted—and their even more depraved counterparts, the unsound—roam freely. In Philadelphia, a cultish grassroots organization aims to salvage some shred of humanity until a cure is discovered, but its motivations are dubious. No solution is in sight. It’s unclear as to whether anybody even cares anymore.\r\n\r\nThe Gall family is among the countless irreparably marred by the phenomenon, from embittered patriarch Walter to his sons, one an emotionally absent narcissist, the other foolishly entertaining a pregnancy with his afflicted fiancée. Trapped in a protracted purgatorial transition between societies, the Galls have no recourse but to persevere. Whether that means investigating the malady’s legitimacy, fixating on old regrets or succumbing to gruesome indulgence, all fail to recognize that the differences between their past and lurid present are negligible.\r\n\r\nThe Dreamt and Deathless Obscene is available in two formats: standard paperback and ultra-limited corpsepile edition. The latter was hand-assembled/stained/screwdrivered/hammered/obliterated by the author and his substantially less degenerate bookmaking associate.

Complete with requisite \"source information\", these songs are faster, more complete, and believe it or not, more pissed. This EP ventures further into the \"character study\" of Los Angeles, focusing on themes as diverse as stilted relationships, getting robbed, and shooting the shit out of downtown for 11 unimpeded minutes, while simultaneously encapsulating the disgusting culture of the mid-90s.\r\n\r\nThis comes with an insert featuring lyrics and some great artwork courtesy Alan Hunter. \r\n\r\nThere are 600 copies of this bastard, broken down into three different covers. The covers will have actual me-shot bullets holes in them, so technically, each is a 1/1 because even though i have ridiculously accurate and tight firing patterns, no two are the same. For you wieners trolling discogs, they are all black vinyl. \r\n\r\nPreorders go on March 10, let's say 9pm pacific. Tunes up soon. Karl has been heavily immersed in hip-hop lately, which i believe definitively informs his call-and-response vocal delivery. If you have a problem with this, you should consider the idea of having your friends in a band no matter how braindead they sound.

Every band that has to deal with doing so wishes they didn't have to deal with doing so. However, it's a necessary evil and, if nothing else, it’s a source of highly entertaining tales for ambitious wannabe authors to mine, compile and exploit. \r\nIn Do You Have Anything to Declare?, veteran music journalist/borderline hack, Kevin Stewart-Panko and Vitriol Records head honcho/rent-a-guitarist, Justin Smith interview 75 touring bands and musicians about their frustrating, terrifying, hilarious and ridiculous border crossing (mis)adventures. Compiling stories and experiences from the likes of the Dillinger Escape Plan and Fear Factory to Atheist and Zoroaster to old-school road warriors Tomas Lindberg (At the Gates/Disfear/etc.), Eugene Robinson (Oxbow) and Rich Hoak (Brutal Truth) and many more, Do You Have Anything to Declare? uses first-person accounts to shine a light on the always nail-biting experience of crossing borders around the world while on tour. Also included are the author's personal road-dogging recollections, including Smith being arrested in Denmark and Stewart-Panko, theoretically, being denied entry into his own home and native land. \r\nOver the course of 260 pages, topics such as drug dogs, touring through the Schengen Zone, draconian America, Eastern European searches, Russian shakedowns and the ongoing confusion and difficulty inherently associated when crossing from the U.S. into Canada are touched upon. Throw in a bit of snarky commentary, contextual context and even a few history lessons in international relations and first-time authors Stewart-Panko and Smith will have you laughing, crying, perplexed and shaking your head, wondering why any band would even bother to try and leave their home country, but grateful that they put up with as much crap as they do in order to bring their music to the people.\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth Vitriol Literary Release. \r\nThis thing is pretty cool. Support the desire to learn things not from T.V. or declining school systems. \r\nThese will be mailed in the next week and a half.

They have released one demo tape, one self-titled vinyl EP, and two LPs/CDs, one entitled Anger and the other entitled Messy, Isn't It?  The band flails amidst the murkier Southern Californian estuaries between punk, hardcore, and rock and roll, and feel most comfortable clinging to broader genre labels like \"loud\" or \"disgruntled.\"  They have toured extensively both domestically and overseas, and make ample use of the DIY ethic that actively destroys the performative distinction between author and audience.  2014's Five O'Clock Shadows at the Edge of the Western World finds DANGERS stretching into new musical territory that wrestles with the band's geographic, political, and emotional malaise.

However the track that starts side B, “Funerals” is simply goose bump inducing, awe inspiring hardcore perfection.

They are used to create one hell of an atmosphere. When you hear some of the riffs on this album, they're going to put you in a trance like state. Now with only two songs on this album, the first being about 14 minutes and the second being about 11, you're going to hear the riffs repeated plenty of times. Now for some black metal bands repetitiveness can be bad, well that's not the case with Ash Borer. The riffs are extremely catchy and will stick in your head long after you listen to this album. Drumming is pretty standard for a black metal album. Now with atmospheric black metal you should know that it's all about atmosphere (obviously). The drums aren't really meant to stand out over the guitars and they really don't, but it's not like it's the same beat over and over. There's enough variety in the drumming to keep the listener entertained for the whole 25 minutes of the demo. Fast and slow parts are present on the album and the drums vary with that.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":19679635,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.5,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":12.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.5,"amount_with_others":4.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60620887/-/ashborer_standard.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60620887/-/ashborer_standard.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":249101,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":6894787,"name":"Terrorbird \"Secret Rituals\" LP","permalink":"terrorbird-secret-rituals-lp","position":78,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/terrorbird-secret-rituals-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-06T21:02:21.000Z","description":"This is the 2nd full length by terror bird from vancouver, Canada.

In late 2006, He and bandmate Jeremy Earl decided to combine their bedroom recordings and release them together, as Woods. They recorded two albums together and toured the US and Europe. In early 2008, for several reasons, Christian left both bands. On the Knife is a deeply personal take on love and loss, and was very much shaped by Christian’s departure from his previous bands. Like his earlier work with Woods, the songwriting is earnest, and of course there are a few indulgent headphone tracks as well.","options":[{"id":1997541,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.5,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":7.6,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":15.5,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.5,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/4401751/-/little-gold.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/4401751/-/little-gold.jpg","width":595,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":10811,"name":"Little Gold","permalink":"little-gold","url":"/artist/little-gold"}],"categories":[{"id":249101,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"},{"id":378621,"name":"Distribution","permalink":"distribution","url":"/category/distribution"}]}]
