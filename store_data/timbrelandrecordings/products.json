Influenced as much by traditional European folk culture and French medieval music as by Japanese experimental music, Mirage moves from playful song and hum-along melodies to unearthly atmospherics and outer-limits soundscapes.\r\n\r\nThese mysteriously enchanting pieces cross the musical spectrum from folk flavoured theme tunes to ghostly sound collages and dusty field recordings via traditional song and minimal electronic composition. In essence this is an album informed as much by the juxtaposition of the modern and ancient as it is by various strands of leftfield pop, electronica and psychedelia.\r\n","options":[{"id":9901908,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27426684/-/KoryoSaitoMirage.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27426684/-/KoryoSaitoMirage.jpg","width":709,"height":709}],"artists":[{"id":47113,"name":"Koryo Saito","permalink":"koryo-saito","url":"/artist/koryo-saito"}],"categories":[{"id":297149,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":368206,"name":"This Is The Sound Of The Winter Journey","permalink":"this-is-the-sound-of-the-winter-journey","position":4,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/this-is-the-sound-of-the-winter-journey","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-08-12T19:59:51.000Z","description":"The Winter Journey are Anthony Braithwaite and Suzy Mangion, a gentle duo out of place in Manchester, England who create gorgeous music in their drawing room as if it were only yesterday. Their album is a perfect eleven songs of vintage warmth and homely welcomes that could only be made from a collection of music recorded by hand on birthdays, Christmases and other days of rest. Both Suzy and Anthony were previously in the band George who released albums on Pickled Egg Records gathering plaudits including Pitchfork’s Top 50 albums of 2003 and toured with A Hawk and A Hacksaw.
