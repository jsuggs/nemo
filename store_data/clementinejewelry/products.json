I forge and hammer each ring individually for a unique finish, made to order in U.S. whole and half sizes from 4 - 13 (this ring looks great on a guy's hand, too!). \r\n","options":[{"id":19259627,"name":"size 4","price":58.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19259629,"name":"size 4.5","price":58.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19259631,"name":"size 5","price":58.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19259633,"name":"size 5.5","price":58.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19259635,"name":"size 6","price":58.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19259637,"name":"size 6.5","price":58.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19259639,"name":"size 7","price":58.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19259641,"name":"size 7.5","price":58.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19259643,"name":"size 8","price":58.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19259645,"name":"size 8.5","price":58.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19259663,"name":"size 9","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":19259661,"name":"size 9.5","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":19259659,"name":"size 10","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":19259657,"name":"size 10.5","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":19259655,"name":"size 11","price":62.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":19259653,"name":"size 11.5","price":62.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":19259651,"name":"size 12","price":62.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":19259649,"name":"size 12.5","price":63.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":19259647,"name":"size 13","price":63.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.99,"amount_with_others":0.65,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59122351/-/R120C.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59122351/-/R120C.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59122527/-/R120D.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59122527/-/R120D.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59122573/-/R120A.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59122573/-/R120A.jpg","width":800,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3150909,"name":"Rings","permalink":"rings","url":"/category/rings"}]},{"id":6019523,"name":"Moonstone and Gold Scalloped Stud Earrings","permalink":"moonstone-and-gold-scalloped-stud-earrings","position":16,"price":47.0,"default_price":47.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/moonstone-and-gold-scalloped-stud-earrings","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-24T21:49:45.000Z","description":"Brilliant white Moonstone gems are enveloped in a 14k gold filled scalloped setting in these versatile stud earrings.
