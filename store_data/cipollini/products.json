This platform will also integrate with a safety light to be released summer 2013.\r\n\r\nOur single bolt, Full Wrap Clamp is easy to install without removing the handlebar tape and is added protection that your Garmin will never \"fall off\" even without the bolt over the roughest terrain.     \r\n\r\nTested at the highest level.
