She stands outside of her voodoo shop, where people come to buy love potions, good luck charms and other gris-gris. She is conjuring the spirit of her lost love, barely visible beneath her fingertips.\r\n\r\n\"Celeste\" contains lots of little details, from the boning on her burgundy corset to the skull and glasses of her lost lover, to the magical black cat and glass bottles full of potion in the shop window. The full moon and night sky lend their light, while Celeste works her voodoo with the bubbling cauldron.\r\n\r\nThe original drawing was created with pencil, ink, watercolor pencil and oil pastels.
