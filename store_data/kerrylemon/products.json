I use their HP (Hot pressed) paper as it's smooth and allows a clean print from the screen as well as enabling a good watercolour wash. The printing ink I use is waterbased and has excellent lightfastness. Obviously I would advise against hanging this work in direct sunlight due to the delicate nature of watercolour paints.\r\n\r\nPlease note that as each print is created by hand, every piece is an original work which will have unique differences. Your print may therefore vary slightly from the one in the photo, but please be assured that I have worked hard to ensure that every print is beautiful.\r\n\r\n(Please be aware that colours may vary slightly depending on your computer monitor.)\r\n\r\nThis piece will be carefully packed for you with a firm backing in an archival sleeve inside a rigid board mailer. Inside the sleeve is a information sheet giving further information about the artist (pictured) and so is a perfect gift.\r\n\r\nUK Shipping:\r\nYour item will be shipped with Royal Mail Special Delivery™.
