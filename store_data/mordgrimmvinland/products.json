A six piece band hailing from Sydney, Lycanthia plays traditional gothic death-doom metal with a strong emphasis on atmosphere, melody, and the captivating use of alternating male growls and female soprano vocals. Comparisons could be drawn between Lycanthia and the sound found in the early \"golden age\" works of classic gothic doom bands such as My Dying Bride, Paradise Lost, Draconian, and Theatre of Tragedy. A flagship of this particular sound is the contrast between dark, aggressive, and heavy death-doom and softer moments courtesy of female vocals, keyboards, and violin arrangements and Lycanthia does this extraordinarily well. The growls courtesy of founding member and bassist Lee Tassaker is a definite strong point of the album, and contrasts nicely with the poignant female vocals from violinist and keyboardists, Vanessa Black, and Megan Tassaker. The vocal work is complimented nicely by six very competent musicians all working towards a heavy, despairing, and powerfully melancholic sound and a production quality that does the songwriting justice. Mastered by Jens Bogren at Fascination Street Studios (Opeth, Katatonia), the re-release of Oligarchy on Hypnotic Dirge comes in a digipack format with an 8 page foldout booklet.","options":[{"id":38066277,"name":"Default","price":7.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/118506306/-/Oligarchy_Album_Cover.jpg.opt377x377o0_0s377x377.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/118506306/-/Oligarchy_Album_Cover.jpg.opt377x377o0_0s377x377.jpg","width":377,"height":377}],"artists":[{"id":213513,"name":"Lycanthia","permalink":"lycanthia","url":"/artist/lycanthia"}],"categories":[{"id":5334186,"name":"Albums","permalink":"albums","url":"/category/albums"},{"id":5334273,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"},{"id":5635770,"name":"Hypnotic Dirge Records","permalink":"hypnotic-dirge-records","url":"/category/hypnotic-dirge-records"},{"id":6829638,"name":"Sale Items","permalink":"sale-items","url":"/category/sale-items"}]},{"id":11233899,"name":"Maveth - Coils of the Black Earth","permalink":"maveth-coils-of-the-black-earth","position":38,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/maveth-coils-of-the-black-earth","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-18T16:23:17.000Z","description":"Formed in 2007, Finland's Maveth finally break through with their debut full-length.

Initially formed in 2008 under the name 'Shards of Silence', the past five years has given the band ample time to develop and refine their sound for their debut album 'Bardo. Relative Reality.' Creating dynamic and profound music, rich in tempo and mood variation, Odradek Room has crafted an extremely strong debut which perfectly shows the duality between the aggressive and melancholic sides of death-doom combining slow plodding riffs, soaring emotional melodies, post-rock leanings, and a psychedelic touch to create a rich canvas of sonic majesty. A conceptual album based on the ideas of the Tibetan Book of the Dead and surreal images of the subliminal consciousness, the album consists of seven songs and an hour playtime, released in a digipack with a 12 page booklet including the full album's lyrics in both Russian and English, since it was very important to the band for the lyrical concept of this work to be comprehensible in both languages. Unique, mature, and with a well-defined personality, Bardo. Relative Reality. is a highly recommended debut album from this young Ukrainian band.","options":[{"id":38066154,"name":"Default","price":6.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/118505874/-/Odradek_Room_-_Bardo._Relative_Reality..jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/118505874/-/Odradek_Room_-_Bardo._Relative_Reality..jpg","width":513,"height":513}],"artists":[{"id":213510,"name":"Odradek Room","permalink":"odradek-room","url":"/artist/odradek-room"}],"categories":[{"id":5334186,"name":"Albums","permalink":"albums","url":"/category/albums"},{"id":5334273,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"},{"id":5635770,"name":"Hypnotic Dirge Records","permalink":"hypnotic-dirge-records","url":"/category/hypnotic-dirge-records"},{"id":6829638,"name":"Sale Items","permalink":"sale-items","url":"/category/sale-items"}]},{"id":12376899,"name":"The Deathisodes - Inside the Universe of Horror","permalink":"the-deathisodes-inside-the-universe-of-horror","position":42,"price":7.5,"default_price":7.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-deathisodes-inside-the-universe-of-horror","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-07-15T17:03:23.000Z","description":"Second album from this amazing collective of extremely talented UK artists.
