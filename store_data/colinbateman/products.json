But they can! Will Nathan get his girl back? Will the President survive imprisonment by a psychotic white supremist in (rapidly melting) black-face? Will veteran lift-operator Sam McClusky get his job back?

It’s just Eddie’s luck that he quickly stumbles upon a kidnapping plan that implicates Scuttles, the hospital’s head of security – and his mum’s new boyfriend. \r\n‘Running with the Reservoir Pups’ was acclaimed on its first publication in 2003.   \r\n\r\n‘This author’s hilarious, dark Northern Irish wit, penchant for action-packed mayhem, sense of irony and snappy dialogue are all evident in this outrageously comic caper,’ said the (US) School Library Journal. \r\n\r\n‘A zany caper…innovative, far-fetched tale makes for great entertainment,’  said (US) Publishers Weekly.  * UK postage is free, please enquire about ROI and overseas. \r\n","options":[{"id":21593495,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66784229/-/RESERVOIR.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66784229/-/RESERVOIR.jpg","width":144,"height":217}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
