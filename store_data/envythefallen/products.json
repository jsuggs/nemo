It is certainly not known for breeding fresh, premium quality metal. Yet against this bizarre backdrop Envy The Fallen have managed to put together six tracks that put ‘Cornish Metal’ firmly on the map.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n\r\n1. The Brave One\r\n2. Hoist The Colours\r\n3. This Is Not Goodbye, It's A Fond Farewell\r\n4. I Will Prevail\r\n5. Until Lambs Become Lions\r\n6. The Ending\r\n\r\nA huge Thank You goes to everyone who buys a copy of this album. \r\n\r\nYou will not be disappointed.","options":[{"id":12724010,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37110564/-/product-pic2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37110564/-/product-pic2.jpg","width":600,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1965260,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
