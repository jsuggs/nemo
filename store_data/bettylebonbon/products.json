Until January 31, you are welcome to pre-order in any size you like. Pre-ordering has two significant benefits: you'll guarantee a skirt in your size, AND you'll pay the special pre-order price of $45 (skirts are usually $55)! Skirts will be sent out late February/early March.\r\n\r\nFabric is 97% cotton, 3% spandex - giving the fabric a slight sheen and some stretch.\r\n\r\nAll skirts are 24 inches long, have a 2 inch deep waistband, zip  at the back of the skirt, and side seam pockets. \r\n\r\nSkirts have up to an inch and a half of stretch - someone with a 45 inch waist will be able to fit into the size 26 skirt! If you're unsure which size to order, please get in touch and we'll help you out! If your size isn't listed, let me know and I'll add it. \r\n\r\nPayment plans are available, email bettylebonbon@gmail.com to discuss! \r\n\r\nSize 10 = 28 inches\r\nSize 12 = 30 inches\r\nSize 14 = 32 inches\r\nSize 16 = 34 inches\r\nSize 18 = 36 inches\r\nSize 20 = 38 inches\r\nSize 22 = 40 inches\r\nSize 24 = 42 inches\r\nSize 26 = 44 inches\r\nSize 28 = 46 inches\r\nSize 30 = 48 inches\r\nSize 32 = 50 inches","options":[{"id":49697352,"name":"Size 6 - 24 inches","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49697355,"name":"Size 8 - 26 inches","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49697358,"name":"Size 10 - 28 inches","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49697361,"name":"Size 12 - 30 inches","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46038297,"name":"Size 14 - 32 inches","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40157865,"name":"Size 16 - 34 inches","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49697364,"name":"Size 18 - 36 inches","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49697367,"name":"Size 20 - 38 inches","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49697370,"name":"Size 22 - 40 inches","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49697373,"name":"Size 24 - 42 inches","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49697385,"name":"Size 26 - 44 inches","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49697382,"name":"Size 28 - 46 inches","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49697379,"name":"Size 30 - 48 inches","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49697376,"name":"Size 32 - 50 inches","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128710245/-/1012111_10151426625742587_587743960_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128710245/-/1012111_10151426625742587_587743960_n.jpg","width":640,"height":960},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108172653/-/IMG_4305_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108172653/-/IMG_4305_3.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108172749/-/IMG_4336_4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108172749/-/IMG_4336_4.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108172785/-/IMG_4360_6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108172785/-/IMG_4360_6.jpg","width":1000,"height":578}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3100469,"name":"Skirts","permalink":"skirts","url":"/category/skirts"}]},{"id":6544247,"name":"Faux Fur Stole - READY TO SHIP!","permalink":"faux-fur-stole","position":23,"price":35.0,"default_price":35.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/faux-fur-stole","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-26T05:06:24.000Z","description":"FAUX fur stole!\r\n\r\nDeliciously soft and cozy!
