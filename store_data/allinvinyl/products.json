It comes with red screen printed covers (on purple card) and looks great! The record itself comes on red \r\n\r\nFinally, the long wait is over!! The 6th and final 7\" in our split series features Cheap Girls from Michigan and Above Them from Pontefract. \r\n\r\nCheap Girls continue with their much loved 90s, indie driven pop-punk style with theses latest offerings. Dim lights is a brand new track, one of their more upbeat songs, and a soon to be classic. The version of Sunnyside on this release was actually recorded during the \"Find Me A Drink Home\" sessions and has a suprisingly different, more raw feel to the version that went on to \"My Roaring 20s\"\r\n\r\nAbove Them have been leading the UK punk scene, with their fast melodic \"HWM-esque\" sing along anthems, for quite some time now. Without a doubt they just get better and better, and these 2 songs certainly show that.... After a few listens these songs will be stuck in your head all day long\r\n\r\nTrack Listing\r\n1.

The songs are melodic, the vocals are raw and biting, and the choruses are of the huge sing-a-long variety.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nJust Panic are one of the best live UK bands - lots of energy and intensity.  They follow up their excellent \"Stand Up Straight...\" EP with 2 more impressive songs.  A sound which comes across as a combination of a variety of late 90's bands - put Against Me and The Bouncing Souls in a blender, add a British sound and I guess this is what you get<br>\r\nSide A:\r\nHow Dare You\r\n1.
