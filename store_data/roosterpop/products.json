Whether we are right or wrong, in our heads we are law. So I made the paper boats as a representation of our personal self made crowns. Any person can afford a piece of paper; whether it's bought, borrowed or stolen. We fold and overlap the paper where we decide. The bigger the crown the more the self confidence. The smaller or darker crowns reflect someone not so in control or maybe even self destructive in some cases. I think symbolism is amazing in how it works. For me it's literally a painted picture of how you feel, whether you want the world to know or not. Another metaphor you will see a lot in my art is the Band-Aid. If it's on the heart it represents a survivor of the war of love, someone who has been hurt before. In other cases I put the Band-Aid on the ribs, to signify sacrifice. Like Adam, sometimes we have to give something painful up for something greater.\"\r\n         -Josie DeVora","options":[{"id":19131651,"name":"Default","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":15.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58704021/-/2012-03-23_17.42.07.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58704021/-/2012-03-23_17.42.07.jpg","width":480,"height":505},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58704145/-/2012-03-23_17.42.44.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58704145/-/2012-03-23_17.42.44.jpg","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58703885/-/2012-03-23_17.42.16.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58703885/-/2012-03-23_17.42.16.jpg","width":480,"height":640}],"artists":[{"id":123575,"name":"Josie DeVora","permalink":"josie-devora","url":"/artist/josie-devora"}],"categories":[{"id":3133813,"name":"Original Artworks","permalink":"original-artworks","url":"/category/original-artworks"}]},{"id":5980479,"name":"\"Elanore Everyoung\" Print by Josie DeVora","permalink":"elanore-everyoung","position":19,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/elanore-everyoung","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-20T03:18:29.000Z","description":"Print on high quality archival paper.\r\n\r\nSizes available\r\n5\"x 7\"\r\n8\"x 10\"\r\n16\"x 20\"\r\n Select your from the drop menu down below\r\n\r\n\"Betrayed by her own flesh, she finds herself draining the life from all around.
