In response to one stipulation of the commission, that the music incorporate an Asian theme, I seized upon the idea of a bridge that could be freely inserted between the strings and the fingerboard. The bridge, together with the bottleneck slide has enabled the tranformation of the guitar into an instrument with Asian characteristics.\r\n\r\nFor more information and to listen to the piece performed please <a href=\"http://classicguitarmethod.com/blog/?page_id=32\">click here</a>.\r\n\r\n<b>Please Note: In order to play this piece it is necessary to have a Luse-Mat™ bridge installed on your guitar. The bridge installs in minutes, is removable and does not require modification of your guitar in any way. Directions to make your own bridge are available <a href=\"http://classicguitarmethod.com/blog/?page_id=32\">here</a>.
