In \"Spots,\" the 10-minute centerpiece track, a mostly unaccompanied synth melody uses syncopation to create the impression of stumbling through darkness. \"Clay & Fire\" threatens to burst into full-bore power electronics territory but doesn't; the narration we hear is not a transgressive confession but instead a factory worker's discovery of pottery as a respite from his labor. From there the record offers an electronic crescendo before resolving in the almost-comforting \"Far Away; Close To You,\" which trails off in Morse code blips clearly transmitted but only possibly received.\r\n\r\n \"Playing With Light\" is unique in Nelson's discography and is entirely deserving of this vinyl reincarnation. \"Rhodes, Electric Mandocello, Various Trogotronic Electronic / Electro Acoustics Prototypes & Field Recordings.\" \r\n\r\nMastered by Timothy Stollenwerk and presented in an edition of 250 copies with download code.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/119711854&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":51066597,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":22.0,"amount_with_others":6.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129726600/-/fabrica031_pwl_72dpi_12_crp.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129726600/-/fabrica031_pwl_72dpi_12_crp.jpeg","width":480,"height":482}],"artists":[{"id":261438,"name":"UNICORN","permalink":"unicorn","url":"/artist/unicorn"}],"categories":[{"id":1981538,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"},{"id":3236833,"name":"Fabrica Records","permalink":"fabrica-records","url":"/category/fabrica-records"}]},{"id":15309240,"name":"Pre-Order: LUCIERNAGA  Collected Works: 2008-2013  CD  (FABCD005)","permalink":"luciernaga-collected-works-2008-2013-cd-r-fabcd005","position":3,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/luciernaga-collected-works-2008-2013-cd-r-fabcd005","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-03T22:12:00.000Z","description":"<b>PRE ORDER: Official Release Date: January 14, 2014</b>\r\n\r\nLuciernaga is the experimental ambient/noise project of Fabrica founder and co-owner Joao Da Silva. Luciernaga's music has been described as more surreal than ethereal, dark and somber. Luciernaga tends to bypass melody in favor of complex layers of sounds and textures created through processed field recordings, treated acoustic/electric guitar, buddha machine, tibetan signing bowl, shruti box, mbira and voice.\r\n\r\nFabrica Records was born with the release of \"Life Passes Away Like Idle Chatter\" by Luciernaga. A limited edition of 100 home-dubbed 44 minute long cassettes, with hand-painted covers (including an excerpt from an Octavio Paz poem on the flap) and labels, containing a collection of field recordings, tape loops, treated acoustic and electric guitar, synth drones, and sampled dialogues from a documentary on the history of U.S. interventions in Latin America recorded over a 2-year period. At that time, Fabrica was just one guy recording and dubbing tapes from his overpriced shithole of an apartment in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn, NY. \r\n\r\n\"Life Passes...\" opened the doors for Fabrica, introducing the label to fellow experimental/noise music obsessives, independent label heads, and a wide variety of amazing and talented weirdoes. \r\n\r\nTherefore, it's only fitting that we designate the \"005\" catalog number to a release that compiles tracks from Luciernaga's 5 years of making music.\r\n\r\n\"Collected Works\" includes compositions selected from the first four and now out-of-print Luciernaga cassettes plus unreleased material. The photographs used to decorate the insert and tray card of the CD were taken around the Gowanus neighborhood the day after Superstorm Sandy and serve as a tribute to the section of Brooklyn where both Fabrica and Luciernaga were born.\r\n\r\nOn January 11, 2014 Luciernaga will be performing for the first time in Santiago, Chile with long-time friends and fellow Fabrica recording artists A Full Cosmic Sound. This CD compilation was put together for this performance and will be available first in Santiago, Chile and then in the U.S. after January 14.\r\n\r\nMastered by Eric Hardiman.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/124591599&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":49773171,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.75,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128908434/-/luciernagaCd_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128908434/-/luciernagaCd_cover.jpg","width":1467,"height":1482}],"artists":[{"id":43372,"name":"LUCIERNAGA","permalink":"luciernaga","url":"/artist/luciernaga"}],"categories":[{"id":1540765,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"},{"id":3236809,"name":"Compilation","permalink":"compilation","url":"/category/compilation"},{"id":3236833,"name":"Fabrica Records","permalink":"fabrica-records","url":"/category/fabrica-records"}]},{"id":13446207,"name":"CULVER  Gateshead Graves  LP  (FABREC030) ","permalink":"fabrec030-culver-gateshead-graves-lp","position":4,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fabrec030-culver-gateshead-graves-lp","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-09-09T02:32:11.000Z","description":"In the crowded field of guitar droneworks, UK musician Lee Stokoe could be said to be hidden in plain sight. For two decades, his solo project Culver and in-house tape label Matching Head have produced a consistent stream of releases without approaching anything near household-name status. This is due in part to a workmanlike, low-profile approach to recording and releasing music, despite time served in the mighty Skullflower. And then there's the music itself: unpolished, unsettling, a history of textures divorced from any linear notions of progress. Prolific as Culver has been, \"Gateshead Graves\" marks only the third instance of Lee filling 24 inches of grooved real estate on his own (after the obscure \"Route of Aesthetic\" lathe cut and the oddly elusive \"Dead Winter Blood\" LP). It features two side-long tracks that put the listener first in the hold of a ship bound nowhere good and then in an aircraft headed in roughly the same direction. Volume and isolation recommended for an appropriately immersive experience. \r\n\r\nMastered by Timothy Stollenwerk at Stereophonic Mastering (Grouper, Sublime Frequencies, Mississippi Records).\r\n\r\n<b>Limited edition of 200 on black vinyl with hand-numbered insert.</b>","options":[{"id":43038501,"name":"Default","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":22.0,"amount_with_others":6.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124004016/-/culverlp.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124004016/-/culverlp.jpg","width":900,"height":902}],"artists":[{"id":231807,"name":"CULVER","permalink":"culver","url":"/artist/culver"}],"categories":[{"id":1981538,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"},{"id":3236833,"name":"Fabrica Records","permalink":"fabrica-records","url":"/category/fabrica-records"}]},{"id":12445470,"name":"AERONAUT  Your Space Transmissions Listening Kit  CD (FABCD029) ","permalink":"fabcd029-aeronaut-your-space-transmissions-listening-kit-cd","position":5,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fabcd029-aeronaut-your-space-transmissions-listening-kit-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-18T19:43:35.000Z","description":"A perfect follow-up to 2012's \"Coronal Mass\" limited-edition cassette which quickly sold out upon release, \"Your Space Transmissions Listening Kit\" is comprised of four 15-minute pieces depicting the journey of a lone astronaut into deep space, as imagined by a 7 year-old boy. \r\n\r\nThe album is meant to be a document of the past, specifically of his past as a boy imagining the perils and grandeur of space travel. \r\n\r\nEach song is a sonic expression of a moment in the spaceman's travels: Preflight/Launch, My First Spacewalk, Through the Oort Cloud, and Into the Magellanic Stream. \r\n\r\nAudio mastered by James Plotkin.

As Rambutan, Hardiman has released a steady stream of quality material on a variety of underground labels since 2007.  Subtly bridging realms of noise, dub, psych, drone, minimalism, and musique concrete, Rambutan brings listeners into a unique sonic headspace that finds common ground between bliss and dread. Utilizing various electronics, synthesizers, tapes, guitar, and bass, “Inverted Summer” is a sprawling, wide-angle piece of work, yielding deep zones of textural soundscaping that can soothe and unsettle in equal measure. \"Inverted Summer\" captures Rambutan's thick, dubby atmospherics in all their glory, revealing Hardiman to be a sound artist whose improvisational techniques are as formidable as his sense of structure and development.

Voider/FZ13). \r\n\r\n\"There’s a ringing in my ears. The left is flickering, picking up the faint sounds of the world reanimating. The right, well it may be out of commission. It’s stuck on an infinite loop, the cochlea a grinding chuff but of little use. This explosion of industrial sound; the rattle of war as brothers once bonded by peace are now torn asunder by mistrust and obstructed by smoke. It’s attrition and though my right ear may never regain its strength, its pulsations are comfort at night in a camp as hollow and horrific as one can imagine. There are the noises of the dying. There are the cries of the weak. There are the beasts of the wild, men turned feral by what man has sown. But the gears are still churning. Their relentless clank never letting up. We clock in, poise our bayonets, and wait for the howl and stampede of 10,000 high-heeled boots. It’s all just a beat to the docile ringing in my ear. We fight because we have stayed loyal to Robert Turman, his anarchistic music breaking us away from the savages of a world too eager to conform. It began at a nameless award ceremony, the hapless pop starlet engorged by fame exploding across the crowded theater. Now we fight off the beasts of celebrity, starved for the relevance and power taken away by wantonness. The music machine still quacks but we stand in the trenches, hands full of Macro to blast back the pack before we’re all callously swallowed by fashion police and paparazzi.\" - Justin Spicer (Tiny Mix Tapes) \r\n\r\nLimited to 100 pro-dubbed copies with full color j-card.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F73907500\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":27685829,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":1.75,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86717585/-/fab023.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86717585/-/fab023.jpg","width":763,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":121161,"name":"ROBERT TURMAN","permalink":"robert-turman","url":"/artist/robert-turman"}],"categories":[{"id":1540773,"name":"Cassette","permalink":"cassette","url":"/category/cassette"},{"id":3236833,"name":"Fabrica Records","permalink":"fabrica-records","url":"/category/fabrica-records"}]},{"id":8817926,"name":"A FULL COSMIC SOUND  Chemtrails  C-40  (FAB022)","permalink":"fab022-a-full-cosmic-sound-chemtrails-c-40","position":11,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fab022-a-full-cosmic-sound-chemtrails-c-40","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-06T21:57:00.000Z","description":"Second official release by this improv. experimental pysch collective from Santiago, Chile on Fabrica. \r\n\r\nMurky spacey distorted fuzz-drenched jams with a hint of Spacemen 3 and a pinch of Joy Division-ish bass-lines thrown into the mix. \r\n\r\nPlay Loud!\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F3219345\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":27685469,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":1.75,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86716529/-/fab022.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86716529/-/fab022.jpg","width":519,"height":683}],"artists":[{"id":90927,"name":"A FULL COSMIC SOUND","permalink":"a-full-cosmic-sound","url":"/artist/a-full-cosmic-sound"}],"categories":[{"id":1540773,"name":"Cassette","permalink":"cassette","url":"/category/cassette"},{"id":3236833,"name":"Fabrica Records","permalink":"fabrica-records","url":"/category/fabrica-records"}]},{"id":6129555,"name":"TURMAN, ROBERT  Beyond Painting  2xLP  (FABREC020)","permalink":"fabrec020-turman-robert-beyond-painting-2xlp","position":12,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fabrec020-turman-robert-beyond-painting-2xlp","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-05-07T23:06:03.000Z","description":"Robert Turman began making sound experiments in the early 70's employing reel-ro-reel tape, cassette decks, arp synth, drum sequencers, multiple string and percussion instruments, and whatever else he could scavenge. \r\n\r\nIn the late 70's he co-founded NON (along with Boyd Rice), but left shortly after the release of  Mode of Infection/Knife Ladder 7\" to focus on composing and releasing his own music on limited-edition, and now extremely rare, cassette tapes. Robert has collaborated with art rockers FZ13, post-apocalyptic industrialists Z.O. Voider, and more recently Aaron Dilloway (Wolf Eyes, Nevari Butchers), Neon Depth and Jandek.\r\n\r\nBeyond Painting, with its 72 minutes of haunting lo-fi ambience, is probably one of Robert's most accomplished recordings. Layers of meditative synth loops, guitar, and eastern tinged melodies, all beautifully delayed, bring to mind blistering desert landscapes, high-tension cold war era spy action sequences, and dark cavernous sounds.\r\n\r\nOriginally recorded in 1990, these tracks did not see the light of day until 2010 when they were self released on a limited run of 100 professionally printed and duplicated CD-Rs. Beyond Painting follows in the footsteps of the recently reissued \"Flux\" cassette on LP (Spectrum Spools).\r\n\r\nMastered by Timothy Stollenwerk (Mississippi Records, Sublime Frequencies, Grouper, Wooden Shjips, Yellow Swans)  at Stereophonic Mastering.\r\n\r\nEdition of 500 on 140grm black vinyl in full-color gate-fold jacket.\r\n\r\n<b>First 100 copies sold through this website will include a small zine with an interview with Robert Turman, discography and photos.</b>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F74954477\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":28777178,"name":"w/ Zine","price":20.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19555923,"name":"Normal Edition","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70605695/-/beyondpaintinglp1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70605695/-/beyondpaintinglp1.jpg","width":994,"height":983},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70605755/-/beyondpaintinglp2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70605755/-/beyondpaintinglp2.jpg","width":990,"height":983}],"artists":[{"id":121161,"name":"ROBERT TURMAN","permalink":"robert-turman","url":"/artist/robert-turman"}],"categories":[{"id":2017388,"name":"2xLP","permalink":"2xlp","url":"/category/2xlp"},{"id":3236833,"name":"Fabrica Records","permalink":"fabrica-records","url":"/category/fabrica-records"}]},{"id":7424459,"name":"SOUND OUT LIGHT  Bloom  C-30  (FAB018)","permalink":"fab018-sound-out-light-bloom-c-30","position":13,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fab018-sound-out-light-bloom-c-30","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-02T17:38:13.000Z","description":"Music like the sound of a power generator in the middle of a vast desert where the escaping ions affect the landscape, creating unusual lifeforms that grow out of the cracked ceramic floor after an acid-rain storm.

Over two sides and four compositions, Bertucci weaves a suite of tape-focused compositions which utilize a vast library of sources, including her trademark bass clarinet (which she put to exquisite use at the center of her past work in TwistyCat as well as her many solo and collaborative performances), bowed vibraphone, various percussive implements, and mysterious field recordings take from her homestead of Brooklyn, Southern Utah, and areas unnamed. The compositions embrace an expanse of quietude that’s carefully punctuated by the reverberating progression of her meticulously collaged resonances. The album’s title is thus most apt as Bertucci’s patient focus and eclectic and tolerant ear build beautifully potent and dynamic structures out of the incidental and unexpected. Her art fits confidently and boldly alongside likeminded seekers such as Moniek Darge, Graham Lambkin, Vanessa Rossetto, The Hafler Trio, and Luc Ferrari. A must for anybody interested in modern experimental composition and sound art. \r\n\r\nCoke-bottle clear vinyl packaged in a translucent sleeve designed and printed by Bertucci herself.

A heartfelt and very sincere love letter to the punk spirit of 1982 if you will.  It’s a fitting concept, given that Century Plants member Ray Hare was part of that original era, as the lead singer for Washington DC’s Deadline. In fact, Hare’s deep roots in the punk scene (he appears on the seminal “Flex Your Head” LP) make his vocal homage to Discharge even more appropriate.  Musically, Century Plants have updated the sound of 81/82, with a fully improvised approach, fuzz-drenched feedback, and lyrics that draw on several different Discharge songs. Most importantly, the spirit of blistering political dissent and anti-authoritarianism shines through, with Hare snatching Discharge concepts and phrases at will.  It all captures the energy and sonic assault of punk, yet filtered through modern-day noise, drone, and DIY strategies as well.  A unique item in their catalog, this is the second vinyl appearance for Albany, NY’s Century Plants, following a split LP with Locrian. Usually a duo (Eric Hardiman of Rambutan/Tape Drift and Ray Hare), Century Plants are joined for this record by drummer Phil Donnelly. The three also play together as part of the singularly sprawling improv psych rock unit Burnt Hills.  Rather than continuing the ominous dronescapes of the split with Locrian, in this live recording Century Plants offer an intensely rockist track, melding several of their core influences (psych rock, punk, noise, and even dub) into one seething, energetic track.
