There are several photos in Vancouver Archives (@vanarchives) including several different VAC teams, but not much has been published about the club itself. We know their clubhouse was located at Dunsmuir and Beatty (the old Cambie Grounds) - it seems they had soccer, rugby, football, basketball and baseball teams, hosted boxing matches and had a track team. Legendary Olympic sprinter Percy Williams was a member of the VAC track team.\r\n\r\nThe VAC bucket has all of the elements of an official, custom made, authentic team cap with a modern fit and shape.\r\n\r\nImages courtesy of Vancouver Archives. @vanarchives","options":[{"id":44053218,"name":"S/M ","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46318218,"name":"L/XL","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.76,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128629620/-/Nineoclock-400.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128629620/-/Nineoclock-400.jpg","width":432,"height":375},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128629626/-/Nineoclock-401.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128629626/-/Nineoclock-401.jpg","width":432,"height":375},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128629629/-/Nineoclock-403.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128629629/-/Nineoclock-403.jpg","width":432,"height":375}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4674641,"name":"Hats","permalink":"hats","url":"/category/hats"}]},{"id":13729494,"name":"Vancouver Beavers 1918","permalink":"vancouver-beavers-1918-lot-2","position":4,"price":39.0,"default_price":39.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/vancouver-beavers-1918-lot-2","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-23T03:00:47.000Z","description":"Stitch Details:\r\n\"V\" - Vancouver Beavers Raised Logo (centre front)\r\n\"1918\" - The year which they wore this logo (left side)\r\n\"Beavers\" - Team Name (centre back)\r\n\"Vancouver Beavers\" - Printed (inside hat on the crown taping)\r\n\"The Nine O'Clock Gun Company\" - Our Trademark Inner Patch (inside centre back)\r\n\r\nBucket Details:\r\nStretch Fitted (S/M & L/XL)\r\nDark Navy Cotton Twill Fabric with White Stitching\r\n6 Panel, Flat Brim (shapable) with 4\" Crown\r\n\r\nSizing Details:\r\nS/M is best paired for head sizes of 7, 7 1/8, & 7 1/4\r\nL/XL is best paired for head sizes of 7 3/8, 7 1/2, & 7 5/8\r\n\r\nShipping Details:\r\nItems will be packaged and shipped within a week of placing your order.\r\n\r\nBOOM!\r\nBack by popular demand! We are ecstatic to bring you our second shipment of 'Beavers' buckets!\r\n\r\nThis lid is a tribute to Vancouver's first professional baseball club, the Vancouver Beavers. The Beavers started in 1908, and were bought by Bob Brown, also known as \"Mr Baseball\". The team played at 5th Avenue & Hemlock Street in Athletic Park for several seasons, but eventually folded in 1922. The logo represented on this bucket is similar to what was worn on their jersey in 1918.\r\n\r\nThe Beaver's bucket has all of the elements of an official, custom made, authentic team cap with a modern fit and shape.\r\n\r\nImages courtesy of Vancouver Archives. @vanarchives","options":[{"id":44052729,"name":"S/M","price":39.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44717691,"name":"L/XL","price":39.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.76,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128629827/-/Nineoclock-397.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128629827/-/Nineoclock-397.jpg","width":432,"height":375},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128629830/-/Nineoclock-398.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128629830/-/Nineoclock-398.jpg","width":432,"height":375},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128629833/-/Nineoclock-399.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128629833/-/Nineoclock-399.jpg","width":432,"height":375}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4674641,"name":"Hats","permalink":"hats","url":"/category/hats"}]}]
