However, if you were expecting to follow the instructions on the back so you could build your own assault rifle, we'd suggest utilizing a different method and/or rifle assembly manual.","options":[{"id":29176457,"name":"M","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29176460,"name":"L","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29176463,"name":"XL","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29176466,"name":"2XL","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":29176469,"name":"3XL","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.99,"amount_with_others":6.99,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.99,"amount_with_others":4.99,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.99,"amount_with_others":10.99}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91653038/-/1-warmart-mainer.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91653038/-/1-warmart-mainer.jpg","width":999,"height":879},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91645310/-/1-warmart-main.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91645310/-/1-warmart-main.jpg","width":1000,"height":784},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91645358/-/1-warmart-back.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91645358/-/1-warmart-back.jpg","width":1000,"height":781}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2527427,"name":"Apparel","permalink":"apparel","url":"/category/apparel"}]},{"id":9323753,"name":"Demigodz - KILLmatic VINYL 2LP","permalink":"demigodz-killmatic-vinyl-2lp-pre-order","position":11,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/demigodz-killmatic-vinyl-2lp-pre-order","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-02-05T10:18:14.000Z","description":"Demigodz - KILLmatic VINYL 2LP \r\nRyu, Esoteric, Blacastan & Motive\r\nProduced by DJ Premier, Marco Polo, Snowgoons, Apathy, Will C., Teddy Roxpin, Skammadix & Chumzilla\r\nFeaturing R.A.

Shortly after its release, the label went under and the CD quickly became out of print and hard to find, despite the high demand. Demigodz Entertainment in association with Endless Recordings now brings you this classic EP as a massive 2-disc remastered Deluxe Edition, featuring 6 unreleased songs recorded in the same sessions intended for the Demigodz full length at that time. In addition to the 6 bonus songs, the 2nd disc contains full instrumentals to all the songs from the original EP as well as the new bonus tracks. This double disc release also showcases brand new original artwork in limited edition form. \"The Godz Must Be Crazier\" is a classic piece of underground hip hop capturing an early era of an indie goldmine, making this a necessary purchase for heads across the board.\r\n\r\n01.

Painstaking lyricism, strangleholding mic presence, high caliber rap flows and upper echelon neck-snapping production round out this release in true Demigodzilla fashion. Some of the highlights include the uptempo \"Shoot First\", which is a Mike Shinoda produced track featuring the legendary B-Real (of Cypress Hill) and Celph Titled, as well as a collaboration with J-Live called \"This Is The Formula\". Little Brother's own Phonte makes a cameo on \"True Love\", and some soulful hooks are laced across the album courtesy of Chip-Fu (of Fu-Schnickens) and Wu-Tang vocalist Blue Raspberry. Also contributing a major factor to the album is singer Holly Brook, best known for Fort Minor's chart topping \"Where'd You Go\" single and video. Fort Minor, Get Busy Committee, Demigodz and AOTP family are definitely in full effect throughout the project, including Ryu (of Styles of Beyond), Motive, King Magnetic, Veze Skante and more. The bulk of production is handled by Apathy himself, who has been building up a production resume producing for Tiye Phoenix, Styles of Beyond, 7L & Esoteric, Eternia, and albums from Cypress Hill and Edo G. This is an impressive body of work and is much anticipated by faithful fans that Apathy has steadily accumulated from his long list of indie vinyl era 12\" singles, album-like mixtapes, epic double disc \"It's the Bootleg\" compilations and relentless domestic and international touring. Sure to be contender for hip hop album of 2009, \"Wanna Snuggle?\" smashes completely through the sophomore jinx and delivers timeless rap music for you and yours.  \r\n\r\nTRACK LISTING:\r\n\r\n01.

After years of strongly cultivating their fanbase and branding their stamp within the underground hip-hop scene, this supergroup of sharp soloists unite to create a force of witty lyricism and authentic, classic-style East Coast hip-hop production. The crew consists of many recognizable names, including Apathy, Celph Titled, Ryu (of Styles of Beyond/Fort Minor), Esoteric, Blacastan and Motive. Each member has built up their own following over time --- and now they all combine to create a powerhouse album that their fans have always wanted. While Apathy, Celph Titled, Esoteric and Blacastan are also part of the Army of the Pharaohs clique, the Demigodz are an old school crew that have a strong alliance with their Pharaoh brethren dating back to the late 90's. Additionally, the Godz have been highly heralded by Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda, as he recruited them to be a part of his RIAA Certified Gold \"Fort Minor\" project and tour in 2006. This new album is the first official follow-up since 2002's \"The Godz Must Be Crazy\" EP and 2007's \"The Godz Must Be Crazier\" deluxe re-issue; both top-selling indie hip-hop titles. \"Demigodz is for true, hardcore hip-hop fans,\" Apathy says. \"This KILLmatic album was made to reflect that.

Shortly after its release, the label went under and the CD quickly became out of print and hard to find, despite the high demand. Demigodz Entertainment in association with Endless Recordings now brings you this classic EP as a massive 2-disc remastered Deluxe Edition, featuring 6 unreleased songs recorded in the same sessions intended for the Demigodz full length at that time. In addition to the 6 bonus songs, the 2nd disc contains full instrumentals to all the songs from the original EP as well as the new bonus tracks. This double disc release also showcases brand new original artwork in limited edition form. \"The Godz Must Be Crazier\" is a classic piece of underground hip hop capturing an early era of an indie goldmine, making this a necessary purchase for heads across the board. \r\n\r\n- TRACK LISTING:\r\n\r\n01.

GBC.\" GBC (Get Busy Committee) is a group comprised of Apathy, Ryu (of Styles of Beyond/Fort Minor) and Scoop Deville. This project pushes boundaries and is not your typical underground hip-hop album. It fuses all kinds of genres together and delivers a sound that could compete with any of today's mainstream music without being a contrived \"swag\" festival. Consider this an experimental opus with a Demigodz twist = Koalas, uzis, payphones, and pagers. Production is handled by Apathy and Scoop Deville. Creative/Art Direction by Alex 2 Tone of TLFI and Born X Raised.\r\n\r\n- TRACK LISTING:\r\n\r\n01. My Little Razorblade\r\n02. Runnin Outta Dough (feat. Tashina Suzuki)\r\n03. Stylish Clothes\r\n04.

Executive produced by Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda, this project brings a strong barrage of larger-than-life production and undisputed lyricism mixed with the classic raw hip hop sound that the west coast Demigodz squad and Fort Minor frontmen are known for. Merging action packed rhymes, tongue in cheek humor and infectious hooks, \"Reseda Beach\" looks to deliver the perfect mix of that God-damned rap music that's missing in today's market. This double-disc release showcases not only the album but it also contains a bonus disc featuring the tracks from their previous \"Razor Rag\" mixtape, minus the DJ shouts and mixing. Additionally, there are 3 completely unreleased songs included on the bonus disc as well. All in all, this 36-song opus features guest vocals from Mike Shinoda himself along with Apathy & Celph Titled (Demigodz/Army of the Pharaohs), Scoop Deville (Get Busy Committee/Producer for Snoop, Kendrick Lamar & Dr. Dre), Somaya Reece (VH1's Love & Hip Hop), Bishop Lamont (Aftermath alumni) and Alex 2Tone (True Love & False Idols). Production is handled by the group's in-house team of Vin Skully & Cheapshot, plus Mike Shinoda, J. Dilla, Scoop Deville, Apathy, Divine Styler, Aqua and Chumzilla.\r\n\r\n- TRACK LISTING:\r\n\r\n01.

The art form is brought full-circle through this groundbreaking collaboration between underground giant Celph Titled and production legend Buckwild (D.I.T.C.)! Showing that the lessons from the past can be combined with the innovations of the present, these two heavyweight artists have joined forces to create a neo-classic. By having uninhibited access to Buckwild’s original mid-90’s production, Celph Titled was able to select and record to over 16 unreleased D.I.T.C. bangers; bringing his charismatic flow and lyrical prowess to each one.\r\n\r\nGuest appearances from D.I.T.C. (A.G., O.C., Diamond D), Treach (of Naughty by Nature), Vinnie Paz (of Jedi Mind Tricks), Brand Nubian (Grand Puba, Sadat X), R.A. The Rugged Man, Chino XL, Demigodz (Apathy, Ryu, Esoteric), F.T.

Aptly titled \"Nineteen Ninety MORE\", this release serves as a companion title to the well received \"Ninety Now.\" Due to popular demand and fan interest, this release features 4 unreleased songs from the original sessions which include guest appearances from Cella Dwellas, Outerspace (AOTP), Laws (J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League), Kwest (formerly Kwest Tha Madd Lad) and Lord Digga (Bluez Brothers/Masta Ace Inc). Also included are the 3 previously vinyl-only cuts \"The Celph Titled Show\", \"Nothin' To Say (feat. Rise)\" and \"There Will Be Blood [Remix] (feat. DITC and Brand Nubian)\". In addition, all the instrumentals for these songs are gathered here as well. This is the perfect addendum for anyone who owns \"Ninety Now\" and is an essential piece for any Buckwild/DITC production enthusiast.\r\n\r\nKey Selling Points:\r\n\r\n• In-demand additional material from the sessions of \"Nineteen Ninety Now\"\r\n• Authentic mid-90's era vaulted beats from DITC's own, the legendary Buckwild.\r\n\r\n- TRACK LISTING:\r\n\r\n01.

This album compiles some of Apathy's earliest demo recordings from as far back as 1994 up until 1998. Transferred from cassettes and ADAT studio tapes, these songs represent his early to late teen years, as well as Eternia's first recordings ever. “The Alien Tongue” is a title that takes you on a journey thru the 90's era of Apathy, fresh into his early association with Jedi Mind Tricks, as this was around the same time he was recording for their debut album, “The Psycho Social...” Also included are some of the first beats Ap ever produced, made on an old school Ensoniq ASR-10. This release gives fans a great insight into the mind of a young Apathy and a spotlight on the beginnings of what would become a highly respected legacy.\r\n\r\n- TRACK LISTING:\r\n\r\n01.

Excuse the language, but to put it frankly this self-proclaimed gorilla has torn stages down worldwide and gained an aggressively dedicated following since his first raps surfaced on Jedi Mind Tricks’ cult-classic debut in 1997. Always repping his Demigodz, Army of the Pharaohs and Get Busy Committee crew affiliations proudly, the widely talented wordsmith continues his rampage with his 3rd official studio solo album --- “HONKEY KONG”. A fitting title for a monster of an LP, this disc features an eyebrow-raising clientele of producers including DJ Premier, Evidence, DJ Muggs, Statik Selektah and Da Beatminerz. Joining forces with Apathy on the mic duties are the upperclassmen of respected MCs with a lineup that features Xzibit, Vinnie Paz, Celph Titled, Ill Bill, Slaine, General Steele (of Smif-N-Wessun), Mad Lion, Action Bronson and his AOTP brethren Esoteric, Outerspace and Reef the Lost Cauze. Released on Apathy and Celph Titled’s own label, Dirty Version Records, this marks the first release for the new imprint and will set a monumental tone for their future releases. As an added extra, the digital version of this album includes 7 bonus tracks from Apathy featuring Eternia, Diabolic, Blacastan and Scoop Deville.\r\n\r\n- TRACK LISTING:\r\n\r\n01.

Painstaking lyricism, strangle-holding mic presence, high caliber rap flows and upper echelon neck-snapping production round out this release in true Demigodzilla fashion. Some of the highlights include the uptempo \"Shoot First\", which is a Mike Shinoda produced track featuring the legendary B-Real (of Cypress Hill) and Celph Titled, as well as a collaboration with J-Live called \"This Is The Formula\". Little Brother's own Phonte makes a cameo on \"True Love\", and some soulful hooks are laced across the album courtesy of Chip-Fu (of Fu-Schnickens) and Wu-Tang vocalist Blue Raspberry. Also contributing a major factor to the album is singer Holly Brook, best known for Fort Minor's chart topping \"Where'd You Go\" single and video. Fort Minor, Get Busy Committee, Demigodz and AOTP family are definitely in full effect throughout the project, including Ryu (of Styles of Beyond), Motive, Emilio Lopez, King Magnetic, Veze Skante and more. The bulk of production is handled by Apathy himself, who has been building up a production resume producing for Tiye Phoenix, Styles of Beyond, 7L & Esoteric, Eternia, and upcoming albums from Cypress Hill and Edo G. This is an impressive body of work and is much anticipated by faithful fans that Apathy has steadily accumulated from his long list of indie vinyl era 12\" singles, album-like mixtapes, epic double disc \"It's the Bootleg\" compilations and relentless domestic and international touring. Sure to be contender for hip hop album of the year, \"Wanna Snuggle?\" smashes completely through the sophomore jinx and delivers timeless rap music for you and yours.\r\n\r\n- TRACK LISTING:\r\n\r\n01.

Just like 2003's \"Volume 1\", this compilation continues in the tradition of being a chock-full double disc sized limited edition set. 38 digitally mastered tracks in all, this eye-opening collection includes mostly unreleased vaulted material spanning the earlier years of his career up to his Atlantic Records recording sessions. In addition, there are 12\" only songs, collaborations, freestyles and remixes never previously released in digital format. Apathy, the frontman of his highly respected Demigodz crew, is an underground veteran who has been making and appearing on timeless indie hip hop records since 1997, beginning with Jedi Mind Tricks' \"Psycho-Social\" album and following up with countless classic 12\" vinyl singles from the now defunct but legendary late 90's indie label, Bronx Science. \"Hell's Lost & Found\" represents a strong staple in the underground hip hop genre and will be a must-have item for all Apathy, Fort Minor and Demigodz associated fans worldwide.\r\n\r\n- TRACK LISTING:\r\n\r\n01.

This release contains 22 brand new tracks, including full original produced songs plus a few exclusive freestyles & remakes utilizing classic golden era instrumentals, some of which are unreleased and have never been used before (Nas’ \"Represent\" & Jeru the Damaja’s \"Da Bichez\"), as well as rock-influenced instrumentals.

He is also known for his freestyle ability which is often the highlight of his live performances. This massive double-disc length collection of Apathy songs has 45 tracks and is a full 160 minutes long. That's just under 3 hours! These joints span as far back as 1997 and complete all the way thru 2003. All the songs are from the original masters and everything has been digitally remastered to professional standards, including the old classics like \"Compatible\", \"Smackdown\", \"Ain't Nuthin' Nice\", and \"Just Begun\". You'll never find a collection of all these songs in perfect quality anywhere else. A lot of tracks have never before been released on CD, and many are super rare. There's even three previously unreleased heaters: \"Y'All Ain't Good Enough\", \"Public Execution (Demigodz Mix)\" and \"Don't Talk To Me\". A must for any Apathy, Demigodz or Army of the Pharaohs fan!\r\n\r\n- TRACK LISTING:\r\n\r\n01. Y'All Ain't Good Enough (feat. Celph Titled)\r\n02. Every Emcee (feat. Rise)\r\n03. DSL's\r\n04.

But if you feel hoggish, then creep! It was inevitable. After the success of “Eatadiccup” & “$poiled Rotten” from J-Zone’s last two albums, folks started talkin’... “J-Zone and Celph Titled need to do an album together”. Say no more, the Hogs are here. As a group, J-Zone and Celph Titled (aka Kenny Hoggins and Wade Hoggs) are the Bo$$ Hog Barbarian$. The two multi-talented beatsmiths/rappers /entertainers / masters of all that is rude are in the house for a full length ride. Enter Hog Heaven, where the order of the day is foul mouthed trash talk, funkafied beats and a sense of humor, to the 50th power. With nearly all production by J-Zone and Celph Titled, the lone outside beat comes from none other than the legendary Mr. Walt of Da Beatminerz’, longtime Hog affiliates. On the rapping side? No guests!! Hogs don’t need em. Celph and Zone are the Jordan and Pippen of Hog Heaven, so no help is necessary. 100% pure unadulterated hoggin’. With Zone having produced for the likes of Biz Markie, Casual, Devin the Dude, Del, 7L & Esoteric, Tha Alkaholiks, King T and many more and Celph collaborating with everybody from 45 King, to Mike Shinoda (of Linkin Park), to Redman & Fabolous, the hogs are heavyweights. Brought to you by Mt. Kill-A-Ho / Hog Cabin Ent., the official Bo$$ Hog Barbarian$ record label.

After first appearing on the 2002 Ill Boogie/Caroline Demigodz EP, The Godz Must Be Crazy, Motive has been a staple within the crew that has enjoyed great independent success due to its cult-like following. In true East Coast fashion, NJ-bred, Connecticut representer Motive a/k/a \"Hoody 2 Shoez\" brings out his debut solo mixtape, \"Mo-llinium: The Takeover Begins\". The tape features original production from Apathy and Chum the Skrilla Guerilla as well as many cleverly manipulated old school and industry standard beats. Fellow crew members Celph Titled, Apathy, Esoteric and Styles of Beyond all make appearances and help make Motive's mixtape a banger from start to finish. This release comes as a follow-up to Mo's 2007 European Tour with Apathy and Main Flow as well as his continuous buzz appearances on major releases such as Apathy's Eastern Philosophy, Green Lantern and Styles of Beyond's Razor Tag, Apathy's It's the Bootleg 2xCD collection, and his role in the 2006 independent film, 6 Brothaz In A Cadillac, alongside Wildchild (of Lootpack), Slim Kid Tre (of Pharcyde) and other underground cohorts such as Mighty Casey and Oktober. With \"Mo-llinium\" showcasing Motive's sound, solo projects from fellow crew members due to surface this year, and a full-length Demigodz LP currently in the works . . . let the takeover begin!\r\n\r\n- TRACK LISTING:\r\n\r\n01.
