What is it about those giant expanses of water that ease our souls, center our spirit and offer up a place of comfort in any storm? \r\n\r\nI grew up on the Gulf Coast of Florida. Each evening as a child my Grandparents and I would go to the beach at sunset to comb for shells and sink our toes into the shoreline. As I grew the beach became my spot: for exercise- swimming and walking each evening, for nourishing my mind- reading is perfect with a soundtrack of waves lapping, and for comfort- what is more soothing than floating on a warm blanket of salt water? As an adult I married my husband next to the water, on a beach just after a tropical storm spent days dumping rain. That night our our entire wedding party dipped into the ocean. We swam and laughed and I kissed my husband under that velvety night sky, surrounded by a comforting cocoon. That moment was perfection. And my heart was anchored, right then and there. \r\n\r\nps- This picture was originally created as a benefit image to raise funds to help clean up the Gulf Oil spill. I thought my heart would break when I saw the images of all that oil...\" (Jen Renninger, Still Room Studio)\r\n\r\nOriginal media: gouache and acrylic on board, scanned and digitally manipulated.\r\n\r\nThis image is approximately 6\" x 8\", with a white border on 8.5\" x 11\" archival paper, smooth and heavy stock.\r\n","options":[{"id":12613830,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.95,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36717044/-/hearts_reside_here_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36717044/-/hearts_reside_here_1.jpg","width":516,"height":421},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36717068/-/hearts_reside_here_series.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36717068/-/hearts_reside_here_series.jpg","width":500,"height":483}],"artists":[{"id":62634,"name":"Please Be Still/Still Room Studio","permalink":"please-be-still-still-room-studio","url":"/artist/please-be-still-still-room-studio"}],"categories":[{"id":2067624,"name":"Art and Prints","permalink":"art-and-prints","url":"/category/art-and-prints"}]},{"id":3769520,"name":"We Have Everything We Need","permalink":"we-have-everything-we-need","position":224,"price":30.0,"default_price":30.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/we-have-everything-we-need","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-05-18T02:20:18.000Z","description":"Part of the the 'Words to live by ' Series by artist Jen Renninger of Still Room Studio. \r\n\r\nThis Giclee is roughly 5.5 x 8 inches printed on 8.5 × 11 inch archival paper.
