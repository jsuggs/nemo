Visual Artist & Writer Craig Kerrecoe, founder of Ovenden Contemporary, has compiled over 100 of the self-portraits submitted to the competition, including paintings, photography, digital art, sketches, prints and sculpture from artists around the world. \r\n\r\n'Self: Self-portraits from around the world' is an 80 page hardcover format book with a glossy dust jacket. It is a limited edition book of 1000 numbered copies and all come signed by the compiler, Craig Kerrecoe. Dimensions 25x20cm or 10x8\" (w x h).\r\n\r\n<I>\"Identity is immeasurably greater than a simple snapshot of oneâ€™s face. Self-portraits can be incredibly revealing and are essential as an art form. They offer the Artist, and the viewer, a valuable opportunity to consider just what it is that makes us, us.\" </I>\r\n\r\nCraig Kerrecoe\r\n","options":[{"id":1698401,"name":"Default","price":34.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.25,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":17.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":17.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":17.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":35.75,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":13,"name":"Ecuador","code":"EC"}},{"amount_alone":30.75,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":96,"name":"Egypt","code":"EG"}},{"amount_alone":27.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":100,"name":"Estonia","code":"EE"}},{"amount_alone":17.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":17.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":27.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":243,"name":"Montenegro","code":"ME"}},{"amount_alone":27.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":189,"name":"Romania","code":"RO"}},{"amount_alone":35.75,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":193,"name":"Saint Kitts and Nevis","code":"KN"}},{"amount_alone":27.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":228,"name":"Ukraine","code":"UA"}},{"amount_alone":17.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":20.75,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":20.75,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":20.75,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":17.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":20.75,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":20.75,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":20.75,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":184,"name":"Poland","code":"PL"}},{"amount_alone":20.75,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":15.75,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":20.75,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":125,"name":"Hungary","code":"HU"}},{"amount_alone":20.75,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":20.75,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":20.75,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":91,"name":"Cyprus","code":"CY"}},{"amount_alone":20.75,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3522840/-/self-cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3522840/-/self-cover.jpg","width":927,"height":772}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":330300,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":426807,"name":"The Black Box Project","permalink":"the-black-box-project","position":2,"price":34.95,"default_price":34.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-black-box-project","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-10-14T23:05:24.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":1698571,"name":"Default","price":34.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3523160/-/thesethingsforever-500.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3523160/-/thesethingsforever-500.jpg","width":500,"height":640}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":330300,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]}]
