It is a vehicle for artists who are passionate, committed to their craft, and challenging the boundaries of a “Fine Art” isolated from society at large.\r\n\r\nSome of Ad Hoc Art’s 2009 featured artists included Armsrock, Morning Breath, Crash, Cycle, Daze, Imminent Disaster, Know Hope, Hiro Kurata, Gilbet Oh, Chris Stain, TheDirtyFabulous, & Joe Vaux.\r\n\r\nAd Hoc Art resulted as one of the primary efforts of Peripheral Media Projects {PMP}, an art, design, & print studio and creative think tank, founded in 2002.  From September 2005-January 2010, AHA & PMP were bosom buddies located next door to one another, off the Morgan Avenue “L” train, in an area zoned the “East Williamsburg Industrial Park.”  Amongst concrete factories, lumber yards, metal recyclers, and waves of creative-types looking for relatively affordable live/work spaces, the two entities blazed a salient trail as they ushered street art, consciousness, and activism to the forefront of the art world.\r\n\r\nAs AHA & PMP continue to try and increase the overall goodness on planet earth, they are bringing forth an ecologically-driven art residency and cultural development center in the amazing country of Vermont-land.  In addition to the center’s location being the Buxton’s family homestead dating to the 1700′s, it was also home and studio to one of the most important figures in modern printmaking, Harry Shokler.  After helping blaze the trail for the new art form of Serigraphy, Shokler worked in the barn studio for more than 40 years marrying screen printing’s industrial commercial rigor with the infinite creativity of art & the human spirit.  We are greatly pleasured and honored to be carrying on his blazing footsteps.","options":[{"id":12278142,"name":"Default","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":8.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38250316/-/Picture_24.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38250316/-/Picture_24.png","width":481,"height":645},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38250348/-/Picture_25.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38250348/-/Picture_25.jpg","width":861,"height":644}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":3664136,"name":"domenic petrillo ","permalink":"domenic-petrillo","position":3,"price":200.0,"default_price":200.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/domenic-petrillo","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-04-27T21:35:36.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":12278134,"name":"Default","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":8.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38251004/-/Picture_38.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38251004/-/Picture_38.png","width":479,"height":644}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":3664118,"name":"christian tribastone","permalink":"christiane-tribastone","position":4,"price":200.0,"default_price":200.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/christiane-tribastone","status":"sold-out","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-04-27T21:33:49.000Z","description":"Christian Tribastone received his BFA from the Alfred University, School of Art & Design in 2001 & his MST in Art Education from RIT in 2005.
