I work very hard to carve out things that people will enjoy.\r\n\r\nSpoons are the most common pipe people ask for. I personally enjoy spinning rock on a lathe. It is fun, dangerous, and makes a variety of shapes. Mushroom shaped pipes have sold very well for me. I can make a smaller mouth piece or a more blunt one. Please let me know what type you prefer and I will accommodate. The bowls are 5/8ths\" wide and about 5/8ths\" to 1\" deep. the draw is 1/4\" though some have a larger or smaller draw, the hole in the bottom of the bowl is 1/8th\". I normally don't drill the draw all the way through for aesthetics. But I can also do a side carb or no carb if asked. also adding dots like the small yellow one can mask a carb as part of the pattern. Purple, red, white, and yellow are made of Pyrophillite. Black and translucent brown are Chlorite. I also have some soap stone in white and light green. As for exact color I can not control what the rock will look like. i will do what I can to get close to what you want. The striations and spots can be very different when I cut into the rock and may vary greatly even in the same color rock. Also some have more then one color like the center of the first photo has a yellow purple pipe. You may notice some of the other rocks are also translucent (Yellow is an awesome example). These are natural stone so they will become that way the more polishing they get. I did not polish these pipes, I would not want to put any thing on it you wouldn't want to smoke, I find that the oils from your hands and from use make them polished very quickly. I sprayed them with water to get them to be shinny for these photos. normally I walk around with one in my pocket and they shine up very fast just doing that. I have had a piece of black that had been with me for 7 years. It seems transparent, you can see deep into the stone, one of the many benefits of a stone pipe.
