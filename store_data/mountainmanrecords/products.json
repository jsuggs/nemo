Dreamdecay are a Seattle born toast to a doggedly unwavering, touch-warmer-than-death strain of noise rock.\r\n\r\nTheir five track record 'Fern' floats into being with a blizzard of screaming guitars - a clamorous instrumental race to the beginning of the song that sounds like Earth trying to play a 'Bloody Valentine jam and freaking out under the frustration. 'The Dire and Ever Circling Wolves' with another guitar and a Scratch Acid injection.\r\n\r\nOn first hearing the vocals I thought they pulled directly from the commanding cries of Michael Gira, yet there's something almost heraldic about these utterances, that kind of touch upon desert splutters and doomy coughs. Praise to the lead singer though, whose post-punk lump in the throat does well to arc over the top of the candle-lit tumult swarming beneath him.\r\n\r\nI think the intention with this record is to initially trip up it's listeners, with huge blocks of impassable sawing, screeching fuzz and buried beneath the sand vocals. 'Fern' throws all of it's initial weight behind the idea of testing you as a listener, but comes down hard with lashings of North Western musical heritage to wash away the drone fan's take on rock that you've been struggling to swallow. Tracks II & III do much of what the opening number did, but bake it into four and two minute drone odes to Confusion Is Sex.\r\n\r\n'Fern' treads heavily, most often at a lumbering pace, yet ignores the confines of already written Sludge metal and takes convention to task with the bestial assault of the Melvins and a charged post-punk overlay. The now noticeable slacker vocals push a little harder into the skirmish. \r\n\r\nThings progress to an almost funereal state by the time the ending track appears, not before track 'IV' gets to flex it's Jesus Lizard without the metal chops with a quickly spun math-y opening that ends up working as the entire spine of the track, holding up a canopy of drawn-out early Swans electricity. \r\n\r\nThe sheer love for butchering about with feedback and laying off any metallic precision keeps this record constitutionally punk in some sense, but the common feel of 'Fern' doesn't lend itself to anything other than a 'noise' tag. There are passages of ear-splitting doom, vague dream sequences of gazey proportions and even a well submerged predisposition towards the sooty grunge of Mudhoney.

Key Losers is a band that may be characterized by its concept-driven lyrics and melody-driven music.\r\n\r\n\"California Lite\" was engineered by Phil Elverum (Mount Eerie) in Anacortes, Washington, during late 2010, due out on May 24th via Elverum's P.W. Elverum and Sun. It was recorded by Katy and friends referred to as “Key Losers Black Crow Session Band” featuring Karl Blau (K Records), Greg Campanile (Total Noise), Andrew Dorsett (LAKE / K Records), Tom Filardo (Total Noise), Nick Krgovich (No Kids / Tomlab Records) and Eli Moore (LAKE / K Records).","options":[{"id":12797574,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":14.22,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.25,"amount_with_others":1.35,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.87,"amount_with_others":5.44}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37363442/-/Key-Losers-California-Lite.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37363442/-/Key-Losers-California-Lite.jpg","width":608,"height":608}],"artists":[{"id":66532,"name":"Key Losers","permalink":"key-losers","url":"/artist/key-losers"}],"categories":[{"id":3669833,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"},{"id":1927360,"name":"DISTRO","permalink":"distro","url":"/category/distro"}]},{"id":4468783,"name":"Ridgemont \"Colder Days\" LP (Mindless/Kiss of Death)","permalink":"colder-days-lp-mindless-kiss-of-death","position":42,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/colder-days-lp-mindless-kiss-of-death","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-09-19T21:07:10.000Z","description":"In less than 2 short years, Allston, Massachusetts' Ridgemont have managed to release a demo, the \"Documented Failures\" EP, a special tour edition cassette and record a full-length.

Inspired by early Propaghandi, Dillinger Four, Latterman and showing traces of a love for Thin Lizzy, Ridgemont spends their time humbly playing the music they hold dear to their hearts. With only a small amount of touring under their belts so far, the band expects to spend a whole lot more time out on the road once their first full-length is released.

Moral Omnivoration.\r\n\r\nEmphatic atrophy. Like a sun-bleached can of cola lying idle for years in the desert. Or, upon \r\nhearing gunfire, being scared, and trying to decide whether or not to call the Police. \"Rennet\" is \r\na convoluted expression of “Arizona Goddam”.\r\n\r\nTechnically his 14th album of songs (following the two full length LP’s released in 2010, French \r\nQuarter’s “It’s Not Just Kissing” and eponymous “Yellow Canary Jumpsuit”) sees a prolific artist in \r\ntransition. Partially produced and heavily influenced by Sonoran sound artist Glochids, these \r\nsongs run the proverbial gamut, from Steinbrink’s expected sparse guitar based meditations to \r\n“new” hook-based dance pop, utilizing traditional Indonesian Gamelan gongs, and heavy use of \r\nGlochid's and Steinbrink’s field recordings. \r\n<br><i>from Gilgongo Records</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://stephensteinbrink.tumblr.com/\">Stephen Steinbrink / French Quarter</a>","options":[{"id":12727870,"name":"Default","price":2.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.7,"amount_with_others":0.95,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.4,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.6,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38244500/-/rennet.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38244500/-/rennet.jpg","width":800,"height":995},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37122972/-/Rennet-CS.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37122972/-/Rennet-CS.jpg","width":1000,"height":620},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37122980/-/Rennet-Spine.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37122980/-/Rennet-Spine.jpg","width":1000,"height":667}],"artists":[{"id":66530,"name":"Stephen Steinbrink","permalink":"stephen-steinbrink","url":"/artist/stephen-steinbrink"}],"categories":[{"id":1403011,"name":"CASSETTE","permalink":"cassette","url":"/category/cassette"},{"id":1927360,"name":"DISTRO","permalink":"distro","url":"/category/distro"}]},{"id":4227195,"name":"So Adult \"Rookie\" CS","permalink":"rookie-cs","position":55,"price":2.0,"default_price":2.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rookie-cs","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-08-09T08:20:48.000Z","description":"the 3rd pressing of So Adult's \"Rookie\" EP.\r\n4 songs from these Bellingham, WA 90's indie prodigies.
