Opae Ula are known to live up to 20 years! Our units come with a Cultured coral lava rock and live sand to feed the shrimp in your tank for years to come. Along with 5-10 Opae Ula depending on the size of your kit.\r\n\r\nOn the market are sealed systems called <b> Ecospheres.</b> Customer satisfaction is low with these units for several reasons.\r\n\r\n1. The shrimp in these units if you ever noticed are clear or pink. This is a classic sign of a unhappy shrimp. It is true that some shrimp are more pale then others . But the shrimp in our units are red as seen in pics.\r\n\r\n2. They reduce the lifespan of a shrimp that can live up to 20 years down to 2 years... That alone should make it a shame to buy these units.\r\n\r\n3. The shrimp in Small Sealed Ecosphere units are starved. Not enough food is able to grow inside and since it is sealed you do not have the option to feed them. With time the shrimp shrink in size and consume there own exoskeleton ! Leaving pale small shrimp in your unit.\r\n\r\n4. These units often come with only 4-5 shrimp inside making them dull to watch and are not customizable at all. Open desktop units such as ours can easily support up to 6 happy red Opae Ula. That you can watch feed on the algae covered rock or feed them yourself. With our shrimp food.\r\n\r\n5. Sealed units cost a fortune to refill with new shrimp after their short 2 year lifespan . Our tanks are easy to add shrimp to if you desire and make it easy to add new decorations.\r\n\r\n<b>How to care for a Desktop kit?</b>\r\n\r\n1.Simply remove the kit from package. \r\n2.Remove cork in top used for shipping. \r\n3.Place where the tank and preferably get indirect sunlight or a good source of artificial light. \r\n4. add bottled water over time to compensate for evaporated water. \r\n5. \" optional\" feeding your shrimp 1-2 times a week.

Lohena are another Shrimp species that live naturally with Opae ula in anchialine ponds. They are a lot larger then Opae Ula and range from 1/2-1 inch in size. which is about 2-3 times the size of Normal Opae Ula. They have distinct line pattern on there tails large claws. They are a lot more rare then Opae Ula and prefer to have more space. \r\n\r\nA great way to add excitement and expand your tank !!!!\r\nAdd 1-2 for every 100 shrimp \r\n\r\nAlpha Opae are very entertaining to watch in a Opae Ula tank. They add new excitement and energy to your tank. There temperament is more aggressive then Opae Ula. Which is why I gave them the name Alpha or Boss Opae Ula. When prowling the tank they boss around the Opae making them move out of there way. \r\n\r\nDiet: They scavenge and eat the same foods as Opae Ula. \r\n\r\nMinimum tank size: 1 gal\r\n\r\nHardiness : They are a little less hardy then H. Rubra however, they are still tough shrimp and can handle a lot harsher conditions compared to any other shrimp out there \r\n\r\nCommon M. lohena Myth: \r\nIf you read online you may come across people saying that these shrimp eat the Opae Ula and that their diet consist of H.rubra. This is in fact a massive myth. In my years of keeping both of these Shrimp and Hours of observation I have never witnessed a M. lohena attack and kill a Opae Ula. In fact to my knowledge nobody has. During feeding times in my tank they eat the same algae wafers or shrimp food that i give all my other shrimp. In fact they get greedy and try to take a flake for themselves while many other shrimp swarm it. Clearly if they wanted to eat Opae they would not prefer shrimp food.   \r\n\r\nmore pics and video coming soon","options":[{"id":30381170,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":44.33,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":54.96,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":44.33,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":117,"name":"Guam","code":"GU"}},{"amount_alone":43.64,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":18,"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HK"}},{"amount_alone":43.84,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":27,"name":"Malaysia","code":"MY"}},{"amount_alone":57.33,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":59.88,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122534532/-/DSC00865.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122534532/-/DSC00865.JPG","width":1080,"height":810},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122534508/-/DSC00835.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122534508/-/DSC00835.JPG","width":1080,"height":810},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122534547/-/DSC00870.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122534547/-/DSC00870.JPG","width":1080,"height":810},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122534607/-/DSC00840.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122534607/-/DSC00840.JPG","width":1080,"height":810},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122534673/-/DSC00861.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122534673/-/DSC00861.JPG","width":1080,"height":810}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4286870,"name":"Shrimp","permalink":"shrimp","url":"/category/shrimp"}]},{"id":9706535,"name":"Opae Ula food pure algae dwarf shrimp     $0.50 shipping  !

Depending on size of tank. \r\n\r\nFeeding your Opae Ula is not always necessary. However, it can help speed up the growth and provide the shrimp with extra energy. When keeping large quantities of shrimp feeding becomes important to promote growth and maturation.  \r\n\r\nFeeding instructions: \r\n1. grab a very small pinch of food. Or use the tip of a fork or toothpick and take a small portion of powder out.\r\n\r\n2. sprinkle food on top of the water ( as shown in pic ) a think speckled layer on the surface.  \" This part is important you do not want to have big clumps floating on the water, it is best to have a thin layer coating the top\".\r\n\r\n3. Enjoying watching your shrimp feed. The Opae Ula will come to the surface and start sifting the water eating the specs of food. Part of this process is learned by the shrimp. After the first week or two of feedings they will be trained to go to the surface to eat. \r\n\r\n4. Left over food will simply sink to the bottom where the shrimp will eat it on another day. This is why it is good to not over feed them and have clumps floating in the water. Wasted food with time will pollute the water. As long as you feed the shrimp at most every other day small amounts the water quality will remain fine. \r\n\r\nThat's all there is to it. If you do have questions about this please ask !
