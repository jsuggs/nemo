This visit played an important role in the development of his artistic side and own pyschology.\r\n \r\nComputers and graphic design were next, a connection which helped him to develop an early interest in machines, techonolgy and electronics, which can be seen widely across his work today.\r\n\r\nCinema, comics and Science fiction also made a big impact on him. Reminiscences of some of his dancing years can be seen in the movement and fluidity of his works.\r\n\r\nIt wasn´t until 2009 where at the age of 22, he decided to quit the art school in order to focus on his own personal and original artistic approach and began his artistic career as an \"outsider\" in an area not known for for his style of art.\r\n \r\nSince then Egido has been developing his own visual style through different techniques, mainly drawing and painting, creating the base in which he stands now and preparing him for all the new challenges to come and reaching a far wider audience that he has up until now.\r\n\r\nHis own way of understanding the visual language helped him win some important prizes, although he´s been remaining underground in order to create a strong and original character.\r\n \r\nAfter a long journey of intense work and self-awareness along with  progression in his own style, Egido has been putting all the pieces together, he is now prepared to showcase his talents to a worldwide audience with his own and very distinctive style.\r\n \r\nAlthought his art has many different influences Egido likes to use term “CYBEREXPRESSIONISM” \r\n\r\nWhich he describes as the only possible art answer to the world we live in.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":32558563,"name":"Mounted","price":190.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32558566,"name":"Framed & Mounted","price":240.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":13.99,"amount_with_others":5.99,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":19.99,"amount_with_others":5.99,"country":{"id":9,"name":"China","code":"CN"}},{"amount_alone":13.99,"amount_with_others":5.99,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":13.99,"amount_with_others":5.99,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":19.99,"amount_with_others":5.99,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":13.99,"amount_with_others":5.99,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":13.99,"amount_with_others":5.99,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":13.99,"amount_with_others":5.99,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":13.99,"amount_with_others":5.99,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":19.99,"amount_with_others":5.99,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.99,"amount_with_others":5.99},{"amount_alone":13.99,"amount_with_others":5.99,"country":{"id":18,"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HK"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102195580/-/jungle.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102195580/-/jungle.jpg","width":971,"height":849},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102195616/-/DSC_0004e.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102195616/-/DSC_0004e.jpg","width":745,"height":632}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3095435,"name":"Originals","permalink":"originals","url":"/category/originals"}]},{"id":14292327,"name":"Neverwork - Begger Child - Hand finished Artist proof ","permalink":"neverwork-begger-child-hand-finished-artist-proof","position":28,"price":125.0,"default_price":125.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/neverwork-begger-child-hand-finished-artist-proof","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-10-20T10:43:55.000Z","description":"<b>Neverwork - Begger Child - Artist Proof edition of 5 2012</b>\r\n\r\n<i>This screen print by the British based stencil artist \"Neverwork\" measures 44cm x 64cm comes printed on Somerset Velvet paper print and is signed, dated and numbered.
