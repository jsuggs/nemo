Our thick body butter is made with two of the most important butters for your skin: Cocoa butter and Shea butter. Both of these butters together give your skin the maximum moisture it needs to be soft and nourished without leaving a greasy feeling to your skin. We also add grape seed oil, apricot oil, rice bran oil and Vitamin E in our body butter. So that's where the double trouble comes in at because with all of these finest ingredients dry skin and eczema doesn't stand a chance. \r\n\r\n8 ounce jar of double trouble whipped body butter in an enticing blend of blackberries and raspberries, with middle notes of white floral greenery, and bottom notes of musk and vanilla. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Summertime notice** Because this is cocoa butter and shea butter it will melt in the summer heat during shipping. Please keep this in mind when ordering. Once received place container in the refrigerator to harden back up and product will be like new again. \r\n\r\nDiscontinue use if irritation occurs.
