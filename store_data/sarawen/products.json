Sidling up beside him, he gives you a friendly grin and you catch the aroma of his sweet cigar, exotic woods, citrus, and little hint of Daisy's orchid perfume. For only one woman can truly hold his heart.  Main notes: tobacco, citrus accord, oud, coffee, orchid, benzoin\r\n\r\nThis scent is inspired by the character of Jay Gatsy from F. Scott Fitzgerald's American masterpiece, and is unisex bordering to masculine fragrance.\r\n\r\nJADED DECADENCE - She's the ultimate party girl. She is youth, beauty, and decadence personified. Her athletic figure dances to the latest rage - jazz music. And soon you note the scent of violets, rose, and a hint of cream vanilla and sweet red wine. She flashes a smile and the young men sigh.\r\n\r\nMain notes: violets, vanilla, rose, chypre, citrus accord, merlot wine\r\n\r\nThis scent is inspired by the character of Jordan Baker from F.

Each bottle is enough for about 10-14 applications. \r\n\r\nARCANE: Mysterious labdanum and cloves tendered with a touch of warming vanilla. Starts off with a fresh herbal note, then gradually relaxes into mild sweetness. This unique blend is inspired by Anders, the handsome rogue mage from the RPG game, Dragon Age 2! This fragrance is a unisex blend that borders towards masculine.\r\n\r\nFUGITIVE: Exotic amber with incense and dragon's blood topped with sensuous ylang-ylang. A broody, musky oriental perfume with hints of floral. This sexy blend is inspired by Fenris, the runaway elf warrior from the RPG game, Dragon Age 2! This fragrance is a unisex blend, good for men or ladies!\r\n\r\nLADY NIGHTINGALE: Fragrant white flowers of ginger blossom, jasmine, and gardenia over a sensuous base of light musk. Topped off with a single note of sweet vanilla. Delicate and innocent, yet charmingly sexy. This scent is an ultra-feminine floral musk inspired by Lelianna.\r\n\r\nQUEEN OF THE SEAS - After a successful raid, the ocean spray mingles with the scent of blood oranges and grapefruit stored in the ship’s hold. The aromatic essence of exotic orchid trails after the Sea Queen’s skin as she turns to head below decks. Her cabin door opens and she is greeted by the familiar scent of bay rum, allspice and musk from the previous night’s endeavours. Tomorrow will bring another conquest - for gold does not last forever. This fragrance is a feminine sexy-fresh floral blend inspired by Isabella from Dragon Age.\r\n\r\nTHE ROSE KNIGHT - This sexy and romantic fragrance is a blend of dragon's blood, battle-worn leather, eastern musk, and a hit of cedarwood. Within lies a single red rose representing Alistair's love and friendship! Inspired by the character of Alistair from the Dragon Age:Origins game, this scent is a balanced unisex blend.\r\n\r\nSHAPESHIFT - Fresh cypress leaves, cedarwoods, and labdanum, topped with wild honey and blood orange. A scent only a wilderness witch would dare to wear. Inspired by Morrigan, this fragrance is a wild mix of forest herbals and florals. Created for ladies, but there are enough woodsy notes for the witch-adoring gentleman to wear this scent with ease!\r\n\r\nTHIEF OF HEARTS - Come hither! Exotic honeysuckle blended with cedar and cypress woods, leather, and sugared musk are the main notes in this sexy fragrance. Inspired by the flirtatious character Zevran from Dragon Age, this balanced unisex fragrance will have lords or ladies (or both) swooning over you!\r\n\r\n---------\r\n-Sarawen perfume oils are:\r\n\r\n- Cruelty-free and 100% vegan (any scents with notes of honey, leather, or musk are synthetic and are not derived from animal ingredients).\r\n\r\n- Hand-blended from natural and synthetic sources, in a base of rice bran and fractionated coconut oil, with vitamin E as a natural preservative.\r\n\r\n- No alcohol, parabens, or phthalates\r\n\r\nPerfume oils have been used for centuries by both ladies and gentlemen, and are the ideal alternative to harsh, modern, preservative-laden formulas.\r\n\r\n--------\r\nPlease read shop Policies before ordering! sarawen.bigcartel.com/policies\r\n\r\nSHIPPING:\r\n\r\nTo USA and Overseas - Canada Post Light Packet.

Each bottle is enough for about 10-14 applications. \r\n\r\nDEMON'S BANE - The deep roar of an Impala's engine is heard over the hill. The scent of leather-upholstered seats, oud, and sweet benzoin marks the coming of Demon's Bane. He's armed with the tools to do the job and a grim determination to see it done, yet always ready to crack a joke while exorcising demons. After which, Demon's Bane sidles up to a roadside cafe's counter with the smell of black pepper and honey in the air. It's dessert first for this guy ... One apple pie coming up!\r\n\r\nFALLEN ANGEL - Unassuming. Soft-spoken. Fallen Angel from Heaven. When he appears you are lovingly embraced by the fragrance of allspice and honey. Then, lingering traces of frankincense and patchouli with the hint of sugar puts one at ease. This fragrance will keep your guardian angel close to you at all times. Even during the apocalypse!\r\n\r\nWAYWARD SON - Never one to give up on a brother, friend or something more, the Wayward Son brings comfort and protection with the scent of musk, leather and sandalwood.
