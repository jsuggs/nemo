All of the components of this game are made of recycled materials. This game is suitable for ages 5 years and up and includes a mini-booklet with fun facts about birds, and inspiring messages by Olivia.\r\n\r\nThe game includes an 18\"” x 24” Printed canvas game board, playing cards, die, and 6 game pieces in a reusable cardboard tube.\r\n\r\nA portion of proceeds from Olivia’s Collection will benefit the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. \r\n\r\n***********\r\nABOUT OLIVIA:\r\nOlivia Bouler is Gryphon Design Collective's first ever Youth Ambassador! We felt that kids can inspire other kids in fantastic ways, so we asked Olivia and her brother, Jackson, to share their passion for birds with us. She may be only 13 years old, but this provocative young artist has already raised over $200,000 to help \"Save the Birds.\" She has been named a White House Champion of Change and has a blog for other kids on the Huffington Post. As per Olivia's request, a portion of the proceeds of this game will benefit the Cornell Lab for Ornithology. (She thinks they're \"awesome,\" and so do we.)
