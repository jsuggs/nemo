Includes illustrations, paintings, and mixed media works as well as a statement from the artist.\r\n\r\nThe concept of the “3rd Eye” comes from the Ajna Chakra (the 2nd Chakra down at brow level) in western spiritual tradition. It represents enlightenment and awareness and is represented as a lotus with two petals and is violet in color.  Chakras are our energy centers. They are the openings for life energy to flow into and out of our aura. Their function is to vitalize the physical body and to bring about the development of our self-consciousness. They are associated with our physical, mental and emotional interactions.
