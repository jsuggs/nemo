The unassuming tie around the neckline can be adjusted to the height that suits and to cover bra straps or be worn without.  \r\n\r\nThe easiest way to explain how to wear the dress is to look at the pictures. Some multiwear pieces are like rocket science... not this baby. She is simple. Sweet. Comfortable and flattering. Perfect!\r\n\r\nBUT, let's count the ways here:\r\n1. Neck line Bow at the front. (Pic no 3)\r\n2. Undo the bow and tie it behind the neck (pic no. 2 and 4)\r\n3. Halter Neck. Turn the whole dress around so the bow is at the back. Cinch the neck in for a sexier look which can be worn with a strapless bra or layered with a top underneath. Spread the neck line out and you can wear this with a bra.\r\n\r\nSo three easy necklines. Now play with the waist tie.\r\n\r\n1. Tie me around your skinny bit. I like to not have two bows at the front for a simple line. So when you have the neck bow at the front, make a bow for the waist tie at the back.\r\n2. Cinch in around your tummy. Look at the waist tie in pic no. 1... do that! It will hide your tummy and look stunning, even if you're up the duff.\r\n3. Cinch me around the back for flatter tummies who want to show off that slimmer line, or hide the bum! Don't think if you do have a tummy that you can't do this, just don't tie too tight.\r\n4. Loose the waist tie altogether! This will allow the dress to fall at an aline, for zero cling and lots of room. \r\n\r\nThree neck lines times four waist ties, makes twelve lovely ways to wear your dress! Add your own belt and you have more ways. Wear over a tee, long sleeve, or singlet. Wear under a cropped jacket or drape cardi. So many possibilities! \r\n\r\nCaurrently available in eggplant (pictured), warm purple grey and timeless black.\r\n\r\nOne size fits 6-14 due to the aline cut and versatility of straps!\r\n","options":[{"id":34727706,"name":"S-M Eggplant","price":35.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34727709,"name":"M-L Eggplant","price":35.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34730979,"name":"S-M Warm Grey","price":35.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34730982,"name":"M-L Warm Grey","price":35.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34730985,"name":"S-M Black","price":35.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34730988,"name":"M-L Black","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108556281/-/IMG_6152.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108556281/-/IMG_6152.jpg","width":666,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108556413/-/IMG_6132.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108556413/-/IMG_6132.jpg","width":607,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108568989/-/IMG_6124.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108568989/-/IMG_6124.jpg","width":568,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108576705/-/IMG_6138.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108576705/-/IMG_6138.jpg","width":571,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108579381/-/IMG_6163.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108579381/-/IMG_6163.jpg","width":682,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3036187,"name":"Dresses","permalink":"dresses","url":"/category/dresses"}]},{"id":11834223,"name":"Metallic Leggings- Leopard Print","permalink":"metallic-leggings-leopard-print","position":60,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/metallic-leggings-leopard-print","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-06-17T06:50:04.000Z","description":"HOT HOT HOT.
