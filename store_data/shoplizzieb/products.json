That\u001as how Lizzie B sees it! In essence, Tucsadelphia IS wherever Liz and Beth ARE. Let Lizzie B Cre8ive take you on a tour through some of their favorite places. \"Greetings from TUCSADELPHIA\" is a collection of some of Liz and Beth\u001as favorite travel-inspired projects. Like all quilters who travel, Liz and Beth collect FABRIC! They gather fabric from the places they visit and take those bits and weave them into a quilt; like Beth\u001as \"Happy Hawaii\" quilt. They make us smile and feel warm and fuzzy inside as memories of our travels flood back to us. Join them on a sun-drenched beach in \"Happy Hawaii\" or the bustling streets of \"New York\u001as Got Soul\". Stitch up the quick and \"Easy-Breezy Backsack\", then take a jaunt through Pennsylvania Amish country. Or pick your own favorite places for the \"Wish You Were Here\" quilt and adorn it with postcards and memories. Don\u001at forget to bake some \"Be Cre8ive Cookies\" for your travels, and escape with the Lizzie B playlist. Whether you find time to stitch a little, \"Kick Back and Relax\" or do some \"Peaceful Dreamin\u001a\" on your own travel pillow, remember that \"All Roads Lead to Home\". And when it comes to the Lizzie B Girls... all roads lead to Tucsadelphia! We hope you enjoy the journey. Dream big, go far, and always Be Cre8ive! Oh, and if you're wondering where the heck Tucsadelphia is, it's the official city of Lizzie B Cre8ive!
