Ordering 5 pucks will get you 6. Ordering 10 pucks will get you 12, ad infinitum. The smallest USPS flat rate priority mailer will hold 6 pucks exactly.\r\nThe free pucks will not be listed on the checkout invoice but will be noted on the emailed update and invoice that I send everyone within a day or two of receiving orders.)\r\n \r\n\"Copper Tops\" - For Repairing the Mental and Physical Effects of Electropollution\r\n\r\nStrong sources of electromagnetic radiation stimulate orgonia to emit a sweet and coherent vibration that many people find calming and centering. Electrosensitive people especially call this material a “life saver” - it rescues them from the electromagnetic distress that creates psychological confusion, impaired biological processes, insomnia and lots of other malfunctions. With the proliferation of cell phone towers, \"smart\" meters,\" and wireless routers we are all electrosensitive now. \r\nThe mechanism by which this stuff works is still mysterious, but the main theory is that the metal shavings absorb and then reflect aetheric forces whereas the organic resin binder only absorbs. The two conflicting forces “scramble” the incoming electromagnetic energies which are then made coherent again by the quartz crystals inside. The quartz is under pressure from the cured, shrunken resin which somehow boosts the energy output.  The end result is an energy that entrains the body and mind in a delightful manner—the exact opposite of the entrainment imposed by electromagnetic pollution. My pucks use both copper and aluminum - just like the wall plaques - to gather and transform as wide a spectrum of offending energies as possible. The dense pure copper layer combined with the lighter aluminum layer processes a wide spectrum of offending radiations. The pucks also include several lithium bearing minerals like petalite which add the calming and relaxing effect that so many people report (see Customer Testimonials.) I also use only clear gemmy grades of quartz points in all of my work. I feel this contributes to greater force and clarity of energy.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to understand or believe in orgone theory to get its benefits—experience will tell you all you need to know. Placing these around or throughout a dwelling suffuses the environment with an upbeat, positive, calm, and centered feeling. Paradoxically, the nastier the level of electropollution the stronger is the energy output from the orgonite. Just carrying one in a pocket or keeping it at bedside can completely transform your being. I never cease to be amazed by orgonite.\r\nFor a more thorough look at this material please read the web site's various headings. The plaques are suited to saturating a home or business's structural components with orgone energy - they are more subtle but deeper. Ideally, both types of orgonia can be used. The \"copper tops\" are a great introduction.\r\n\r\n*Orgonia does not interfere with cell phone signals or any such transmission.\r\n\r\n(Photos #3 and #4 show one of my puck displays at the \"Dark Star Visuals\" bead and clothing store in Fayetteville, Arkansas.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":36840174,"name":"Default","price":5.9,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.8,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.95,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114893658/-/Towerbuster_1_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114893658/-/Towerbuster_1_.jpg","width":1000,"height":563},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114915222/-/TBinhand_1_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114915222/-/TBinhand_1_.jpg","width":1000,"height":753},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124265268/-/Puckdisplay1(1).jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124265268/-/Puckdisplay1(1).jpg","width":1001,"height":1154},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124265196/-/Puckdisplay2(1).jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124265196/-/Puckdisplay2(1).jpg","width":1000,"height":692}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5498631,"name":"Orgonia Pucks","permalink":"orgonia-pucks","url":"/category/orgonia-pucks"}]},{"id":14210037,"name":"Orgonia Pendant","permalink":"orgonia-pendant","position":9,"price":39.5,"default_price":39.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/orgonia-pendant","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-16T05:35:19.000Z","description":"1 1/2 inch diameter orgonia pendant. (Chain length customizable for no extra charge.)\r\n\r\nThese are basically smaller versions of the copper top pucks mounted in an antiqued brass bezel. The lensing effect is achieved by first pouring a layer of clear resin behind which is layered the copper shavings. Tiny quartz crystals are tucked into the resin bound shavings along with the additives such as scolecite crystals from Narsik, India (see fourth photo.) Scolecite is sublimely relaxing and calming and is also both piezoelectric and pyroelectric meaning that within the matrix or orgonia it responds both to vibration and thermal shifts. Lying against your chest it responds to vibration when you speak, and it responds and is energized by the heat of your body as well.\r\n\r\n I can make any length chain you desire. All of the jewelry work is done by me. I can also work with whatever custom chain you might want to use. That can be negotiated by email.\r\n\r\nThese have a wonderful, relaxing energy that can ride around with you all day long and look good doing it. The finely chopped recycled pure copper wire has a intricate and elegant looking texture underneath the clear resin lens.\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Book Of Stones.\"\r\n\"The phrase that best summarizes the energy of scolecite is \"inner peace.\" These stones in both tumbled and crystal form emanate a deep peace that can resonate through one's entire auric field. For those who wish to enhance meditation, sleep more restfully, or dream more sweetly, scolecite is highly recommended.\r\nEmotionally, scolecite enhances the heart chakra energies making the spontaneous expression of love a more frequent experience. It is a good stone to exchange between lovers, helping to establish a constant invisible connection between their hearts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","options":[{"id":45899409,"name":"Default","price":39.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.8,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.95,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125941452/-/Copperpendantsupreme(1).jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125941452/-/Copperpendantsupreme(1).jpg","width":1024,"height":936},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125941470/-/Copperpendantside(1).jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125941470/-/Copperpendantside(1).jpg","width":1024,"height":562},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125941503/-/lintless2(1).jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125941503/-/lintless2(1).jpg","width":1024,"height":1044},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127516827/-/Scolecit1(1).jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127516827/-/Scolecit1(1).jpg","width":1000,"height":981}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5330313,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]},{"id":10424653,"name":"Orbicular Sea Turtle","permalink":"orbicular-sea-turtle","position":10,"price":49.5,"default_price":49.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/orbicular-sea-turtle","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-08T20:59:44.000Z","description":"Orgone field emitting plaque. 4 3/4 x 4 3/4 inches\r\n\r\nIn Japanese folk iconography the sea turtle symbolizes wisdom, deliberation, and long life.

This is not a surface coloration but a part of the molecular structure of the quartz which is man made in high tech pressure vessels that reproduce the natural conditions which make quartz deep in the earth.  In a gem grading sense this is \"flawless\" quartz that has no cracks, fissures, or inclusions, and when crafted into these expertly faceted energy tools the material is a pure conduit for whatever energy is put into it. \r\nI own a nice collection of precision faceted quartz wands in natural grown quartz, but since discovering these cobalt wands last Spring they have become the wands I most reach for. They are centering, relaxing, and more than any other crystal they are healing. Energy workers are always talking about \"healing,\" but these wands really do heal - they walk the walk. One of my favorite stones is dark blue sapphire - there is a long, long ayurvedic tradition of using blue sapphire to settle and cohere the aura - these big wands are like giant gem grade sapphires such as are never seen in nature. I find these wands endlessly delightful, and love holding them up to a light source and looking through their heavenly blueness. It is a very potent color therapy. \r\n\r\nJust idly fiddling around with these in your hands and gazing into them feels very, very nice. After working with a lot of different sizes and shapes (and locating a careful and reliable cutter) I finally settled on this design and have these custom cut to my specifications which include having one end gently rounded so that it nestles in the palm of the hand without poking the skin with sharp facets. The energy of the hand is absorbed by the spherical end, accelerated and focused by the precise faceting, and then goes rocketing out of the pointed end. You can wave the crystal back and forth past the fingers of your free hand and feel a vibration like dragging a stick down a picket fence. \r\n\r\nThere is an elaborate lore surrounding the use of faceted quartz wands, but if you are a novice you can just mess around with this tool and come up with your own mojo. Just holding one and meditating is good enough for most everyone. The energy is as accessible as that of orgonia and makes a very nice adjunct to orgonia energy.\r\n\r\nThe clear lateral line down the middle of the quartz is the \"seed plate\" upon which slowly nucleates the hot, high pressure quartz fluid inside the reactor vessel. There is a faint mist of tiny star looking things just off the surface of the seed plate that look sort of like a galaxy. When I first saw one of these wands I wondered if the seed line would interrupt the energy, but the instant I picked one up in my hands and felt how strong it was it was obvious that the seed line may actually be enhancing the energy by some sort of edge effect or something like that. The clear seed plate is itself a piece of quartz also, so the entire tool is quartz.\r\n\r\nThese come with a soft but durable silicone rubber storage pouch that snaps easily but snugly shut like a purse and protects the wand in a manner befitting its quality. The drawstring inner pouch is made of microfiber lens polishing cloth which can be used to buff and clean the wand too without scratching the mirror polished surface.\r\nThese are beautifully and precisely cut heirloom grade quartz wands - very fairly priced. I order these in groups of 5, and it takes about 3 weeks to replenish stock; so be forewarned if you want one of these for Christmas.\r\n\r\n***************************\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Book Of Stones\"\r\n\"These stones have been laboratory grown specifically for their greatly refined flawless nature and vibrant color. Cultured quartz is actually a purer form of quartz having no inclusions and a more stable pattern of rotation in the molecules which speeds up the energy movement in the crystal.\r\nThe cobalt blue ray has an amazing blend of serenity, purity, and beauty. It is related to the throat and brow chakras which embody the qualities of inner vision, clairvoyance, intuition, communication and detachment.

He is inseparably associated in Christian Art with a pig; not because he was ever a swineherd, nor, as Fuller observes, since by living in a cave, and feeding upon roots, he and the hogs had something in common; but rather for the reason that the hog is typical of the demon of gluttony and sensuality, which St. Anthony is supposed to have vanquished by the exercise of piety and the Divine assistance. As the founder of monachism, he wears a monk's habit and cowl. The crutch upon which he leans is given to him out of respect for his age; while the bell suspended from the crutch, or carried in his hand, indicates his power to exorcise evil spirits because he withstood so many demons and temptations.

The material coming from Peru now is of superb quality. This is the kind of necklace that can be used to wind down at the end of a hectic day, and it will wash over you about as quickly as a beer or glass of wine as soon as you put it around your neck. This is also an excellent aid to meditation. If I had only one stone to take with me to the proverbial desert island angelite would be high on my list.\r\n\r\nThe Book Of Stones on angelite:\r\n\"The frequency of angelite is soothing to the emotional body lending a lightness of being during difficult times. It is a stone of tranquility and  it evokes a sense of inner peace when it is worn or used in meditation. It can be utilized to help bring peace to situations where conflict or ego posturing is making progress difficult. As its name implies angelite is useful in connecting with the guidance of angels and spiritually aligned beings.\r\nAngelite's mineral composition is related to the skeletal system, particularly in regard to energetic support of one's bone density and growth as well as such issues as arthritis and osteoporosis. It energetically assists one in attaining greater mobility and range of motion and helps dissolve calcification in the joints.\"  \r\n\r\nI have been making hand knotted necklaces for a few years. Purist jewelers serious about stone energies tend to use knotted necklaces to minimize the antenna influence of metal wires though the differences may be subtle. Supple, knotted necklaces also drape wonderfully on the body, and if a necklace breaks the beads don't go bouncing off every which way.

It has it's own soothing qualities with complex undertones. Something is happening deep inside with this material, yet the pace is slow and measured. It's like having a very congenial friend who nevertheless gently urges that you pay attention to your fears and hangups - all those things that get in the way of complete peace and self possession - all of those \"loose ends.\" This is a good stone to have near you when you are in threatening situations or just situations that usually make you uneasy for whatever reason. There is a sense that you are part of a larger whole that makes your petty little bothers seem superfluous.\r\nThis coral comes from reefs managed for jewelry harvesting - not \"wild\" reefs.\r\n\r\nFrom \"Gems Of the 7 Color Rays\" - \"By wearing white coral we will learn to maintain an inner feeling of safety and security even in circumstances that might have frightened us at one time.\r\nNegative emotions of others can be quite destructive to our energy flow, especially during the process of rebuilding our core.

This awareness will go a long way toward keeping us out of the line of fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Understand that you are much like a space colony.Your organs and bodily systems have likely lost touch with each other. They obtain directives, but are used to being ignored when their needs change. Problems have developed in your body.\r\nWhen you begin to wear coral it is like bringing in information from an undersea colony. The coral is dead, but the vibrations of the creatures are still within its makeup. This hologram is complete in even the smallest beads. The rounded beads allow the vibrations of coral to emanate in all directions. Your body gets the message. Every part gets the same message - a restructuring can begin. A new language of cooperation is developed.\"\r\n\r\nI have been making hand knotted necklaces for a few years.

No other stone can help one to attune to the earth's energies and unlock the mysteries of the earth and its vast array of knowledge in the same way as malachite. It brings understanding of the hidden mysteries of the earth. Yes, the earth has memories and intelligence, and malachite will introduce you to earth's unusual language. It will take you into the mysteries of vibrational signatures and teach you of numbers and symbols.\"\r\n\r\nI have been making hand knotted necklaces for a few years. Purist jewelers serious about stone energies tend to use knotted necklaces to minimize the antenna influence of metal wires though the differences may be subtle. Supple, knotted necklaces also drape wonderfully on the body, and if a necklace breaks the beads don't go bouncing off every which way. Knots also separate the beads and keep them from wearing against each other. The Griffin \"High Performance\" beading thread that appeared on the market recently has revolutionized knotted necklace making. This material is 15 times stronger than steel for a given thread diameter and certainly stronger than silk or nylon which had a reputation for fraying and breaking with heavy wear. \r\nContinuous knotted necklaces are beautifully simple and strong with no clasps to fiddle with, and the spaced beads of high grade are each highlighted and accentuated by the arrangement.\r\n\r\nNote: These necklaces are not about moderating EMF's, but they can be helpful in repairing an aura damaged by electropollution.\r\n","options":[{"id":35464314,"name":"Default","price":125.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":28.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110849877/-/malachiteclose_1_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110849877/-/malachiteclose_1_.jpg","width":1000,"height":420},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110850057/-/malachitefemaile1_1_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110850057/-/malachitefemaile1_1_.jpg","width":505,"height":421},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110850117/-/malachitemale_1_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110850117/-/malachitemale_1_.jpg","width":592,"height":421}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5330313,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]}]
