Introducing Aphrodite(AYAPI). \r\nThe Aphrodite AYAPI shoe style has its base point inspiration from the ancient greek leather sandal with its prominent external stitching. The heart shape upper feature symbolises love, beauty and all things our children represent and in which we adore. \r\nNow imagine the adapatability of this shoe. Adorne with sweet party frocks for Christmas, cool block colour beachwear or  mummy like kaftans. What about crisp white tights or grecian style A-line cheesecloth dresses or beaded singlets with the puffiest ballerina skirts on the market, we can go on and on with stylised pictures to come. \r\noh and pleated mini skirts and shiney dance tights lolol couldnt resist.\r\n\r\nAll leather, with an added rubber sole and heel for stability. A patent leather upper and an adjustable velcro ankle strap to allow children themselves to take them off and on in a heartbeat. (pardon the pun).\r\n\r\nSimplistic craftmanship that is eyecatching but not overstated; cool and modern, day and night.\r\n\r\nDesigned in Australia in the beautiful seasonal colours of RED, WHITE and PINK.\r\n\r\nAphrodite is known as the Greek Goddess of love, desire, beauty, fertility, the sea, and vegetation. Aphrodite was born and arose on a large shell, which was then carried to land, thus her name being translated \"foam-risen\". The sea nymphs dressed her and adorned her with flowers and gold. How adorable that this child's shoe takes a name from such an admirable godess. Their have been many paintings depicting this scene in Aphrodite's name and retelling this wonderful story will leave the enchanted little girl yearning for more.\r\n\r\nTo see more pictures of the shoes on child model feet, please view on our facebook page.\r\n\r\nWith every purchase of 2 or more shoes receive a free pair of shoes from our tan sample stock variety.

This design will create the scaffold to other great shoe designs coming in our future season collections.\r\n\r\nAll leather sole and upper with rubber heel for stability. Extra buckle holes for ankle strap.\r\n\r\nSimplistic craftmanship that is eyecatching but not overstated; cool and modern, day and night.\r\n\r\nAthene is the goddess of war, civilization, wisdom, strength, strategy, crafts, justice and skill in Greek mythology.  Athena is also a shrewd companion of heroes and the goddess of heroic endeavour. She is the virgin patron of Athens. \r\n\r\nTo see more pictures of the shoes on child model feet, please view our facebook page.\r\n\r\nWith every purchase of 2 or more shoes receive a free pair of shoes from our tan sample stock variety.
