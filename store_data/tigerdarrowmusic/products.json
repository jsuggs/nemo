These interactions are what create a fluidity in our routines, our thinking, our creativity, and our inspiration and curiosity. They nourish us and help us to grow. \r\n\r\nAqua Vitae also means brandy. \r\n\r\nSorry to get all thesis-y sounding. \r\n\r\nThis record would not have been possible without the help of my amazing, incredibly talented team of artists, producers, and engineers who so generously donated their time and talents to make this record as beautiful as I feel it is. From the bottom of my heart, I cannot thank you all enough for making my dreams and visions as a songwriter come to life. And an equally special \"thank you\" is due to Phil Galdston, Dr. Robert Rowe, Dr. Ron Sadoff, and my family for providing me with constant encouragement and support throughout the writing and recording process. I love you all. \r\n\r\nxo \r\nTiger","options":[{"id":47415267,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127043505/-/DIGITAL_ART.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127043505/-/DIGITAL_ART.jpg","width":1600,"height":1600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1920726,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":3349300,"name":"You Know Who You Are","permalink":"you-know-who-you-are","position":2,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/you-know-who-you-are","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-02-28T06:27:44.000Z","description":"Tiger Darrow's sophomore album is self-written, produced and recorded.
