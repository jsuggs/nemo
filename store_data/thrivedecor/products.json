It is an unusual early example depicting a male nude.  It measures  30 1/2\" H by  36\" W including the beautiful original frame illustrated.  Site:   21 1/2\" by 27 1/2\". \r\n\r\nIf you search Dario Campanile paintings on the internet, you'll see that his originals being sold by a good art brokerage company typically sell between $25,000 to $85,000. We have priced this low for a fast sale.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE ARTIST:\r\n\r\nBorn in 1948 - Artist Dario Campanile started to sketch as a very young child. At the age of six, his talent for art was encouraged with the gift of a small set of watercolors from an uncle, himself a painter. At the age of eighteen, Dario had the good fortune to meet Giorgio de Chirico, the Italian master of metaphysical art. Dario showed him some paintings and asked if he should attend art school. De Chirico counseled the young painter to simply experiment and continue discovering his own techniques. Inspired by this encounter, Dario found that his own hard work and discipline proved to be his best teachers. Dario Campanile continued to work full time on his art, and by the time he was twenty, he was successfully exhibiting his paintings in the Galleria Esedera in Rome, and attracting the attention of international collectors. After moving to Los Angeles in 1973, Dario experienced great commercial success, and explored new directions in his art. Campanile worked with clay sculpture, cast paper sculpting and cast paper bas-relief. In 1986, after working in Los Angeles for over a decade, Dario Campanile was honored to be chosen from hundreds of artists to create the 75th Anniversary Logo for Paramount Studios. Campanile's beautiful design of the famous mountain symbol is seen on every Paramount publication today.\r\n\r\nDario continues to exhibit his art at various galleries in San Francisco, Laguna Beach, Aspen, Las Vegas, and Hawaii. His paintings are also owned by many private collectors. My main goal, says the artist, is to be able to express my true soul and continue my journey by taking risks and always allowing myself to explore new visions.\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":20114265,"name":"Default","price":3500.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":125.0,"amount_with_others":99.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61972671/-/R0517campanileman3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61972671/-/R0517campanileman3.jpg","width":565,"height":437}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2311737,"name":"Fine Art","permalink":"fine-art","url":"/category/fine-art"}]},{"id":5840233,"name":"Spectacular Pair of J Robert Scott White Gold Urn Lamps","permalink":"spectacular-pair-of-j-robert-scott-white-gold-urn-lamps","position":213,"price":1800.0,"default_price":1800.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/spectacular-pair-of-j-robert-scott-white-gold-urn-lamps","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-02T18:52:30.000Z","description":"This wonderful pair of lamps are genuine J Robert Scott luminaries designed by J Robert Scott.

This magnificent portrait is a genuine original oil painting on canvas and dates to the 18th century.  It is an stunning example depicting the late great Maria Theresa of Austria.  She is posed in the widow's dress she wore after the death of her husband Francis I. It is of superb quality clearly painted by a master artist and is likely a study for a larger painting.    It measures approximately  18 x 12 5/8in.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa (May 13, 1717 ? November 29, 1780) was (reigning) Archduchess of Austria and Queen of Hungary and Bohemia, and, through her marriage, Holy Roman Empress.\r\n\r\nShe was the eldest daughter of Emperor Charles VI, who promulgated the Pragmatic Sanction to allow her to succeed to the Habsburg monarchy, and Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Opposition to her acceding to the throne led to the War of the Austrian Succession in 1740. After Emperor Charles VII, who claimed the throne, died in 1745, Maria Theresa obtained the imperial crown for her husband, Francis I. Though she was technically empress consort, Maria Theresa was the de facto ruler of the nation, and she began styling herself Holy Roman Empress in 1745.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa helped initiate financial and educational reforms, promoted commerce and the development of agriculture, and reorganized the army, all of which strengthened Austria's resources. Continued conflict with the Kingdom of Prussia led to the Seven Years' War and later to the War of the Bavarian Succession. She became dowager empress after the death of Francis and the accession of her son Joseph as emperor in 1765. Maria Theresa criticized many of Joseph's actions but agreed to the First Partition of Poland (1772). Maria Theresa was a key figure in the power politics of eighteenth-century Europe who brought unity to the Habsburg Monarchy and was considered one of its most capable rulers. Not only did she successfully fulfill her public duties but she also at the same time bore and brought up 16 children including Marie Antoinette and Leopold II. By doing so she became a role model for many women.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa was born in Vienna as the eldest daughter of Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor and Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, whose sole male heir?his son Leopold Johann?died as an infant in 1716. In 1713 Charles issued the Pragmatic Sanction which guaranteed his daughter the right to succeed to the Austrian throne and inherit his united lands on his death. Initially, many Northern European monarchs agreed to the Pragmatic Sanction when it was issued. One of the few not to sign was Frederick the Great of Prussia who, soon after Maria Theresa assumed the throne upon Charles' death on October 20, 1740, began the War of Austrian Succession.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa was married to Francis I, Duke of Lorraine. Maria Theresa was one of the few people in her age who married for love. She loved her husband dearly and passionately. She had 16 children by him, with 11 daughters (ten of whom had the first name \"Maria\") and five sons. Her youngest daughter was Maria Antonia, better known under her French name Marie Antoinette, who would be promised in marriage to the later King Louis XVI of France. After her husband's death, Maria Theresa made her son Joseph II co-regent of her Austrian dominions, but she actually kept most of the power to herself, which led to tension between her and her son. It was not until her death that Joseph could fully exercise his powers.\r\n\r\nHer children were:\r\n\r\nArchduchess Maria Elisabeth (1737-1740). Maria Theresa's heiress presumptive between 1737 and 1740.\r\nArchduchess Maria Anna (1738-1789). Maria Theresa's heiress presumptive between 1740 and 1741.\r\nArchduchess Maria Caroline (1740-1741).\r\nHoly Roman Emperor Joseph II (1741-1790), married Infanta Isabel of Spain (1741-1763), then Princess Marie Josephe of Bavaria (1739-1767); no surviving issue. Holy Roman Emperor from 1765; Archduke of Austria, King of Hungary and King of Bohemia and from 1780.\r\nArchduchess Maria Christina, Duchess of Teschen (1742-1798), married Prince Albert of Saxony, Duke of Teschen (1738-1822); no surviving issue.\r\nArchduchess Maria Elisabeth (1743-1808)\r\nArchduke Charles Joseph (1745-1761)\r\nArchduchess Maria Amalia (1746-1804), married Ferdinand, Duke of Parma (1751-1802); had issue.\r\nHoly Roman Emperor Leopold II (1747-1792), married Infanta Maria Louisa of Spain (1745-1792); had issue.
