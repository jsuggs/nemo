The live shows were an accurate representation: I can remember one promoter in particular smiling and singing along during their set, despite the fact that he was simultaneously hunched over, trying in vain to protect his ears with his cupped palms. Although they put on a good show, it was obvious that they were growing tired of this approach; by the final few dates of that short tour they were already re-working songs in order to play with dynamics and toy with new melodies.<br>\r\nTheir debut LP, Moves, which came out last year followed this progression, offering sprawling soundscapes that were much more concerned with building an atmosphere than trying to overpower one. It was one of those rare instances when people I knew -- friends of mine -- were responsible for one of my favorite records of the year.<br>\r\nThese two tracks, part of the third and final release in Volume One of our Singles Series, pick up where Moves left off. Though the total playing time is well under ten minutes, you can hear all of the places they've been (and a few hints as to where they're headed).\r\n<br>\r\nA\r\nAscend\r\nB\r\nDeep Moves<br>\r\nWhite Laces on the net\r\n<a href=\"http://whitelacesmusic.com/\">White Laces</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WhiteLaces\">Facebook</a> <br>\r\n</font>\r\n<font size=2 color=grey> This wonderful release is part of our Cassingle Series.

Codey moved from Philly to Berlin this summer, but before leaving he and Dan recorded a few songs on a lark, dubbing themselves Alpine Roses. The songs on this three-song cassingle (the second release in Volume One of our <a href=\"http://www.treetopsorbet.com/product/tts-cassingle-series-volume-1\">Cassingles Series</a>) exist somewhere outside of either of their main, mostly insular, projects.

Part of it might be the brevity of the songs (three on each side for a total of eight minutes), or maybe the interesting, yet fitting, intersection of influences (imagine Robert Pollard and Lou Barlow sitting in with The Byrds). Or, maybe more significantly, it’s the guiding voice of bandleader Jason Henn that shines through these jangly sketches. In recent years, the term “lo-fi” has come to refer to a certain aesthetic, deliberately chosen by an artist in order to add to their sound, rather than as a simple necessity. Henn’s songs are anything but gimmicks shrouded in reverb or tape hiss; instead, these vignettes sound like someone attempting to press record before the song leaves him.</br>\r\nA\r\n1.
