A simple, clean, understated style that will become your favorite, everyday piece.\r\n\r\n<B>Features:</B>\r\nThe crown is a black cotton denim twill, that features black enamel grommets. The center front of the crown includes a genuine leather patch, with a silver foil deboss logo.  A black suede brim, with black topstitching finishes off the front of the hat. The back features a black leather strap, with a polished silver adjustment buckle.\r\n\r\n<B>The Story:</B>\r\nLombard is a street in North Portland that runs East to West, and goes right through the neighborhood we live in -- an artery in working-class Portland. North Portland was the centerpiece of an industrial district at the turn of the century. We wanted to highlight the blue-collar, industrial center of early Portland by using a palette of materials that are reminiscent of that time period, but done in a modern way. The different depths and textural differences create interest in a monochromatic color story, to create a simple, yet luxe feel.\r\n\r\n<B>Additional Info:</B>\r\nOne size fits all","options":[{"id":50772210,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129511875/-/5panel-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129511875/-/5panel-1.jpg","width":720,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129512004/-/5-panel-back.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129512004/-/5-panel-back.jpg","width":720,"height":480}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5334651,"name":"New","permalink":"new","url":"/category/new"},{"id":5307795,"name":"Accessories","permalink":"accessories","url":"/category/accessories"}]},{"id":12035415,"name":"Vintage: Pin Pack #2","permalink":"vintage-pin-pack-2","position":2,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/vintage-pin-pack-2","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-26T22:47:03.000Z","description":"<B>Circa:</B> Various\r\n\r\n<B>Description:</B>\r\nWhat you see is what you get!
