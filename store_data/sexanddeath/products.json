At the gym, it walks at a glacial pace on the treadmill, or pushes the pedals of the stationary bike at roughly 15 RPMs. Someone needs to help Music. It needs a trainer, a nutritionist. It needs motivation and inspiration. A push and a pull. Weird Party, a five piece of fun-time Rock ‘N’ Roll idiots from Houston, TX, can help make Music lean and mean again. Look how Weird Party’s muscles glisten as they display perfect form squat thrusting, clean jerking and dead lifting five times their weight. What a hard rock specimen! Surely they’ll want to help Music get back on track. \r\n\r\nNope. Nope.

Much like a slap in the face, or a kick in the crotch, WEIRD PARTY came out of the gates with the charge of a thousand knaves, resulting in their debut self-released 7\" last year. Imagine the terseness of the Guilloteens mixed with the rock'n roll riffage of the mighty Sugar Shack covered in a layer of heavy… and you might have something close to WEIRD PARTY.
