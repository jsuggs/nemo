It often takes its form as temporary, site-responsive, and socially-engaged projects. These projects include The Long Walk, ONN/OF \"a light festival\", Sleeper Cell Training Camp, and Warmth Giant Black Toobs as well as public commissions such as Parking Squid and Water Lab. Robb’s work has been funded by a Pollack Krasner Foundation Grant, two Artist Trust Fellowships, a Stranger Genius Award, a 4Culture Special Projects Grant, and the City of Seattle. She has exhibited nationally and internationally including shows at Family Business, NYC, Discovery Greens, Houston TX, Hui No‘eau Visual Arts Center, Maui HI, Tacoma Art Museum, Tacoma WA, Lawrimore Project, Seattle WA, The Henry Gallery, Seattle, WA, Swing Space, NYC, Blindside Gallery, Melbourne Australia, Berkeley Art Museum, Berkeley CA; and Weisman Art Museum, Minneapolis MN. Robb worked as an adjunct professor at the University of Washington, the Gage Academy of Art, and the Frye Art Museum. In 2013 Robb received a Creative Capital grant for her project Wild Times.

Throughout her hike Susan will be creating art and sharing it with a series of art venues in proximity to the PCT. These selected host sites and their guests will act as collaborators, interacting with the project, with Susan, and with the broader public via the Wild Times website. At its core Wild Times asks the public to explore the wildness in their own lives and to aid in this Susan will be inviting the public’s interaction through propositions to collaborate with her, complete creative tasks, and attend workshops all designed to delve into the question \"How can we remain self-willed and free?\"\r\n\r\nHost venues include Grand Central Art Center, Palm Spring Art Museum, 826 Valencia, The Schneider Museum of Art, The Tacoma Art Museum, and The Henry Art Museum\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":50655315,"name":"Default","price":400.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129425265/-/in_order_to_do_it_copysmall.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129425265/-/in_order_to_do_it_copysmall.jpg","width":864,"height":1152},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129425166/-/IMG_0609.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129425166/-/IMG_0609.jpg","width":2448,"height":3264}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":618291,"name":"Fruitique","permalink":"fruitique","url":"/category/fruitique"}]},{"id":15382383,"name":"The Last Supper with Stawberry","permalink":"the-last-supper-with-stawberry","position":3,"price":200.0,"default_price":200.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-last-supper-with-stawberry","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-12-06T20:41:22.000Z","description":"Fallen Fruit\r\nThe Last Supper with Stawberry\r\nFound Last Supper plaster sculpture\r\nand found Ceramic Strawberry\r\n2013\r\n1/1\r\n$300.00","options":[{"id":50025087,"name":"Default","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":20.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128945160/-/IMG_0408333.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128945160/-/IMG_0408333.jpg","width":3264,"height":1926}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":618291,"name":"Fruitique","permalink":"fruitique","url":"/category/fruitique"},{"id":618371,"name":"Fallen Fruit Products","permalink":"fallen-fruit-products","url":"/category/fallen-fruit-products"}]},{"id":14930148,"name":"FINISHING SCHOOL: The Potter's House Kids","permalink":"finishing-school-the-potter-s-house-kids","position":4,"price":180.0,"default_price":180.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/finishing-school-the-potter-s-house-kids","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-18T19:12:08.000Z","description":"ARTIST: FINISHING SCHOOL\r\nTITLE: The Potter's House Kids\r\nDESCRIPTION: Founds figurines and decaying limes\r\nMATERIALS: Porcelain and decaying Limes\r\nRETAIL PRICE: $180 (3 piece set)\r\nDIMENSIONS: Variable\r\nEDITION: N/A\r\n\r\nFinishing School (FS) is a socially-engaged artist collective that explores an expansive range of subject and media territories.

Crosher uses photography as a starting point to explore and examine the fiction of documentary & the materiality of the archive. Through re-photography and ever-evolving iterations of both photographic and publishing-based work, she pursues a practice that is conceptual in orientation yet rooted in vernacular representation, provoking an ambiguity that highlights the strategies & structures of fantasy as much as it exposes anything concrete. In addition to exhibiting, Crosher makes publications centered around her practice. Out the Window (LAX), examines space and transience around the Los Angeles airport, & a recently published four-volume book series created with Aperture Ideas examines her most recent work, The Michelle duBois Project. She has taught at UCLA and Art Center College of Design, and was Associate Editor of the journal Afterall after receiving herMFA from CalArts. In 2011 she was awarded the prestigious Art Here and Now Award by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and is a recent recipient of the Rauschenberg award. Her work has been included in MoMA’s 2012 New Photography exhibition as well as extensive exhibitions throughout the United States. She is represented by Perry Rubenstein Gallery.

His recent work developed with funding from Creative Capital deals with the discovery of the real and poetic convergence between two phenomena specific to Argentina. It is the site of one of the few growing glaciers in the world as well as the last growing Lacanian psychoanalytic practice. His recent photo and video work was developed and produced in Vietnam. He is currently developing a performative project in Taiwan and a project exploring Cinema Novo in Rio de Janeiro.\r\n\r\nYonemoto has been honored with numerous awards and grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the American Film Institute, The Rockefeller Foundation, and the Maya Deren Award for Experimental Film and Video. In 1999 Yonemoto was honored with a major mid-career survey show curated by Karen Higa at the Japanese American Museum in Los Angeles Bruce's solo installations, photographs and sculptures have been featured in major one-person shows at the ICC in Tokyo, the ICA in Philadelphia, the St. Louis Art Museum and the Kemper Museum in Kansas City. He has had solo exhibitions at Alexander Gray Gallery, New York, Blum & Poe, Los Angeles, Tomio Koyama, Tokyo, Galerie Quynh, Ho Chi Minh City and his work was featured in Los Angeles 1955-85 at the Pompidou Center, Paris, and the Generali Foundation, Vienna, , the 2008 Gwangju Biennial. Pacific Standard Time, Getty Research Center and most recently an expansive survey show in Kanazawa, Japan.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: In the photographic series Beyond South: Vietnam (Caravaggio) (2010), the artist recreates masterpieces by the16th century Baroque painter, Michelangelo Caravaggio. Each photograph re-imagines an original Caravaggio portrait setting with the original figures replaced by similarly posed Asian models. Further complicating the Western gaze and ideals of patronage and politics, Yonemoto’s sitters are clothed in South and North Vietnamese military uniforms, themselves reproductions sold to contemporary tourists in Vietnam.

Yurshansky earned her MFA from UC Irvine and was a participant in the post‐graduate Critical Studies course at the Malmö Art Academy. In 2012 she was an invited artist-in-residence connected to the exhibition Odor Water Limo in northern Norway. In 2010 she was the first international artist awarded the Maria Bonnier Stipend from Bonniers Konsthall in Stockholm, the prize was awarded along with an exhibition. In 2010 she was invited for a residency and solo exhibition at Galleri Rostrum in Malmö and workspace in Los Angeles. She has also participated in group shows at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, Laguna Beach Art Museum, MAK Center, LA><ART, the Torrance Art Museum, the Armory Center for the Arts, the 7th Istanbul Biennial, the Hammer Museum, Rooseum Center for Contemporary Art in Malmö, and the Toyota Museum.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: This piece is the silhouette of the Himalayan Blackberry, Rubus armeniacus, one of several species of fruit that are considered invasive in California, arranged as if it were a specimen within an herbarium. This work is a special edition of a larger project\r\nthat investigates the distinction between native versus invasive species as determined by the California Invasive Species Advisory Council (CISAC). Beginning in 2009 CISAC has created a list of invasive species that names roughly 1,700 species of flora and fauna as invasive in California and categorizes their threat levels with a variety of metrics on scorecards. The cultural bias that plays into the scientific criteria and discourse around how, why, and by whom these plants are considered to be invasive are the project’s focus.\r\nSemantically the use of such terms as invasive and native are loaded. The direct correlation between human population shifts that occur at politically determined borders, rather than those determinedby biomes, and the introduction vectors of these species is an area that warrants illumination. The reasons for identifying alien species vary from their being unwelcome because of their competitiveness with native flora and fauna or those cultivated for commercial or aesthetic purposes.\r\n","options":[{"id":48427278,"name":"Default","price":1800.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":100.0,"amount_with_others":75.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127851105/-/IMG_1069.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127851105/-/IMG_1069.jpg","width":2448,"height":3264}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":618291,"name":"Fruitique","permalink":"fruitique","url":"/category/fruitique"},{"id":618371,"name":"Fallen Fruit Products","permalink":"fallen-fruit-products","url":"/category/fallen-fruit-products"}]},{"id":14931096,"name":"SUSAN WEBER:  \"Outside The Law”","permalink":"susan-weber-outside-the-law","position":57,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/susan-weber-outside-the-law","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-18T19:46:52.000Z","description":"ARTIST: SUSAN WEBER\r\nTITLE:  \"Outside The Law”\r\nDESCRIPTION: Found pulp fiction paperbacks with collaged fruit images.\r\nMATERIALS: paper and glue\r\nRETAIL PRICE: $50 (20% discount for the set)\r\nDIMENSIONS: Variable\r\nEDITION: N/A\r\n\r\n*contact Info@fallenfruit.org about shipping options or pick-up within Los Angeles\r\n\r\nSusan C.

The collaboration has expanded to include serialized public projects and site-specific installations and happenings in various cities around the world. By always working with fruit as a material or media, the catalogue of projects and works reimagine public interactions with the margins of urban space, systems of community and narrative real-time experience. Public Fruit Jams invites a broad public to transform homegrown or public fruit and join in communal jam-making as experimentation in personal narrative and sublime collaboration; Nocturnal Fruit Forages, nighttime neighborhood fruit tours explores the boundaries of public and private space at the edge of darkness; Public Fruit Meditations renegotiates our relationship of ourselves through guided visualizations and dynamic group participation. Fallen Fruit’s visual work includes an ongoing series of narrative photographs, wallpapers, everyday objects and video works that explore the social and political implications of our relationship to fruit and world around us. Recent curatorial projects reindex the social and historical complexities of museums and archives by re-installing permanent collections through syntactical relationships of fruit as subject. Fallen Fruit is an art collaboration originally conceived by David Burns, Matias Viegener and Austin Young.  Fallen Fruit uses fruit as a common denominator to change the way you see the world.\r\n","options":[{"id":48446802,"name":"Default","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":35.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127801986/-/ff-cuttingboard_wut22.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127801986/-/ff-cuttingboard_wut22.jpg","width":268,"height":216}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":618371,"name":"Fallen Fruit Products","permalink":"fallen-fruit-products","url":"/category/fallen-fruit-products"},{"id":6703482,"name":"Everyday  Objects","permalink":"everyday-objects","url":"/category/everyday-objects"}]},{"id":14930970,"name":"SUSAN WEBER:  “China Coaster”","permalink":"susan-weber-china-coaster","position":62,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/susan-weber-china-coaster","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-18T19:42:35.000Z","description":"ARTIST: SUSAN WEBER\r\nTITLE:  “China Coaster”\r\nDESCRIPTION: Found pulp fiction paperbacks with collaged fruit images.\r\nMATERIALS: paper and glue\r\nRETAIL PRICE: $50 \r\nDIMENSIONS: Variable\r\nEDITION: N/A\r\n\r\nSusan C.

Cake and Eat It has given away copious amounts of free clothes, thrown fashion shows in dingey dinge holes, hosted anarchist variety shows and salons (yum yum), given away cursed gifts, staged riotous fashion marches, styled defendants for court as well as ran a year long free boutique and orchestrated an experimental opera tribute to Jean Genet. Their most recent work, Femme Strike, is an investigation into the cultural scripts that pervade radical political forms- the manifesto, the union hall, the strike hall, the picket, the strike itself. The project questions the utilitarian veneer of politics, instead seeking to elaborate femme methodologies and aesthetics to better mediate between affective bonds and bonds of political solidarity. Project iterations have so far included a series of femmed temporary strike halls dispersed throughout Los Angeles, Opera Operaismo: A May Day Opera-As-Flying-Picket, and the forthcoming book Thee Femme Method.  cakeandeatit.org\r\n\r\nNOTE:  $75.00 each panel or $180.00 for set\r\n","options":[{"id":48419613,"name":"Default","price":180.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128202108/-/IMG_0090.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128202108/-/IMG_0090.jpg","width":2448,"height":3264},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128202066/-/IMG_0088.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128202066/-/IMG_0088.jpg","width":2448,"height":3264},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128202153/-/IMG_0089.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128202153/-/IMG_0089.jpg","width":2448,"height":3264},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127852911/-/IMG_1086.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127852911/-/IMG_1086.JPG","width":1024,"height":768}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":618291,"name":"Fruitique","permalink":"fruitique","url":"/category/fruitique"},{"id":618371,"name":"Fallen Fruit Products","permalink":"fallen-fruit-products","url":"/category/fallen-fruit-products"}]},{"id":14929896,"name":"URSULA BROOKBANK: Neck Ornament (b) from the SHE WORLD Archive","permalink":"ursula-brookbank-neck-ornament-b-from-the-she-world-archive","position":83,"price":300.0,"default_price":300.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ursula-brookbank-neck-ornament-b-from-the-she-world-archive","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-18T19:02:53.000Z","description":"ARTIST: URSULA BROOKBANK\r\nTITLE: Neck Ornament (b) from the SHE WORLD Archive\r\nDESCRIPTION: Mixed media.\r\nMATERIALS: Mixed media\r\nRETAIL PRICE: $300\r\nDIMENSIONS: Variable\r\nEDITION: N/A\r\n\r\nUrsula Brookbank is a Los Angeles based artist, who works in the mediums of film, video and photography.

It was not until the navel orange was unveiled in 1879 that it quickly became Californian’s favorite fruit. Oranges have remained a central agricultural product and have been the center of many Californians’ memories. The first California navel orange tree is still alive today. At over 179 years old, it has been studied, honored and protected throughout its life. It is currently in danger of being infected by disease-carrying Asian citrus psyllid, and city officials are investigating putting up a structure to protect the historic tree. Southern California was shaped by the orange tree and it remains a major part of the culture and economy today. When I found the stereoscope image from 1879 of a Southern California orange tree I knew it would be a great foundation for a piece about fruit and our relationship with it.","options":[{"id":48419061,"name":"Default","price":180.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128202438/-/IMG_0100.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128202438/-/IMG_0100.jpg","width":3264,"height":2448}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":618291,"name":"Fruitique","permalink":"fruitique","url":"/category/fruitique"}]},{"id":15664101,"name":"FALLEN FRUIT: EVERYDAY OBJECT, KNIFE, 2008 (CAPITALIST COGSUCKER)","permalink":"fallen-fruit-everyday-object-knife-2008-capitalist-cogsucker","position":87,"price":100.0,"default_price":100.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fallen-fruit-everyday-object-knife-2008-capitalist-cogsucker","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-12-19T21:31:48.000Z","description":"ARTIST: FALLEN FRUIT (David Burns, Matias Viegener and Austin Young) \r\nTITLE: Everyday Object, Knife, 2008 \r\nDESCRIPTION: 'Capitalist Cogsucker' \r\nMATERIALS: Laser etched OXO knife \r\nRETAIL PRICE: $100; open edition \r\nDIMENSIONS: N/A\r\n\r\nFallen Fruit is a long-term art collaboration that began by mapping fruit trees growing on or over public property in Los Angeles.
