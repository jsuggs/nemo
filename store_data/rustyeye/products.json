Like nothing your eyes have ever seen – or your ears ever heard – before.</b>\r\n\r\nThis is the album Rusty Eye have been hinting they had inside them since 2006. Live At The Joint, Cryogenic EP and Stendhal Syndrome all showed that not only were the LA trio past masters at their respective instruments, but also well versed in a wide range of musical genres. That much remains true, of course, but Possessor is arguably the ultimate synthesis of all those strands. What on paper may sound bewildering – thrash, metal, '70s rock, prog – is in fact beguiling, and fits the album's existential lyrical themes hand in glove. The two-pronged vocal assault of Miss Randall and Mr Rust has never sounded so damn potent, bringing every composition to life. Or should that be death? Either way, if you've never heard Rusty Eye, then it's guaranteed that you'll have never heard an album quite like this before.\r\n\r\nCalum Harvie\r\nZero Tolerance Magazine)\r\n\r\nGuest Appearances:\r\nClaudio Simonetti - tracks 3 and 6 (keyboards)\r\nWaldemar Sorychta - tracks 8 and 12 (guitar solo, keyboards)\r\nAlex Mitchell - track 4 (vocals)","options":[{"id":25269225,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81467985/-/possessorcd.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81467985/-/possessorcd.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3252545,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":8005599,"name":"Stendhal Syndrome [2006] CD","permalink":"stendhal-syndrome-2006-cd","position":7,"price":12.99,"default_price":12.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/stendhal-syndrome-2006-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-15T02:51:50.000Z","description":"<object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F52145882&amp;show_comments=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=b30600\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F52145882&amp;show_comments=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=b30600\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>   <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/rusty-eye/birds-of-prey\">Birds of Prey</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/rusty-eye\">Rusty Eye</a></span>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The moment when Rusty Eye bring it all together: technically challenging, progressive metal with a uniquely punk-informed rockin' spirit.</b>\r\n\r\nWith Mr Rust now joined by guitarist Baron Murtland and vocalist / drummer Miss Randall, <b>Rusty Eye</b> are at last able to deliver an album which essentially defines them as a band. In a way, if 2009's Possessor is <b>Rusty Eye</b>'s Master Of Puppets, then Stendhal Syndrome is their Ride The Lightning - it's that important. The album's appeal is wide ranging as the band pull in aspects of '70s rock, punk, prog, doom and thrash. In lesser hands, such a blend could be a real mess, but <b>Rusty Eye</b> weave the various musical strands together like master craftsmen. The duality of the vocals - courtesy of Mr Rust and Miss Randall - add a cinematic / dramatic quality to the songs, which befits tunes like the seminal 'Mr Cannibal'. But just when you've got <b>Rusty Eye</b> sussed, they pull the rug from under your feet - effortlessly seguing from intricate jazz-inspired instrumental passages into razor-sharp riff assaults into head-noddingly appreciable grooves. And that is exactly what makes this album so damn enjoyable!\r\n\r\n<i>By Calum Harvie\r\nZero Tolerance Magazine (UK)","options":[{"id":25270014,"name":"Default","price":12.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81467289/-/stendhal-cd.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81467289/-/stendhal-cd.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81470973/-/stendhal-back1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81470973/-/stendhal-back1.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81493545/-/stendhaldisc.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81493545/-/stendhaldisc.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3252545,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":8005479,"name":"Rust n' Roll [2001] CD","permalink":"rust-n-roll-2001-cd","position":8,"price":4.99,"default_price":4.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rust-n-roll-2001-cd","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-11-15T02:45:00.000Z","description":"<object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F52146050&amp;show_comments=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=b30600\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F52146050&amp;show_comments=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=b30600\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>   <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/rusty-eye/phantasm-instrumental\">Phantasm (Instrumental)</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/rusty-eye\">Rusty Eye</a></span><br>\r\n<b>An essential snapshot of where Rusty Eye were at the turn of the century: the groundwork being laid for what was to come some years later.</b>\r\n\r\nAlthough known these days for being based in Los Angeles, California, Rusty Eye trace their roots to the mid-'90s and Mexico City. After a slew of demo releases and live recordings, this is their debut album proper. Groove-laden, you can hear Mr Rust's different influences at play here - early Maiden, garage punk, elements of early cross-over (DRI, Suicidal Tendencies...), among others. Those familiar with the way in which the band progressed subsequently will notice a looser vibe at work here, not to mention a different vocal approach. But the key elements of Mr Rust's visions are here to be found - existential nightmares, death and gore - as is the hint of his musical ambitions which were to be realised just a few years later.\r\n\r\nBy Calum Harvie\r\nZero Tolerance Magazine (UK)","options":[{"id":25269711,"name":"Default","price":4.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81467769/-/rustnrollcd.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81467769/-/rustnrollcd.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3252545,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":8285898,"name":"Live at The Rainbow MMX [2010] CD","permalink":"live-at-the-rainbow-mmx-2010-cd","position":9,"price":12.99,"default_price":12.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/live-at-the-rainbow-mmx-2010-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-30T02:24:05.000Z","description":"<b>15 Years of Rusty Eye unleashed live in its rawest form.

Captured in its purest form, in front of a select number of diehard fans taking part of this historical occasion, this is the Rusty Eye show their fans could not miss out on taking part of. The first time any musical act has ever recorded a live record at the World Famous Rainbow Bar & Grill in West Hollywood, California, this release is for hardcore Rusty Eye fans – capturing its raw intensity in its purest form along with those who were on hand to experience this. Over 70 minutes long and recorded in multi-track by Yuri Anisonyan (Fireball Ministry, My Ruin), produced by band drummer Miss Randall, and cover art by Farron Loathing (Lightning Swords of Death) - Live at the Rainbow spans Rusty Eye’s career with songs from every release (Rust N Roll, the Cryogenic mini CD, Stendhal Syndrome & Possessor), they captured the historic evening…and not letting anything stopping them from giving their fans a piece of that historic night.

As before there is rock, there is roll, there is metal... but this album concentrates that with a whole lot of punk-laced attitude. And the pace is blistering - stick-slayer extraordinaire Miss Randall leading the charge with precision-tooled drumming, feeding off and informing Mr Rust's bass-lines like it's the most natural thing in the world while Baron Murtland's fretboard pyrotechnics set the world ablaze. Tight doesn't even come close to describing this, but here's the rub: honed chops never come at the expense of feel and vibe. That Rusty Eye are made for the stage jumps out from the start.
