What you saw instead was an image that showed James Brown in mid-soul-reeling-screech and it read; <em>voice of James Brown live from Boston Garden</em>. \r\n\r\nIt was the night after MLK was shot and most American cities were burning with riot and rage â€” All except Boston. Already scheduled to play the Boston Garden that night James agreed to air the concert on live TV in hopes that the opportunity to see him perform for free would entice mourners to stay home and lessen the threat of violence. It worked and not only was James credited with saving Boston but this moment hurled him into the National spotlight as the voice of black people everywhere.  \r\n\r\nThis is the hold graphic that momentarily took up the screen while TV crews scrambled to sync sound and image for the viewers at home. <em>Hand printed off white on a black Hanes Medium weight Tee.

As he was coming up in the music business everyone told him he wouldn't get much further than the chitlin' circuit. They said his music just wasn't meant for mainstream airplay. As soon as James made some money he bought the station he used to shine at and reformatted it into a soul station so he could play his own records. \r\n\r\nThere were a few artists that came before James who can be credited with bringing black music to white America but James Brown is the first to bring white America to black music. The radio station he did it at was WRDW 1480-am.\r\n\r\n<em>Hand printed off white on a black Hanes Medium weight Tee.
