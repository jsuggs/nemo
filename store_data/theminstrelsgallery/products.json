What matters the most still are knowledge one should bear and how to keep on going.","options":[{"id":30801580,"name":"Default","price":950.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103590628/-/IMG_2564.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103590628/-/IMG_2564.jpg","width":1000,"height":667}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4789315,"name":"Original Painting","permalink":"original-painting","url":"/category/original-painting"},{"id":4794931,"name":"Original Piece","permalink":"original-piece","url":"/category/original-piece"}]}]
