Better than gold, earth's silica, iron, magnesium, calcium, sodium, zinc and other minerals bind with environmental toxins while removing old sebum that may be clogging your pores.\r\n\r\nPerfection: Sense & Sensitivity Clay gently purifies and restores easily irritated skin. If you thought that dry, dehydrated or sensitive skin should not use clay, here is your chance to give it a try. The Perfection Sense & Sensitivity Clay uses a blend of french red clay, Kaolin, Rhassoul and herbs to create a pore-refining mask suitable for sensitive skin. Remember, all clay masques work by bringing more circulation to the surface of the skin, so don’t be alarmed if you have some “redness” following your treatment. It is only increased circulation and with subside shortly.\r\n\r\nSpot treatment: mix a pinch of any clay mixture with equal part water and form a paste in your palm. You may want to add 1 small drop of an essential oil (such as geranium for blemishes or lavender with sensitive clay for sunburns). Dot onto problem spot or area. Leave on overnight, or allow to dry & remove with a damp cloth. This is also great for insect bites and stings.\r\n\r\nFacial masque (once a week): mix 2 scoops any Clay Mix with 3 scoops water water, herbal tea (fennel, chamomile, rose, etc.) or aloe juice to make a smooth paste (honey is a great addition as well). You can add a pinch of Sow Your Wild Oats or a drop of the women’s vitality oil blend. Lightly apply over damp/wet skin. Relax with a damp/wet washcloth over your face and witch hazel pads over your eyes for 10 minutes before removing the masque, intermittently misting your face with the Hydrosol of your choosing. You can also wear your masque around the house, vacuuming, dancing, yoga-ing, etc...please experiment! Try letting it dry if you love that tight feeling (it’s certainly better for you than other ways of getting that tiny-pore look!) and press with a damp cloth just before you are about to take it off.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Perfection Clays are hand-mixed in small batches to perfection. Each batch takes 6 weeks of weekly infusions of herbs. 100% vegan and contains absolutely no chemicals or preservatives!","options":[{"id":24066279,"name":"2oz - 32.00","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":24066281,"name":"6oz","price":58.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103786684/-/SS_Clay.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103786684/-/SS_Clay.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103786666/-/SS_Clay_close.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103786666/-/SS_Clay_close.jpg","width":600,"height":413},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76909884/-/ss_clay2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76909884/-/ss_clay2.jpg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76909932/-/smallclays2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76909932/-/smallclays2.jpg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75618888/-/Ingredient_Card-ss_clay.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75618888/-/Ingredient_Card-ss_clay.jpg","width":800,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3710879,"name":"Basic Skin Care","permalink":"basic-skin-care","url":"/category/basic-skin-care"},{"id":3710969,"name":"Vegan","permalink":"vegan","url":"/category/vegan"}]},{"id":7279123,"name":"No Evil","permalink":"no-evil","position":14,"price":45.0,"default_price":45.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/no-evil","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-18T05:53:56.000Z","description":"100% Natural skin protector that removes make-up as it nourishes delicate skin.

Better than gold, earth's silica, iron, magnesium, calcium, sodium, zinc and other minerals bind with environmental toxins while removing old sebum that may be clogging your pores.\r\n\r\nPerfection: Pore-Refining Clay is a flawless blend of our two favorite clays. Montmorillonite—Green Clay—is both antiseptic and healing. Derived from volcanic deposits, it is by far the richest in mineral composition. It energizes the connective tissue with gentle stimulation and is effective in promoting lymphatic drainage and circulation, increasing the flow of oxygen and speeding the elimination of wastes. Rhassoul clay’s most impressive property is its unique absorption capacity, due to its high level of ionic exchange. This makes it the most gentle of all clays and is used to smooth and improve even dry skin. It has been used for over 12 centuries in North Africa, South Europe and The Middle East.\r\n\r\nSpot treatment: mix a pinch of any clay mixture with equal part water and form a paste in your palm.

Better than gold, earth's silica, iron, magnesium, calcium, sodium, zinc and other minerals bind with environmental toxins while removing old sebum that may be clogging your pores.\r\n\r\nPerfection: Clear Complexion Clay (with activated charcoal): A clay mixture specially designed to get you through you breakouts by drawing out toxins and encouraging blood flow to your problem areas. We took the high-quality clays and herbs that refine your pores and nourish your skin and added activated charcoal for a deep detoxification. Beware: This intense mask will really draw out impurities. We recommend keeping it moist and leaving it on for 5-7 minutes. Clear Complexion Clay will stain clothing and/or washcloths.\r\n\r\nSpot treatment: mix a pinch of any clay mixture with equal part water and form a paste in your palm. You may want to add 1 small drop of an essential oil (such as geranium for blemishes or lavender with sensitive clay for sunburns). Dot onto problem spot or area. Leave on overnight, or allow to dry & remove with a damp cloth. This is also great for insect bites and stings.\r\n\r\nFacial masque (once a week): mix 2 scoops any Clay Mix with 3 scoops water water, herbal tea (fennel, chamomile, rose, etc.) or aloe juice to make a smooth paste (honey is a great addition as well). You can add a pinch of Sow Your Wild Oats or a drop of the women’s vitality oil blend. Lightly apply over damp/wet skin. Relax with a damp/wet washcloth over your face and witch hazel pads over your eyes for 10 minutes before removing the masque, intermittently misting your face with the Hydrosol of your choosing. You can also wear your masque around the house, vacuuming, dancing, yoga-ing, etc...please experiment! Try letting it dry if you love that tight feeling (it’s certainly better for you than other ways of getting that tiny-pore look!) and press with a damp cloth just before you are about to take it off.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Perfection Clays are hand-mixed in small batches to perfection! Each batch takes 6 weeks of weekly infusions of herbs. 100% vegan and contains absolutely no chemicals or preservatives!","options":[{"id":23082843,"name":"2oz - 32.00","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23082845,"name":"6oz ","price":58.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103786888/-/CC_Clay.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103786888/-/CC_Clay.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103786912/-/CC_Clay_close.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103786912/-/CC_Clay_close.jpg","width":600,"height":410},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76910196/-/smallclays2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76910196/-/smallclays2.jpg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75619404/-/Ingredient_Card-cc_clay.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75619404/-/Ingredient_Card-cc_clay.jpg","width":800,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3710879,"name":"Basic Skin Care","permalink":"basic-skin-care","url":"/category/basic-skin-care"},{"id":3710969,"name":"Vegan","permalink":"vegan","url":"/category/vegan"}]},{"id":7278975,"name":"Cow Fart Juice","permalink":"cow-fart-juice","position":22,"price":60.0,"default_price":60.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cow-fart-juice","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-18T05:32:55.000Z","description":"A highly intoxicating blend of healing herbs that have natural anti-bacterial, anti-microbial, anti-viral, & anti-fungal properties.

Milk is full of healthy fats and vitamins which moisturize skin. Lactic acid in milk is mildly exfoliating. Probiotics assist in neutralizing destructive bacteria. Chamomile, Matricaria chamomilla, & Lavender, Lavandula, flowers are traditionally used for soothing and calming the body’s nervous system. \r\n\r\nRecipes for Milk Baths:\r\nEgyptian: Add 1/2 cup honey and a few scoops of Milk Bath to running water. \r\nMagnesium: Mix 1 cup Epsom salt with 1/2 cup Milk Bath.

Great for acneic, oily, normal & problem skin, it helps to protect and repair your skin's natural defensive line (the rhein's barrier) and prevent breakout.\r\n\r\nUses:\r\n1. As a daily cleanser, it takes off make-up, gently removes dirt and debris. Oily and breakout prone skin should use it once a day, applying over dry skin and adding water to the finger tips before working it around in circles. Remove with a damp cloth. You may follow it with Sow Your Wild Oats and Nourish & Replenish.\r\n\r\n2. As a light moisture lotion, anyone can use it as a daily or pick-me-up moisturizer. Honey is an excellent humectant and this lotion feels healthy & nourishing. \r\n\r\n3. As a breakout treatment for large or small areas. Applying LOMAH over large areas of breakout skin helps improve the texture and appearance of a breakout better than any type of drying treatment. \r\n\r\n\r\nHow it works: \r\nThe gentle cleansing exfoliation of milk (lactic acid) combined with the anti-bacterial power of honey prevents break-outs by teaching your skin how to discern between what is YOU and what is OTHER. \r\nYour skin is naturally assisted in protecting itself from outside forces (pollution, dust, grime, toxins, pesticides, etc.) resulting in less inflammation, fewer pustules and the repair of raw skin. Additionally, honey helps to repair your skin’s natural defensive line, the rhein’s barrier. The oil-reducing properties of Willowbark and the antibacterial properties of neem make this an ideal moisturizer for anyone with acne-prone skin who needs the soothing qualities of a light\r\nmoisturizer.\r\n\r\nHolistic Triangulation: \r\nIndicated for HIGH HEAT, LOW WATER, HIGH OIL conditions. \r\nAcneic, dehydration-related breakout, mature, immature, normal to oily and combination. (pH: 4.5 - 5.5 - helps to restore the acid mantle) \r\n\r\nThe Name: \r\nIf we look into literary archaeology, there are many references to “a land flowing with Milk and Honey” or a promised land in ancient biblical literature. We make this reference literally, meaning that this lotion actually flows with milk and honey and literarily, implying beauty, health and abundance for those who are willing to seek it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: It is a favorite among teenagers as well as the men-folk who want to have young-looking, healthy skin without actually having to admit to using skin care products.","options":[{"id":23081749,"name":"4oz - 38.00","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81886041/-/lomah-sm.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81886041/-/lomah-sm.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74743743/-/Ingredient_Card-lomah.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74743743/-/Ingredient_Card-lomah.jpg","width":800,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3710881,"name":"Advanced Skin Care","permalink":"advanced-skin-care","url":"/category/advanced-skin-care"}]},{"id":7290925,"name":"Magick Potion Lotion","permalink":"magick-potion-lotion","position":42,"price":128.0,"default_price":128.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/magick-potion-lotion","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-19T06:47:10.000Z","description":"**SHIPPING IN JANUARY**If ordered in DEC, 2 for the price of 1 Special will still be honored!**\r\n\r\nThis unique and naturally-based treatment is loaded with powerful active ingredients of hyaluronic acid, DMAE, vitamin A, B, C and E, CoQ10 and alpha lipoic acid while incorporating the use of multi-fruit acids and the “wonder-oil” that comes from the meadowfoam plant, all in a pure rosewater distillate base.\r\nPrepare for profoundly transformative results!\r\n\r\nUse:\r\n1. Morning: After cleansing, add 1-2 pumps of Magick Potion Lotion to your finger tips and apply all over your face and neck. Mist with Hydrosol and massage in upward circular motions, creating a light \"foam\". Allow to set for a few minutes and it will soak in completely before applying your N&R oil, LOMAH Lotion, Blooming Rose Creme or just make-up, depending on your skin's needs. \r\n2. Evening: apply before make-up for a night out and about! Simply apply to clean skin, massage (with water or a hydrosol) to create the Magic Potion Foam, allow to set and apply make-up. \r\n\r\nFrequency:\r\nWe recommend using this product for three weeks and then taking a one-week break every month. Do not use in conjunction with pharmaceutical skin care, heavy AHAs and retinols or the BY&TM Vita-C ten day treatment (you CAN do that during your \"week-off\" though. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story of Magick Potion Lotion (According to Emma):\r\nHow does one create a healthy skin care treatment that lives up to this name?! Yes, I have been listening. You love the products; you love how healthy and fresh you skin feels using the all-natural stuff everyday. Your skin tone and texture has improved following a simple 2 to 3 step regimen faithfully. But all those claims from the other skin care lines …magazines…the department store…the drug store (ahhhh!!!) each promising youth and beauty. But at what cost? Petrol-products? Parabins? And do they work? Are there enough active ingredients in the drug store brand (mixed with a slurry of chemical skin care) to actually make a difference? Hmmm…But I am listening. I know you want it. That magic Potion Lotion. The one that is filled with the newest advances in skin care to remove wrinkles, fine lines, dark spots, blemishes, years! So, here you go. I did it. This unique and naturally-based treatment is loaded with the popular and powerful active ingredients of hyaluronic acid, DMAE, vitamin A, B, C and E, CoQ10 and alpha lipoic acid while incorporating the use of multi-fruit acids and the “wonder-oil” that comes from the meadowfoam plant. Oh, and did I mention that it’s made with pure rosewater distillate? Remember, no matter how fancy we can get—it’s still Between You & The Moon. \r\n\r\nAbout the \"advanced\" ingredients:\r\nHyaluronic Acid was \"discovered\" by Karl Meyer in 1934 and since then, has been successfully used in personal care and wound healing. It is a substance that is naturally found in the extra cellular matrix of human tissue (Like elastin in collagen). When topically applied, hyaluronic acid forms an air permeable layer that can penetrate the dermis (the next layer down from the epidermis), thus boosting the elasticity and hydration of the skin. The protective breathable barrier on the skin locks in moisture and has a unique ability to hold more than 1000 ml of water per gram of hyaluronic acid, which gives the skin a youthful appearance. Amazingly, hyaluronic acid adjusts its moisture absorption based on the relative humidity in the air meaning that it adjusts to the skin’s need for a moisturizing effect depending on the season and climate of an area. Hyaluronic acid has also been shown to protect the epidermis by scavenging reactive oxygen species generated by ultra violet light, which would normally cause sunspots. The Hyaluronic acid in MPL is made by a Vegan-approved fermentation process in an organic-based lab (not mine!). \r\nNiacinamide is an amazing antioxidant that works for aging and acne related issues. It is the biologically active form of niacin, Vitamin B3 which increases the rate of skin exfoliation and increases moisture barrier repair. Studies have shown it to be useful in increasing synthesis of collagen and lipids, inhibiting the transfer of melanosomes and decreasing inflammation. \"Niacinamide is one of the vitamins that I believe we'll hear more and more about in the coming years. Already, topical 4% niacinamide has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of papular and pustular acne in a 4% gel, as well as the improvement of skin cancer and its anti-tumor characteristics'' (Dr. Draelos). SOURCE: American Academy of Dermatology. \r\nPro-Vitamin B5 (dl-Panthenol) is a popular humectant known for it's ability to counteract environmental and age-related dryness as well as increase the moisture retention capacity of the skin. This allows dry skin to stay supple and elastic longer. It is anti-inflammatory and stimulates skin regeneration. Together, Niacinamide and Panthenol improve the condition of the skin's moisture barrier, a function considered by dermatologists as critical to healthy skin. \r\nAS mentioned (over and over again) in Dr. Nicholas Perricone’s #1 New York Times Best Seller, The Wrinkle Cure, Unlock the Power of Cosmeceuticals for Supple, Youthful Skin it … DMAE, Alpha Lipoic, Ester C and Vitamin E are rock-n-roll for your skin. According to Dr. Perricone, products containing DMAE, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Vitamin C Ester, Alpha Hydroxy Acids, Vitamin E and Retinol (Vitamin A) can create amazing results in the appearance of aging skin. DMAE is found in foods and can create an almost immediate appearance in the firming and tone of the skin. Vitamin C Ester is well known and long documented antioxidant that protects the surface of the skin from free radicals that can damage the skin. Alpha Lipoic Acid is the most powerful of antioxidants. It is able to benefit both the water and lipid portions of the skin. It is said to give the skin a “youthful and glowing appearance.” Retinol Palmitate (Vitamin A) nourishes the skin and assists in the “rejuvenation process that maintains a more youthful appearance.” Alpha Hydroxy Acids gently remove dead skin and provide an added antioxidant. In this formula I use the gentle and natural form of AHA’s that occur in natural fruit extracts.","options":[{"id":23081659,"name":"Default","price":128.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125133771/-/mpl.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125133771/-/mpl.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74744751/-/Ingredient_Card-mpl.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74744751/-/Ingredient_Card-mpl.jpg","width":800,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3710881,"name":"Advanced Skin Care","permalink":"advanced-skin-care","url":"/category/advanced-skin-care"},{"id":3710969,"name":"Vegan","permalink":"vegan","url":"/category/vegan"}]},{"id":7291049,"name":"Vita-C 10 Day Wild Berry Treatment","permalink":"vita-c-ten-day-treatment","position":43,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/vita-c-ten-day-treatment","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-19T07:01:52.000Z","description":"Vita-C 10 Day Treatment\r\n1 oz. = About 3 months supply\r\nat least 70% organic/100% vegan\r\n\r\nIntended for \r\n• Fine Lines\r\n• Sun Damage\r\n• Enlarged Pores\r\n• Hyper-pigmentation\r\n• Breakout (old, hardened papules...)\r\n\r\nThis light home \"peel\" has the unique ability to bring a high concentration of vitamin C esters to the skin while using the gentle aha action of Wild Blueberry, Cranberry and Red Raspberry. The vitamin C esters, vitamin E and herbal extracts create a synergetic blend that helps to fight off the assault your skin encounters on a daily basis and protect from an onslaught of from free radicals. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Vita-C treatment is to carefully bring your skin to the “breaking point” of where it is just peeling (usually between 5 and 10 days, though you should go for every other day if you have very sensitive skin) and then stop and let your skin recover (usually 3 weeks to a month).  This recovery period is VERY IMPORTANT.  You do not want to use any suppressive therapies (such as anti-biotic ointments or steroid/cortisone creams) on your skin during this time.  You also want to make sure to EAT WELL, hydrate, and be respectful of the sun.  \r\n\r\nThose blessed with sensitive skin may want to remove the Vita-C 10 Day Treatment after 5 minutes and moisturize.  Hardened and tough skin can leave it on and either apply moisturizer (or Nourish & Replenish Oil mixed with water) over it or simply go to bed and moisturize in the morning.  \r\n\r\nThe 1oz jar of Vita-C 10 Day treatment is enough for a series of 3 “months”.  Please be aware to use clean utensils to dip into the jar to preserve the integrity of the ingredients.  After 6 months, the product may loose potency.  This cycle of peel/recovery may be repeated up to 6 times in a year.  (Just listen to your skin and don’t over-do it, OK?)\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":23082085,"name":"1oz - 50.00","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76910280/-/vitac1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76910280/-/vitac1.jpg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76910304/-/vitac2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76910304/-/vitac2.jpg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75336948/-/Ingredient_Card-vc.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75336948/-/Ingredient_Card-vc.jpg","width":800,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3710881,"name":"Advanced Skin Care","permalink":"advanced-skin-care","url":"/category/advanced-skin-care"}]},{"id":7618733,"name":"Ageless Collection {for mature skin}","permalink":"ageless-collection-for-mature-skin","position":44,"price":375.0,"default_price":375.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ageless-collection-for-mature-skin","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-21T23:28:04.000Z","description":"The Ageless Collection is Between You and the Moon’s most powerful antidotes to dull, lifeless skin.

DMAE has also been shown to stimulate the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, an essential fatty acid that improves and protects cell membranes which have been damaged by free-radicals (oxidation) while boosting circulation. Another intriguing finding in some DMAE studies was that it reduced the accumulation of lipofuscin deposits (cellular pigments made up of aggregated chucks of molecular waste inside cells). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that DMAE causes some degree of skin and pore tightening & people report cumulative effect with continued use of the product. DMAE can't fully reverse existing facial sag, but it may reduce its further progression.

Apply a layer of Nourish & Replenish Oil, Cow Fart Juice, or NO EVIL over your skin before leaning over steam.\r\n\r\nPlace 1oz (about a shotglass) of herbs in a large bowl and secure in a safe place. Pour about one quart of boiling water over the herbs and sit comfortably nearby. Lean over bowl (about 10 to 15 inches away) and use a towel to create a \"tent around the steam\". Inhale and enjoy!\r\n\r\nCAUTION: Boiling water is VERY HOT and can BURN YOU! Do not get too close to the steam. Do not pour boiling water into a plastic bowl as it may melt and hurt you. Do not put boiling or very hot water directly on the skin!\r\n\r\nWhile you enjoy your steam for ten to fifteen minutes, you can even give yourself a lovely facial massage.\r\n\r\nAnother fun idea is to let the steam bath cool and strain the plant pieces out of the water, pressing out as much of the \"goodness\" as you possibly can. You can then take this water and store it in a glass bottle (preferably with a spray top) in your refrigerator. This Herbal Infusion is now a lovely toner that will stay good for up to a week. (If it starts to smell funny before that, let it go. When in doubt, throw it out!)\r\n\r\nThe steamboat steamer rolls along through the seasons, grabbing the best of the available herbs while taking care to complement the changing needs of the body throughout the cycling year.","options":[{"id":23080649,"name":"6oz glass jar - 40.00","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23168891,"name":"6oz refill","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73394009/-/ss1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73394009/-/ss1.jpg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73394017/-/ss2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73394017/-/ss2.jpg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75957228/-/Ingredient_Card-steamboat.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75957228/-/Ingredient_Card-steamboat.jpg","width":800,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3710879,"name":"Basic Skin Care","permalink":"basic-skin-care","url":"/category/basic-skin-care"},{"id":3710877,"name":"Apothecary","permalink":"apothecary","url":"/category/apothecary"}]},{"id":7291037,"name":"Ancient Secrets Body Scrub","permalink":"ancient-secrets-body-scrub","position":56,"price":35.0,"default_price":35.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ancient-secrets-body-scrub","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-19T06:59:57.000Z","description":"A gentle herbal scrub which combines turmeric, mustard seed, jojoba, and grapefruit seed. Wonderful for body blemishes, dry skin and rough spots, and ingrown hairs.\r\n\r\nUse:\r\nGentle enough for daily use. Smooth skin results even if only used every few days in the shower or bath. Apply to moistened skin, scrub lightly in a circular motion with an organic cotton cloth or a natural sea sponge. Rinse completely when finished. Enjoy smoothed, refreshed skin!\r\n\r\nPre-wax: Use every other day for a week before your waxing appointment, but discontinue 2 days before to rest skin.\r\nPost-wax: Wait at least 1 day (especially for the bikini line) \r\nand scrub in the shower. It will also remove any traces of excess wax or stickiness.\r\n\r\nWe have been behind many closed doors with healers and beauty therapists from around the world. Over and over again, we hear the healing mantra of the herbs in this Ancient Secrets Body Scrub.\r\n\r\nTurmeric has long been used in Ayurvedic skin care. It has naturally occurring anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and anti-microbial properties and has been used both internally and topically in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine. In India it is used on cuts, bruises and burns. Some Indian women use turmeric to keep them free of superfluous hair and to give a glow to the skin. Turmeric is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial plant from the ginger family and it is native to tropical South Asia. The Government of Thailand is currently funding a project to isolate tetrahydrocurcuminoids from turmeric, a colorless compound found in turmeric which is believed to have high antioxidant, skin lightening properties and to treat skin inflammations.\r\n\r\nMustard has been used for many years by cultures around the world because of its reputation to increase circulation and open pores. It is thought to stimulate sweating which in turn helps the body rid itself of toxins. Neem is widely used in India as an antibacterial, antiviral, anti-fungal, antiseptic and anti-parasitic agent in skin care for centuries.\r\n\r\nJojoba oil contains a waxy substance that is similar to skin sebum. One of the most common problems with oily skin is that the tendency is to try to dry out the skin to compensate for the oiliness. However, instead the skin produces extra oil trying to protect itself. The wonderful thing about using jojoba oil is that it can mimic the skin’s sebum allowing oily skin to balance out and stop over producing oil. Jojoba oil has excellent moisturizing and protective effects.\r\n\r\nGrapefruit essential oil is known to be an antiseptic, disinfectant, lymphatic stimulant and tonic essential oil. It has a lymphatic stimulant action and is also very effective in controlling liquid processes in the skin, making it effective in cases of water retention and in detoxification. At the same time it tones the skin and eases congestion in oily skins, which makes it helpful in treating acne. \r\n\r\nNeed we say more?","options":[{"id":23082041,"name":"Default","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73394481/-/asbs1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73394481/-/asbs1.jpg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73394505/-/asbs2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73394505/-/asbs2.jpg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76912020/-/Ingredient_Card-ancientsecret.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76912020/-/Ingredient_Card-ancientsecret.jpg","width":800,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3710877,"name":"Apothecary","permalink":"apothecary","url":"/category/apothecary"},{"id":3710969,"name":"Vegan","permalink":"vegan","url":"/category/vegan"}]},{"id":7478973,"name":"Newfangled Ideas Coffee Body Scrub","permalink":"newfangled-ideas-coffee-body-scrub","position":57,"price":45.0,"default_price":45.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/newfangled-ideas-coffee-body-scrub","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-08T05:17:52.000Z","description":"An invigorating sea salt scrub which combines coffee and herbal magic to address an issue we all face at one point: the dreaded cellulite.\r\n\r\nUse:\r\nGentle enough for daily use.

She received her reiki training from her father, and her masage training form the Swedish Institute of Health Sciences in NYC.  She is currently continuing her education with craniosacral therapy, and is always interested in exploring new ways to use herbs for healing and relaxation.  Ruby is delighted to work with the Brooklyn Herborium, where she can combine so many of her passions with such lovely people.  Combining reiki with elements of massage, hot stone therapy and reflexology, as well as the beautiful oils we all know and love from the Brooklyn Herborium, Ruby strives to tailor each session to her client's needs. Come, relax, and leave feeling deeply nurtured.\r\n\r\n30 Minute Massage\r\nIncredible relaxation massage to the head, neck, shoulders and face.  Make it 60 minutes {$100} to include hand and foot reflexology.  These treatments have the option to include hot stones and aromatherapy as well. {$60}\r\n\r\n\r\nReiki Treatment {60 minutes}\r\nReiki is an ancient method of physical and spiritual healing. It has been effective in helping virtually every known malady. Here, Reiki is used as a key element of therapeutic massage and can dramatically improve physical and mental well being through loving wisdom.  Many people find this work most beneficial when done once a week for 3-5 weeks, but one can schedule a single session whenever it feels needed. Reiki is also a great way to nurture oneself during pregnancy and leading up to birth. Babies are pure energy and love reiki.\r\n{$100}\r\n\r\nDeep Spirit Reiki Treatment {90 minutes}\r\nReiki healing combined with other modalities to enhance the relaxation experience.  Can include massage of the head, neck, shoulders and face, hand and foot reflexology, hot stone therapy, and aromatherapy.  These can be mixed and employed to best suit a client's needs. Special treatment will be given to any areas which need attention.\r\n{$150}\r\n\r\nFor more about Reiki:\r\nWhat is Reiki??\r\nReiki is a healing treatment that is beneficial to your energy.   A lot of people use the word \"energy\", what does it imply?  There is only one energy, and it animates and flows through all things, you, me, a flower, a stone, a star, a galaxy.  This energy needs clear smooth channels to flow through, and when it does, you feel your best; balanced with a clear head, things seem to work with less effort and you can be flexible and open. But, when something disturbs the flow of this energy, a barrier is placed in it's path, things can become difficult.  There can be sickness, depression, a feeling of being \"stuck\" or \"off\".   A barrier can be as seemingly insignificant as a little argument with your partner or co-worker, or it can be a major life event.  Sometimes these things work themselves out, but when things persist we need help to bring ourselves back to our balance.  This is where energetic healing can be a great help.  By allowing our systems to relax, as happens during reiki, we allow healing and realignment to occur.\r\nReiki is a tradition of energetic healing developed in Japan.  The reiki practitioner acts as a conduit to let the energy of the universe flow to the recipient, helping them to clear their energetic pathways to get back to that open, balanced place.  This energy is intelligent, it knows where it needs to go, where it's purpose is.  During a treatment, a practitioner may be draw to one area of the body or another, but it is this intelligent energy that is doing the work, not them.  Because of this, reiki can do no harm.  It is gentle enough to accompany any other treatments or therapies one may be receiving.  It can be employed for someone who is \"feeling blue\", someone dealing with a chronic or fatal disease, or anyone in between.  Some people get reiki cause it just feels great, and they are better for receiving it on a regular basis. \r\nWhat is a reiki session like?\r\nA reiki session can be vastly different depending on who you get it from.  When I, Ruby, do reiki, it is with a very soft touch.  Sometimes the work is hands on, sometimes hands off. The recipient lays comfortably on a treatment table fully clothed, or undressed under a sheet if they are also receiving a massage.  Throughout the session I hold the head, the hands, the feet, as well as lay my hands on the body over energetic centers.  Breasts and groin are never touched.  There is no oil used on the skin (unless the session is including massage), but I do sometimes use essential oils as I see fit or as my client requests.  At the beginning and end of the session there can be some gentle rocking of the body, traction of the head and neck or of the legs to loosen the body. A short massage to the face or scalp can be helpful so that the recipient can leave the day behind and bring their attention into their body.  Some people chose to speak about what they feel or see during reiki, some choose not to, whatever is most comfortable to the client is honored.  It is important that anything that comes up is acknowledged, but the way that is done is different for everybody.  At the end of a reiki session most people feel very relaxed, sometimes sleepy but sometimes energized, always with a smile on their face.     \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":43718007,"name":"30 Minute Massage - $60.00","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43718010,"name":"60 Minute Massage","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":43718019,"name":"Reiki Massage {60 minutes}","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":43718022,"name":"Reiki Massage {90 minutes}","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124472877/-/ruby1-bc.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124472877/-/ruby1-bc.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3710971,"name":"Services","permalink":"services","url":"/category/services"}]},{"id":7455311,"name":"Facial Point Stimulation Therapy","permalink":"facial-point-stimulation-therapy","position":66,"price":100.0,"default_price":100.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/facial-point-stimulation-therapy","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-05T08:30:54.000Z","description":"Also known as Dien Cham (or Facial Reflexology), this relaxing facial technique uses hand-blown glass “wands” to stimulate points along meridian lines as well as a mixture of a mixture of warm and cold semiprecious stones (including jade) to boost circulation and smooth skin tone.
