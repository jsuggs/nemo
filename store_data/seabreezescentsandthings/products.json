Well, I wouldn't advise it because these are tarts! Scoopies are available in any of my scents, and will be individually packaged in cello wrap with a tie.  I don't use a 'mold' for my scoopies, and each one is hand made and shaped. Because they're all unique, the average weight is approximately 2.3 - 2.8 ounces (generally on the larger side). Too large for your warmer? You can slice your scoopie with a warmed knife to the size you need, or simply break off the crumbles! These are totally customized, just for you.  \r\n\r\nPlease note that scoopie colors will vary. On occasion, I like to add glitter and/or sprinkles to my tarts.

Perhaps a loved one has passed, and you want a more unique item to remember them... Or maybe you would like to remember the day you were married... Or how about your pet? The possibilities are absolutely endless with my image candles! \r\n\r\nThis listing is for the \"Large\" sized image candles. They are about 6 inches tall and they can be designed with just a front image, and sometimes I can add a back image as well (depending on the shape of the images). The candles are white, and will be unscented. I can add quotes, photos, awareness ribbons, and more! Candle images can be designed in color, or black & white. \r\n\r\nAfter you order your candle(s), I will send you an email to collect the information, text, photos, etc. Before I create your candle, I will send you a couple of \"proof\" images to be sure that you like the design. I can also add 3D flowers and/or jewels at no extra charge. Please inquire if you are interested in these items, for color choices and information. \r\n\r\nWhen you order, please be sure to choose color or b&w in the options below. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions at all, please do not hesistate to contact me!

Candle images can be designed in color, or black & white.\r\n\r\nAfter you order your candle(s), I will send you an email to collect the information, text, photos, etc. Before I create your candle, I will send you a couple of \"proof\" images to be sure that you like the design. I can also add 3D flowers and/or jewels at no extra charge.
