It's furious. It's uncompromising. It's punk rock laced with hardcore tinges and a hint of late 80's gutter. It's the type of music you see described as \"punk 'n' roll\" on gig flyers. And it's what THIS DRAMA does best. One part conventional instrumentation and one part spaztastic attack, a battling theme of familiarity and surprise propel this red hot set of four new songs with roaring rock riffs, pummeling drums, jarring tempo shifts, a palette of powerchords and venom-spitting vocals. Although the band hails from the Canary Islands, make no mistake...these aren't sunshine-soaked tourist tunes. Produced by ex-The Ghost Of A Thousand guitarist Jag Jago, who is known for his work with The Maccabees, Your Demise, Mastodon as well as his expertise at capturing ferocity in the studio, The Wasted Youth is a relentless, explosive, mouth-watering assault of punk meets rock n' roll. This Drama lays it all out there and yet again, the payoff is huge.","options":[{"id":30829402,"name":"Digipak CD","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":41275470,"name":"7\" Clear with Black Haze Vinyl","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96811192/-/thisdrama_thewastedyouth.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96811192/-/thisdrama_thewastedyouth.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":313694,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":313696,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":2664608,"name":"This Drama \"Tarantula Mata\" - CD / 10\" White Vinyl","permalink":"this-drama-tarantula-mata","position":2,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/this-drama-tarantula-mata","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-07-21T03:30:04.000Z","description":"THIS DRAMA hails from the Canary Islands, but these aren't sunshine-soaked tourist tunes. Produced by The Bronx guitarist Joby Ford, who is known for his proficiency at translating ferocity to tape, Tarantula Mata (\"Tarantula Kills\") is a relentless yet slitheringly seductive presentation of pure punk rock. Glorious. Furious. Uncompromising. Laced with hardcore tinges and a hint of late 80's gutter, it's the type of music you see described as Punk 'n' Roll on gig flyers. And this is what This Drama do. One part conventional instrumentation and one part spaztastic attack, a dual theme of familiarity and surprise propel this red hot set of seven songs with a distinctive blend of Spanish and English lyrics. \"Obsessively influenced by the spirit and the brawn of early SoCal punk rock scene, we've delivered a high-energy album fueled by urgency and intensity that feels, sounds and smells just like THIS DRAMA should\" says lead vocalist Asdrubal Marichal. He adds \"this is the first time we've introduced Spanish words to our songs, resulting in a unique blend of lyrics that really helps define our sound.\" With roaring rock riffs, pummeling drums, jarring tempo shifts, a palette of powerchords and venom-spitting vocals, This Drama lays it all out there and the payoff is huge.

This Drama  isn't an exception. This Drama is forged with a sense of urgency, immediacy...incubated and neutered with losers pride, with excess, with irony, hate and needs. Tired of the general attitude of the industry, of routine in rock and the pathetic passion for the mainstream, This Drama decided to make a clean break from effects and technical obsession in favor of emotions, intensity, the live show, of freshness...of music. Punk, rock 'n roll, whatever-core...name it any way you want. This is music at its purest...and with no makeup. \"When we started the band, we spent the first year trying to find a direction far removed from our previous projects and the tired, boring, mainstream wannabe spanish music scene. The music flowed and after play-shows-to-death touring we finally found ourselves in our comfortable own way and excited with the evolution of our musical direction. It was a rebirth\" says vocalist Asdrubal Marichal. \"San Diego XIII is the name of the street where everything happens for us, where we rehearse, where the band was born and raised. The album embodies our musical direction perfectly, our inspiration (Southern California) and our influences...rising somewhere between our passion for the rage of the 80s American punk rock scene, our respect for the germ of 70s UK punk and our love for the worldwide underground music movement.\" The result: San Diego XIII is hot as fuck.","options":[{"id":1682386,"name":"CD","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3489460/-/PORTADAthisdramaKTC.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3489460/-/PORTADAthisdramaKTC.jpg","width":1000,"height":998}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":313694,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":423328,"name":"This Drama \"We Rock, You Don't\" - 7\" Clear Purple Vinyl","permalink":"we-rock-you-dont-7-inch","position":4,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/we-rock-you-dont-7-inch","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-10-11T19:43:01.000Z","description":"7\" Clear Purple Vinyl Debut EP","options":[{"id":1682381,"name":"7\" Clear Purple Vinyl","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25197501/-/thisdrama_werockyoudont.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25197501/-/thisdrama_werockyoudont.jpg","width":991,"height":987}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":313696,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":9874768,"name":"This Drama Buttons Pack","permalink":"this-drama-buttons-pack","position":5,"price":2.0,"default_price":2.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/this-drama-buttons-pack","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-12T07:16:05.000Z","description":"Pack of 3 buttons","options":[{"id":30890596,"name":"Default","price":2.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/97520359/-/photo.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/97520359/-/photo.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":313695,"name":"Misc","permalink":"misc","url":"/category/misc"}]}]
