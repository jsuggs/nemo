It's stacked with a Swarovski-set rondelle and small vintage bead of rare 'angel-skin' coral. I recalled the sea by using Cathy Lanzl's art bead cast from the texture of a sea urchin's shell. That texture is echoed in turn with a filigree tube bead studded at either end with a peachy crystal.  \r\nI created an original component by threading vintage French metal sequins with iridescent matte Delica seed beads onto sterling wire, then coiling that around a large pink crystal to achieve texture, interest and subtle sparkle. An orange soda pop cap bead pairs with vintage pink glass to boldly state: Sun, Pink. It's tempered by a soft pink crystal cube, given motion by a tassel of tiny, intensely orange carnelian.
