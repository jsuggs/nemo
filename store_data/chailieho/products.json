One night, she selected the ideal location to start sketching the glamorous Eiffel Tower. As she began to lose herself in her art, she heard someone say, “Amazing! Your art portrays the Eiffel Tower like my photography does. Can I join you?”. It was a man who was carrying an antique camera. He introduced himself as well as his invaluable box camera which was given to him by his great grandfather. The photographer and Ella turned out to have a lot common, they both liked to explore and capture beauty in the world. Time passed swiftly and Ella had not realized that they had spent hours talking. Although they had just met, they were kindred spirits. Every moment of their time together was captured like a photograph in the depths of their hearts. The photographer proposed that they travel around the world together. “I would like to make endless possibilities and promises with you just because of who you are. No matter what may come tomorrow, my life is more fruitful today because of you.”…","options":[{"id":22410905,"name":"Paris Print Long Scarf","price":118.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13028058,"name":"Paris Print Shawl","price":189.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":22410907,"name":"Paris Print Pocket Square","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":18,"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HK"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69469513/-/w01-4_Paris.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69469513/-/w01-4_Paris.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38211596/-/Paris_Scarf_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38211596/-/Paris_Scarf_3.jpg","width":429,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3623703,"name":"scarf","permalink":"scarf","url":"/category/scarf"}]},{"id":3914408,"name":"Provence Print Silk Scarf ","permalink":"lavender-fields-scarf","position":3,"price":118.0,"default_price":118.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lavender-fields-scarf","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-06-13T14:11:15.000Z","description":"100% Silk Satin \r\n\r\nSize: Long Scarf 35 cm x 180 cm\r\n        Shawl 100 cm x 180 cm \r\n        Pocket Square 35 cm x 35 cm\r\n\r\nIt occurred in the gorgeous lavender fields next to a catholic marble church. Ella was apt at watercolor painting; especially the realistic painting of nature, which she felt allowed her to hear the sweet sounds of it. All her paintings reflected the unique experience of an individual. Ella picked up a brush and started to immerse herself in her wonderful world. She shuddered in the light breeze that crept through her hair. The beauty of the view and the calming aroma of lavender made her feel as if everything was so peaceful, so perfect. At the exact moment she finished drawing the light-brown church, the stillness in the cottage was no more. Suddenly, someone tapped her shoulder and Ella turned back inquisitively. A man holding a long, flat, quill pen fell into her gaze. She was about to greet him but the man interrupted her and started to say,“… My angel who glides across the ground, would you mind receiving this poem that I wrote for you?”. Ella nodded lightly, took the poem and put it into her sketch book – where it would remain for life…","options":[{"id":22389139,"name":"Provence Print Long Scarf","price":118.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13028052,"name":"Provence Print Shawl","price":189.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":22389141,"name":"Provence Print Pocket Square ","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":18,"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HK"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69472243/-/w01-1_lavender.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69472243/-/w01-1_lavender.jpg","width":741,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38211428/-/Lavender_Fields_Scarf_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38211428/-/Lavender_Fields_Scarf_3.jpg","width":429,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3623703,"name":"scarf","permalink":"scarf","url":"/category/scarf"}]},{"id":3914394,"name":"Venice Print Silk Scarf","permalink":"venice-scarf","position":4,"price":118.0,"default_price":118.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/venice-scarf","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-06-13T14:07:17.000Z","description":"100% Silk Satin \r\n\r\nSize: Long Scarf: 35 cm x 180 cm\r\n        Shawl  100 cm x 180 cm \r\n        Pocket Square 35 cm x 35 cm\r\n\r\n\r\nVenice is one of the world’s greatest cities of art. Ella wished to ride a gondola and she found one that would allow her to cruise along the Venetian waterfront between the Piazza San Marco and the Public Gardens. As she was boarding the gondola, she accidentally fell into the water. A gondolier reached out his hand, trying to grab her arms to pull her up from the lake. She failed to catch his hands and so the gondolier swooped down from the gondola to save her. They reached shore completely soaked. The gondolier, enchanted by Ella’s presence, offered her a free gondola ride. They dried their clothes and started a nightlong journey of cruising up and down the canals. The Gondolier’s bushy eyebrows and silky hair were attractive as was his voice. He was a great singer who sang his heart out to Ella that night. After the romantic journey, she realized that Venice was not only a busy city but a magical one at that. “When you are with me, time comes to a halt,” the Gondolier said. He gave her a bouquet of gorgeous roses to thank her for their time together…","options":[{"id":13028026,"name":"Venice Print Shawl","price":189.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":22388773,"name":"Venice Print Pocket Square ","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":22388775,"name":"Venice Print Long Scarf ","price":118.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":18,"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HK"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69395419/-/w01-2_Venice.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69395419/-/w01-2_Venice.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38211276/-/Venice_Scarf_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38211276/-/Venice_Scarf_3.jpg","width":429,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3623703,"name":"scarf","permalink":"scarf","url":"/category/scarf"}]},{"id":7082137,"name":"Big Crack Print Silk Scarf","permalink":"big-crack-print-silk-scarf","position":5,"price":118.0,"default_price":118.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/big-crack-print-silk-scarf","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-28T07:57:07.000Z","description":"100% Silk Satin\r\n\r\nSize: Long Scarf: 35 cm x 180 cm \r\nShawl 100 cm x 180 cm \r\nPocket Square 35 cm x 35 cm\r\n\r\nChailie designed this collection for Isabel to wear to the coalmine parties.

She treasured the sophistication, the rapid pace and how it was a necessity to dress up before leaving the house, she had almost everything, except love. Up until she met a boy- a coal miner at a train station en route to the countryside. They held different values yet they tumbled heart first into a love-crazed idyllic relationship, tripping over their declarations of love. Within a few weeks, she found herself packing up her life in the city to move to the coal-mining town with this boy. Despite the hard rocks and stones in the coalmine, their hearts were filled with delicate love for each other, and everyday was as beautiful as crystals.","options":[{"id":22411305,"name":"Crystal Print Long Scarf","price":118.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":22411307,"name":"Crystal Print Shawl","price":189.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":22411309,"name":"Crystal Print Pocket Square","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":18,"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HK"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69471467/-/w02-1_Crystal.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69471467/-/w02-1_Crystal.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69471547/-/42530e_613f9a61c2208070249f25709e7342a3.jpg_srz_310_400_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srz.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69471547/-/42530e_613f9a61c2208070249f25709e7342a3.jpg_srz_310_400_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srz.jpeg","width":310,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3623703,"name":"scarf","permalink":"scarf","url":"/category/scarf"}]},{"id":7082095,"name":"Small Crack Print Silk Scarf","permalink":"small-crack-print-silk-scarf","position":7,"price":118.0,"default_price":118.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/small-crack-print-silk-scarf","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-28T07:51:52.000Z","description":"100% Silk Georgette\r\n\r\nSize: Long Scarf: 35 cm x 180 cm \r\nShawl 100 cm x 180 cm \r\nPocket Square 35 cm x 35 cm\r\n\r\nWhen Isabel arrived, the town was filled with the dreadful spirit of the workers.

Yet, all other miners wore their shoddiest clothes to work and were generally unconcerned about enjoying life. Isabel decided to host a weekly party in the mines to revitalize the townspeople. At each party, inspired by the minerals and cracks, Isabel would always wear this stunning scarf that moved gracefully as she danced.

So she set off for the peaceful and blossom-covered green hills spotted with sheep, country hamlets and dairies. Her excitement drove her to climb one hill after another, until Ella discovered that she was lost in the middle of nowhere. At this miserable moment, an young shepherd with intense yet subtle grey eyes passed her way. Helplessly, she reached out to him so he could be her guide. A crowd of sheep gathering around allowed them to move as a single entity until they moved on to a dairy farm owned by the young shepherd. After the lovely tour of the farm, the sky had become tinged with purples, pinks and fiery reds. They sat on the marsh grass and enjoyed the sunset. The shepherd closed his eyes and said: “Whether we talk about everything or don’t talk at all, I feel comfortable with you”. Ella could hardly pull her eyes away from his face to turn and look at the stars.Chailie designed this collection for Isabel to wear to the coalmine parties. Isabel is a fun-loving, amorous and fashionable woman who turns the darkness of the coalmine into a brighter place. She moved to the town because she followed her heart. Isabel remains true to city girl self by dressing accordingly, despite working in the coalmines.  In spite of uprooting herself, through an amalgamation of love and fashion, Isabel is able to remain jovial. Armed with a few essential elements in life, especially love, one can always generate contentment during difficult times.","options":[{"id":13028034,"name":"Emmental Print Long Scarf","price":118.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":22410981,"name":"Emmental Print Shawl","price":189.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":22410983,"name":"Emmental Print Pocket Square","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":18,"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HK"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69470003/-/w01-3_Emmental.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69470003/-/w01-3_Emmental.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69470139/-/42530e_63ec00da674f7ed6e386b0f01a7e836c.jpg_srz_315_516_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srz.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69470139/-/42530e_63ec00da674f7ed6e386b0f01a7e836c.jpg_srz_315_516_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srz.jpeg","width":315,"height":516}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3623703,"name":"scarf","permalink":"scarf","url":"/category/scarf"}]},{"id":15081060,"name":"Fur Bracelet ( Fuchsia )","permalink":"fur-bracelet-fuchsia","position":11,"price":32.0,"default_price":32.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fur-bracelet-fuchsia","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-25T04:20:06.000Z","description":"Rabbit Fur Bracelet\r\n\r\nFur is considered to have been one of the first materials used for clothing.
