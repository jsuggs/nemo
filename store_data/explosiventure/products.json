In the Barbarian Survivor is neatly fit a tough tool steel knife; a P-38 military style can opener; a stainless steel inspirational dog tag; at least 12 feet of 550 lb test parachute cord. All of this fit onto a comfortable and durable wrist cuff and secured with a side release buckle.\r\n\r\nSelect the size you want the bracelet to be. I suggest a little larger than your wrist for a comfortable fit.\r\n\r\nThe P-38 and knife are both easily and quickly usable without having to disassemble your cuff.\r\n\r\nThe inscription on the dog tag reads \"Drop your torch and fear not the darkness\". Custom dog tags are available. Please contact me for more information on personalized inscriptions.\r\n\r\nIf you do find yourself in a bad situation, and the parachute cord is needed, simply cut the melted section off and unravel. You'll notice the knife has notches on the base. These allow secure lashing to a handle if you ever need to disassemble the bracelet. Doing this makes the knife much easier to use when you need it most.\r\n\r\nEach bracelet is made to order and high standards. Please allow 3 - 5 business days to ship.
