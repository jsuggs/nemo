The story begins with her Hitler Youth grandfather Erich - obsessed with his radio and the music of Mendelssohn, and goes on to show how her own parents overcame cultural and language difficulties to prove nothing is 'forbidden' where love is involved.\r\n\r\n‘Love looks Away’ won the prestigious ICOM award in 2008 as the best Independent German comic.\r\nLine Hoven is an illustrator and comic artist; she uses a highly meticulous scratchboard method - using black card and scratching out contrasting white lines, surface areas and filigree textures. The book has been translated into Italian, this will be it’s first appearance in English. Love Looks Away is the author’s first book; she lives and works in Hamburg.\r\n\r\n“Again and again one discovers fine nuances in both content and aesthetics and these compound to make this comic book one of the most interesting German-speaking comic book publication of recent years.” Matthias Schneider, Goethe-Institut Stockholm.\r\n\r\n“Love Looks Away', Line Hoven's first full length comic, is a delight not only because of the powerful, scratchboard images she's created. The side stepping story of her own American/German family proves the art of the 30 year old's storytelling. A true discovery.” Matthias Schmidt, Stern Magazine.","options":[{"id":49109931,"name":"Default","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128278623/-/LoveLooks-cover.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128278623/-/LoveLooks-cover.png","width":1436,"height":1605}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1629900,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":15115761,"name":"Kochi Wanaba","permalink":"kochi-wanaba","position":2,"price":14.99,"default_price":14.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kochi-wanaba","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-26T14:27:28.000Z","description":"Kochi Wanaba is a quiet kid who loves nothing more than to draw secrets in his sketchbook.

Unable to drive - and with her deranged neighbour offering no help whatsoever – how on Earth can she get Cruncher’s body across town to the vet’s to take care of before the family returns? And then she has an idea….\r\n\r\nAnd so the journey of the suitcase and its strange contents begins.\r\n\r\nIn his debut graphic novel, Dan Berry uncovers the delirium that lurks beneath suburban life.

Will Cruncher make it to the vet’s? Can one man succeed in his top-secret mission to sneak his neighbour’s dead rabbit back into its hutch?

In this first volume East walks from his Manchester home out and into England recording the landscape, the architecture, flora, fauna and the thing he’s walking away from in the first place.”\r\n\r\nBy far the most personal of Ollie East’s works, this book cov- ers the changes brought about by the birth of his first child and the impact of the difficult birth on both himself and his wife Claire. At times painfully honest, always deeply felt and human, it’s another step along the path to becoming one of comics’ true originals.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“Oliver East’s perambulating comics are thoroughly unique and Swear Down is his best yet”\r\n- John Porcellino, creator of King-Cat Comics and Stories\r\n\r\n“Technically inventive with formal sleights of hand, this is a rare type of comic book that reads like a poem.

It’s avid photographer Danny’s last summer in his home town before he heads off to Glasgow and to college. But before he leaves the ailing fishing community he has a long week in prospect on board his dad’s fishing boat, The Silver Darling.\r\n\r\nUninspired by the family business and with a head full of modern ideas, Danny decides to challenge the crew’s superstitions and bring ‘a spirit of enlightenment’ to his week at sea. But by taking aboard a strictly forbidden cargo, Danny gets more than he bargained for and learns a few lessons of his own.\r\n\r\nWriter and artist Will Morris revisits an industry in decline to create a story that’s as much a coming-of-age tale as it is a tribute to Ayrshire’s historic fishing community. Packed with humour, pathos and rendered in Morris’ beautifully atmospheric ink-washed art, The Silver Darlings is an unmissable debut graphic novel from one of UK comic’s fastest-rising stars.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPraise for Will Morris & The Silver Darlings\r\n\r\n“Will Morris sculpts a world of wild, glittering seas and inner turmoil from delicate watercolour, expressive lines and sparse, potent words. You can practically smell the sea salt on his drawings. Superstition, luck – it’s all in the mind, isn’t it? The Silver Darlings makes irrational beliefs as tangible as waves, as biting as storm spray in your face.

Comes with an exclusive \"Fear & Loathing\" bookplate signed by the author while stocks last.</strong>\r\n\r\nEighteen years after Hugo Tate drew to a close within the pages of Deadline, publisher Blank Slate is collecting the comic’s celebrated entire six-year run in a single graphic novel for the first time ever.\r\n\r\nRunning in the influential music and comics magazine between 1988 and 1994, Hugo Tate appeared alongside titles such as Jamie Hewlett and Alan Martin’s Tank Girl and Philip Bond's Wired World. One of the most vital and important eras of UK comics, Hugo was an integral part of a wave of work that redefined the potential of the form for a generation of readers.\r\n\r\nBeginning as an acerbic humour strip featuring a stick man protagonist in a figuratively drawn world, Hugo Tate evolved into an intelligent look into the lives of a complex web of characters. Described by The Comics Journal as “Britain’s _Love and Rockets_“, Hugo's world stretched from London to New York and beyond and examining themes of friendship, family, relationships, depression, self-discovery and Generation X malaise.\r\n\r\nCollected in its entirety for the first time, this graphic novel brings together every page of the story and includes over 60 pages of never-before reprinted work. Also included is the critically-acclaimed final story arc O, America!, in which Hugo finds himself on a drug-fuelled road trip across the nightmarish underbelly of the United States. Featuring a gallery of rare extras, all-new commentary from Abadzis and Deadline editor Frank Wynne, as well as a special introduction by Garth Ennis (Preacher, Hellblazer), there’s never been a better time to read – or revisit – this genuine classic of British comics.\r\n\r\n<strong>ISBN 978-1-906653-26-2 | 192 pages | 217 x 216mm softcover with flaps, b&w | 192 pages | £14.99</strong>","options":[{"id":17943339,"name":"Default","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54729801/-/3D-Book-Model---Hugo.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54729801/-/3D-Book-Model---Hugo.jpg","width":410,"height":510},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54729695/-/hugotate1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54729695/-/hugotate1.jpg","width":793,"height":443},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54729713/-/hugotate2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54729713/-/hugotate2.jpg","width":793,"height":443},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54729721/-/hugotate3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54729721/-/hugotate3.jpg","width":793,"height":443},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54736185/-/TINTIN72.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54736185/-/TINTIN72.jpg","width":382,"height":489}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1629900,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":4610039,"name":"Peepholes - Laurie J.

Proud peers into the worlds that lie behind closed doors—where everyday stuck-on smiles are shaken off to reveal the darkness and inner-yearnings they obscure.\r\n\r\nTen beautifully-crafted stories of the bizarre take us through somnambulant cities where businessmen walk up the sides of buildings, werewolves go to midnight screenings, love-struck hitmen are hired to kill their favourite movie starlets and literal towers of self-pity threaten to collapse at any moment. Veering in between dreams and nightmares, Proud’s oblique visions of urban and emotional chaos range from the darkly comical to bitingly poignant.\r\n\r\nCreated over a ten-year period whilst Proud worked professionally as an animator and storyboardist, Blank Slate now binds these stories together in a special 122-page hardcover presentation. Fans of creators such as Al Columbia and Ho Che Anderson will find a lot to love in work that’s captivating and unsettling in equal measure.

He works in a boring cubicle, in a boring office, surrounded by people that just ‘don’t get him’. However, as a regular listener to extreme conspiracy theorist Dick March's  podcasts, Noah has built a fully functional underground bunker in the event that a supposedly “safe” passing-meteor collides with the Earth.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for most of the population, the conspiracy believers are proven right. The lone survivor of the cosmic catastrophe, Noah emerges completely blasé to the fall-out and destruction around him. With barely a second thought, he settles into a new life without work, without the man, and—most importantly—days full of pursuing his true passion: drawing comics.\r\n\r\nSlowly growing sick of the monotony of being the supposed last man alive, Noah’s days of wine and irradiated roses grind to a halt when a mysterious female, Fatima, arrives on the scene. At first suspecting her to be a terrorist, a significant relationship blooms amongst the wreckage, forcing Noah, at long last, to genuinely connect with someone else.\r\n\r\n<strong>42 pages | B&W | 29x21cm with flaps | £5.99</strong>","options":[{"id":15606961,"name":"Default","price":5.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46826879/-/The-Survivalist-300dpi-22.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46826879/-/The-Survivalist-300dpi-22.jpg","width":700,"height":934},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46826687/-/Flick2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46826687/-/Flick2.jpg","width":1000,"height":671},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46826679/-/Flick1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46826679/-/Flick1.jpg","width":1000,"height":670}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2132998,"name":"Comics","permalink":"comics","url":"/category/comics"}]},{"id":4196391,"name":"Dinopopolous - Nick Edwards","permalink":"dinopopolous-nick-edwards","position":19,"price":5.99,"default_price":5.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dinopopolous-nick-edwards","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-08-03T17:00:09.000Z","description":"Jurassic Park’s got nothing on Nick Edwards astonishing solo debut: one part bande dessinée adventure, one part video-game homage, all parts dinosaur-inspired.\r\n\r\nNigel is your average 13-year-old boy from Chipton.

Oh yeah, and he spends most of his time solving mysteries with his best friend Brian… a dinosaur with twin-mounted laser cannons on his back, naturally.\r\n\r\nCalled into action by moustachioed madman Lancaster Perrifold, Nigel and Brian are launched into the hunt for The Miracle Bird of Ndundoo: a mythical jewel-excreting creature living deep below the planet’s crust.

Master DJ Osaka Best has disappeared, mysteriously vanishing in a flash of blinding light during the climax of his set at Robot Mitchum nightclub. Enter, Hector Umbra—Osaka’s best friend and artist-turned-detective—to solve the mystery of a lifetime.\r\n\r\n61 hours, seven packs of cigarettes and countless phone calls later, Hector springs into action, turning over every dirty stone in Munich on the hunt for the displaced DJ. It soon transpires that all is not as it seems, and our hard-boiled painterly protagonist finds himself embroiled in a plot involving religious freaks, villainous Elvis impersonators, aliens and even the dead themselves.\r\n\r\nThe first of German creator Uli Oesterle’s long-form works to appear in English, Hector Umbra combines sci-fi, occult, noir and clubland influences in one explosive narrative. With a visual style reminiscent of Mike Mignola, English-speaking readers of all varieties are sure to fall in love with Oesterle’s work.\r\n\r\n<strong>212 pp | Full-colour | Hardcover | ISBN 978-1-906653-16-3 | £18.99</strong>","options":[{"id":15562487,"name":"Default","price":18.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50239981/-/Hector-Umbra-web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50239981/-/Hector-Umbra-web.jpg","width":500,"height":713},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46664301/-/Screen_shot_2011-11-02_at_09.53.11.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46664301/-/Screen_shot_2011-11-02_at_09.53.11.png","width":679,"height":901},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46664317/-/Screen_shot_2011-11-02_at_09.54.14.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46664317/-/Screen_shot_2011-11-02_at_09.54.14.png","width":643,"height":880},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46664325/-/Screen_shot_2011-11-02_at_09.54.51.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46664325/-/Screen_shot_2011-11-02_at_09.54.51.png","width":637,"height":860},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46664437/-/Hector_Preview_1.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46664437/-/Hector_Preview_1.png","width":658,"height":886}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1629900,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":1741927,"name":"Hardcovers","permalink":"hardcovers","url":"/category/hardcovers"}]},{"id":4352631,"name":"Nelson - Limited Edition Hardcover","permalink":"nelson-hardcover-blank-slate-store-exclusive","position":21,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nelson-hardcover-blank-slate-store-exclusive","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-08-31T11:03:14.000Z","description":"BLANK SLATE STORE EXCLUSIVE\r\n\r\nNelson is a 250-page collaboration between 54 of the UK’s most exciting comic creators.

Also features mini-interviews with classic skateboarders Steve Steadham (of Bones Brigade fame) and Jeff Hedges.\r\n\r\nVisually-inspired by the board graphics that Ed still drools over to this day, My Skateboard Life stays true to skating’s punk roots with a zine-like presentation that’s both honest and celebratory. Illustrated in the distinctive high-impact black and white style that made him a star in the Manchester music poster scene, there’s no better way to relive falling in love with skateboarding all over again.\r\n\r\n<strong>ISBN 9781906653095\r\nSoftcover with flaps - 100 pages - B&W </strong>","options":[{"id":9597344,"name":"Default","price":8.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26374175/-/MSLcover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26374175/-/MSLcover.jpg","width":225,"height":323},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/45155645/-/2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/45155645/-/2.jpg","width":700,"height":996},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/45155653/-/3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/45155653/-/3.jpg","width":639,"height":886},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/45155661/-/4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/45155661/-/4.jpg","width":639,"height":886},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/45155669/-/5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/45155669/-/5.jpg","width":1000,"height":679}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1629900,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":3820618,"name":"The Accidental Salad - Joe Decie","permalink":"the-accidental-salad-joe-decie","position":25,"price":5.99,"default_price":5.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-accidental-salad-joe-decie","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-05-27T02:04:19.000Z","description":"Life seen through a lens of thought provoking absurdism.\r\n\r\nChalk Marks is Blank Slate’s new line allowing a large format space for new UK comic artists to produce their first commercial works.\r\n\r\nIn this first issue Joe Decie gives us his beautifully ink washed stories of the apparently everyday, with a twist in the tail.

A tragic symbol of misogynist violence, Cuidad Juárez has been the scene of hundreds of feminicidios —the abduction and brutal murders of female victims aged between 12 and 22.\r\n\r\nReferred to as 'Las Muertas de Juárez', many of these victims are found tortured, sexually abused, or disfigured - senseless atrocities that have caught international attention. With many of these cases still unresolved, some sources suggest the number of victims may even reach into the thousands.\r\n\r\nIt is in this harrowing real setting that we are introduced to Alma, a woman courageously attempting to escape her abusive gang-member fiancé. Following a violent altercation, she flees in the night, cementing her vow to never return by beginning a new relationship with a considerate stranger.\r\n\r\nIn this story of survival by any means necessary, <a href=\"http://www.blankslatebooks.co.uk/artist-profiles/peggy-adam/\">Peggy Adam</a> explores the complex issues surrounding the murders through the humanity of her characters. Truly a graphic novel of substance, <strong>Luchadoras</strong> asks the reader to consider where exactly the extents of morality lie in a corrupt society.\r\n\r\n<em>“Peggy Adam portrays her story with stylistic and narrative sobriety. The setting is very real, and we wouldn't have been  surprised if the story itself had had been too, as it is so accurately told…” </em>\r\n-Baptiste Gilleron, ActuaBD\r\n\r\n<strong> ISBN 9781906653125\r\nSoftcover with flaps - 97 pages - B&amp;W - Published April 2011\r\nSlate 11\r\n</strong>","options":[{"id":11571474,"name":"Default","price":12.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/33301000/-/Luchadoras-600pxw.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/33301000/-/Luchadoras-600pxw.jpg","width":600,"height":787},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/33301024/-/Luchadoras-pg13-600pxw.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/33301024/-/Luchadoras-pg13-600pxw.jpg","width":600,"height":807},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/33301032/-/Luchadoras-pg26-600pxw.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/33301032/-/Luchadoras-pg26-600pxw.jpg","width":600,"height":806}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1629900,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":2971721,"name":"The Girl And The Gorilla - Madeleine Flores","permalink":"the-girl-and-the-gorilla-madeleine-flores","position":29,"price":7.99,"default_price":7.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-girl-and-the-gorilla-madeleine-flores","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-12-03T16:43:17.000Z","description":"Aurelie is having a rough day.

Following on from his 'breakout' book Trains are...Mint  this book sees Oliver further adventuring out on walks from Manchester  until he reaches Liverpool, recording the many things that pass us by in  everyday life. Part travel book, part diary, Oliver manages to capture both the beauty and problems of this part of the country whilst passing  some social and political comment as he goes. Told in a series of  beautifully composed panels this is a step forward for the artist and  another leg up the path of critical acclaim for the new British comics.\r\n\r\nTrains are... Mint was nominated for the 2008 Ignatz award  (recognising outstanding achievement in comics and cartooning) and  Oliver was the cover and booklet artist on the Mercury award winning  Elbow album \"The Seldom Seen Kid\".\r\n\r\nWhat people are saying about Trains are...Mint and Oliver East:\r\n\r\n<em>\"Oliver East picks his readers out of their easy chairs and  makes them follow him on his modest travels, experiencing the world as he does, seeing what he sees, sharing with them in that unadorned,  curious voice. As long as he continues to ask me along I'm not sure I ever care if I figure it all out.\"</em>\r\n- Tom Spurgeon, The Comics Reporter\r\n\r\n<em>\"Sometimes a book just catches you perfectly; you fall into its  sweet spot and are overwhelmed by it. So it is with Trains Are…Mint.  It’s a spectacular success. Oliver East’s Trains are…Mint is one of  the most intriguing, complicated, difficult, strange and altogether  wonderful books I have  read in a long, long time. Yet when you attempt to describe it the first thing that comes to mind is to label it as a  simple travelogue. But East obviously loves what he’s doing, loves the simple pleasures of his walk and his time just observing and it shows on every glorious page.\"</em>\r\n- Richard Bruton, Forbidden Planet Blog\r\n\r\n<em>\"Oliver East walks. When he's done, he draws. In Trains  Are...Mint, he walks  and draws  Manchester to Blackpool along the train tracks. It all seems terribly English and quite refreshing. East  contributes walking not as a rural idyll, but a meditation on the other side of the tracks. He focuses on train stations and apartment blocks, trash-strewn alleys and  scrawled  graffiti. The results are oblique and intoxicating.\"</em>\r\n- Bill Randall, The Comics Journal\r\n\r\nISBN 9781906653026\r\nHardback - 172 pages - Colour - Published May 2009\r\nSlate 3","options":[{"id":10262501,"name":"Default","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/28813553/-/PGWHcover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/28813553/-/PGWHcover.jpg","width":452,"height":650}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1629900,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":1741927,"name":"Hardcovers","permalink":"hardcovers","url":"/category/hardcovers"}]},{"id":2731944,"name":"We Can Still Be Friends - Mawil","permalink":"we-can-still-be-friends-mawil","position":37,"price":7.99,"default_price":7.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/we-can-still-be-friends-mawil","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-09-03T15:31:23.000Z","description":"Berlin-based cartoonist Markus Witzel, who goes by the pen name of Mawil, has established a reputation in Europe for his cataloging of the awkwardness of relationships, especially with the opposite sex, but always with some terrific humour throughout, earning him an Icom Prize in 1998 and an international reputation among the comics community.

This is his first large collection of his work.\r\n\r\n<em>“Oliver East has produced one of the most unique works to come out of the UK small press scene and one that I believe has a chance of crossing over to a much wider audience. His comic forgoes word balloons and the text and speech is all written in Oliver’s own longhand superimposed upon the images. Essentially this is a diary of walks along the train tracks between Manchester and Blackpool in the northwest of England.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>The story is told in deceptively simple watercolours that many will see as childlike (somewhat like the work of a young John Porcellino) although in fact they convey not only the narrative but also the spontaneity of sketches - which seems highly appropriate to a diary. It also serves as eyewitness to what modern Britain is like behind the tourist posters, showing the everyday lives of small towns and people, and the often deep drabness at their center, it reminds me in feel of the films of Shane Meadows.”</em>\r\n- Kenny Penman, director Forbidden Planet International and publisher of Blank Slate Books.\r\n\r\n<em>“On the Road becomes On the Track as Oliver tramps, traipses, strolls and slogs from station to station… A unique use of comics, almost a time capsule of the unrecorded, everyday provinces,”</em>\r\n- Paul Gravett, organiser of the ICA Comics festival and author of numerous books including Great British Comics.\r\n\r\nHardcover - 122 pages - Colour - Published May 2008\r\nSlate 1","options":[{"id":10262481,"name":"Default","price":12.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/28813457/-/TAMcover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/28813457/-/TAMcover.jpg","width":484,"height":650}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1629900,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":1741927,"name":"Hardcovers","permalink":"hardcovers","url":"/category/hardcovers"}]}]
