With a nice, warm peppermint scent. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you don't want glossy hair and are ready to pay a bit more the Uppercut Matt Clay is the right choice for you. The \"Uppercut Matt Clay Pomade\" is a modern classic pomade on petrolatum base. It was formulated and tested by barbers and is suitable for all hair types and hairstyles. The tin can with a very nice sporty design is an eye catcher anyway.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nConsistency and fragrance\r\nThe Uppercut Matt Clay is a field-gray pomade with a warm undertone. It has a heavy weight consistency. Once you have managed to dig a little pomade, the pomade and feels like soft plastic on your finger. But it is not as sticky as a DAX or Murray's, but more dry. The pomade can be rubbed quite well rub between your hands and worked into the hair. Surprisingly enough already a little pomade achieves a very nice effect. The scent is one of the freshest: a really pleasant peppermint scent with a touch of vanilla. And in fact the Uppercut Matt Clay contains real peppermint oil. As in the 1930's mineral oil and lanolin keeps hair and scalp in a good condition. Only a bit chemistry might spoil this gray pomade. But this price of modernity will surely please fans of the dry hair look..\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe effect\r\nWith Uppercut Matt Clay your hair will get dull as mud - not a hint of shine. This effect ensures the contained clay (kaolin). The Uppercut Matt Clay is suitable for all firm classical and messy modern hair styles. The hold is firm, and if you already have a soft pomade or a hair tonic in your hair the Uppercut Matt Clay ads a very nice hold to your hair.\r\nThe Uppercut Matt Clay is quite easy to wash out. But you will get a nice effect when you leavy the pomade in your hair over night: on the next morning the hair looks thicker and all you need is just combing through a bit or fresh it up with a hair tonic, like the Jeris or Lucky Tiger Hair Tonic.\r\n\r\nApplication: Apply pomade with dry hands into dry hair. Then comb or shape with his hands.
