Extremely RARE release documenting the graffiti career of Cope2. Thousands of photos including productions long gone as well as a nice amount of illegal subways. \r\n\r\nPress Release-\r\n\r\nCope 2 has lived his whole life in the Bronx, in the public housing projects on the opposite end of the earth from Wall Street in Manhattan. He came to graffiti like everyone else in those days, at the age when young men and women begin to explore the urban labyrinth where we all live.\r\nColoring outside society’s lines\r\nThe subway system, the main way people get around in New York, was appropriated by youth who made it into their medium of expression. Their intention was never to make it stop operating, running and carrying passengers from point A to point B. They needed the trains to run. Their goal was to be the very best at what they were doing, and to that end they established a social and cultural mechanism that was unsanctioned by the authorities. The train system, especially the “el” (elevated) lines in the ghettos and working class areas, put their language into circulation.\r\nGraffiti is a mode of visual expression, and what better way to take it public than putting it directly on trains? That was the idea for a number of years. Young people write their names on subway cars and covered them with images from top to bottom. The city was caught in a serious economic recession and could not stop this movement from spreading over every paintable surface in town.\r\nCope 2, a living legend\r\nCope 2 never really put down his spray cans for something else. Along with many other people he was very active in the 1990s, taking graffiti to new media such as city walls. Bringing together many local and foreign writers, he came to be called the “ambassador” for New York graffiti because he was so good at organizing collective projects, as this book bears witness to. Graffiti motivated him to develop friendships and work with people from the four corners of the world who came to New York just to paint. A documentary about him released in 1999 shows that it was still possible to paint New York trains despite the media hype that claimed that subway graffiti had been dead for a decade. You can also see how painting in the street and doing permission pieces can eliminate the risk factor from the equation. In this way writers have been doing work that is increasingly large format but no less urban.\r\nThe authorities see him as a ringleader of a movement they have never really been able to wipe out despite their claims. They’ve tried to make an example of him, applying their usual tactic of trying to single out certain people. The city of New York has pressed major charges against him twice. Both times he came out of the courthouse with not much more than scratches, thanks to the tireless defense of an attorney.\r\nOut of the sum total of photos in this book, at most two percent are still visible as this first edition goes to press.\r\n\r\n272 Pages - Hardcover\r\nRighters Publishing\r\nColor photographs and text\r\n12\" x 8.5\" ","options":[{"id":20284083,"name":"Default","price":300.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":24.0,"amount_with_others":12.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/62709159/-/_MG_3712.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/62709159/-/_MG_3712.jpg","width":717,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/62709183/-/_MG_3713.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/62709183/-/_MG_3713.jpg","width":1000,"height":704},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/62709231/-/_MG_3714.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/62709231/-/_MG_3714.jpg","width":1000,"height":728}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3271325,"name":"Graffiti Books","permalink":"graffiti-books","url":"/category/graffiti-books"}]},{"id":6366917,"name":"*Signed* SEEN On The Run Blackbooks Magazine Book GOLD Edition 1/200","permalink":"signed-seen-on-the-run-magazine-book-gold-edition-1-200","position":13,"price":300.0,"default_price":300.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/signed-seen-on-the-run-magazine-book-gold-edition-1-200","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-05T03:36:56.000Z","description":"A very rare signed copy of  On The Run Blackbooks Vol. 3 - SEEN \r\nThe Limited Gold edition cover. *Signed* by Seen with silver paint marker on the cover.

He saw BIG-O 116, EVIL ERF 14, RAT FINK 131, SUPER KOOL 223 written on the walls. In the beginning he thought of them as strange ideograms but he was even more fascinated to find out that the inscriptions were actually names. He decided to archive this phenomenon by taking pictures and to make it the subject of the thesis for his degree on Literature. He got in touch with many cliques of writers that open him the doors of New York. Big names, as COCO 144, were his guide. Graffiti a New York by Andrea Nelli is the re-edition of one of first books about Graffiti Writing, published for the first time in 1978. This book conserves the original text, precious and rare document of an unthinkable research for that period. It contributes to the historical memory of Graffiti Writing with amazing pictures about the styles and the first tags of Manhattan Heights. More than 100 pictures of Names and historical pieces photographed by Andrea Nelli accompany the text, true in the form and in the content.\r\nGraffiti a New York is a true witness about Graffiti phenomenon in his early years of birth.","options":[{"id":24707556,"name":"Default","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76896456/-/PF-5800.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76896456/-/PF-5800.jpg","width":723,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76896489/-/PF-5801.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76896489/-/PF-5801.jpg","width":1000,"height":736},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76896504/-/PF-5802.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76896504/-/PF-5802.jpg","width":1000,"height":744},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76896528/-/PF-5803.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76896528/-/PF-5803.jpg","width":1000,"height":796}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3271325,"name":"Graffiti Books","permalink":"graffiti-books","url":"/category/graffiti-books"}]},{"id":6356935,"name":"Aerosol Kingdom: Subway Painters of New York City 2002 Paperback","permalink":"aerosol-kingdom-subway-painters-of-new-york-city-2002-paperback","position":16,"price":65.0,"default_price":65.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/aerosol-kingdom-subway-painters-of-new-york-city-2002-paperback","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-06-04T04:05:36.000Z","description":"Ivor Miller\r\n2002 Printing\r\n218 pages Soft Cover\r\n11\" x 8\" \r\n\r\n\"Aerosol Kingdom documents the careers of the graffiteros and records the reflections of many key figures in the movement.

The first part of the research analyzes how graffiti in media such as movies, videos, magazines, and books from New York influenced Europe. When images of the New York subway arrived in London, Paris, Munich, and Amsterdam, a huge milestone was set: A first generation of European graffiti writers started to follow the letters, the method, the techniques, and the general lifestyle of New York in the '70s.\r\n\r\nThe book, a massive volume of more than 400 pages, has been conceived as an imaginary newspaper. The chronicles it contains have not been penned by real journalists or narrators but by people who define themselves as 'writers.' In this volume, a chorus of uncensored voices in the first person reveal their knowledge of European cities, their infrastructures, interstices, and neighborhoods. This is the generation who, in the last two decades of the 20th Century, imported the countercultural phenomenon from New York commonly known as 'Graffiti.'\r\n\r\nAt the outset, the obsessive repetition of a tag and the search for urban fame became a widespread and spontaneous act, an infinite ego trip that was rarely dissociated from the reproduction of the chosen letters. In these pages, European writers abandon the compulsive act of tagging for a moment, to narrate the city and cast a personal eye—not always detached—on the trains, the streets, and the urban surroundings that common citizens generally cannot or will not acknowledge. The chapters that compose this book focus on special themes, comparable to the sections of a daily newspaper, presented here as special reports on the New York subway, the European network, or the first urban strongholds.\r\n\r\nThe combination of these elements, including, among others, a detailed, in-depth description of the phenomenon's explosion in Italy during the '90s, provides a unique history of the variety of pathways they explored and documents the desires of an entire generation intent on describing and interpreting their cultural movement. Through historic and detailed documentation deriving from a singular urban episode, the New York City Subway, ALL CITY WRITERS wants to investigate the evolution and the consequences of a countercultural phenomenon, which in the last decades has provoked a change in the rules of aesthetics and communication in modern day society.\r\n\r\n**The book is very large and heavy so forgive the high shipping on international orders.

The name was a line and the line begat the Mark.

Hard to find Import.\r\n\r\nUrban centres such as Barcelona, Paris and Berlin are places whose landscapes are characterised by anonymously created artwork and  signatures that are inventing new visual codes. This street art is much more than mere graffiti.\r\n\r\nIn addition to using spray paint, today s enterprising urban artists use stencils, wheat paste and found objects to manifest their ideas. They work in an interdisciplinary way and are often creative nomads travelling and working their way through cities around the world.\r\n\r\nBerlin is a particularly strong magnet for international street artists, inviting them to leave their mark. But the impressions that they leave are inevitably fleeting as their art falls victim to the city s unrelenting development. Luckily, editor and street artist Jürgen Grosse has worked with Michael Bonk for years to track and archive Berlin s urban art.\r\n\r\nUrban Art Photography presents artwork from Berlin that communicates with its environment in a subversive way. Successfully capturing this interplay, the book serves as a permanent documentation and time capsule of these constantly changing images.\r\n\r\nThe creative process and constant development of the pieces through interventions by other street artists are vividly depicted in Urban Art Photography.

This dark, democratic environment provided the setting for photographer Bruce Davidson's first extensive series in color, originally published in 1986. In it, subway riders are set against a gritty, graffiti-strewn background, displayed in tones Davidson described as \"an iridescence like what I had seen in photographs of deep-sea fish.\" Never before had the subway been portrayed in such detail, revealing the interplay of its inner landscape and outer vistas. The images include lovers, commuters, tourists, families, and the homeless. From weary strap hangers to languorous ladies in summer dresses to stalking predators, Davidson's compassionate vision illuminates the stubborn survival of humanity. From the spring of 1980 to 1985, Davidson explored and shot 600 miles of subway tracks. In his own words, he \"wanted to transform this subway from its dark, degrading, and impersonal reality into images that open up our experience again to the color, sensuality, and vitality of the individual souls that ride it each day.\" Now nearly 25 years later, and on the eve of the subway's 100th anniversary, St. Ann's Press is publishing a new edition of Davidson's classic book. This edition adds 43 unseen images to the original book, and includes an introduction by Arthur Ollman of the Museum of Photographic Art in San Diego, and a foreword by Fred Braithwaite (aka Fab Five Freddy), the original graffiti artist. It also includes Bruce Davidson and Henry Geldzahler's original essays.","options":[{"id":24633957,"name":"Default","price":325.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76669308/-/PRF-5714.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76669308/-/PRF-5714.jpg","width":1000,"height":814},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76669344/-/PRF-5715.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76669344/-/PRF-5715.jpg","width":1000,"height":847}],"artists":[{"id":148896,"name":"Bruce Davidson","permalink":"bruce-davidson","url":"/artist/bruce-davidson"}],"categories":[{"id":3890178,"name":"Photography Books","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":7755600,"name":"SUBWAY- Bruce Davidson SIGNED Aperture Edition","permalink":"subway-bruce-davidson-signed-aperture-edition","position":55,"price":200.0,"default_price":200.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/subway-bruce-davidson-signed-aperture-edition","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-30T21:49:41.000Z","description":"124 page \r\nHardcover - 11.6\" x 11.8\" \r\nAperture- 3rd & FINAL Edition \r\n\r\nSIGNED by Davidson on title page.

Flawless copy.\r\n\r\nBruce Davidson's groundbreaking Subway, first published by Aperture in 1986, has garnered critical acclaim both as a documentation of a unique moment in the cultural fabric of New York City and for its phenomenal use of extremes of color and shadow set against flash-lit\r\nskin. In Davidson's own words, the people in the subway, their flesh juxtaposed against the graffiti, the penetrating effect of the strobe light itself, and even the hollow darkness of the tunnels, inspired an aesthetic that goes unnoticed by passengers who are trapped underground, hiding behind masks and closed off from each other. In this third edition of what is now a classic of photographic literature, a sequence of 118 (including 25 previously unpublished) images transport the viewer through a landscape at times menacing, and at other times lyrical and soulful. The images present the full gamut of New Yorkers, from weary strap hangers and languorous ladies in summer dresses to stalking predators and homeless persons. Davidson's accompanying text tells the story behind the images, clarifying his method and dramatizing his obsession with the subway, its rhythms and its particular madness.","options":[{"id":24479283,"name":"Default","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":4.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":22.5,"amount_with_others":7.95}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76152876/-/prf-5607.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76152876/-/prf-5607.jpg","width":1000,"height":945},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76152924/-/prf-5608.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76152924/-/prf-5608.jpg","width":1000,"height":539},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76152948/-/prf-5610.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76152948/-/prf-5610.jpg","width":1000,"height":534},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76152960/-/prf-5611.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76152960/-/prf-5611.jpg","width":1000,"height":511}],"artists":[{"id":148896,"name":"Bruce Davidson","permalink":"bruce-davidson","url":"/artist/bruce-davidson"}],"categories":[{"id":3890178,"name":"Photography Books","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"},{"id":3909609,"name":"Signed Editions","permalink":"signed-editions","url":"/category/signed-editions"}]},{"id":6391551,"name":"King Kong: We Didn't Invent Anything - King Kong Collective, Le Le Saveri Milan Italy","permalink":"king-kong-we-didn-t-invent-anything-king-kong-collective-le-le-saveri-milan-italy","position":57,"price":30.0,"default_price":30.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/king-kong-we-didn-t-invent-anything-king-kong-collective-le-le-saveri-milan-italy","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-07T19:43:24.000Z","description":"A italian import documenting graffiti, photography and street life in Milan, Italy between 2000-2005.
