The cabin is full of family belongings including: piles of old books, records, paintings, drawings, boxes of old photographs, journals, dream diaries & an impressive collection of strange and meaningful objects, including old masks, broken instruments, stones, feathers, primitive figurines, clay bowls & fetishes. One night I happened to pick up a copy of <i> Mysterium Coniunctionis </i> (Jung's last major work before he died), & then I immediately remembered a strange photograph I found in a shoe box under the bed which featured a priest next to an African woman in a green dress. My initial instinct was to juxtapose the photo & the book to see what would happen. From this initial act, <i> South Sound </i> was born. I think of this first image as the key to understanding the rest of the series as it features Jung's book <i> Mysterium Coniunctionis,</i> which is an inquiry into the separation & alchemical synthesis of psychic opposites. The juxtapositions in the final images are meant to be suggestive rather than expository, relying on the formal & material qualities of the objects within them, as well as their mysterious textual & photographic contents, in order to elicit responses in the viewer that range from synthetic story-making to mute, impassable aporia.        \r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Alexander Keefe, whose grandfather built the cabin, writes in his essay, \"Some of the photographs in this book are of close relatives – my mother and her siblings, my grandparents – many others are of strangers, and Tarrah's knowledge of the people & places in them is even more limited than my own.  And yet I am still surprised by how deeply some of the conjunctions she put together resonate, how painfully too. But the idea was never to narrate the story of my family using photographs and books – it was more about the way we felt at the cabin, about what Tarrah was able to do with the materials she had at hand, the results of an alchemical experiment she ran in my grandfather's strange laboratory.

Without much context they manage the limited universality of a speculative riddle; burdened with biblio-biographical detail they forfeit the powerful simplicity of their premise: a photo on a book on a table.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":41740881,"name":"Default","price":125.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123064608/-/Picture_15.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123064608/-/Picture_15.png","width":598,"height":748},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123064686/-/IMG_9274insta.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123064686/-/IMG_9274insta.jpg","width":1200,"height":1200},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123064785/-/IMG_9280.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123064785/-/IMG_9280.jpg","width":1200,"height":1200},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123064791/-/IMG_9281.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123064791/-/IMG_9281.jpg","width":1200,"height":1200},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123064794/-/IMG_9282.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123064794/-/IMG_9282.jpg","width":1200,"height":1200}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2909547,"name":"AMPERSAND PUBLICATIONS","permalink":"ampersand-publications","url":"/category/ampersand-publications"},{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"},{"id":2846891,"name":"COLLECTIBLE & RARE","permalink":"collectible-rare","url":"/category/collectible-rare"},{"id":3375767,"name":"SIGNED","permalink":"signed","url":"/category/signed"}]},{"id":12838560,"name":"The Revolutionary Moment - Don Unrau (signed)","permalink":"the-revolutionary-moment-don-unrau-signed","position":12,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-revolutionary-moment-don-unrau-signed","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-07T22:24:53.000Z","description":"<p align=\"justify\">Join Ampersand on Saturday, August 24 from 6 to 8PM for a book launch party & signing with the photographer. \r\n\r\n<i>The Revolutionary Moment</i>\r\nDon Unrau\r\n\r\n6 1/4 x 9 1/4 in. \r\nHardcover\r\n60 pages\r\n28 b&w plates\r\n\r\nPublished by Stray Dog Press\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> <i>The Revolutionary Moment </I> contains twenty-eight portraits of communist Viet Cong revolutionaries by photographer & Viet Nam war veteran Don Unrau.

Paris was where his mother was born and raised, giving Steinmetz a special connection to, and familiarity with, the city. In the streets, parks, and along the Seine, Steinmetz plays with the conventions of the Paris photographic tradition, from Atget to Kertész. The work is classical, but with a modern feel that both updates the tradition and follows the path Steinmetz has set with his other books. Beautifully printed on uncoated Japanese stock with Nazraeli's exclusive “Daido black” ink, <i>Paris in my time </i> is printed in a first edition of 1,000 casebound copies.

Separated from the minutia of McElroy’s lived reality, however, the photographs also allow for an endless drift of fictitious suggestion & voyeurism. <i> After Wake </i> can be a half-alert morning recollection of disjointed dreams. Or it's a catalog of contradictory eyewitness accounts. It may also be selections from the visual diaries & detritus of a life-long peeping tom. Perhaps it's a snapshot paper trail of lovely women from a savant's poetic thoughts. Or it's the happy Saturday memories of two lovers, tinged by the banal possessions of a soiled suburban life. It may also be something like the outtakes from a B movie chronicling pleasure, grotesque beauty, infidelity, addiction, abuse & redemption. In short, <i> After Wake </i> is a collection of provoking photographs by McElory that eschews concept & meaning in favor of imagination & a stream of inchoate ideas.         \r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":37529841,"name":"Default","price":28.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":11.5,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116895846/-/IMG_7178_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116895846/-/IMG_7178_1.jpg","width":1000,"height":752},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116897178/-/IMG_7196.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116897178/-/IMG_7196.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116897190/-/IMG_7197.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116897190/-/IMG_7197.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116897214/-/IMG_7198.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116897214/-/IMG_7198.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116897226/-/IMG_7199.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116897226/-/IMG_7199.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2909547,"name":"AMPERSAND PUBLICATIONS","permalink":"ampersand-publications","url":"/category/ampersand-publications"},{"id":2846891,"name":"COLLECTIBLE & RARE","permalink":"collectible-rare","url":"/category/collectible-rare"},{"id":3375767,"name":"SIGNED","permalink":"signed","url":"/category/signed"}]},{"id":11393460,"name":"HEAD FAKE - Jason Brinkerhoff - Signed ","permalink":"head-fake-jason-brinkerhoff","position":17,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/head-fake-jason-brinkerhoff","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-26T21:07:35.000Z","description":"<i> HEAD FAKE </i>\r\nJason Brinkerhoff\r\n\r\n6 x 8 1/2 in. \r\nPerfect bound soft cover\r\n89 pages \r\n40 color plates\r\n\r\nEssay by Scott Zieher\r\n\r\nDesigned & published by Ampersand\r\nPrinted & bound in Portland, Oregon\r\n\r\nEdition of 200\r\n\r\nSigned by Brinkerhoff\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> 12 signed & numbered deluxe copies include one of 12 original signed works on paper by the artist. \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/category/head-fake-signed-deluxe\"> here</a> to take a look at your options.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Published on the occasion of an exhibition of Brinkerhoff's work at Ampersand in June, 2013.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> <i> HEAD FAKE </I> is a conceptual taxonomy of source material that functions in Brinkerhoff’s studio as input to the drawing processes at hand.

Together the photographs create a cryptic and heterogeneous index of nature, with recurring shapes, patterns and texture, where the clarity and simplicity of the individual photographs contrasts with the enigmatic whole.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Shot in his signature black and white style, his subjects are isolated from their environments, taking on sculptural qualities. Ranging from the sublime (lightning, mountains, a star) to the commonplace (ducks, rocks, a fish), these phenomena all attain equal importance through the democracy of Lange’s photographic treatment.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Mårten Lange was born in 1984 in Mölndal, Sweden.

Phillips \r\n\r\n<i>click images to enlarge</i>\r\n \r\nHardcover\r\n464 pages\r\n\r\nPublished by SFMOMA\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Widely regarded as one of the most important photographers of the 20th century, Garry Winogrand (1928–1984) did much of his best-known work in Manhattan during the 1960s, becoming an epic chronicler of that tumultuous decade. But Winogrand was also an avid traveler and roamed extensively around the United States, bringing exquisite work out of nearly every region of the country.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">This landmark retrospective catalogue looks at the full sweep of Winogrand’s exceptional career. Drawing from his enormous output, which at the time of his death included thousands of rolls of undeveloped film and unpublished contact sheets, the book will serve as the most substantial compendium of Winogrand’s work to date. Lavishly illustrated with both iconic images and photographs that have never been seen before now, and featuring essays by leading scholars of American photography, <i>Garry Winogrand</i> presents a vivid portrait of an artist who unflinchingly captured America’s swings between optimism and upheaval in the postwar era.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Leo Rubinfien is a photographer and essayist in New York City.

In short, <i> After Wake </i> is a collection of provoking photographs by McElory that eschews concept & meaning in favor of imagination & a stream of inchoate ideas.     \r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":30516146,"name":"Default","price":125.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95821475/-/1640x830-zXamojmi2pMo8x0G.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95821475/-/1640x830-zXamojmi2pMo8x0G.jpg","width":552,"height":830},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95821523/-/IMG_7180_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95821523/-/IMG_7180_1.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95821559/-/IMG_7207.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95821559/-/IMG_7207.jpg","width":1000,"height":777},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95821619/-/IMG_7192.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95821619/-/IMG_7192.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95821655/-/IMG_7196.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95821655/-/IMG_7196.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2909547,"name":"AMPERSAND PUBLICATIONS","permalink":"ampersand-publications","url":"/category/ampersand-publications"},{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"},{"id":2846891,"name":"COLLECTIBLE & RARE","permalink":"collectible-rare","url":"/category/collectible-rare"}]},{"id":10314295,"name":"Damaged Negatives - Glen Luchford","permalink":"damaged-negatives-glen-luchford","position":35,"price":27.0,"default_price":27.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/damaged-negatives-glen-luchford","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-03T00:46:37.000Z","description":"<i>Damaged Negatives</i>\r\nGlen Luchford\r\n\r\n<i>click images to enlarge</i>\r\n \r\n7 x 9 3/4 in.\r\nSoftcover\r\n\r\nEdition of 1,000\r\n\r\nPublished by Dashwood Books\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">“I put the images in storage for two weeks, which turned into two months.

As in amateur photography, what is essential about these photographs is that they were originally not meant to be seen by strangers — only their subjects were supposed to see them. The shots were meant to exist as single prints—originals in the literal sense of the word.\r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":32289718,"name":"Default","price":27.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/101356276/-/IMG_7683.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/101356276/-/IMG_7683.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/101356312/-/IMG_7684.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/101356312/-/IMG_7684.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/101356336/-/IMG_7686.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/101356336/-/IMG_7686.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/101356396/-/IMG_7690.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/101356396/-/IMG_7690.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/101356432/-/IMG_7691.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/101356432/-/IMG_7691.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":10315270,"name":"Pul Ke Niche - Nick Sethi","permalink":"pul-ke-niche-nick-sethi","position":38,"price":27.0,"default_price":27.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pul-ke-niche-nick-sethi","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-03T01:36:10.000Z","description":"<i>Pul Ke Niche</i>\r\nNick Sethi\r\n\r\n<i>click images to enlarge</i>\r\n \r\n7 x 9 3/4 in.\r\nSoftcover\r\n\r\nEdition of 500\r\n\r\nPublished by Dashwood Books\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><i>Pul Ke Niche</i> is the first book by Nick Sethi, an American photographer of Indian extraction. What is remarkable in Sethi’s pictures of the children and families living under a freeway in New Delhi is how they boldly avoid the usual traps of photojournalism in depicting poverty – there are no sad faces, begging hands, or juxtaposing of rich and poor to illicit sympathy. Even though they are desperate, blowing-the-lid off poverty in India is clearly not Sethi's objective, instead he portrays of the “wrongness” of their predicament, and their humor despite this, illustrated in a series of often surreal scenarios.\r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":32292481,"name":"Default","price":27.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/101366752/-/IMG_7729.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/101366752/-/IMG_7729.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/101366788/-/IMG_7731.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/101366788/-/IMG_7731.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/101366812/-/IMG_7733.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/101366812/-/IMG_7733.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/101366860/-/IMG_7736.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/101366860/-/IMG_7736.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/101366872/-/IMG_7738.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/101366872/-/IMG_7738.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":10315177,"name":"Byways & Through Lines - Pierre Le Hors","permalink":"byways-through-lines-pierre-le-hors","position":39,"price":27.0,"default_price":27.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/byways-through-lines-pierre-le-hors","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-03T01:30:59.000Z","description":"<i>Byways & Through Lines</i>\r\nPierre Le Hors\r\n\r\n<i>click images to enlarge</i>\r\n \r\n7 x 9 3/4 in.\r\nSoftcover\r\n\r\nEdition of 500\r\n\r\nPublished by Dashwood Books\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">“This publication folds together disparate narrative strands and formal devices in an attempt to extract a hybridized union.

At the time, I was busy with all sorts of work for magazines. Partly because of a daily feeling inside that I shouldn't let myself get carried away by it all, I came up with the idea of a small, self-published personal photo journal. Without any ties to work or any fixed topic, I just wanted to continue publishing a 16-page booklet with an arbitrary selection of favorite photos among the pictures I snapped from day to day. By nature, it was directed first and foremost to myself rather than other people. I wanted a simple, basic title, so I called it 'Kiroku' (record). However, the publication of 'Kiroku' sadly ended with issue number five. Now, thanks to the willpower and efforts of Akio Nagasawa, 'Kiroku' the magazine has resumed publication. Or rather, we should call it a fresh publication. With the hope that it will continue this time, I am selfishly thinking of asking Mr. Nagasawa to publish 'Kiroku' at a pace of four issues per year. I happily accept his proposal and look forward now to embarking on a new 'voyage of recording.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/category/books\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":31255615,"name":"Default","price":48.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98180767/-/IMG_7274.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98180767/-/IMG_7274.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98180779/-/IMG_7275.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98180779/-/IMG_7275.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98180827/-/IMG_7276.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98180827/-/IMG_7276.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98180881/-/IMG_7277.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98180881/-/IMG_7277.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98180911/-/IMG_7278.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98180911/-/IMG_7278.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"},{"id":3375767,"name":"SIGNED","permalink":"signed","url":"/category/signed"}]},{"id":9996010,"name":"Casa De Campo - Antonio M.

Xoubanova \r\n\r\n6 x 8 1/2 in. \r\nPrinted & embossed hardcover \r\n144 pages\r\n72 color plates\r\n\r\nText by Luis Lopez \r\n\r\nPublished by MACK\r\nFebruary, 2013\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> <i> Casa de Campo </I> is a photographic fable rooted firmly in the realities of Madrid’s largest public park. Casa de Campo sprawls, five times the size of Central Park, to the west of Madrid. Between 2008 and 2012 Antonio M. Xoubanova wandered the paths of this urban woodland examining the people, animals and objects he saw as if he was on uncommon ground. Inadvertently he found himself transforming a given reality into narrative fiction. \r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Designed as an ancient fairy tale, the book is made up of five chapters referring respectively to love, death, fleeting moments, symbols and a lack of direction. It examines both the symbolic and the oneiric through the gathering together of people, animals, animate and inanimate beings within this single space. In his text Luis Lopez posits that for any researcher, archaeologist, intruder or anthropologist their findings will always be the same: someone was here, somebody did this. Stuff happens here. These traces are what drew Xoubanova back into Casa de Campo over the years.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Antonio M. Xoubanova is one of the founding members of the Blank Paper Collective. Based in Madrid he studied photography at The School of Art and Design. He has received numerous grants and prizes including the FotoPres’07 from La Caixa Foundation to develop his project M-30, a grant from the Ministry of Culture and a prize for documentary photography in ARCO’05. Xoubanova’s work has been published in The New York Times, El Semanal and he has been working regularly for El Mundo since 2006. This is his first book.\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":31258045,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98189689/-/IMG_7311.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98189689/-/IMG_7311.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98189731/-/IMG_7312.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98189731/-/IMG_7312.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98189755/-/IMG_7313.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98189755/-/IMG_7313.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98189791/-/IMG_7314.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98189791/-/IMG_7314.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98189815/-/IMG_7315.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98189815/-/IMG_7315.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":10010725,"name":"Pot Shots -

It is printed on our special uncoated art paper and bound in a subdued green cloth. A wonderful companion book to the artist's earlier title <i>Bodhisattva</i>, <i>Prayers in an American Church</i> is a welcome addition to the literature available on this important American artist.\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":31305058,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98339323/-/IMG_7346.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98339323/-/IMG_7346.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98339347/-/IMG_7348.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98339347/-/IMG_7348.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98339359/-/IMG_7350.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98339359/-/IMG_7350.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98339371/-/IMG_7352.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98339371/-/IMG_7352.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98339383/-/IMG_7353.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98339383/-/IMG_7353.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"},{"id":2846891,"name":"COLLECTIBLE & RARE","permalink":"collectible-rare","url":"/category/collectible-rare"},{"id":3375767,"name":"SIGNED","permalink":"signed","url":"/category/signed"}]},{"id":10010125,"name":"Illuminance - Rinko Kawauchi","permalink":"illuminance-rinko-kawauchi","position":50,"price":60.0,"default_price":60.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/illuminance-rinko-kawauchi","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-19T00:02:20.000Z","description":"<i>Illuminance</i>\r\nRinko Kawauchi\r\n\r\n11 x 8 1/2 in. \r\nHardcover\r\n163 pages\r\n144 color plates\r\n\r\nPublished by Aperture\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">In 2001, Rinko Kawauchi published three astonishing photobooks simultaneously—<i>Utatane, Hanabi</i>, and <i>Hanako</i>—establishing herself as one of the most innovative newcomers to contemporary photography. Other notable monographs include <i>Aila</i> (2004), <i>The Eyes, the Ear</i> (2005), and <i>Semear</i> (2007). Now, ten years after her precipitous entry onto the international stage, Aperture has published <i>Illuminance</i>, the first volume of Kawauchi’s work to be published outside of Japan.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Kawauchi’s work has frequently been lauded for its nuanced palette and offhand compositional mastery, as well as its ability to incite wonder via careful attention to tiny gestures and the incidental details of her everyday environment. In <i>Illuminance</i>, Kawauchi continues her exploration of the extraordinary in the mundane, drawn to the fundamental cycles of life and the seemingly inadvertent, fractal-like organization of the natural world into formal patterns.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Gorgeously produced as a clothbound volume with Japanese binding, this impressive compilation of mostly previously unpublished images is proof of Kawauchi’s unparalleled, unique sensibility and her ongoing appeal to the lovers of photography.\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":31304971,"name":"Default","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":62.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98338663/-/IMG_7337.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98338663/-/IMG_7337.jpg","width":1000,"height":746},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98338675/-/IMG_7338.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98338675/-/IMG_7338.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98338687/-/IMG_7340.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98338687/-/IMG_7340.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98338699/-/IMG_7342.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98338699/-/IMG_7342.jpg","width":1000,"height":745},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98338738/-/IMG_7344.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98338738/-/IMG_7344.jpg","width":1000,"height":745}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":10009963,"name":"Boy Stories - Johan Willner","permalink":"boy-stories-johan-willner","position":51,"price":55.0,"default_price":55.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/boy-stories-johan-willner","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-18T23:54:51.000Z","description":"<i>Boy Stories</i>\r\nJohan Willner\r\n\r\n12 x 9 1/2 in. \r\nHardcover\r\n80 pages\r\n67 color plates\r\n\r\nPublished by Hatje Cantz\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Between documentation and staging: childhood as the source of mysterious images.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Johan Willner (*1971 in Stockholm) makes it difficult to tell to what degree his black-and-white and color photographs are renditions of real or staged events. Inspired by music, literature, and philosophy, the artist discovers mysterious motifs in front of the backdrops provided by nature or the city, beaches or hospitals. This publication presents the series <i>Boy Stories</i>, which is based on images from his own memory and which Willner has been pursuing since 2006—not to reconstruct the details of past events but with the intention of creating a universally valid manifestation of existential questions. The slightly faded colors, often in complimentary hues of green and red on a lighter background, lend the photographs a fascinating aesthetic that belies their dramatic depths while at the same time creating an interesting contrast to the subjects, such as the fragility of the child within the man.\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":31304608,"name":"Default","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98337007/-/IMG_7327.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98337007/-/IMG_7327.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98337031/-/IMG_7328.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98337031/-/IMG_7328.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98337067/-/IMG_7329.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98337067/-/IMG_7329.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98337127/-/IMG_7334.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98337127/-/IMG_7334.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98337160/-/IMG_7336.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98337160/-/IMG_7336.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":10009723,"name":"Paintings - Anj Smith ","permalink":"paintings-anj-smith","position":52,"price":70.0,"default_price":70.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/paintings-anj-smith","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-18T23:45:25.000Z","description":"<i>Paintings</i>\r\nAnj Smith \r\n\r\n9 1/2 x 13 in. \r\nPrinted paper hardcover with UV varnish highlight\r\n104 pages\r\n40 color plates\r\n\r\nPublished by MACK\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">The eerie, luminous, compact portraits and landscapes of London-based artist Anj Smith are exercises in extravagant meticulousness. The magic of her laboriously depicted figures and motifs, however, derives in large part from the contrast Smith creates in surrounding areas of loamy, thickly applied impasto. This formal incongruence – between the intricate and the inchoate, between a jewel-like glow and rough scratchings, between filigree and mire – is crucial to Smith’s work. It suggests that she seeks to navigate a murky psychological space far beyond the reach of her virtuosic single-bristle brush. In her world, certainty is just a vestige of the past, with everything today existing in a fragile, constantly shifting instability.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">A thematic corollary to such general elusiveness is the gender ambiguity in many of Smith’s portraits. In ‘The Moon, Like a Flower’, the delicate features of a sitter with long blonde hair might equally be described as feminine or effeminate, and are interrupted by sprouting facial hair that could indicate male pubescence. In ‘The Sentry’, the viewer’s eye sweeps down from a lipsticked mouth and intricate headpiece of feathers and fossils, to a pair of massive masculine thighs and a flower-covered codpiece that protects the mystery of the figure’s identity. Both isolated and on display, these subjects maintain their distance from the viewer but are far from idle: Smith’s subjects deliberately frustrate norms of composure, decorum and self-possession. Half naked and at the same time elaborately attired, their fantastical ensembles simultaneously camouflage and affirm individuality.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Organic and inorganic objects alike tend to snake, coil, twine, twist, and weave, teasing the eye with tendrils, creepers, roots, and veins. By collapsing the traditional genres of ‘portrait’ and ‘landscape’, Smith suggests a territory in which neither one is adequate to represent contemporary experience. Time is often fragmented in Smith’s scenes, which appear simultaneously retroactive and futuristic but neither firmly of the past or the present. In ‘Fruits Of The Forest’, fossils seem to decay into base-matter faster than the ‘fruits’ of such fashion sensations as sequined fabric. While the artist is rendering a bleak and inhospitable environment, she suggests possibility: The makeshift structures she depicts may be cobbled together from wire, cigarette butts and twigs, but between them gauzy tangles of exquisite fabric stretch into new configurations.\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":31303888,"name":"Default","price":70.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98335027/-/IMG_7320.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98335027/-/IMG_7320.jpg","width":1000,"height":751},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98335045/-/IMG_7321.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98335045/-/IMG_7321.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98335087/-/IMG_7323.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98335087/-/IMG_7323.jpg","width":1000,"height":641},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98335111/-/IMG_7324.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98335111/-/IMG_7324.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98335132/-/IMG_7326.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98335132/-/IMG_7326.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3373415,"name":"ART & DESIGN BOOKS","permalink":"art-design-books","url":"/category/art-design-books"}]},{"id":10009636,"name":"The Afternoon Interviews - Marcel Duchamp","permalink":"the-afternoon-interviews-marcel-duchamp","position":53,"price":16.0,"default_price":16.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-afternoon-interviews-marcel-duchamp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-18T23:41:12.000Z","description":"<i>The Afternoon Interviews</i>\r\nMarcel Duchamp\r\n\r\n5 1/4 x 8 in. \r\nPaperback \r\n110 pages\r\n10 Black & white images\r\n\r\nPublished by Badlands Unlimited\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">In 1964, Calvin Tomkins spent a number of afternoons interviewing Marcel Duchamp in his apartment on West 10th Street in New York. Casual yet insightful, Duchamp reveals himself as a man and an artist whose playful principles toward living freed him to make art that was as unpredictable, complex, and surprising as life itself. Those interviews have never been edited and made public, until now. <i>The Afternoon Interviews</i>, which includes an introductory interview with Tomkins reflecting on Duchamp as an artist, guide and friend, reintroduces the reader to key ideas of his artistic world and renews Duchamp as a vital model for a new generation of artists.\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":31303714,"name":"Default","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98333956/-/IMG_7307.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98333956/-/IMG_7307.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98333995/-/IMG_7308.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98333995/-/IMG_7308.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98334079/-/IMG_7309.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98334079/-/IMG_7309.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98334115/-/IMG_7310.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98334115/-/IMG_7310.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3373415,"name":"ART & DESIGN BOOKS","permalink":"art-design-books","url":"/category/art-design-books"}]},{"id":10009534,"name":"Water Towers - Bernd Becher & Hilla Becher","permalink":"water-towers-bernd-becher-hilla-becher","position":54,"price":85.0,"default_price":85.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/water-towers-bernd-becher-hilla-becher","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-18T23:35:24.000Z","description":"<i>Water Towers</i>\r\nBernd Becher & Hilla Becher\r\n\r\n9 1/4 x 11 1/4 in. \r\nHardcover \r\n223 pages\r\n\r\nPublished by MIT Press\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Hilla and Bernd Becher's cool, objective photographs of industrial structures have earned them a special position in international photography. Although their work is widely collected by American dealers and institutions and shown in New York galleries, this is the first time that it has been published in book form in the United States.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">The Bechers' 224 photographs of watertowers comprise a unique, single minded, even obsessive mission. They were taken from as many as 8 angles, over a period of 25 years, with a stylistic approach so consistent that photographs juxtaposed from the 1950s and 1980s suggest a minute to minute account deadpan portraits of unadorned metal, concrete, and wooden structures.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Always taken in overcast skies, or in the hazy sunlight of industrial zones, these seemingly artless photographs belle the elaborate process and decisions involved in creating them elevating the camera on scaffolds or ladders, waiting for clouds to block the sun, enlisting the cooperation of plant foreman and security guards to remove all signs of human life from the scene.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">The Bechers refer to their photographs as \"typology\" or \"typologies of topographies,\" situated between established categories such as art and photography. Their work is distancing, deliberately unglamorous, departing from the usual style of architectural photography. Almost everything they photograph is eventually demolished.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Hilla and Bernd Becher began their collaborative enterprise in 1957, when they did a study of workers' houses in their native Germany. Through the years, their extensive documentation of industrial landscapes has taken them outside of Germany to France, England, Scotland, Wales, Holland, and the United States. The Bechers follow in a distinguished line of German photographers active in the Rhineland, including August Sander, Albert Renger-Patzsch, and Werner Manz, all of whom contributed in different ways to the definition of \"objective\" photography.\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":31303378,"name":"Default","price":85.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98332768/-/IMG_7301.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98332768/-/IMG_7301.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98332795/-/IMG_7302.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98332795/-/IMG_7302.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98332825/-/IMG_7303.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98332825/-/IMG_7303.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98332843/-/IMG_7305.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98332843/-/IMG_7305.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98332867/-/IMG_7306.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98332867/-/IMG_7306.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":10009414,"name":"Illuminance, Ametsuchi, Seeing Shadow - Rinko Kawauchi","permalink":"illuminance-ametsuchi-seeing-shadow-rinko-kawauchi","position":55,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/illuminance-ametsuchi-seeing-shadow-rinko-kawauchi","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-18T23:28:27.000Z","description":"<i>Illuminance, Ametsuchi, Seeing Shadow</i>\r\nRinko Kawauchi\r\n\r\n8 1/4 x 11 3/4 in. \r\nSoft cover \r\n144 pages\r\n\r\nPublished by Seigensha\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> <i>Intertwining light and dark, life and death, and the past and the present, Rinko KAWAUCHI raises them to a universal “shine of life”.

Goldblatt grew up in the South African town of Randfontein, which was shaped by the social culture and financial success of the gold mines surrounding it. When these mines started to fail in the mid-sixties Goldblatt began taking photos of them, which form the basis of On the Mines. The book features an essay on the human and political dimensions of mining in South Africa by Nobel laureate Nadine Gordimer, whose writing has long influenced Goldblatt.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">The new version of the book maintains the original three chapters “The Witwatersrand: a Time and Tailings”, “Shaftsinking” and “Mining Men”, but is otherwise completely updated, in Goldblatt’s words, “to expand the view but not to alter the sense of things”. There are thirty-one new, mostly unpublished photos including colour images, eleven deleted images, a postscript by Gordimer to her essay, as well as a text by Goldblatt reflecting on his childhood and the 1973 book. On the Mines is the first of many titles in an ambitious collaboration between the photographer and Steidl that will publish Goldblatt’s life work in a series of re-prints and new books.\r\n<p align=\"justify\">\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":30054273,"name":"Default","price":88.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":52.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94390751/-/IMG_7102.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94390751/-/IMG_7102.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94390759/-/IMG_7103.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94390759/-/IMG_7103.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94390775/-/IMG_7106.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94390775/-/IMG_7106.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94390783/-/IMG_7107.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94390783/-/IMG_7107.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94390791/-/IMG_7108.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94390791/-/IMG_7108.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":9605925,"name":"Such Appetite -

Rethinking how photographs and text can function, Lutz blends family archives, interviews and letters with his own photographic practice seamlessly into a precious, fictitious experience of a life and family consumed by mental illness. Instead of showing us what it looks like, <i> Hesitating Beauty </i> is able to play with our own conceptions of reality to show us what it feels like.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Joshua Lutz: “Holding on so tightly to what I believed was sanity and being consumed by fear of depression and schizophrenia prevented me from being fully present to my mother’s reality. The past few years, as she slipped away from the aggressive paranoia and depression of my youth to an almost calming sense of delusion, made it much easier for me to rid the anger that veiled my life and to attempt to find a place of empathy and compassion as I managed her care.

Freeze, thaw, flood: the great climatic cycles that created the topography of the northern hemisphere, and which continue to shape the idea of winter that lies deep in our cultural imagination.”\r\nRichard Hamblyn\r\n\r\nIn November 2010, after a photographic lull of half a year, Jem Southam took a photograph which became the first in this series, <i>The River Winter</i> and which spurred him to make one of the most concentrated bodies of work in his career. From late autumn through to the earliest signs of spring, along the banks of the river Exe in Devon, Southam chose locations and took photographs, returning at regular intervals. This pattern continued for the next five months with Southam documenting the subtle agencies of change transforming the landscape. By the end of January 2011 he realized this had become a new work, one that caught the effects of the Earth’s turn on film, one which followed the passage of a single winter.\r\n\r\nThe shift in seasons is presented through a sequence of ten by eight colour contact prints, with which an essay by Richard Hamblyn explores how, since the last ice-age, winter has embedded itself into our cultural psyche.\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":30051309,"name":"Default","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":27.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94378827/-/IMG_6838.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94378827/-/IMG_6838.jpg","width":1000,"height":751},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94378843/-/IMG_6839.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94378843/-/IMG_6839.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94378851/-/IMG_6840.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94378851/-/IMG_6840.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94378899/-/IMG_6842.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94378899/-/IMG_6842.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94378923/-/IMG_6843.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94378923/-/IMG_6843.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":9605023,"name":"Rodeo Drive - Anthony Hernandez","permalink":"rodeo-drive-anthony-hernandez","position":66,"price":60.0,"default_price":60.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rodeo-drive-anthony-hernandez","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-23T16:45:40.000Z","description":"<i>Rodeo Drive</i>\r\nAnthony Hernandez\r\n\r\n12 x 12 in. \r\nHardcover clothbound with tipped-in image\r\n96 pages\r\n41 color photographs\r\n\r\nPublished by MACK\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><i>Rodeo Drive</i>, 1984 is a series of 41 images of shoppers on Beverly Hills’ infamous shopping highway. The subjects appear caught unaware, glancing up as they walk, or daydreaming as they wait to be served in its commercial landscape of shops and restaurants. Anthony Hernandez poses as a dispassionate observer, recording the big hair, wide shoulders and cinched waists of the 1980’s in sunlit photographs.\r\n\r\nHernandez does not simply document the urban experience, but reveals in his images the complexity of social spaces, implying economic disparity and racial divide. Layers of socio-economic tension are exposed on a street in an overt symbol of civic success; as Lewis Baltz observes, “these are the victors...enjoying the spoils of their victory on Rodeo Drive”.\r\n\r\nWorking in the 1970s, Hernandez and his contemporaries, who included Lewis Baltz and Terry Wild, were interested in photographing the social landscape of Los Angeles. Hernandez work was included in a landmark exhibition, The Crowded Vacancy, at the Pasadena Art Museum, LA (now the Norton Simon Museum) in 1971, which introduced to the public a new type of American landscape photography – four years prior to New Topographics; both exhibitions inspired an aesthetic movement that continues to resonate today.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":30051255,"name":"Default","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":27.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94378603/-/IMG_6825.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94378603/-/IMG_6825.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94378619/-/IMG_6826.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94378619/-/IMG_6826.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94378643/-/IMG_6827.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94378643/-/IMG_6827.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94378667/-/IMG_6828.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94378667/-/IMG_6828.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94378683/-/IMG_6830.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94378683/-/IMG_6830.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":9604955,"name":"Self Portrait - Lee Friedlander","permalink":"self-portrait-lee-friedlander","position":67,"price":35.0,"default_price":35.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/self-portrait-lee-friedlander","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-23T16:35:16.000Z","description":"<i>Self Portrait</i>\r\nLee Friedlander\r\n\r\n10 x 9 1/2 in. \r\nHardcover\r\n104 pages\r\n\r\nPublished by MOMA\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Originally published in 1970, this remarkable book was redesigned and reprinted in 1998 in a larger format and with a new afterword by John Szarkowski.

His work is deadpan, reflecting a dry wit, and is a continuous engagement with the subject of reality and of landscape as a snapshot of our interaction with the world.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">This new edition of <i>Kodachrome</i> is published as a facsimile of the original, adopting the original design, text layout and image sequence, but using new image files scanned from Ghirri’s original film to take advantage of modern technology and printing methods. A small booklet is included with an essay by Francesco Zanot, which offers a contemporary perspective on the historical impact of Kodachrome, alongside French and German translations of the original texts from the book (which were published in English and Italian).<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":30050843,"name":"Default","price":40.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":27.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94377515/-/IMG_6723.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94377515/-/IMG_6723.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94377523/-/IMG_6726.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94377523/-/IMG_6726.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94377531/-/IMG_6727.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94377531/-/IMG_6727.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94377547/-/IMG_6729.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94377547/-/IMG_6729.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94377571/-/IMG_6731.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94377571/-/IMG_6731.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":9601479,"name":"Drawing Surrealism - Leslie Jones","permalink":"drawing-surrealism-leslie-jones","position":69,"price":60.0,"default_price":60.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/drawing-surrealism-leslie-jones","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-23T05:41:56.000Z","description":"<i>Drawing Surrealism</i>\r\nLeslie Jones\r\n\r\n9 3/4 x 12 in. \r\nHardback\r\n244 pages\r\nOver 200 illustrations\r\n\r\nPublished by LACMA\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Drawing, often considered a minor art, was central to Surrealism from the very beginning. Automatic drawing, exquisite cadavers, and frottage are just a few of the techniques invented by Surrealists as means to tap into the subconscious realm. While previous books have examined the connection between drawings and Surrealist paintings, <i>Drawing Surrealism</i>, which accompanies a major exhibition organized by LACMA, is the first to recognize the medium as a fundamental form of Surrealist expression, and to explore its impact on other media. Works of collage, photography, and even painting are presented in the context of drawing as a metaphor for innovation and experimentation.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> This book includes works by approximately 100 artists and includes a substantial historical essay and illustrated chronology.

Urban\r\n\r\n9 x 10 1/2 in. \r\nSoft cover\r\n164 pages\r\n94 photographs\r\n\r\nPublished by Arbor Vitae\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> The American photographer Joel-Peter Witkin (born 1939 in Brooklyn) has been one of the most outstanding representatives in the world of photography since the end of the 1970s. His stylized black and white images are included in all major photography collections around the world. Witkin focuses mainly on still-life and portraiture. His work presents a unique view of the contemporary world and he often works with references to religious themes (the crucifixion, saints, etc.) as well as to classical painting (Francisco Goya, Odilon Redon, Joan Miró, Hieronymus Bosch, etc.). His art has influenced a number of other artists (e. g. Erwin Olaf, Jake and Dinos Chapman) and musicians (Diamanda Galás, Trent Reznor). Also thanks to the work of Joel-Peter Witkin the concept of decadence and the decadent has recently emerged more and more in relation to contemporary art. The book represents a cross section of the artist’s work since the 1970s to the present. In addition to photographs, lesser-known drawings and paintings are also included in the book. For the very first time, this monograph presents a collection of Witkin’s latest photographs, his <i>retablos</i>, created over the last three years. The monograph, in English and in Czech, with a text by the art historian Otto M. Urban summarizes the development of Witkin’s life and work.   \r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":30041433,"name":"Default","price":40.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":27.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94346555/-/IMG_6212.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94346555/-/IMG_6212.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94346563/-/IMG_6213.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94346563/-/IMG_6213.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94346571/-/IMG_6217.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94346571/-/IMG_6217.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94346579/-/IMG_6218.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94346579/-/IMG_6218.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94346587/-/IMG_6220.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94346587/-/IMG_6220.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":8569062,"name":"Record No. 21 - Daido Moriyama ","permalink":"record-no-21-daido-moriyama","position":71,"price":45.0,"default_price":45.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/record-no-21-daido-moriyama","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-16T00:59:25.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Record No. 21 </i>\r\nDaido Moriyama \r\n\r\n8 1/4 x 11 in. \r\nStapled paperback\r\n72 pages\r\n\r\nSigned Daido Moriyama on title page\r\n\r\nPublished by Akio Nagasawa\r\n2012\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> \"It was 34 years ago, back in 1972, that I came out with the self-published photo journal 'Kiroku.' At the time, I was busy with all sorts of work for magazines. Partly because of a daily feeling inside that I shouldn't let myself get carried away by it all, I came up with the idea of a small, self-published personal photo journal. Without any ties to work or any fixed topic, I just wanted to continue publishing a 16-page booklet with an arbitrary selection of favorite photos among the pictures I snapped from day to day. By nature, it was directed first and foremost to myself rather than other people. I wanted a simple, basic title, so I called it 'Kiroku' (record). However, the publication of 'Kiroku' sadly ended with issue number five. Now, thanks to the willpower and efforts of Akio Nagasawa, 'Kiroku' the magazine has resumed publication. Or rather, we should call it a fresh publication. With the hope that it will continue this time, I am selfishly thinking of asking Mr. Nagasawa to publish 'Kiroku' at a pace of four issues per year. I happily accept his proposal and look forward now to embarking on a new 'voyage of recording.'\"\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> This vibrant colour issue sees Moriyama in New York, taking a trip to Coney Island in November 2011, followed by a night time stroll through the lights of Times Square.\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/category/books\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":26913138,"name":"Default","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84294225/-/IMG_6662.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84294225/-/IMG_6662.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84294237/-/IMG_6663.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84294237/-/IMG_6663.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84294273/-/IMG_6665.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84294273/-/IMG_6665.jpg","width":1000,"height":749},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84294321/-/IMG_6666.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84294321/-/IMG_6666.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84294357/-/IMG_6667.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84294357/-/IMG_6667.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"},{"id":2846891,"name":"COLLECTIBLE & RARE","permalink":"collectible-rare","url":"/category/collectible-rare"},{"id":3375767,"name":"SIGNED","permalink":"signed","url":"/category/signed"}]},{"id":8567703,"name":"Elementary Calculus -  J Carrier","permalink":"elementary-calculus-j-carrier","position":72,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/elementary-calculus-j-carrier","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-15T22:43:26.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Elementary Calculus</i>\r\nJ Carrier\r\n\r\n\r\nEmbossed hardcover\r\n128 pages\r\n74 color plates\r\n\r\nPublished by MACK\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">J Carrier has had a nomadic lifestyle, moving from Washington D.C. to Ecuador, and then to Africa and the Middle East, every move taking him further from his friends and family. During his time in Israel, Carrier began to feel an affinity with the migrants who had landed in the dusty city of Tel Aviv, relating to their experience as an outsider, someone far from home.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><i> Elementary Calculus</i>, through a series of portraits, landscapes and still life photographs, observes the publicly private moments of these peregrine foreigners as they attempt to connect back to their homes. In his documentation of migrants and refugees in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, Carrier explores the distance between reality and desire – the want for what was and the hope for what will be – and traces the manner in which we navigate the points between the unknowns. His photographs resonate with the sense that in a foreign country geographical distance loses its physical measure and home feels like a hazy memory, a half-remembered dream.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Carrier’s subtle yet striking images of Israel and the West Bank throw up more questions than they answer. What does this influx of foreigners mean in a nation that is defined by ethnicity and competing claims of ownership? And how does this complex situation affect these new varieties of refugees? Is there promise in this land for them?\r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":26909433,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":27.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84277221/-/IMG_6483.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84277221/-/IMG_6483.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84277233/-/IMG_6484.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84277233/-/IMG_6484.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84277257/-/IMG_6485.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84277257/-/IMG_6485.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84277302/-/IMG_6487.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84277302/-/IMG_6487.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84277341/-/IMG_6488.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84277341/-/IMG_6488.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":8481876,"name":"Pulp Art Book: Volume Two","permalink":"pulp-art-book-volume-two-pre-order-signed-copies","position":73,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pulp-art-book-volume-two-pre-order-signed-copies","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-11T02:29:12.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Pulp Art Book: Volume Two </i>\r\nNeil Krug & Joni Harbeck\r\n\r\n12 x 12 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n72 pages\r\n44 four-color plates\r\n\r\nPublished by Nazraeli Press\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Photographer Neil Krug & his wife & collaborator Joni Harbeck will be at Ampersand this Saturday, December 15 to celebrate the release of <i> Pulp Art Book: Volume Two. </i> In addition to presenting an artist talk & slideshow, they will be signing copies of the book, which you can order here.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Designed as a companion book to the LP-sized “Pulp Art Book: Volume One”, this much anticipated second volume builds on the first, introducing several new characters and vignettes, while solidifying Joni Harbeck and Neil Krug’s position as the hippest ex-Kansans in the contemporary art world. Poliziotteschi films were a major influence for Volume Two, in particular with the “Heist” series, which introduces Farrow, Patti and Tash. Jackie, Mystic White Flight, SummerLovers and other favorites make their appearances as well. Taken together, the characters and imagery in this fresh new collection take Pulp Art Book to a new level. “Husband and wife Neil Krug and Joni Harbeck have given birth to a poignant ballad of imagery that incorporates both psychedelia and spirituality. Pulp Art Book is an examination of societal life during the 1960s and 70s as well as a stylistic homage to B movies and Spaghetti Westerns. Krug has drawn attention in recent years for his commercial work with the likes of Ladytron, The Horrors, and Devendra Banhart, while model Joni Harbeck has been a muse to many and is the heroine of the print trilogy.” – Planet \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":26667345,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":27.5,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84001713/-/IMG_6641.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84001713/-/IMG_6641.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84001893/-/IMG_6649.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84001893/-/IMG_6649.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84001929/-/IMG_6644.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84001929/-/IMG_6644.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84001977/-/IMG_6646.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84001977/-/IMG_6646.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84002073/-/IMG_6650.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84002073/-/IMG_6650.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":8540193,"name":"Pulp Art Book: Volume One","permalink":"pulp-art-book-volume-one-pre-order-signed-copies","position":74,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pulp-art-book-volume-one-pre-order-signed-copies","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-14T00:23:55.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Pulp Art Book: Volume One </i>\r\nNeil Krug & Joni Harbeck\r\n\r\n12 x 12 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n72 pages\r\n44 four-color plates\r\n\r\nPublished by Nazraeli Press\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Photographer Neil Krug & his wife & collaborator Joni Harbeck will be at Ampersand this Saturday, December 15 to celebrate the release of <i> Pulp Art Book: Volume Two. </i> In addition to presenting an artist talk & slideshow, they will be signing copies of the book, which you can order here.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> “Neil Krug’s stylized photos of his wife, the model Joni Harbeck, were taken with Polaroid film years past its sell-by date. They have the kind of grainy, sun-scorched feel of a Sergio Leone spaghetti western. And ever since the couple began posting the photos on Flickr early this year, they’ve drawn a blaze of attention.” - The New York Times. Pulp - the multi-media collaboration between photographer Neil Krug and supermodel Joni Harbeck - has become a virtual sensation online, and is now the subject of the artists’ first monograph. 'Pulp Art Book: Volume One' is an LP-sized hardcover book, split into several vignettes ranging from a spaghetti western theme to a Bonnie and Clyde revival and to the struggles of a 1950s housewife. These series tell the story of each character, and will be expanded in subsequent volumes. The inspiration for the pulp theme comes from the artists’ collective appreciation of societal life and the artistic expressions of the 1960s and 70s. Old LP jackets, Giallo posters, vintage book covers, and B-movie cinema themes have defined their taste for this project. Initially they set out to capture something simple and sexy; as the shoots progressed, however, natural story lines emerged. The resulting work captures the smell of those decades and expresses them in a fresh way.\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":26831283,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":27.5,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84002817/-/IMG_6652.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84002817/-/IMG_6652.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84002853/-/IMG_6653.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84002853/-/IMG_6653.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84002865/-/IMG_6654.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84002865/-/IMG_6654.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84002937/-/IMG_6655.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84002937/-/IMG_6655.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84002961/-/IMG_6656.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84002961/-/IMG_6656.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":8568597,"name":"Marilyn Monroe: NYC, 1955 - Peter Mangone ","permalink":"marilyn-monroe-nyc-1955-peter-mangone","position":75,"price":35.0,"default_price":35.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/marilyn-monroe-nyc-1955-peter-mangone","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-16T00:16:45.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i>Marilyn Monroe: NYC, 1955</i>\r\nPeter Mangone \r\n\r\n9 x 9 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n48 pages\r\n \r\nPublished by Danziger Gallery/T.Adler Books\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">In 1955, Peter Mangone was 14 years old--a skinny boy from the Bronx with a Marilyn Monroe fixation, like so many teenagers of his generation. What distinguished Mangone was that he got to meet his idol. For several months, he had played truant from school to stake out the Gladstone Hotel on Manhattan's East 52nd Street, where the 29-year-old Monroe was staying after her unhappy divorce from Joe DiMaggio and her dismissal from the Twentieth-Century Fox studios. One morning, Mangone borrowed an eight-millimeter Kodak camera from his brother, headed down to the Gladstone and met Monroe as she was on her way out shopping with her friend Milton Greene. Mangone's dream came true: she waved, winked and invited him along. Over the course of the afternoon, he filmed her intermittently, without sound, later developing the film and viewing it at home. When Mangone left home, the footage went missing, and was thought to be lost--until 2002, when his brother found it among their father's possessions, virtually in mint condition. \"It was like refinding my high school sweetheart,\" he said. \"She was just the way I remembered her.\" This book of stills from Mangone's five-minute movie shows the great screen siren in wonderful moments of unguardedness, against the Chevys and Checker cabs of 1950s midtown Manhattan. The great charm of Mangone's images lies at the opposite end of familiar portraits by Cecil Beaton, Elliott Erwitt and co.: in his 14-year-old hands, through the grainy Kodak film, with its erratic lighting, Marilyn remains every inch the icon.\r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":26911809,"name":"Default","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":27.5,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84288561/-/IMG_6588.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84288561/-/IMG_6588.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84288597/-/IMG_6590.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84288597/-/IMG_6590.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84288633/-/IMG_6591.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84288633/-/IMG_6591.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84288645/-/IMG_6592.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84288645/-/IMG_6592.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84288669/-/IMG_6594.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84288669/-/IMG_6594.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":8558523,"name":"Saul Leiter - Saul Leiter","permalink":"saul-leiter-saul-leiter","position":76,"price":65.0,"default_price":65.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/saul-leiter-saul-leiter","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-15T02:25:17.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Saul Leiter </i>\r\nSail Leiter\r\n(ed.) Ingo Taubhorn\r\nText by Vince Aletti, Adam Harrison Levy, Carrie Springer, Margit Erb, Rolf Nobel, Ulrich Rüter & Brigitte Woischnik.\r\n\r\n9.1 x 11 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n155 color & b&w illustrations\r\n\r\nPublished by Kehrer Verlag\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Saul Leiter (b. 1923 in Pittsburgh) has only in recent years received his due as one of the great pioneers of color photography. This can perhaps be attributed to the fact that Leiter saw himself for a long time mainly as a painter.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> After coming to New York in 1946, he exhibited alongside abstract expressionists like Willem de Kooning before beginning in the late 1940s to take photographs. Like Robert Frank or Helen Levitt, he found his motifs on the streets of New York, but at the same time was visibly interested in abstraction. Edward Steichen was one of the first to discover Leiter's photography, showing it in the 1950s in two important exhibitions at New York's Museum of Modern Art. Back then color photography was regarded as \"low art,\" fit only for advertising. Leiter accordingly worked primarily as a fashion photographer, for magazines such as <i>Esquire</i> and <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>. Nearly forty years would go by before his extraordinary artistic color photography was rediscovered.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> This book, published to mark the first major retrospective of Leiter's work anywhere in the world, features for the first time, in addition to his early black and white and color images, his fashion photography, the overpainted nudes, as well as his paintings and sketchbooks.\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":26886123,"name":"Default","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":27.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84188121/-/IMG_6441.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84188121/-/IMG_6441.jpg","width":1000,"height":751},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84188205/-/IMG_6442.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84188205/-/IMG_6442.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84188277/-/IMG_6444.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84188277/-/IMG_6444.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84188349/-/IMG_6445.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84188349/-/IMG_6445.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84188481/-/IMG_6447.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84188481/-/IMG_6447.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":8568549,"name":"Toiletpaper Magazine - July 2012","permalink":"toiletpaper-magazine-july-2012","position":77,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/toiletpaper-magazine-july-2012","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-16T00:11:56.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i>Toiletpaper Magazine - July 2012</i>\r\nMaurizio Cattelan\r\n\r\n9 x 11 1/2 in.\r\nSoftcover\r\n42 pages\r\n \r\nPublished by Deste Foundation\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Specially created by Maurizio Cattelan in collaboration with fellow countryman Pierpaolo Ferrari for Cattelan's major retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, Toilet Paper 4 is a brilliant new creation from the aberrant, animated mind of the Italian-born provocateur, mischief-maker and macabre witness to our times. Published by Deste, this part artist's book, part magazine contains no text; only full spreads of color photographs with imagery that often appropriates the slick production values of commercial photography to deliver dreamlike (or nightmarish) images that are as appropriate for the coffee table as they are for the WC. In an interview with Vogue Italia, Ferrari said that \"the magazine springs from a passion/obsession that Maurizio and I have in common. Each picture springs from an idea, even a simple one, and then becomes a complex orchestration of people who build tableaux vivants. This project is also a sort of mental outburst.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":26911692,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84287793/-/IMG_6559.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84287793/-/IMG_6559.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84287817/-/IMG_6560.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84287817/-/IMG_6560.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84287841/-/IMG_6561.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84287841/-/IMG_6561.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84287865/-/IMG_6562.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84287865/-/IMG_6562.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84287889/-/IMG_6563.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84287889/-/IMG_6563.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3373415,"name":"ART & DESIGN BOOKS","permalink":"art-design-books","url":"/category/art-design-books"},{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":8567907,"name":"Vivian Maier: Out of the Shadows - Richard Cahan & Michael Williams","permalink":"vivian-maier-out-of-the-shadows-richard-cahan-michael-williams","position":78,"price":60.0,"default_price":60.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/vivian-maier-out-of-the-shadows-richard-cahan-michael-williams","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-15T23:06:29.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i>Vivian Maier: Out of the Shadows</i>\r\nRichard Cahan & Michael Williams\r\n\r\n8 x 10 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n288 pages\r\n300+ duotone plates\r\n\r\nPublished by City Files Press\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Vivian Maier created more than 100,000 negatives during her long life. Only a few of those pictures were ever seen by others. Shortly after Maier died in April of 2009, the first large batch of her unseen photographs—gritty with humanity and filled with empathy and beauty—were shown on a web site. Word of the work spread quickly. “The frames are so spontaneous,” said Mary Ellen Mark, one of the most celebrated photographers of our time. “She is just looking at life and capturing moments that are real. So few people know how to shoot like that.”\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><i>Vivian Maier: Out of the Shadows</i> is the first attempt to put Maier’s work in context. It is based on the Jeffrey Goldstein Collection, a treasure trove of nearly 20,000 black-and-white negatives, color slides, and vintage prints. When combined with interviews with those who knew the photographer best, a remarkable portrait emerges. \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":26909988,"name":"Default","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":27.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84280245/-/IMG_6505.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84280245/-/IMG_6505.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84280257/-/IMG_6507.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84280257/-/IMG_6507.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84280293/-/IMG_6508.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84280293/-/IMG_6508.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84280305/-/IMG_6509.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84280305/-/IMG_6509.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84280329/-/IMG_6512.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84280329/-/IMG_6512.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":8568189,"name":"<i>Echoes of the Future: Rational Graphic Design and Illustration</i>","permalink":"i-echoes-of-the-future-rational-graphic-design-and-illustration-i","position":79,"price":55.0,"default_price":55.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/i-echoes-of-the-future-rational-graphic-design-and-illustration-i","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-15T23:37:27.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i>Echoes of the Future: Rational Graphic Design and Illustration</i>\r\n\r\n9.44 x 11 in.\r\nSoftcover\r\n176 pages\r\n176 color illustrations\r\n\r\nPublished by Gestalten\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><i>Echoes of the Future</i> is a stunning compilation of recent graphic design and illustration that is inspired by our collective visual memory. Today’s young designers are not copying elements from classic modernism, letterpress printing, and other design styles of the past, but rather, they are synthesizing them to create a new aesthetic that emanates quality, timelessness, and sustainability.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book showcases an up-to-the-minute style trend that promotes the impression of visual longevity in these times of economic uncertainty and contrasts sharply with the rapidly shifting styles of previous years that seemed out-of-date almost immediately. While the work featured in Echoes of the Future deliberately seems older, one realizes how clearly different and contemporary it is when confronted with genuine examples from the past.\r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":26910678,"name":"Default","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":27.5,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84283485/-/IMG_6535.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84283485/-/IMG_6535.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84283509/-/IMG_6536.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84283509/-/IMG_6536.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84283533/-/IMG_6538.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84283533/-/IMG_6538.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84283545/-/IMG_6539.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84283545/-/IMG_6539.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84283557/-/IMG_6540.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84283557/-/IMG_6540.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3373415,"name":"ART & DESIGN BOOKS","permalink":"art-design-books","url":"/category/art-design-books"}]},{"id":8567091,"name":"Painting People: Figure Painting Today","permalink":"painting-people-figure-painting-today","position":80,"price":29.95,"default_price":29.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/painting-people-figure-painting-today","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-15T21:58:03.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Painting People: Figure Painting Today </i>\r\nEssay by Charlotte Mullins\r\n\r\n9 x 11 in.\r\nSoftcover\r\n192 pages\r\n150 color plates\r\n\r\nPublished by D.A.P.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">After a century in which the lexicon of artists' materials expanded from the classic oil, canvas, stone and plaster to include photography, film, performance, found objects and concepts, the spotlight has finally swung back. A new generation of artists--as well as some who never abandoned figurative painting in the first place--is relishing the solitary, slow, subtle set of processes involved in not just painting, but painting people. They are choosing paint's unique ability to distill a lifetime of events rather than photography's glimpse of a frozen moment. <i> Painting People </i>, edited by the prominent London art historian and critic Charlotte Mullins, unites and contrasts the work of a key group of artists from around the world, and investigates their richly varied accomplishments in lucid text with detailed commentaries, accompanied by more than 150 reproductions. The list of contributing artists is stellar, ranging from photo-based painters like Luc Tuymans, Peter Doig and Marlene Dumas to Pop artists like Sigmar Polke and Alex Katz, photorealists like Chuck Close and Gerhard Richter, Neoexpressionists like Cecily Brown, and comics-inspired painters like Yoshitomo Nara, Inka Essenhigh and Takashi Murakami. There are erotic grotesques from John Currin and Lisa Yuskavage, meditations on the muse by Elizabeth Peyton and Lucian Freud, \"Repro-realistic\" work from Neo Rauch and of course self-portraits by Philip Akkerman and Marcel Dzama, among others.\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":26907828,"name":"Default","price":29.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":27.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84271653/-/IMG_6450.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84271653/-/IMG_6450.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84271677/-/IMG_6451_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84271677/-/IMG_6451_1.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84271701/-/IMG_6453.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84271701/-/IMG_6453.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84271725/-/IMG_6454.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84271725/-/IMG_6454.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84271737/-/IMG_6455.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84271737/-/IMG_6455.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3373415,"name":"ART & DESIGN BOOKS","permalink":"art-design-books","url":"/category/art-design-books"}]},{"id":8558250,"name":"Barry McGee - (ed.)

Lawrence Rinder, Dena Beard.\r\nText Alex Baker, Natasha Boas, Germano Celant, Jeffrey Deitch\r\n\r\n6.7 x 9.3 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n448 pages\r\n450 color plates\r\n15 b&w plates\r\n\r\nPublished by D.A.P./University of California, Berkeley Art Museum & Pacific Film Archive\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Published on the occasion of the first major survey of Barry McGee's work, this monumental volume records more than two decades of incredible fecundity, over the course of which McGee has pioneered a new iconography of sharp street vitality and graphic snap. McGee began as a graffiti artist on the streets of San Francisco, working under such tags as Ray Fong, Twist and Twisto, and his work since then has hugely expanded the terms of both street art and contemporary art. The freshness of McGee's work stems in part from his virtuoso handling and consolidation of a whole panoply of influences, from hobo art, sign painting and graffiti to comics, Beat literature and much else. His extraordinary skill as a draughtsman is energized by his insistence on pushing at the parameters of art--his work can be shockingly informal in the gallery and surprisingly elegant on the street--and by his keen nose for social malaise.\r\nThis volume revisits McGee's most influential installations in art spaces, and considers the evolution of his aesthetic within institutional settings. Previously unseen photographs by Craig Costello document the artist's work on the streets of San Francisco in the early 90s, highlighting the contributions of his friends and mentors. Also included are images from the artist's famous slide lecture, compiled and refined over the past 20 years, and an oral history of the Bay Area's Mission School by McGee's friends, mentors and collaborators. Featuring 450 images, including many never before published, the book is designed by the artist in collaboration with Conny Purtill.\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":26885406,"name":"Default","price":49.95,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":27.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84186681/-/IMG_6425.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84186681/-/IMG_6425.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84186717/-/IMG_6426.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84186717/-/IMG_6426.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84186729/-/IMG_6428.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84186729/-/IMG_6428.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84186813/-/IMG_6430.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84186813/-/IMG_6430.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84186837/-/IMG_6432.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84186837/-/IMG_6432.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3373415,"name":"ART & DESIGN BOOKS","permalink":"art-design-books","url":"/category/art-design-books"}]},{"id":8480412,"name":"Matador -

The central figure in his universe is that of an individual lying prostrate in the midst of his fellow men, whether praying, crippled, begging, morally broken or even murdered.

From high art, through to commercial commissions, fashion shoots, and vivid still lifes, the scale of Araki’s range of work is unsurpassed. In addition to his chameleonic capacity for stylistic variances, Araki’s emotional approach also runs the gamut. Often displaying a wicked sense of humour, Araki is also notable for a distinct humanistic vein of sentimentality that has spanned his career. A profound example is the documentation of his relationship with his wife, capturing the euphoria and lust of their honeymoon through to the sadness and longing resulting from her decline and untimely death from cancer. Always present is entire spectrum of emotions—urge, love, elation, loss, and grief—essentially the spectrum of life captured on the page.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> All the while, Araki remains a master of constructing narrative in his books by playing with sequence and time—often altering the digital auto-date settings to draw a determined emotional response from his viewer. In this sense, Araki plays the role of trickster, affecting certain impulses. The result of which is a new reality arising from artifice, defined by subversion, chicanery, and white lies.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> <I> To The Past </i> focuses on his auto-dated photo diary black and white photographs, spanning monumentally from Araki’s adoption of the process in 1979, up until the day of the great Japanese earthquake in March, 2011. Ordered ‘chronologically,’ Araki’s masterful editing defines a clear narrative of passing time and life over 32 years. The edit, often with the sublime sitting next to the seemingly mundane gives further charge to all images both individually and as a whole, and each can be viewed as a link between moments previous and following. <I> To The Past </i>, viewed alongside Araki’s many other books can be seen, paradoxically in light of its chronological fraudulence, as an exceedingly open and frank dialogue about universal truths—joy, and sadness, life and, ultimately, death. While an inherent honesty and nostalgia are hallmarks of much of Araki’s previous work, the level of reflection and openness on display in <I> To The Past </i> can clearly be read as the tenderising influence of age, illness, and experience.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> The narrative arc of <I> To The Past </i> begins during Araki’s early forties. On a SONY television, we see projected the ruins of Hiroshima—a post-war mash-up with both ‘new’ and ‘old’ Japans. Tender images of his wife Yoko, his contemporaries and friends are ballasted by the devastating frankness of Yoko’s death—a heartrending and sentimentally charged image of him holding her hand in hospital sears emotionally. Throughout, familiar themes emerge—Araki’s beloved cat Chiro, scenes of rope bondage, and his boundless sexual appetite. Towards the end of the book, we observe Araki undergoing treatment for his own fight with cancer, before finally ending on two images taken on the day of the earthquake—the negatives distressed and scratched as a traumatic reaction. With reference to the first atomic disaster near the beginning, and the second at the end <I> To The Past </i> is an edition defined by uncertainty and remains open-ended both back and forth. To highlight this sense of linear control, the title of the book gives insight to Araki’s clever manipulations as he pulls the viewer backwards to the past whilst maintaining perpetual motion forward.\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":23635139,"name":"Default","price":325.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73384343/-/IMG_5940.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73384343/-/IMG_5940.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73384357/-/IMG_5946.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73384357/-/IMG_5946.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73384409/-/IMG_5948.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73384409/-/IMG_5948.jpg","width":1000,"height":731},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73384445/-/IMG_5962.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73384445/-/IMG_5962.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73384517/-/IMG_5960.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73384517/-/IMG_5960.jpg","width":1000,"height":914}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"},{"id":2846891,"name":"COLLECTIBLE & RARE","permalink":"collectible-rare","url":"/category/collectible-rare"}]},{"id":7369059,"name":"Folding Space/Pressing Time - Dan Gluibizzi & Zefrey Throwell","permalink":"folding-space-pressing-time-dan-gluibizzi-zefrey-throwell","position":90,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/folding-space-pressing-time-dan-gluibizzi-zefrey-throwell","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-27T03:56:26.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Folding Space/Pressing Time </i>\r\nDan Gluibizzi & Zefrey Throwell\r\n\r\n5 x 7 in. \r\nPerfect bound soft cover\r\n90 pages \r\n80 color illustrations \r\nPrinted on Mohawk Superfine paper\r\nWrapped in Ultra Sheer panty hose\r\n\r\nPublished & designed by Ampersand\r\nPrinted & bound in Portland, Oregon\r\n\r\nEdition of 200\r\n\r\nSigned & numbered copies with original art by Throwell & Gluibizzi are available <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/category/zefrey-throwell\"> here </a> & <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/product/folding-space-pressing-time-signed-w-original-watercolor-painting\">here. </a>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> <i> Folding Space/Pressing Time </i> coincides with a September, 2012 exhibition at Ampersand by Gluibizzi & Throwell titled <i> There is no finish line. </i> Similar to the show stylistically, the book is a stand-alone conceptual exploration in which Gluibizzi vibrantly distorts sexually charged Tumblr archive grids & Throwell gives photographic form to the erotic chaos that plagues his recurring dreams of time travel.

To create his work, Layton first photographs a museum specimen using a restored 11x14-inch mahogany Deardoff camera, fitted with vintage Pinkham & Smith lenses. After making a cyanotype of the image, Layton then painstakingly hand paints the resulting print in subtle hues of color. Each print in the edition is therefore unique, and as much an object as a photographic print. Layton’s work makes obvious reference to naturalist John James Audubon and his majestic illustrations in Birds of America. However, his photographs owe as much to John Ruskin and the Arts and Crafts movement’s emphasis on naturalism and craftsmanship. Although Layton’s work operates at the intersection of science and art, it is a call to beauty, not a diagram of reality. Laszlo Layton’s work is widely exhibited and collected.

Shot in color, the photographs also utilize the ParkeHarrisons’ early technique of applying pigment by hand, directly to their large-scale prints. Robert ParkeHarrison once again appears as the Everyman of the book’s visual narrative--one who despite the will to effect change, is all too often rendered impotent and ineffectual. The ParkeHarrisons also explore the epic landscape as a metaphor for the state of mankind, particularly alluding to recent natural disasters and their aftermath.\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":26911212,"name":"Default","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":27.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84286149/-/IMG_6547.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84286149/-/IMG_6547.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84286161/-/IMG_6548.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84286161/-/IMG_6548.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84286173/-/IMG_6549.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84286173/-/IMG_6549.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84286185/-/IMG_6550.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84286185/-/IMG_6550.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84286209/-/IMG_6552.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84286209/-/IMG_6552.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":8568069,"name":"Letman Graphic Design & Illustration: The Artwork and Lettering of Job Wouters","permalink":"letman-graphic-design-illustration-the-artwork-and-lettering-of-job-wouters","position":95,"price":45.0,"default_price":45.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/letman-graphic-design-illustration-the-artwork-and-lettering-of-job-wouters","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-15T23:26:22.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i>Letman Graphic Design & Illustration: The Artwork and Lettering of Job Wouters</i>\r\nLetman\r\n\r\n8.2 x 10.2 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n160 pages\r\n160 color illustrations\r\n\r\nPublished by Gestalten\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Letman is internationally known for his trailblazing synthesis of illustration and lettering.

On the heels of his major traveling retrospective, this volume compiles around 100 works including drawings, watercolors and an ink-on-paper series. The drawings range from ballpoint studies of exhibition spaces to delicate sketches of a woman breastfeeding, or the folds in a child's socks. Also included is the 1971 \"Two Sculptures for a Room by Palermo,\" which consists of painted bronze busts of Palermo and Richter.

Currin shows how he went about changing night skies into ocean horizons, how a Russian bra evolved upon a pair of bare breasts and why his wife's face underwent a lengthy transformation and traded features with a 1980s newscaster and then a 1970s Danish porn star. It also displays the delicate balancing act Currin maintains more generally in his work as he maneuvers between a broad range of cultural references, from women's magazine photography and photorealist kitsch to Renaissance oil painting drapery and personal narrative. Combining visual documentation with a lecture Currin gave at the Acadia Summer Arts Program in 2010, this book is, as the artist puts it, \"partly just to show kind of what I go through to make a painting,\" but \"also to dispel any notion that it's a good thing to work on a painting for six years.\"\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"left\"> <font size=\"1.5\" face=\"Helvetica\">  Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandgallery.tumblr.com/\"> <i>here</i> </a> to take a look at our <a href=\"http://www.ampersandgallery.tumblr.com/\"> Blog</a>. </font></div> \r\n","options":[{"id":26191413,"name":"Default","price":40.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":27.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81793581/-/IMG_6404.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81793581/-/IMG_6404.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81793593/-/IMG_6405.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81793593/-/IMG_6405.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81793650/-/IMG_6406.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81793650/-/IMG_6406.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81793665/-/IMG_6408.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81793665/-/IMG_6408.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81793677/-/IMG_6409.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81793677/-/IMG_6409.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3373415,"name":"ART & DESIGN BOOKS","permalink":"art-design-books","url":"/category/art-design-books"}]},{"id":8315598,"name":"Daido Moriyama - Daido Moriyama","permalink":"daido-moriyama-daido-moriyama","position":102,"price":14.95,"default_price":14.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/daido-moriyama-daido-moriyama","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-01T22:43:56.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Daido Moriyama </i>\r\nDaido Moriyama\r\n\r\n6 1/8 x 5 3/8 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n128 pages\r\n56 black & white plates\r\n\r\nPublished by Phaidon. \r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Contemporary Japanese photographer Daido Moriyama (b.1938) has made a radical impact on the photographic world in both Japan and in the West. His snapshot aesthetic and no-viewfinder style have succeeded in challenging the medium's prevailing orthodoxies. Moriyama was a member of the famous PROVOKE magazine, and a lecturer and theorist, influencing the new generation of Japanese photographers. This monograph documents the development of Moriyama's photography through a chronologically presented sequence of 55 images. An introductory essay provides a fresh perspective on Moriyama’s life and work.

Lauder Collection </i>\r\nText Lynda Klich, Benjamin Weiss.\r\nPreface Leonard A. Lauder\r\n\r\n9 1/2 x 8 1/2 in.\r\nHardback\r\n370 pages\r\n295 images\r\n\r\nPublished by Museum of Fine Arts, Boston\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">In the decades around 1900, postcards were Twitter, email, Flickr and Facebook, all wrapped into one. A postcard craze swept the world, and billions of cards were bought, mailed and pasted into albums. Many famous artists turned to the new medium, but one of the great pleasures and enigmas of postcards is how some of the most beautiful and interesting examples were made by artists whose names we barely know. Drawing on the riches of the Leonard A. Lauder Postcard Collection (probably the finest and most comprehensive collection of its type), this gorgeous book traces the historical and cultural themes--enthralling, exciting, and sometimes disturbing--of the modern age. The first general publication on the postcard as an artistic medium since the mid-1970s, The Postcard Age is organized thematically, with chapters devoted to urban life, the changing role of women, sports, celebrity, new technologies, the stylish collectors’ cards of Art Nouveau and World War I. The result is at once a vivid picture of the concerns and pastimes of the turn of the century and a sampler from the Lauder’s vast archives.\r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":24637806,"name":"Default","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":52.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76663752/-/IMG_6131.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76663752/-/IMG_6131.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76663800/-/IMG_6134.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76663800/-/IMG_6134.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76663812/-/IMG_6135.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76663812/-/IMG_6135.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76663824/-/IMG_6136.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76663824/-/IMG_6136.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76663884/-/IMG_6138.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76663884/-/IMG_6138.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3373415,"name":"ART & DESIGN BOOKS","permalink":"art-design-books","url":"/category/art-design-books"}]},{"id":7806582,"name":"Symbol - Angus Hyland and Steven Bateman","permalink":"symbol-angus-hyland-and-steven-bateman","position":104,"price":40.0,"default_price":40.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/symbol-angus-hyland-and-steven-bateman","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-03T01:34:38.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Symbol </i>\r\nAngus Hyland and Steven Bateman\r\n\r\n9 1/2 x 7 1/2 in.\r\nPaperback\r\n336 pages\r\n1400 illustrations\r\n\r\nPublished by Laurence King\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">This book features over 1300 symbols, organized into groups and sub-groups according to their visual characteristics.

Melissa Catanese\r\n\r\n9 1/4 x 7 1/2 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n88 pages\r\n57 plates\r\n\r\nPublished by The Ice Plant\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Photographer and bookseller Melissa Catanese has recently been editing the vernacular photography collection of Peter J. Cohen, helping to organize this massive curated archive (a trove of 20,000+ prints) into a series of single-theme catalogues. Along the way, she has pursued an alternate reading of the collection, drifting away from simple typology into something more personal, intuitive, and openly poetic. Her magical new artist book, <i> Dive Dark Dream Slow </i>, is rooted in the mystery and delight of the 'found' image and the 'snapshot' aesthetic, but pushes beneath the nostalgic surface of these pictures, re-reading them as luminous transmissions of anticipation, fear, and desire. Like an album of pop songs about a girl (or a civilization) hovering on the verge of transformation, the book cycles through overlapping themes and counter-themes—moon/ocean; violence/tenderness; innocence/experience; masks/nakedness—that sparkle with psychic longing and apocalyptic comedy.\r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":24636696,"name":"Default","price":29.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":27.5,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76659192/-/IMG_6116.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76659192/-/IMG_6116.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76659204/-/IMG_6118.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76659204/-/IMG_6118.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76659216/-/IMG_6119.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76659216/-/IMG_6119.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76659228/-/IMG_6121.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76659228/-/IMG_6121.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76659252/-/IMG_6124.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76659252/-/IMG_6124.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":7806123,"name":"The Master III - Juergen Teller","permalink":"the-master-iii-juergen-teller","position":106,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-master-iii-juergen-teller","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-03T00:53:29.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> The Master III </i>\r\nJuergen Teller\r\n\r\n9 x 7 in.\r\nSoftcover\r\n52 pages\r\n33 colour plates\r\n\r\nPublished by Steidl\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">In the summer of 2005 Steidl published a small booklet of Juergen Teller’s work, titled <i> The Master</i>.

For Picasso, as for Prince, the theme of the female nude is an abiding motif--\"he never lets go of the body,\" as Prince observes--and Prince's latest nudes are a typically energetic mixture of appropriation and wonderfully crude, irreverent interjection in the fashion of Duchamp, deploying such materials as ink jet printing, oil crayon, pastel, acrylic, graphite and charcoal. The black-and-white photographs of female nudes are derived from recently published anatomy how-to books, and endow Prince's homages with a graceful, rhythmic plasticity. This elegantly produced, linen-bound volume (with a bellyband that doubles as a folded poster), published for a 2012 exhibition at the Museo Picasso in Málaga, presents these works for the first time. It includes a brief interview with Prince and critical commentary by José Lebrero Stals. \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":24636282,"name":"Default","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":27.5,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76657716/-/IMG_6104.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76657716/-/IMG_6104.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76657740/-/IMG_6105.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76657740/-/IMG_6105.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76657764/-/IMG_6106.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76657764/-/IMG_6106.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76657776/-/IMG_6107.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76657776/-/IMG_6107.jpg","width":1000,"height":722},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76657800/-/IMG_6108.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76657800/-/IMG_6108.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3373415,"name":"ART & DESIGN BOOKS","permalink":"art-design-books","url":"/category/art-design-books"}]},{"id":7805940,"name":"Bauhaus: Art as Life - (ed.)

Exemplar works from such Bauhaus Masters as Josef and Anni Albers, Marianne Brandt, Marcel Breuer, Walter Gropius, Johannes Itten, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Hannes Meyer, László Moholy-Nagy, Oskar Schlemmer, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Gunta Stölzl, are illustrated alongside works by lesser-known Bauhaus artists and students. \r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">The catalogue also includes thirteen new essays from historians, curators and academics: Kathleen James-Chakraborty, Michael Siebenbrodt, Catherine Ince, Phillip Oswalt, Phillip Ursprunng, Kalus Weber, Nicholas fox Weber, Melissa trimingham, Torsten Blume, Anja Baumhoff, Lydia Yee and Wolfgang Thöner. \r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Published on the occasion of the exhibition <i> Bauhaus: Art as Life </i> at the Barbican Art Gallery 3 May 2012 – 12 August 2012 \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":24636165,"name":"Default","price":49.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":52.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76657128/-/IMG_6098.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76657128/-/IMG_6098.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76657140/-/IMG_6099.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76657140/-/IMG_6099.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76657164/-/IMG_6100.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76657164/-/IMG_6100.jpg","width":1000,"height":691},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76657176/-/IMG_6101.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76657176/-/IMG_6101.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76657188/-/IMG_6103.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76657188/-/IMG_6103.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3373415,"name":"ART & DESIGN BOOKS","permalink":"art-design-books","url":"/category/art-design-books"}]},{"id":7805838,"name":"101 Tragedies - Enrique Metinides","permalink":"101-tragedies-enrique-metinides","position":110,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/101-tragedies-enrique-metinides","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-03T00:31:36.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> 101 Tragedies </i>\r\nEnrique Metinides\r\n\r\n10 3/8 x 8 1/2 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n184 pages\r\n150 plates\r\n\r\nPublished by Aperture Foundation\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><i> 101 Tragedies </i> is Enrique Metinides' choice of the 101 key images from his life photographing crime scenes and accidents in Mexico for local newspapers and the nota roja (or “red pages,” for their bloody content) crime press. Alongside each image, extended captions give his account of the situation depicted, describing the characters and life of the streets, the sadness of families, the criminals, and the heroism of emergency workers—revealing much about himself in the process. Selected photographs are also paired with their original newsprint tearsheets, collected by Metinides. The photographs have been compiled by Trisha Ziff, a filmmaker and curator who knows Metinides well, and who also contributes an essay about his life, work, and personality. Since all of Metinides’s previous books are out of print, or strictly for art audiences, this will be the only book in print about his life and work. It is also the only Metinides book comprised of images chosen by the photographer himself, and which offers his own account of his life’s work.

For this ongoing documentary project, the artistic duo photograph the airports they passed through in their travels around the world over nearly 25 years, in a quest for exotic banality throughout different cultures. Their images of these nondescript airports focus on the humdrum aspect of air travel: the fuel vehicles, the baggage trucks, the daily routines of airport workers, the long antiseptic corridors and sprawling tarmacs surrounded by panoramic views of empty vistas. Whether presenting a Lufthansa airplane sitting idle in a yellowy light, a Swiss Air plane waiting in a neon-haunted dusk or an Air France plane getting its belly filled in the dead of night, Fischli and Weiss's images present the evanescence of any national identity when reduced to a symbol on a vertical stabilizer. <i> 800 Views of Airports </i> reveal the non-places encircling our world, and the non-journeys that have come to define our contemporary life in transit, while simultaneously offering carefully composed images that are strangely placid and restful.\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":24635154,"name":"Default","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":52.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76654572/-/IMG_6064.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76654572/-/IMG_6064.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76654728/-/IMG_6065.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76654728/-/IMG_6065.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76654746/-/IMG_6067.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76654746/-/IMG_6067.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76654800/-/IMG_6071.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76654800/-/IMG_6071.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76654824/-/IMG_6073.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76654824/-/IMG_6073.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":7377349,"name":"Folding Space/Pressing Time - Signed w/ Original Screen Print on Collage No. 2","permalink":"folding-space-pressing-time-signed-w-original-screen-print-on-collage-no-2","position":113,"price":100.0,"default_price":100.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/folding-space-pressing-time-signed-w-original-screen-print-on-collage-no-2","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-27T22:58:41.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Folding Space/Pressing Time </i>\r\nDan Gluibizzi & Zefrey Throwell\r\n\r\n5 x 7 in. \r\nPerfect bound soft cover\r\n90 pages \r\n80 color illustrations \r\nPrinted on Mohawk Superfine paper\r\nWrapped in Ultra Sheer panty hose\r\n\r\nPublished & designed by Ampersand\r\nPrinted & bound in Portland, Oregon\r\n\r\nEdition of 200\r\n\r\nNumbers 1-10 are signed & numbered by Throwell & include an original screen print on collage that is signed & dated on the verso, shown at left.

In this, it mimics well the dynamic space-time jumble of disorienting dreams or the increasingly authorless & temporally indeterminate web space that is rapidly redefining what we think of as image archives. <p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":23334625,"name":"Default","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.5,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72375039/-/IMG_5894.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72375039/-/IMG_5894.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72375103/-/IMG_5871.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72375103/-/IMG_5871.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72375159/-/IMG_5883.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72375159/-/IMG_5883.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72375223/-/IMG_5888.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72375223/-/IMG_5888.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72375247/-/IMG_5887.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72375247/-/IMG_5887.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2909547,"name":"AMPERSAND PUBLICATIONS","permalink":"ampersand-publications","url":"/category/ampersand-publications"},{"id":3375767,"name":"SIGNED","permalink":"signed","url":"/category/signed"}]},{"id":7345331,"name":"The Shins - Downtime","permalink":"the-shins-downtime","position":122,"price":30.0,"default_price":30.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-shins-downtime","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-24T23:38:23.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> The Shins - Downtime </i>\r\nCompiled & Edited by Davey Brozowski & Patrick Pendergast\r\n\r\n5 x 7 in. \r\nPerfect bound soft cover\r\n157 pages \r\n73 color illustrations \r\nPrinted on Mohawk Superfine paper\r\n\r\nForeword by James Mercer\r\n\r\nPublished by Aural Apothecary\r\nDesign & production by Ampersand\r\nPrinted & bound in Portland, Oregon\r\n\r\nEdition of 500\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> There’s a lot of time to be wasted on a tour. The time in between the things you have to do.  Between the load-in, set-up, the press, catering, drinking, performing, tear down, more drinking, sleeping, etc. You can only read so much and it’s a very solitary thing. Only so many calls you can make to your people back home.  Over the last year or so, taking pictures has become a favorite pastime for the Shins and crew.  Doctoring them with cheap software and sharing them. Trying to impress or amuse each other.  Looking back we realized there was some pretty interesting stuff coming together.  We hope you like this collection.  They’re sort of the bastard children of consumer electronics and the weird art that is photography. We had a lot of fun making them, and some of us got pretty creative during those otherwise wasted hours of downtime.<br>\r\n- James Mercer\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":23242111,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72073125/-/IMG_58370000.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72073125/-/IMG_58370000.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72073239/-/IMG_58410000.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72073239/-/IMG_58410000.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72073285/-/IMG_58440001.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72073285/-/IMG_58440001.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72073307/-/IMG_58510000.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72073307/-/IMG_58510000.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72073333/-/IMG_58620000.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72073333/-/IMG_58620000.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"},{"id":2846891,"name":"COLLECTIBLE & RARE","permalink":"collectible-rare","url":"/category/collectible-rare"}]},{"id":7069821,"name":"Patterns - Gerhard Richter ","permalink":"patterns-gerhard-richter","position":124,"price":45.0,"default_price":45.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/patterns-gerhard-richter","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-27T01:41:36.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Patterns </i>\r\nGerhard Richter\r\n\r\n8 1/4 x 5 1/2 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n488 pages\r\nIllustrated throughout \r\n\r\nPublished by D.A.P./Distributed Art Publishers, 2012\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> <i> Patterns </I> represents a brilliant new adventure in image-making & book-making by Gerhard Richter, who in recent years has produced several fascinating explorations of the possibilities of the artist’s book. For this latest project, Richter took an image of his work “Abstract Painting” (CR: 7244) & divided it vertically into strips: first 2, then 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1,024, 2,048, up to 4,096 strips. This process, involving twelve stages of division, results in 8,190 strips, each of which is reproduced here at the height of the original image. With each stage of division, the strips become progressively thinner (a strip of the 12th division is just 0.08 millimeters; further divisions would only become visible by enlargement). Each strip is then mirrored & repeated, producing an incredibly detailed patterning. The number of repetitions increases with each stage of division in order to make patterns of consistent size. The resulting 221 patterns are reproduced here on landscape spreads, making for a truly extraordinary reading-viewing book experience.\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":22376369,"name":"Default","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69349057/-/IMG_5708.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69349057/-/IMG_5708.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69349075/-/IMG_5709.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69349075/-/IMG_5709.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69349203/-/IMG_5710.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69349203/-/IMG_5710.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69349225/-/IMG_5711.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69349225/-/IMG_5711.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69349243/-/IMG_5712.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69349243/-/IMG_5712.jpg","width":800,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3373415,"name":"ART & DESIGN BOOKS","permalink":"art-design-books","url":"/category/art-design-books"}]},{"id":7069771,"name":"Luigi Ghirri: Project Prints","permalink":"luigi-ghirri-project-prints","position":125,"price":55.0,"default_price":55.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/luigi-ghirri-project-prints","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-27T01:34:17.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Luigi Ghirri: Project Prints </i>\r\nEdited by Elena Re\r\nText by Text by Andrea Bellini, Luigi Ghirri, Paola Ghirri, Massimo Minimi, Elena Re.\r\n\r\n10 1/4 x 7 3/4 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n180 pages \r\n200 color plates\r\n\r\nPublished by JRP|Ringier, 2012\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> The color photographs of Luigi Ghirri (born 1943) revolutionized Italian photography in the 1970s with their gentle humor & appearance of compositional ease. Often compared with the snapshot compositions of Lee Friedlander or William Eggleston, Ghirri’s photographs, often verging on the surreal with their imaginative framing devices & visual puns, placed him in a category all his own. In the early 1980s, Ghirri began to use a medium-format camera that allowed him to produce large, richly textured negatives from whose contact sheets he would extract individual shots. He would then rearrange these small images in various permutations. These “project prints” enabled Ghirri to organize his work in a format that he maintained from the early 1980s until his death in 1992. They are now published for the first time in this volume.\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":22376241,"name":"Default","price":55.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69348627/-/IMG_5693.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69348627/-/IMG_5693.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69348635/-/IMG_5694.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69348635/-/IMG_5694.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69348649/-/IMG_5695.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69348649/-/IMG_5695.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69348659/-/IMG_5696.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69348659/-/IMG_5696.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69348667/-/IMG_5697.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69348667/-/IMG_5697.jpg","width":800,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":7069867,"name":"Robert Capa: The Definitive Collection - Richard Whelan ","permalink":"robert-capa-the-definitive-collection-richard-whelan","position":126,"price":45.0,"default_price":45.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/robert-capa-the-definitive-collection-richard-whelan","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-27T01:51:09.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Robert Capa: The Definitive Collection </i>\r\nRichard Whelan \r\n\r\n9 7/8 x 9 7/8 in.\r\nPaperback\r\n572 pages\r\n937 Duotone Photos\r\n\r\nPublished by Phaidon \r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> <I> Robert Capa: The Definitive Collection </I> is the first book to reproduce the definitive set of 937 rarely seen and classic images by Robert Capa (1913-54), one of the most influential documentary photographers of the twentieth century. Capa, a founding member of Magnum photographic agency, had the mind of a passionate & committed journalist and the eye of an artist. His lifework, consisting of more than 70,000 negatives, constitutes an unparalleled documentation of a crucial 22-year period (1932-54), encompassing some of the most catastrophic & dramatic events of the last century.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> This book represents the most definitive selection of Capa's work ever published - 937 photographs meticulously selected by his brother Cornell Capa (himself a noted Life photographer), & his biographer, Richard Whelan. The photographs, arranged in chronological order as stories & accompanied by brief commentaries, reveal the dramatic shifts in location and subject matter that Capa experienced from day to day - from war-torn Israel to Pablo Picasso on a sunny beach in France, & from Ernest Hemingway carousing in London to Capa's historic images of the Allied landing on Omaha Beach in Normandy in 1944.\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":22376541,"name":"Default","price":45.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":45.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69349691/-/IMG_5686.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69349691/-/IMG_5686.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69349707/-/IMG_5687.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69349707/-/IMG_5687.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69349715/-/IMG_5688.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69349715/-/IMG_5688.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69349729/-/IMG_5689.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69349729/-/IMG_5689.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69349751/-/IMG_5690.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69349751/-/IMG_5690.jpg","width":800,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":7069963,"name":"Immediate Family - Sally Mann","permalink":"immediate-family-sally-mann","position":127,"price":29.95,"default_price":29.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/immediate-family-sally-mann","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-27T02:04:52.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Immediate Family </i>\r\nSally Mann\r\n\r\n11 x 9 1/2 in.\r\npaperback\r\n88 pages\r\n74 b/w photographs\r\n\r\nAfterword by Reynolds Price\r\n\r\nPublished by Aperture\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Many designers use folding techniques in their work to make three-dimensional forms from two-dimensional sheets of fabric, cardboard, plastic, metal & many other materials.

The focus means that work that is rarely reproduced is represented extensively, providing a unique opportunity to study the rapid artistic development of Schiele over the course of his brief twelve-year career.\r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":22376673,"name":"Default","price":34.95,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69349987/-/IMG_5748.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69349987/-/IMG_5748.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69349995/-/IMG_5749.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69349995/-/IMG_5749.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69350011/-/IMG_5750.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69350011/-/IMG_5750.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69350027/-/IMG_5751.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69350027/-/IMG_5751.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69350035/-/IMG_5752.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69350035/-/IMG_5752.jpg","width":800,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3373415,"name":"ART & DESIGN BOOKS","permalink":"art-design-books","url":"/category/art-design-books"}]},{"id":7069729,"name":"Thinking with Type - Ellen Lupton","permalink":"thinking-with-type-ellen-lupton","position":129,"price":24.95,"default_price":24.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/thinking-with-type-ellen-lupton","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-27T01:26:32.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i>Thinking with Type </i>\r\nEllen Lupton\r\n\r\n7 x 8 1/2 in.\r\nPaperback\r\n224 pages\r\n100 color illustrations \r\n\r\nPublished by Princeton Architectural Press\r\nSecond revised & expanded edition, 2010\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> <i> Thinking with Type </i> is the definitive guide to using typography in visual communication, from the printed page to the computer screen.

Martin attributed her grid-based works to metaphysical motivations, lending a serene complexity to her oeuvre that has defied any easy categorization. Perhaps for this reason, critical & scholarly analysis of her paintings has been scarce—until now. This important new anthology brings together the most current scholarship on Martin’s paintings by twelve multidisciplinary essayists who consider various aspects of the artist’s four-decade career.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Organized by Dia Art Foundation, whose extensive holdings of Martin’s paintings and ambitions to support in-depth research on the works are unparalleled, the publication brings renewed focus and energy to Martin’s career and her contributions to the art historical narrative. \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":22375443,"name":"Default","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69344339/-/IMG_5595.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69344339/-/IMG_5595.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69344363/-/IMG_5596.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69344363/-/IMG_5596.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69344371/-/IMG_5597.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69344371/-/IMG_5597.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69344387/-/IMG_5598.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69344387/-/IMG_5598.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3373415,"name":"ART & DESIGN BOOKS","permalink":"art-design-books","url":"/category/art-design-books"}]},{"id":7069317,"name":"Diane Arbus: A Chronology - Elisabeth Sussman","permalink":"diane-arbus-a-chronology-elisabeth-sussman","position":134,"price":29.95,"default_price":29.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/diane-arbus-a-chronology-elisabeth-sussman","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-27T00:27:36.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Diane Arbus: A Chrononlogy </i>\r\nElisabeth Sussman & Doon Arbus\r\n\r\n6 1/4 x 8 in.\r\nPaperback\r\n177 pages\r\n\r\n\r\nPublished by Aperture \r\nFirst edition, 2011\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> <i> Diane Arbus: A Chronology </i> is the closest thing possible to a contemporaneous diary by one of the most daring, influential & controversial artists of the twentieth century. Drawn primarily from Arbus' extensive correspondence with friends, family & colleagues, personal notebooks & other unpublished writings, this beautifully produced volume reveals the private thoughts & motivations of an artist whose astonishing vision derived from the courage to see things as they are & the grace to permit them simply to be. Further rounding out Arbus' life & work are exhaustively researched footnotes that amplify the entire chronology. A section at the end of the book provides biographies for 55 family members, friends & colleagues, from Marvin Israel and Lisette Model to Weegee & August Sander. Describing the Chronology in Art in America, Leo Rubinfien noted that \"Arbus... wrote as well as she photographed, & her letters, where she heard each nuance of her words, were gifts to the people who received them.

The book is divided into a series of thematic and broadly chronological chapters; each features a general introductory text that offers background information and highlights the dominant political and artistic influences on the photobook in the relevant period, followed by more detailed discussion of the individual photobooks.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> The chapter texts are followed by spreads and images from over 200 books, which provide the central means of telling the history of the photobook. Assimilated diligently by Parr and Badger, these illustrations show around 200 of the most artistically and culturally important photobooks featuring the cover or jacket and a selection of spreads. \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":22373945,"name":"Default","price":90.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":50.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69338777/-/IMG_5739.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69338777/-/IMG_5739.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69338867/-/IMG_5741.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69338867/-/IMG_5741.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69338889/-/IMG_5742.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69338889/-/IMG_5742.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69338899/-/IMG_5743.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69338899/-/IMG_5743.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69338947/-/IMG_5744.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69338947/-/IMG_5744.jpg","width":800,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":7003527,"name":"Visual Complexity - Mapping Patterns of Information - Manuel Lima","permalink":"visual-complexity-mapping-patterns-of-information-manuel-lima","position":137,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/visual-complexity-mapping-patterns-of-information-manuel-lima","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-19T06:04:56.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Visual Complexity - Mapping Patterns of Information </i>\r\nManuel Lima\r\n\r\n8.5 x 10.5 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n272 pages\r\n250 color plates \r\n65 black & white plates\r\n\r\nPublished by Princeton Architectural Press\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Our ability to generate information now far exceeds our capacity to understand it. Finding patterns and making meaningful connections inside complex data networks has emerged as one of the biggest challenges of the twenty-first century.

From representing networks of friends on Facebook to depicting interactions among proteins in a human cell, <i> Visual Complexity</i> presents one hundred of the most interesting examples of information-visualization by the field's leading practitioners.

At issue is the question of photography's function as a credible eyewitness and arbiter of justice. \r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> The primary cause of wrongful conviction is mistaken identification. A victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement's use of photographs and lineups. This procedure relies on the assumption of precise visual memory. But, through exposure to composite sketches, mugshots, Polaroids, and lineups, eyewitness memory can change. In the history of these cases, photography offered the criminal justice system a tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals. Photographs assisted officers in obtaining eyewitness identifications and aided prosecutors in securing convictions. \r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Simon photographed these men at sites that had particular significance to their illegitimate conviction: the scene of misidentification, the scene of arrest, the scene of the crime or the scene of the alibi. All of these locations hold contradictory meanings for the subjects. The scene of arrest marks the starting point of a reality based in fiction. The scene of the crime is at once arbitrary and crucial: this place, to which they have never been, changed their lives forever. In these photographs Simon confronts photography's ability to blur truth and fiction-an ambiguity that can have severe, even lethal consequences.<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":22181699,"name":"Default","price":34.95,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68715323/-/IMG_5555.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68715323/-/IMG_5555.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68715331/-/IMG_5556.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68715331/-/IMG_5556.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68715339/-/IMG_5559.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68715339/-/IMG_5559.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68715347/-/IMG_5560.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68715347/-/IMG_5560.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68715355/-/IMG_5561.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68715355/-/IMG_5561.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":7003427,"name":"This Is Not My Wife - Erik Van Der Weijde","permalink":"this-is-not-my-wife-erik-van-der-weijde","position":139,"price":35.0,"default_price":35.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/this-is-not-my-wife-erik-van-der-weijde","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-19T05:50:56.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> This Is Not My Wife </i>\r\nErik Van Der Weijde\r\n\r\n11.48 x 9.84 in.\r\nPaperback\r\n112 pages\r\n\r\nPublished by Rollo Press\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Dutch photographer Erik van der Weijde takes several Brazilian women as his subjects in this bold series of portraits.

In some ways, print is actually nowadays being revitalized rather than replaced, an intriguing prospect which is explored in depth in the pages of this book.<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":21989583,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68714667/-/IMG_5613.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68714667/-/IMG_5613.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68714691/-/IMG_5614.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68714691/-/IMG_5614.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68714699/-/IMG_5615.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68714699/-/IMG_5615.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68714707/-/IMG_5616.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68714707/-/IMG_5616.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68714723/-/IMG_5617.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68714723/-/IMG_5617.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3373415,"name":"ART & DESIGN BOOKS","permalink":"art-design-books","url":"/category/art-design-books"}]},{"id":6916023,"name":"Niagara - Alec Soth","permalink":"niagara-alec-soth","position":142,"price":65.0,"default_price":65.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/niagara-alec-soth","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-09T00:02:16.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Niagara </i>\r\nAlec Soth\r\n\r\nWith essays by Philip Brookman and Richard Ford\r\n\r\n9 x 10.43 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n104 pages\r\n50 color plates\r\n\r\nPublished by Steidl\r\nCo-published with Gagosian Gallery, New York.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> In the follow-up to his critically acclaimed debut monograph <i> Sleeping by the Mississippi</i>, Alec Soth turns his eye to another iconic body of water, Niagara Falls. But as with his photographs of the Mississippi, Soth’s pictures of Niagara are less about natural wonder than human desire. “I went to Niagara for the same reason as the honeymooners and suicide jumpers,” says Soth, “the relentless thunder of the Falls just calls for big passion.”<p align=\"justify\">\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">While the subject may be hot, these are quiet pictures. Using a large-format 8x10 camera, the photographs are rigorously composed and richly detailed. Working over the course of two years on both the American and Canadian sides of the Falls, the editing is tight and surprising. Soth depicts newlyweds and naked lovers, motel parking lots and pawn shop wedding rings. Throughout the book, Soth also includes a number of love letters from the subjects he photographed. We read about teenage crushes, workplace affairs, heartbreak and suicide.<p align=\"justify\">\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Oscar Wilde wrote of the Falls, “The sight of the stupendous waterfall must be one of the earliest, if not the keenest, disappointments in American married life.” In Soth’s <i> Niagara </i>, we see both the passion and the disappointment. His pictures are a remarkable portrayal of modern love and it’s aftermath.<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":21925723,"name":"Default","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67872411/-/IMG_5482.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67872411/-/IMG_5482.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67872419/-/IMG_5483.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67872419/-/IMG_5483.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67872477/-/IMG_5485.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67872477/-/IMG_5485.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67872511/-/IMG_5486.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67872511/-/IMG_5486.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67872535/-/IMG_5487.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67872535/-/IMG_5487.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6820015,"name":"Mona Hatoum - Mona Hatoum","permalink":"mona-hatoum-mona-hatoum","position":143,"price":55.0,"default_price":55.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mona-hatoum-mona-hatoum","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-29T06:04:43.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Mona Hatoum </i>\r\nMona Hatoum\r\n\r\nIngvild Goetz (ed.), Rainald Schumacher(ed.), Larissa Michelberger(ed.)\r\nTexts by Ingvild Goetz, Rainald Schumacher, Leo Lencsés,\r\n\r\n6 3/4 x 9 3/4 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n100 pages\r\n94 plates\r\n\r\nPublished by Hatje Cantz\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Mona Hatoum (*1952 in Beirut), who has lived in London since 1975, first became known in the eighties for her performances, which focused on the relation between violence and her own body as well as those of the members of her audience. In installations, photographs, sculptures, and videos, the artist has examined the human body as a metaphor for oppression in a broader sense. The video Measures of Distance, for example, shows how repressive forces can, by alienating a person from his or her homeland, also affect one’s relationship to one’s own mother. Just as viewers are drawn by the unfamiliar video images, which are overlaid with graphic characters, they are also fascinated by the electrified, dangerous crackle of a large globe illuminated in red lights, <i>Hot Spot III,</i> a work that symbolizes a world afflicted by conflicts and catastrophes. This publication reveals all of the different facets of the artist’s visual subjects and language. <p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":21641971,"name":"Default","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66951053/-/IMG_5392.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66951053/-/IMG_5392.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66951061/-/IMG_5393.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66951061/-/IMG_5393.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66951069/-/IMG_5395.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66951069/-/IMG_5395.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66951077/-/IMG_5396.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66951077/-/IMG_5396.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66951085/-/IMG_5397.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66951085/-/IMG_5397.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3373415,"name":"ART & DESIGN BOOKS","permalink":"art-design-books","url":"/category/art-design-books"},{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6819893,"name":"Small Trades - Irving Penn","permalink":"small-trades-irving-penn","position":144,"price":65.0,"default_price":65.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/small-trades-irving-penn","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-29T05:39:32.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Small Trades </i>\r\nIrving Penn\r\n\r\nText Virginia A. Heckert and Anne Lacoste\r\n\r\n9 1/2 x 12 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n272 pages\r\n259 tritone plates\r\n\r\nPublished by Getty Museum\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Photographer Irving Penn (1917-2009) was renowned for his innovative contributions to portrait, still life, and fashion photography, and a career that has spanned more than six decades at Vogue magazine. In 1950, Vogue assigned Penn to photograph workers in Paris, and thus his monumental work <i> Small Trades </i> began. Created in 1950 and 1951 in Paris, London, and New York, <i> Small Trades </i> consists of portraits of skilled tradespeople dressed in their work clothes and carrying the tools of their respective occupations. Capturing the humble coal heaver and the crisply dressed waiter with equal directness, Penn's arresting portraits also underscore fascinating cultural differences.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> <i> Small Trades </i> was Penn's most extensive body of work, and he returned to it over many decades, producing ever more exacting prints. Two hundred six unique images from the series are flawlessly reproduced in this book. In addition, the introductory essay describes the history and context of <i> Small Trades </i> series and its importance to Penn's career and the history of photography. An interview with Edmonde Charles-Roux, the chief editor for French Vogue from 1952 to 1966, who assisted him on the assignment in Paris, provides fascinating insights of the Paris sittings. An exhibition of the series is on view at the J. Paul Getty Museum from September 9, 2009, through January 10, 2010. <p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":21641513,"name":"Default","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":50.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66949861/-/IMG_5468.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66949861/-/IMG_5468.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66949877/-/IMG_5470.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66949877/-/IMG_5470.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66949901/-/IMG_5471.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66949901/-/IMG_5471.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66949909/-/IMG_5472.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66949909/-/IMG_5472.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66949917/-/IMG_5473.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66949917/-/IMG_5473.jpg","width":1000,"height":751}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6819853,"name":"Cindy Sherman : The Early Works 1975-1977 - Gabriele Schor ","permalink":"cindy-sherman-the-early-works-1975-1977-gabriele-schor","position":145,"price":85.0,"default_price":85.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cindy-sherman-the-early-works-1975-1977-gabriele-schor","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-29T05:33:26.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Cindy Sherman : The Early Works 1975-1977 </i>\r\nGabriele Schor \r\n\r\n9 x 11 1/4 in.\r\nHardback\r\n376 pages\r\n48 color plates\r\n240 duotone plates\r\n\r\nPublished by Hatje Cantz\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> For more than thirty years now, Cindy Sherman (*1954 in Glen Ridge, New Jersey) has been visualizing a whole gamut of role models and female identities. Even as a teenager, the artist loved to dress up. Contrary to popular belief, the famous <i> Untitled Film Stills (1978–80) </i> are not her earliest works, but rather those photographs she took as a student in Buffalo between 1975 and 1977. During those years, Sherman made playing with disguises her artistic concept, producing numerous previously unknown photographs that unite a striking number of theatrical elements. Using a variety of wigs, make-up, mimicry, gestures, expressions, and costumes, Sherman reveals different social identities by playing different roles. Gabriele Schor, director of the SAMMLUNG VERBUND, has performed a scholarly assessment of the conceptual beginnings of her oeuvre and is now publishing a catalogue raisonné of her early work. <p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":21641433,"name":"Default","price":85.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":50.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66949493/-/IMG_5459.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66949493/-/IMG_5459.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66949509/-/IMG_5461.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66949509/-/IMG_5461.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66949525/-/IMG_5462.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66949525/-/IMG_5462.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66949533/-/IMG_5463.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66949533/-/IMG_5463.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66949541/-/IMG_5465.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66949541/-/IMG_5465.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6819817,"name":"For every minute you are angry you lose sixty seconds of happiness - Julian Germain ","permalink":"for-every-minute-you-are-angry-you-lose-sixty-seconds-of-happiness-julian-germain","position":146,"price":95.0,"default_price":95.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/for-every-minute-you-are-angry-you-lose-sixty-seconds-of-happiness-julian-germain","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-29T05:26:02.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\nOut-of-Print\r\n\r\n<i> For every minute you are angry you lose sixty seconds of happiness </i>\r\nJulian Germain  \r\n\r\n9 1/4 x 11 in.\r\nHardcover with a full color printed cloth\r\n80 pages\r\n42 color plates\r\n\r\nPublished by MACK\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> In 2005 <i> For every minute you are angry you lose sixty seconds of happiness </i> was published to critical acclaim, selling out soon after it’s release. Germain’s warm and affectionate portrait of Charles Albert Lucian Snelling (Charlie) is now reprinted in a glowing new edition.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">'I met Charles Albert Lucien Snelling on a Saturday in April, 1992. He lived in a typical two up two down terraced house amongst many other two up two down terraced houses… It was yellow and orange. In that respect it was totally different from every other house on the street. Charlie was a simple, gentle, man. He loved flowers and the names of flowers. He loved colour and surrounded himself with colour. He loved his wife. Without ever trying or intending to, he showed me that the most important things in life cost nothing at all. He was my antidote to modern living.'\r\nJulian Germain\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">In a series of photographs made over eight years, Julian Germain captured the quiet, contemplative existence of an old man living alone in a small house in a city on the south coast of England. Unfettered by the misplaced aspirations of the modern world, Charlie spent the last years of his life absorbed in his memories of his wife, his children, his love for flowers, music and the quotidian pleasures of the crossword, and his albums of his own photographs. Germain’s photographs of Charlie, his home and the things he owned are a beautiful, gentle portrait of a gentleman in his twilight years. <p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":21641353,"name":"Default","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66949093/-/IMG_5452.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66949093/-/IMG_5452.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66949101/-/IMG_5453.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66949101/-/IMG_5453.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66949121/-/IMG_5454.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66949121/-/IMG_5454.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66949141/-/IMG_5456.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66949141/-/IMG_5456.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66949149/-/IMG_5457.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66949149/-/IMG_5457.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"},{"id":2846891,"name":"COLLECTIBLE & RARE","permalink":"collectible-rare","url":"/category/collectible-rare"}]},{"id":6819795,"name":"LE SILENCE Une fiction - Simone Menegoi (ed.) & Cristiano Raimondi (ed.)

Smith, whose sculptures are made from waste collected in his hometown, the urban desert of Detroit, completes the exhibition as ‘fossils’ of our consumer society.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Artists: Dove Allouche, Vladimir Arkhipov, Arman, Bartolomeo Bimbi, Maurice Blaussyld, Michel Blazy, Karl Blossfeldt, Brassaï, Peter Buggenhout, Carlos Casas, Romeo Castellucci, Lourdes Castro, Tony Cragg, Daniel Gustav Cramer,  Geert Goiris, Jochen Lempert, Yves Marchand & Romain Meffre, Adrien Missika, Linda Fregni Nagler, Walter Pichler, Rudolf Polanszky, Pierre Savatier, Erin Shirreff, Michael E.

As part of a series of off-site artist commissions supported by Bloomberg, Petersen was invited by The Photographers’ Gallery to undertake a four-week residency in the bubbling creative underbelly of London. Turning his direct and unflinching gaze to the streets of Soho, Petersen produced a series which is both penetrating and sensitive to his subjects. His intimate, diaristic style of coarse black and white photography captures the essence of today's Soho while drawing you back into the depths of its history.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">For a month Petersen immersed himself in the life of the famous London district, documenting the streets, pubs, cafes and private homes of the residents. This latest installment of his series City Diaries is a testament to the dynamism and diversity of the area and the people who frequent and live in it.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Anders Petersen (b.1944, Sweden) has exhibited internationally and won numerous prizes during his career. His first project, <i>Café Lehmitz</i>, was started soon after he had completed his studies with Christer Strömholm’s School of Photography in Sweden in the late 1960s. Photographing the late-night regulars of Café Lehmitz, a bar in Hamburg, the project was published in 1978 and has since become a seminal book in the history of European photography. In the mid-1980s Petersen focused his attention on people in locked institutions: prisons, a nursing home and a mental hospital. Since then he has published over 20 books observing people at the margins of society. He has been awarded ‘Photographer of the Year' (Arles, 2002) and was shortlisted for the Deutsche Börse Photography Prize (2007).\r\n <p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":21641227,"name":"Default","price":55.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66948373/-/IMG_5436.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66948373/-/IMG_5436.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66948381/-/IMG_5439.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66948381/-/IMG_5439.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66948389/-/IMG_5440.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66948389/-/IMG_5440.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66948397/-/IMG_5441.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66948397/-/IMG_5441.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66948405/-/IMG_5442.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66948405/-/IMG_5442.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6819729,"name":"Undergarments and Armor - Tanya Marcuse","permalink":"undergarments-and-armor-tanya-marcuse","position":150,"price":65.0,"default_price":65.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/undergarments-and-armor-tanya-marcuse","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-29T05:05:37.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Undergarments and Armor </i>\r\nTanya Marcuse\r\n\r\n6 1/2 x 10 1/2 in.\r\nThree hardcover volumes in a slipcased set\r\n112 pages\r\n53 duotone plates\r\n\r\nPublished by Nazraeli Press\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> From the bizarre steatopygous forms of Victorian bustles to the haunting facial masks on medieval helmets, Tanya Marcuse has illuminated the complex relationship between body and clothes, with all the ambiguities this entails. — from the essay by Valerie Steele Since time immemorial, humans have sought to cover parts of their bodies, with materials ranging from animal skins to the finest silk. Clothing not only keeps us warm and protected, it allows us to alter our appearance and the way others might regard us. Tanya Marcuse’s fascinating photographs show that although clothing on its own can look strange and inanimate, it also has a story to reveal. The undergarments she presents here are the kind that would most likely have been kept well-hidden from view, for these are the hard foundation garments such as corsets and bustles that – invisible on the outside – could completely change the shape of their wearer. Conversely, the rigid outer shell of armor would blatantly transform the appearance of the person concealed inside. For women, these undergarments enhanced (so they believed) their beauty and status; for men, the armor likewise presented their desired image – strength and bravery – to whoever crossed their path. <p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":21641183,"name":"Default","price":65.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66948173/-/IMG_5425.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66948173/-/IMG_5425.jpg","width":1000,"height":751},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66948181/-/IMG_5426.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66948181/-/IMG_5426.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66948189/-/IMG_5427.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66948189/-/IMG_5427.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66948197/-/IMG_5429.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66948197/-/IMG_5429.jpg","width":1000,"height":751},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66948213/-/IMG_5435.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66948213/-/IMG_5435.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6819701,"name":"Works 80-08 - Andreas Gursky","permalink":"works-80-08-andreas-gursky","position":151,"price":60.0,"default_price":60.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/works-80-08-andreas-gursky","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-29T05:00:08.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Works 80-08</i>\r\nAndreas Gursky\r\n\r\nMartin Hentschel (ed.), texts by Martin Hentschel\r\n\r\n8 1/4 x 10 1/4 in.\r\nHardback\r\n272 pages\r\n174 color images\r\n\r\nPublished by Hatje Cantz\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> The standard work on Gursky‘s oeuvre, now in a new, revised edition.

Now, for the first time ever, an attempt is being made to unfurl the artist’s oeuvre in all its encyclopedic glory. Gursky has selected over 150 images from his pool of photographs, reaching back in time to his student days at the Folkwang Hochschule Essen, followed by the period in which he was in the class taught by Bernd and Hilla Becher at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. Beginning with the earliest exposures, such as the Desk Attendants and other unpublished photographs, the publication describes an enormous trajectory that takes us to his more recent works. Every single exposure in Gursky’s encyclopedic morphology is a vital piece in the puzzle, which over some twenty-eight years has opened out into a sweeping view of the world.\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":21641081,"name":"Default","price":60.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66947917/-/IMG_5417.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66947917/-/IMG_5417.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66947925/-/IMG_5418.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66947925/-/IMG_5418.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66947933/-/IMG_5420.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66947933/-/IMG_5420.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66947941/-/IMG_5421.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66947941/-/IMG_5421.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66947957/-/IMG_5423.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66947957/-/IMG_5423.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6819657,"name":"My Dakota - Rebecca Norris Webb","permalink":"my-dakota-rebecca-norris-webb","position":152,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/my-dakota-rebecca-norris-webb","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-29T04:52:17.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> My Dakota </i>\r\nRebecca Norris Webb\r\n\r\nText Rebecca Norris Webb.

Dominated by space and silence, South Dakota’s harsh and beautiful landscape is sometimes prey to brutal wind and extreme weather. The next year, however, everything changed for Norris Webb, when one of her brothers died unexpectedly of heart failure. “For months,” she writes in the afterword to this volume, “one of the few things that eased my unsettled heart was the landscape of South Dakota…I began to wonder — does loss have its own geography?” <i> My Dakota </i> — which interweaves her spare text and lyrical photographs — is a small intimate book about the West and its weathers, and an elegy for a lost brother.\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":21640955,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66947549/-/IMG_5410.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66947549/-/IMG_5410.jpg","width":1000,"height":773},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66947557/-/IMG_5411.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66947557/-/IMG_5411.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66947565/-/IMG_5413.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66947565/-/IMG_5413.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66947573/-/IMG_5414.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66947573/-/IMG_5414.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66947581/-/IMG_5416.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66947581/-/IMG_5416.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6819641,"name":"Photography Changes Everything - Marvin Heiferman (ed. & intro) & Merry Foresta (fwd.)","permalink":"photography-changes-everything-marvin-heiferman-ed-intro-merry-foresta-fwd","position":153,"price":39.95,"default_price":39.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/photography-changes-everything-marvin-heiferman-ed-intro-merry-foresta-fwd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-29T04:46:51.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Photography Changes Everything </i>\r\nMarvin Heiferman (ed. & intro) & Merry Foresta (fwd.)\r\n\r\n10 x 7 in.\r\nPaperback\r\n356 pages\r\n250 four-color images\r\n\r\nPublished by Aperture Foundation\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> <i> Photography Changes Everything </i>—drawn from the online Smithsonian Photography Initiative—offers a provocative rethinking of photography’s impact on our culture and our lives.

The publication harnesses the extraordinary visual assets of the Smithsonian Institution’s museums, science centers, and archives to trigger an unprecedented and interdisciplinary dialogue about how photography does more than record the world—it shapes and changes every aspect of our experience of it.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">The book features over three hundred images and nearly one hundred engaging short texts commissioned from experts, writers, inventors, public figures, and everyday folk—Hugh Hefner, John Baldessari, John Waters, Robert Adams, Sandra Phillips, and others. Each story responds to images selected by project contributors. Together they engage readers in a timely exploration of the extent to which our lives have been transformed through our interactions with photographic imagery.<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":21640911,"name":"Default","price":39.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66947191/-/IMG_5404.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66947191/-/IMG_5404.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66947221/-/IMG_5405.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66947221/-/IMG_5405.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66947245/-/IMG_5406.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66947245/-/IMG_5406.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66947261/-/IMG_5407.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66947261/-/IMG_5407.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66947269/-/IMG_5408.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66947269/-/IMG_5408.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6819597,"name":"Occupied Territory - Lynne Cohen","permalink":"occupied-territory-lynne-cohen","position":154,"price":60.0,"default_price":60.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/occupied-territory-lynne-cohen","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-29T04:40:05.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Occupied Territory </i>\r\nLynne Cohen\r\n\r\n9 3/5 x 11 1/2 in.\r\nHardcover with printed acetate jacket\r\n144 pages\r\n110 duotone images\r\n\r\nPublished by Aperture Foundation\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> In 1987, Aperture published Lynne Cohen’s first monograph, <i> Occupied Territory, </i> an exploration of domestic and institutional interior spaces—sometimes idealized, sometimes standardized, humorous, and disquieting. Now, Aperture is pleased to release a newly expanded and updated reissue of this classic monograph, making Cohen’s pioneering work available to a contemporary audience with a new essay situating her within the lineage of the New Documents and New Topographics photographic movements.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> The work in this book, all from 1971 to 1987, Cohen turns her view camera on classrooms, science laboratories, testing facilities, waiting rooms, and other interior spaces where function triumphs over aesthetics and aesthetics triumphs over function. Often, the decorations the inhabitants have added to make the spaces more inviting only serve to amplify their artifice and uniformity. In cool, functional offices, futuristic reception areas, lifeless party rooms, and escapist motel rooms, Cohen surveys a society of surface and contradiction. In her hands, clouds peel off walls and forest glades invade indoor tennis courts, and the awkward lives of furniture are revealed. Drawing on a background in sculpture, Cohen records what seem to be ready-made sculptural installations waiting to be photographed.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">This edition of <i> Occupied Territory </i> includes unpublished images drawn from the book’s original time period, as well as the essay, by Britt Salvesen, placing Cohen’s work in the context of when it was made and of the world today.\r\n <p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":21640763,"name":"Default","price":60.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66946805/-/IMG_5398.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66946805/-/IMG_5398.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66946813/-/IMG_5399.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66946813/-/IMG_5399.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66946821/-/IMG_5400.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66946821/-/IMG_5400.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66946829/-/IMG_5401.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66946829/-/IMG_5401.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66946837/-/IMG_5402.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66946837/-/IMG_5402.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6915687,"name":"One Picture Book #66: Love Point -

In a sequential narrative punctuated by contrasting moments of violence & beauty, Jude follows the rambling journey of a fur trapper, methodically checking his trap line in a remote area of Idaho in the Western United States. Through converging pictures of landscapes, architecture, an encroaching resort community & the solitary, secretive process of trapping pine marten for their pelts,<i> Lick Creek Line </i> underscores the murky & culturally arbitrary nature of moral critique.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> With an undercurrent of mystery & melancholy that echoes Jude’s previous two books about his childhood home of Central Idaho, Lick Creek Line serves as the lynchpin in a multi-faceted, three-part look at the incomprehensibility of self & place through photographic narrative. While <i> Alpine Star </I> functioned as a fictitious sociological archive, and <i> Emmett </I> explored the muddy waters of memory & autobiography,<i> Lick Creek Line </i> finds its tenor through the sleight-of-hand structure of a traditional photo essay.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Ron Jude was born in Los Angeles in 1965, grew up in the Pacific Northwest & currently lives and works in Upstate New York. His photographs have been exhibited at venues such as Gallery Luisotti (Santa Monica), the Photographers’ Gallery (London), the High Museum of Art (Atlanta), Proekt_Fabrika (Moscow) & Roth/Horowitz Gallery (New York), among others. His work is in numerous collections, including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, George Eastman House, the New Orleans Museum of Art & the Georgia Museum of Contemporary Art in Atlanta. Jude is the co-founder of A-Jump Books and the author of <i> Alpine Star, </i> <i> Postcards</i>, <i> Other Nature </i> & <i> Emmett. </i> He is represented by Gallery Luisotti in Santa Monica.\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":21144713,"name":"Default","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65275741/-/IMG_5097.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65275741/-/IMG_5097.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65275789/-/IMG_5105.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65275789/-/IMG_5105.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65275909/-/IMG_5113.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65275909/-/IMG_5113.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65275941/-/IMG_5110.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65275941/-/IMG_5110.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65275997/-/IMG_5106.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65275997/-/IMG_5106.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6646715,"name":"Redheaded Peckerwood - Christian Patterson","permalink":"redheaded-peckerwood-christian-patterson","position":168,"price":65.0,"default_price":65.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/redheaded-peckerwood-christian-patterson","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-08T22:52:19.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Redheaded Peckerwood </i>\r\nChristian Patterson\r\n\r\n7 3/4 x 9 3/4 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n164 pages\r\n98 images including 3 inserts & a booklet\r\n\r\nSecond Edition\r\n\r\nEssays by Luc Sante and Karen Irvine\r\n\r\nPublished by MACK, 2011\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> <i> Redheaded Peckerwood </i> is a work with a tragic underlying narrative – the story of 19 year old Charles Starkweather and 14 year old Caril Ann Fugate who murdered ten people, including Fugate’s family, during a three day killing spree across Nebraska to the point of their capture in Douglas, Wyoming. The images record places and things central to the story, depict ideas inspired by it, and capture other moments and discoveries along the way.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> From a technical perspective, the photographs incorporate and reference the techniques of photojournalism, forensic photography, image appropriation, reenactment and documentary landscape photography. On a conceptual level, they deal with a charged landscape and play with a photographic representation and truth as the work deconstructs a pre-existing narrative.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> <i> Redheaded Peckerwood </i> also utilizes and plays with a pre-existing archive of material, deliberately mixing fact and fiction, past and present, myth and reality as it presents, expands and re-presents the various facts and theories surrounding this story.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> While photographs are the heart of this work, they are the complemented and informed by documents and objects that belonged to the killers and their victims – including a map, poem, confession letter, stuffed animal, hood ornament and various other items, in several cases, these materials are discoveries first made by the artist and presented here for the first time.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> In book form, the work is presented as a sort of visual crime dossier, including pieces of paper which are inserted into the book. The many individual pieces included serve as cues and clues within the visual puzzle. In this way, there are connections that are left for the viewer to be made and mysteries that are left to be solved.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> <i> Redheaded Peckerwood </i> is Christian Patterson's second monograph. His first book, Sound Affects, was published by Edition Kaune, Sudendorf in 2008. His work is in several notable collections including the Libraries of the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the New Orleans Museum of Art and the Ogden Museum of Southern Art.\r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":21142445,"name":"Default","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.2,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65274587/-/IMG_5117.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65274587/-/IMG_5117.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65267885/-/patterson_spine.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65267885/-/patterson_spine.jpg","width":1000,"height":666},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65267925/-/patterson_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65267925/-/patterson_1.jpg","width":1000,"height":666},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65267941/-/patterson_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65267941/-/patterson_2.jpg","width":1000,"height":666},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65267949/-/patterson_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65267949/-/patterson_3.jpg","width":1000,"height":666}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6579673,"name":"The Present - Paul Graham","permalink":"the-present-paul-graham","position":169,"price":75.0,"default_price":75.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-present-paul-graham","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-30T01:07:16.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i>The Present</i>\r\nPaul Graham\r\n\r\n9 1/2 x 12 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n114 pages including 13 gatefolds\r\n30 color photographs\r\n230 black & white photographs\r\n\r\nPublished by MACK\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Street photography is perhaps the defining genre of photographic art. Seminal works by Walker Evans, Harry Callahan, Robert Frank and Garry Winogrand display photography’s astonishing dance with life, and its unique role in forming our perceptions of the modern world.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><i>The Present</i> is Paul Graham’s contribution to this legacy. The images in this book come unbidden from the streets of New York, but are not quite what we might expect, for each moment is brought to us with its double – two images taken from the same location, separated only by the briefest fraction of time. We find ourselves in sibling worlds, where a businessman with an eye patch becomes, an instant later, a man with an exaggerated wink; a woman eating a banana walks towards us, and a small focus shift reveals the blind man right behind her.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Although there are flashes of surprise – a woman walks confidently down the street one moment, only to tumble to the ground a second later – for the most part there is little of the drama street photography is addicted to. People arrive and depart this quiet stage, with the smallest shift of time and attention revealing the thread between them. A suited young businessman crosses the road, only to be replaced by his homeless alternate; a woman in a pink t-shirt is engulfed with tears, but seconds later there is a content shopper in her place.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><i>The Present</i> gives us an impression quite different to most street photography where life is frozen rigid. Here we glimpse the continuum: before/after, coming/going, either/or. A ‘present’ that is a fleeting and provisional alignment, with no singularity or definitiveness; a world of shifting awareness and alternate realities, where life twists and spirals in a fraction of a second to another moment, another world, another consciousness.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><i>The Present</i> is the third in Paul Graham’s trilogy of projects on America which began with American Night in 2003 and was followed in 2007 by a shimmer of possibility (winner of the Paris Photo Book Prize 2011 for the most significant photo book of the past 15 years). The Present takes Graham’s reputation as a master of the book form to new heights, employing multiple gatefolds to convey passages of time and the unfolding of urban life.\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":20911327,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64621349/-/IMG_4759.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64621349/-/IMG_4759.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64621357/-/IMG_4761.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64621357/-/IMG_4761.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64621373/-/IMG_4763.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64621373/-/IMG_4763.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64621381/-/IMG_4767.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64621381/-/IMG_4767.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64621389/-/IMG_4768.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64621389/-/IMG_4768.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6579641,"name":"Francesca Woodman - Francesca Woodman","permalink":"francesca-woodman-francesca-woodman","position":170,"price":75.0,"default_price":75.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/francesca-woodman-francesca-woodman","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-30T01:00:16.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i>Francesca Woodman</i>\r\nFrancesca Woodman\r\n\r\n11 3/8 x 9 7/8in.\r\nHardcover\r\n256 pages\r\n30 color photographs\r\n230 black & white photographs\r\n\r\nPublished by Phaidon\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">The only book available on the legendary American photographer Francesca Woodman, before the SFMOMA exhibition catalog was published in 2011, this comprehensive monograph on Woodman explores the complex body of work produced by the young artist until her suicide at age 22.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Francesca Woodman (1958-1981) was an artist decisively of her time, yet her photographs retain an undeniable immediacy.

Many were motivated by environmental concerns, others were driven by religious beliefs or predictions of economic collapse. While everyone he photographed was working to maintain self-sufficiency, none lived in complete isolation from the mainstream. Instead, they chose which parts of the modern world to embrace and which to leave behind. The body of work, made over a five-year period, is gathered together in the artist’s first book, A Natural Order – a collection that explores a human relationship with wilderness and the persistent libertarianism of the American psyche. Foglia's photographs, at once iconic and intimate, provoke us to take a candid look at individuals whose chosen lifestyles seem both exotic and unnervingly close to home. Included with the book is an anonymously –authored, illustrated ‘zine titled <i>wildlifoodin</i>. Part journal, part survival manual, it reads like a poet’s version of the Whole Earth Catalog, the bible for 1970’s back-to-the-landers.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Lucas Foglia exhibits and publishes his photographs internationally. His work is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Fine Arts Houston, the Pilara Foundation and the Rhode Island School of Design Museum of Fine Art, and has been published in Aperture Magazine, the New York Times Magazine, the Washington Post Magazine, British Journal of Photography, Contact Sheet, and PDN's 30.<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":20910483,"name":"Default","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64619285/-/IMG_4802.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64619285/-/IMG_4802.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64619349/-/IMG_4791.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64619349/-/IMG_4791.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64619357/-/IMG_4793.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64619357/-/IMG_4793.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64619373/-/IMG_4799.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64619373/-/IMG_4799.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64619393/-/IMG_4800.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64619393/-/IMG_4800.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"},{"id":2846891,"name":"COLLECTIBLE & RARE","permalink":"collectible-rare","url":"/category/collectible-rare"}]},{"id":6647047,"name":"Le Luxe - Roe Ethridge","permalink":"le-luxe-roe-ethridge","position":172,"price":150.0,"default_price":150.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/le-luxe-roe-ethridge","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-08T23:31:44.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Le Luxe </i>\r\nRoe Ethridge\r\n\r\n10 x 11 1/2 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n206 pages\r\n200 color plates\r\n\r\nOut of Print\r\n\r\nPublished by MACK, 2011\r\nISBN 9781907946080 \r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> American artist Roe Ethridge's latest book takes its title from the French \"C'est pas du luxe\", an ironic phrase which alludes to the superfluous nature of luxury whilst proclaiming how essential it is to existence. Such paradoxes are fluently woven through Ethridge's oeuvre and Le Luxe encompasses his practice from the past decade, without ever slipping into the moribund gravitas of a retrospective.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Plumbing his diverse image inventories, from personal images and magazine commissions to an archive of online screen shots, the book continues his exploration of picture-making that disavows the potential for creating a finished work. Ethridge para-phrases Eggleston when he states that he is \"at war with the finished\" in an era of digital photography straining towards idealisation. The pristine conditions of photography are undermined in the book's design and riff on Henri Matisse's apposite aphorism \"exactitude is not truth\" (Matisse titled two of his paintings <i> Le Luxe </i>).\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Composed in three parts, <i> Le Luxe </i> contains an unusual backdrop, the everyday of the artist, who worked from November 2005 to January 2010 on one commission documenting a building in downtown Manhattan on a site adjacent to the World Trade Centre. This narrative offers an uneasy balance to the fissures between analogue and digital and Ethridge's consistent undermining of his own certainties.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Roe Ethridge was born in 1969 in Miami and received a BFA in Photography at The College of Art in Atlanta, GA. Ethridge's images emanate from his direct experience of the world. His focus is multiple and restless as he works to capture the vivid and intimate details of his various locales. In doing so, he moves freely among the classic genres of the photographic medium - portrait, landscape, and still life.\r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":21143267,"name":"Default","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65274653/-/IMG_5119.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65274653/-/IMG_5119.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65270813/-/Roe_Luxe_spine.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65270813/-/Roe_Luxe_spine.jpg","width":1000,"height":666},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65270845/-/Roe_Luxe_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65270845/-/Roe_Luxe_1.jpg","width":1000,"height":666},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65270853/-/Roe_Luxe_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65270853/-/Roe_Luxe_2.jpg","width":1000,"height":666},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65270893/-/Roe_Luxe_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65270893/-/Roe_Luxe_3.jpg","width":1000,"height":666}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"},{"id":2846891,"name":"COLLECTIBLE & RARE","permalink":"collectible-rare","url":"/category/collectible-rare"}]},{"id":6578467,"name":"Avedon: Murals & Portraits - Richard Avedon","permalink":"avedon-murals-portraits-richard-avedon","position":173,"price":100.0,"default_price":100.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/avedon-murals-portraits-richard-avedon","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-29T22:29:13.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i>Avedon: Murals & Portraits</i>\r\nRichard Avedon\r\n\r\nEssays by Louis Menand, Mary Panzer, Paul Roth, Bob Rubin, and William Shawcross.\r\n\r\n10 x 12 1/2 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n300 pages\r\n250 photographs\r\n\r\nPublished by Abrams\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">No photographer had a more serious and deeply felt response to the political and cultural impact of the 1960s and early 1970s than Richard Avedon, whose iconic portraits of key figures of the era influenced the course of photography in the decades that followed. In four monumental photographic murals (reproduced in large gatefolds) and many related portraits, he portrayed Andy Warhol’s gender-bending Factory, with Viva and Candy Darling; Abbie Hoffman and the radical agitators of the Chicago Seven; Allen Ginsberg’s family, friends, and fellow artists; and the U.S. Mission Council in Saigon alongside searing portraits of victims of the Vietnam War. \r\n\r\nThe photographs are accompanied by images of archival material, including Avedon’s diaries, correspondence, and contact prints.

Their work—at once conceptual art, typological study, and topological documentation—has influenced German photographers of a younger generation, including Thomas Struth, Thomas Demand, Candida Höfer, Thomas Ruff, and Andreas Gursky. This compelling, exhaustively documented biography describes the Bechers' life and work and offers a critical assessment of their place in the history of photography.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Becher scholar Susanne Lange, granted access to the photographers' archives and quoting extensively from interviews with them, writes the first sustained analysis and biography of the Bechers' extraordinary partnership. She discusses, among other topics, both the functionalist and aesthetic dimensions of the Bechers' subject matter, their typologizing (which she finds reminiscent of nineteenth-century naturalists' classificatory schemes), and the anonymous industrial building style favored by German architects. She argues that industrial building types impose themselves on our consciousness as the cathedral did on that of the Middle Ages, and that the Bechers' photographs—which seem at first glance only to record a vanishing landscape—serve to examine this shaping of our perceptions. Their work provides us with a rare opportunity to see how we see.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Bernd and Hilla Becher: Life and Work, with 53 duotone plates and more than 200 additional illustrations, is the first book to delve deeply into the sources and vision behind the evocative and melancholy beauty of the Bechers' work. It will be indispensable both as a reference for students of postwar German photography and as a guide for readers who want to know how to approach the Bechers' monumental project.<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":20890339,"name":"Default","price":70.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64547789/-/IMG_4667.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64547789/-/IMG_4667.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64547797/-/IMG_4669.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64547797/-/IMG_4669.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64547805/-/IMG_4670.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64547805/-/IMG_4670.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64547821/-/IMG_4671.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64547821/-/IMG_4671.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64547829/-/IMG_4672.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64547829/-/IMG_4672.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6571857,"name":"Ryan McGinley: Whistle for the Wind - Ryan McGinley","permalink":"ryan-mcginley-whistle-for-the-wind-ryan-mcginley","position":175,"price":55.0,"default_price":55.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ryan-mcginley-whistle-for-the-wind-ryan-mcginley","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-29T03:52:17.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i>Ryan McGinley: Whistle for the Wind</i>\r\nRyan McGinley\r\n\r\nContribution by Chris Kraus, John Kelsey and Gus Van Sant\r\n\r\n10 1/2 x 12 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n\r\nPublished by Rizzoli\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">In 2000, Ryan McGinley, then a student, staged his first exhibition of photographs in an abandoned SoHo gallery. To coincide with the show, the artist created several handmade books featuring a sampling of his work entitled The Kids Are Alright. A copy eventually found its way into the hands of Sylvia Wolf, then a curator of photography at the Whitney Museum of American Art. In 2003, Wolf mounted an exhibition of his work at the venerable institution, the youngest artist to ever have a solo show at the museum.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">What Wolf recognized—and what other critics, curators, and collectors would quickly discover—was an artist who understood and chronicled his own generation (habituées of New York City’s downtown) as no artist had before him. McGinley had managed to capture the hedonistic adventures of youth culture—kids hanging out and enjoying life—but without the dark underbelly of earlier artists who mined similar themes. As the work evolved, he moved away from the more documentary aspect of the early photographs and began to create scenarios where he could explore different ideas (aesthetic and otherwise). This eventually led to the now legendary summer-long road trips, capturing groups of twenty-somethings amongst a variety of American landscapes. In his most recent body of work, McGinley continues to explore—in black and white as well as in color—the body but in the still, pared down atmosphere of his studio. \r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">In this first major monograph chronicling the entirety of the artist’s career, McGinley’s work is considered by three extraordinary figures: Chris Kraus, novelist and critic; John Kelsey, writer, artist and activist; and Gus Van Sant, the auteur filmmaker. Each attends—through the lens of their own rich insights—to various aspects of the artist’s work and creative process, offering in-depth and unique perspectives on McGinley’s work and import.  \r\n<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":20890209,"name":"Default","price":55.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64547373/-/IMG_4673.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64547373/-/IMG_4673.jpg","width":1000,"height":749},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64547413/-/IMG_4675.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64547413/-/IMG_4675.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64547437/-/IMG_4676.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64547437/-/IMG_4676.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64547445/-/IMG_4678.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64547445/-/IMG_4678.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64547453/-/IMG_4679.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64547453/-/IMG_4679.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6571811,"name":"Looking In: Robert Frank’s The Americans – Expanded Edition - Sarah Greenough, Robert Frank","permalink":"looking-in-robert-franks-the-americans-expanded-edition-sarah-greenough-robert-frank","position":176,"price":75.0,"default_price":75.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/looking-in-robert-franks-the-americans-expanded-edition-sarah-greenough-robert-frank","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-29T03:45:14.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i>Looking In: Robert Frank’s The Americans – Expanded Edition</i>\r\nSarah Greenough, Robert Frank\r\n\r\nContributing essays by Stuart Alexander, Philip Brookman, Michel Frizot,\r\nMartin Gasser, Jeff L.

In eighty-three photographs, Frank looked beneath the surface of American life to reveal a people plagued by racism, ill-served by their politicians, and rendered numb by a rapidly expanding culture of consumption. Yet he also found novel areas of beauty in simple, overlooked corners of American life. And it was not just his subject matter - cars, jukeboxes, and even the road itself - that redefined the icons of America; it was also his seemingly intuitive, immediate, off-kilter style, as well as his method of brilliantly linking his photographs together thematically, conceptually, formally, and linguistically, that made The Americans so innovative. More of an ode or a poem than a literal document, the book is as powerful and provocative today as it was fifty years ago.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Published to accompany a major exhibition at the National Gallery of Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Looking In: Robert Frank's “The Americans” celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of this prescient book. Drawing on newly examined archival sources, it provides a fascinating in-depth examination of the making of the photographs and the book’s construction, using vintage contact sheets, work prints, and letters that literally chart Frank's journey around the country on a Guggenheim grant in 1955 –1956. Curator and editor Sarah Greenough and her colleagues also explore the roots of The Americans in Frank's earlier books, which are abundantly illustrated here, and in books by photographers Walker Evans, Bill Brandt, and others. The eighty-three original photographs from The Americans are presented in sequence in as near vintage prints as possible. The catalogue concludes with an examination of Frank's later reinterpretations and deconstructions of The Americans, bringing full circle the history of this resounding entry in the annals of photography.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Published alongside the softcover edition, Looking In: Robert Frank's “The Americans” - Expanded Edition includes a wealth of additional materials, essential information for all interested in twentieth-century photography. It contains all of the essays and photographs in the softcover, plus all of Frank’s vintage contact sheets related to The Americans, a section that re-creates his preliminary sequence and presents variant croppings of the first and subsequent editions of the book, and a map and chronology, along with letters and manuscript materials by Frank, Walker Evans, and Jack Kerouac related to Frank’s Guggenheim fellowship, his travels around the United States in 1955 – 1956, and his construction of the book. This groundbreaking 528-page catalogue is certain to be the definitive source of information on The Americans for years to come.\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":20890041,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":50.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64546837/-/IMG_4683.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64546837/-/IMG_4683.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64546853/-/IMG_4684.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64546853/-/IMG_4684.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64546861/-/IMG_4685.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64546861/-/IMG_4685.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64546869/-/IMG_4686.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64546869/-/IMG_4686.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64546877/-/IMG_4690.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64546877/-/IMG_4690.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6571737,"name":"Vivian Maier: Street Photographer - Vivian Maier","permalink":"vivian-maier-street-photographer-vivian-maier","position":177,"price":39.95,"default_price":39.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/vivian-maier-street-photographer-vivian-maier","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-29T03:35:52.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i>Vivian Maier: Street Photographer</i>\r\nVivian Maier\r\n\r\n(ed.) John Maloof\r\nForeward by Geoff Dyer\r\n\r\n10 x 11 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n136 pages\r\n100+ photographs\r\n\r\nPublished by powerHouse Books\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">A good street photographer must be possessed of many talents: an eye for detail, light, and composition; impeccable timing; a populist or humanitarian outlook; and a tireless ability to constantly shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot and never miss a moment. It is hard enough to find these qualities in trained photographers with the benefit of schooling and mentors and a community of fellow artists and aficionados supporting and rewarding their efforts. It is incredibly rare to find it in someone with no formal training and no network of peers.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Yet Vivian Maier is all of these things, a professional nanny, who from the 1950s until the 1990s took over 100,000 photographs worldwide— from France to New York City to Chicago and dozens of other countries—and yet showed the results to no one. The photos are amazing both for the breadth of the work and for the high quality of the humorous, moving, beautiful, and raw images of all facets of city life in America’s post-war golden age.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">It wasn’t until local historian John Maloof purchased a box of Maier’s negatives from a Chicago auction house and began collecting and championing her marvelous work just a few years ago that any of it saw the light of day. Presented here for the first time in print, Vivian Maier: Street Photographer collects the best of her incredible, unseen body of work.<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":20889901,"name":"Default","price":39.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64546117/-/IMG_4691.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64546117/-/IMG_4691.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64546149/-/IMG_4693.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64546149/-/IMG_4693.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64546173/-/IMG_4694.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64546173/-/IMG_4694.jpg","width":1000,"height":751},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64546189/-/IMG_4695.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64546189/-/IMG_4695.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64546197/-/IMG_4696.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64546197/-/IMG_4696.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6579545,"name":"Fish-Work : The Bering Sea - Corey Arnold","permalink":"fish-work-the-bering-sea-corey-arnold","position":178,"price":65.0,"default_price":65.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fish-work-the-bering-sea-corey-arnold","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-30T00:46:37.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i>Fish-Work : The Bering Sea</i>\r\nCorey Arnold\r\n\r\n15 x 12in.\r\nHardcover\r\n80 pages\r\n47 photographs\r\n\r\nPublished by Nazraeli Press\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">The photographs in <i>Fish-Work: The Bering Sea</i> capture moments from Arnold’s grueling retreats as a crew member aboard a fishing boat to the Bering Sea. With scenes of boat life so vivid that some shots can induce fear or seasickness, the artist’s perspective also reveals the tender soulfulness of a fisherman’s extended life at sea. His skillful compositions depict the simultaneous bravery, toil, humor and gumption that “fish-work” demands. Yet the series also illuminates the aesthetic sublimity that can only be experienced, ultimately, by those willing to risk their lives where the sea breaks its back. Having survived several seasons afloat these icy and unforgiving waters, we are lucky that Arnold has taken time to document his artistic impressions of this rare lifestyle and extended us a vicarious glimpse. Corey Arnold's work has been exhibited worldwide.

Photographs of the American West, 1965–2005 presents a narrative sequence of more than 100 tritone images that reveals a steadfast concern for mankind’s increasingly tragic relationship with the natural world.

Here, the trees are mature, the grass is green and the sun is out - and street names are repeated from suburb to suburb across the nation. This is bucolic home, the beginning of life for many Americans. As with her earlier projects, the artist employs color, selective focus, a narrow depth of field, and other intuitive means to arrive at a place somewhere between painting and photography. Terri Weifenbach’s work achieved cult status with her first monograph, In Your Dreams, and has since then been widely exhibited, published and collected throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. Beautifully printed on special matt art paper and bound in Japanese cloth, Between Maple and Chestnut is limited to 1,000 casebound copies.<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":20910113,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64617469/-/IMG_4750.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64617469/-/IMG_4750.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64617477/-/IMG_4752.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64617477/-/IMG_4752.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64617485/-/IMG_4755.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64617485/-/IMG_4755.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64617539/-/IMG_4756.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64617539/-/IMG_4756.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64617557/-/IMG_4757.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64617557/-/IMG_4757.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"},{"id":2846891,"name":"COLLECTIBLE & RARE","permalink":"collectible-rare","url":"/category/collectible-rare"}]},{"id":6570941,"name":"Photofile - Saul Leiter","permalink":"photofile-saul-leiter","position":183,"price":15.95,"default_price":15.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/photofile-saul-leiter","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-29T01:58:28.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i>Photofile, Saul Leiter</i>\r\nIntroduction by Max Kozloff\r\n\r\n7 1/2 x 5 in.\r\nSoft bound\r\n144 pages\r\n64 photographs\r\n\r\nPublished by Thames & Hudson\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Saul Leiter (b. 1923) is one of those photographers who seek neither fame nor commercial success, despite their talent for imagemaking. Born in Pittsburgh, he spent the 1940s and 1950s in New York, in an intensely creative environment where ideas from Europe and America came together and intermingled. There he encountered Rothko and the Abstract Expressionists, and discovered street photography and the work of Cartier-Bresson. His mastery of color is displayed in unconventional cityscapes in which reflections, transparency, complex framing and mirroring effects are married to a very personal printing style, creating a unique urban view.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">PHOTOFILE brings together the best work of the world’s greatest photographers, in an attractive format and at an easily affordable price. Handsome and collectable, the books are produced to the highest standards. Each volume contains some sixty full-page reproductions printed in superb duotone, together with a critical introduction and a full bibliography. The series has been awarded the first annual prize for distinguished photographic books by the International Center of Photography, New York.<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":20887691,"name":"Default","price":15.95,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64537257/-/IMG_4704.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64537257/-/IMG_4704.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64537271/-/IMG_4705.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64537271/-/IMG_4705.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64537285/-/IMG_4706.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64537285/-/IMG_4706.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64537325/-/IMG_4707.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64537325/-/IMG_4707.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64537345/-/IMG_4708.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64537345/-/IMG_4708.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6512719,"name":"North Portland Polaroids - Bobby Abrahamson","permalink":"north-portland-polaroids-bobby-abrahamson","position":184,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/north-portland-polaroids-bobby-abrahamson","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-21T22:46:36.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> North Portland Polaroids </i>\r\nBobby Abrahamson\r\n\r\n5 x 7 in. \r\nPerfect bound soft cover\r\n100 pages \r\n46 photographs\r\nPrinted on Mohawk Superfine paper\r\n\r\nForeword by Julia Dolan \r\nThe Minor White Curator of Photography\r\nPortland Art Museum\r\n\r\nDesigned & published by Ampersand\r\nPrinted & bound in Portland, Oregon\r\n\r\nEdition of 150\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Published on the occasion of exhibitions at <a href=\"http://www.blueskygallery.org/\"> Blue Sky </a>& Ampersand during the month of July, 2012.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Numbers 1-10 are signed & include an original 8 x 10 in. gelatin silver print by the artist.

Parr has selected diverse books which each deal with the subject of protest in quite different ways. From the documentation of various protest movements to the actual book being a form of protest, all these reprints are gems within the history of photographic publishing. A few are known but many are new, even to the connoisseur of photography books. All these books are virtually impossible to locate, so these reprints will make a substantial contribution to our understanding of this sub-genre of the photobook.

For his contribution to the series – in which one artist is selected for each volume to present their own work as well as work by other artists – Parr unleashes his scorching humor in the series “Art World,” photographs made at art gallery and museum openings which reveal more about the art world than some may be comfortable with. This highly entertaining body of work is tempered by the somewhat gentler look at Sri Lanka, made in collaboration with Susie Parr, called “Little England.” Together, Martin Parr’s photographs and Susie Parr’s text create a verbal and visual snapshot of Nuwara Eliya, a hill town lying some 6,000 feet above sea level in the heart of Sri Lanka. Parr rounds out his volume of Witness with a section called “Three Ways to Make a Book,” which documents how photographers Rob Hornstra, Mark Neville, and Bart Sorgedrager were able to self-publish and distribute their own books; a presentation of portfolios by Japanese photographers Keizo Kitajama, Kohei Yoshiyuki, and Osamu Kanemura; and an interview with Parr conducted by Gerry Badger.\".\r\n-JGS<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":20739231,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64072437/-/IMG_3913.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64072437/-/IMG_3913.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64072445/-/IMG_3917.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64072445/-/IMG_3917.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64072453/-/IMG_3920.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64072453/-/IMG_3920.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64072461/-/IMG_3922.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64072461/-/IMG_3922.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64072469/-/IMG_3925.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64072469/-/IMG_3925.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"},{"id":2846891,"name":"COLLECTIBLE & RARE","permalink":"collectible-rare","url":"/category/collectible-rare"}]},{"id":6586417,"name":"Interrogations - Donald Weber","permalink":"interrogations-donald-weber","position":192,"price":40.0,"default_price":40.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/interrogations-donald-weber","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-01T01:47:43.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i>Interrogations</i>\r\nDonald Weber\r\n\r\nText Larry Frolick\r\n\r\n7 1/2 x 8 1/2 in.\r\nHardcover\r\n43 photos\r\n\r\nPublished by Schilt Publishing\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">After a lone trip to Chernobyl in 2005, Donald Weber soon returned to the abandoned site of the nuclear disaster and spent the next six years in Russia and Ukraine photographing the ruins of the unstoppable storm we call history.\r\n\r\nTravelling and living with ordinary people who had endured much, and survived everything, Weber began to see the modern State as a primitive and bloody sacrificial rite of unnamed Power.\r\n\r\n<i>Interrogations</i> is the result of his personal quest to uncover the hidden meaning of the bloody 20th Century. In dialogue with writer Larry Frolick – whose own ancestors had been decimated in the final months of WW II – Weber insistently and provocatively addresses his questions both to the living survivors and to the ghosts of the State’s innumerable victims, resurrecting their final hours by taking their point of view, and performing a kind of incantatory meditation over their\r\nprivate encounters with Power.\r\n\r\nThe policemen, working girls, thugs, dissidents and hustlers who inhabit these pages are all orphans of a secret History; the outline of our collective fate takes shape in Weber’s epic work, expanding our awareness of what it means to be an actor in today’s dark opera.\r\nA regular contributor to the literary quarterly, Descant, Larry travels yearly to Asia, the Middle East, and the Arctic from his family home in Niagara on the Lake, Ontario, Canada. His personal interests include collecting vintage audio equipment from the 1970s, hard bebop, cycling, and the war poetry of the Great War.<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":20937551,"name":"Default","price":40.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64687917/-/IMG_1517.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64687917/-/IMG_1517.jpg","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64687933/-/IMG_1520.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64687933/-/IMG_1520.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64687949/-/IMG_1522.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64687949/-/IMG_1522.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64687989/-/IMG_1523.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64687989/-/IMG_1523.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64687997/-/IMG_1524.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64687997/-/IMG_1524.jpg","width":800,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6523725,"name":"Abandoned Sleep - Ari Marcopoulos","permalink":"abandoned-sleep-ari-marcopoulos","position":193,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/abandoned-sleep-ari-marcopoulos","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-23T06:10:49.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i>Abandoned Sleep</i>\r\nAri Marcopoulos\r\n\r\n7 x 9 1/2 in.\r\nSoftcover\r\n56 pages\r\nEdition of 500\r\n\r\nPublished by Dashwood Books \r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">\"This is the fourth Dashwood Book of Marcopoulos’s.

The aesthetics of minimalism and the drive of modernism are continually dominant and deserve perpetual consideration and updating. From film to digital painting to painting on paper, we move from content to color to form and back again. The seduction of an artwork is that of a landscape and the same for a person - it can be quiet and sublime or aggressively colorful. They're both inexhaustible. The significance lies in perception. It's the same as driving through the deserts of West Texas or standing on an overgrown hill in Los Angeles, nothing really changes, but it's everything to me.” Sam Falls\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":20738879,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64071091/-/paint_paper_palms_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64071091/-/paint_paper_palms_1.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64071129/-/paint_paper_palms_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64071129/-/paint_paper_palms_2.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64071149/-/paint_paper_palms_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64071149/-/paint_paper_palms_3.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64071165/-/paint_paper_palms_4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64071165/-/paint_paper_palms_4.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6523607,"name":"Fuck Paintings Etc. - Betty Tompkins","permalink":"fuck-paintings-etc-betty-tompkins","position":197,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fuck-paintings-etc-betty-tompkins","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-23T05:55:18.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i>Fuck Paintings Etc.</i>\r\nBetty Tompkins \r\n\r\n7 x 9 1/2 in.\r\nSoftcover\r\n36 pages\r\nEdition of 500\r\n\r\nText Martin Herbert\r\n\r\nPublished by Dashwood Books \r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Betty Tompkins' Fuck Paintings were begun in the early 1970s and are based on surreptitiously obtained hardcore pornographic magazines, feature gynecological close-ups of penetration, and are painted in an extraordinary and gorgeous monochromatic palette.

Guided (and haunted) by the extensive photographic and written material produced on his earlier journeys, as well as reflective chronicling of his futile retracings, this book considers the impossibility of tracking down and understanding one’s former self.

Mosse photographs both the rich topography, inscribed with the traces of conflicting interests, as well as rebel groups of constantly shifting allegiances at war with the Congolese national army (itself a patchwork of recently integrated warlords and their militias). For centuries, the Congo has repeatedly compelled and defied the western imagination. Mosse brings to this subject the use of a discontinued aerial surveillance film, a type of color infrared film called Kodak Aerochrome. The film, originally developed for military reconnaissance, registers an invisible spectrum of infrared light, rendering the green landscape in vivid hues of lavender, crimson and hot pink. The results offer a fevered inflation of the traditional reportage document, underlining the growing tension between art, fiction and photojournalism. Mosse's work highlights the ineffable nature of current events in today's Congo. <i>Infra</i> initiates a dialogue with photography that begins as an intoxicating meditation on a broken genre, but ends as a haunting elegy for a vividly beautiful land touched by unspeakable tragedy.<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":20737207,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64064333/-/IMG_1882.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64064333/-/IMG_1882.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64064365/-/IMG_1888.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64064365/-/IMG_1888.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64064381/-/IMG_1891.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64064381/-/IMG_1891.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64064397/-/IMG_1892.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64064397/-/IMG_1892.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64064405/-/IMG_1895.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64064405/-/IMG_1895.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6514131,"name":"Imprint - Yuichi Hibi (signed)","permalink":"imprint-yuichi-hibi","position":205,"price":150.0,"default_price":150.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/imprint-yuichi-hibi","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-22T05:47:43.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i>Imprint</i>\r\nYuichi Hibi\r\n\r\n8 1/2 x 11 in. \r\nHardcover\r\n192 pages, 79 black-and-white plates\r\n\r\nNumbered, signed, slipcased edition of 100\r\n\r\nPublished by Nazraeli Press\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">\"I went back to Japan after seven years of absence, from north to south I traveled the country through the lens: images distorted, images real, only imprints remain today. . . years ago and years ahead perhaps, this Japan travels inside me like a long bamboo path.\" Raw talent rarely express itself so forcefully as it does in Yuichi Hibi’s first book of photographs, <i>Imprint</i>.

They indicate an approach that is both direct and detached, where the unromantic clarity of the documentary style contradicts and enhances the dramatic intensity of the “tableau” form.

His art draws upon found fragments from the lives of persons unknown, such as scribbled notes, journal entries, personalized recipes, sketched drawings & stained ticket stubs. To this he adds his own hand-drawn, painted & collaged images to create story lines filled with dark humor, absurdity & insight. “Often using photographed or printed portraits as their base,” writes Deirdre Madeleine Smith in  the foreword of Implications, “John Hundt’s collages are distortions of figure that aim at absurdity & disparity. He calls one of his recurring formal strategies Totems, a figure that is built up with a combination of human, machine, animal & object parts. At turns graceful, whimsical or strange, Hundt’s constructions always follow in the rich tradition of photomontage by placing heterogeneous visual materials in dialogue with one another. However, Hundt brings a seamlessness to his work in such a way that no matter the absurdity of the combination, his constructions are completely believable in their respective contexts. This is equally true of his collaged landscapes, in which a verisimilitude of perspective is maintained in spite of the impossibility of the situation pictured.”\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":20078321,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61844855/-/IMG_4206.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61844855/-/IMG_4206.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61844871/-/IMG_4210.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61844871/-/IMG_4210.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61844895/-/IMG_4213.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61844895/-/IMG_4213.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61844951/-/IMG_4227.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61844951/-/IMG_4227.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61844975/-/IMG_4233.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61844975/-/IMG_4233.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2909547,"name":"AMPERSAND PUBLICATIONS","permalink":"ampersand-publications","url":"/category/ampersand-publications"},{"id":3373415,"name":"ART & DESIGN BOOKS","permalink":"art-design-books","url":"/category/art-design-books"}]},{"id":6179235,"name":"Women I Never Knew No. 1 ","permalink":"women-i-never-knew-no-1","position":209,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/women-i-never-knew-no-1","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-05-13T23:58:55.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Women I Never Knew No. 1 </i>\r\nMyles Haselhorst\r\n\r\n5 x 7 in. \r\nPerfect bound soft cover\r\n67 pages\r\n32 photographs\r\nPrinted on Mohawk Superfine paper\r\n\r\nDesigned & published by Ampersand\r\nPrinted & bound in Portland, Oregon\r\n\r\nEdition of 100\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Published on the occasion of a collaboration with <a href=\"http://dunderdonusa.com/blog/ampersand-gallery-fine-books-at-dunderdon-nyc\"> Dunderdon Workshop, NYC,</a> which is located at 25 Howard Street in SOHO.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Numbers 1-10 are signed & include an original real photo postcard from the collection.

Held together in an old envelope simply marked photos, I assume they represent the efforts of one collector. Dating from the 1920s & taken by unknown photographers, the staged quality of these images suggest they were intended for circulation, even as the act of owning them was considered illicit & kept hidden. In this, they differ slightly from the photographs taken by the bedroom pornographers alluded to above. Nonetheless, their snapshot quality marks a transition point from the work of trained studio photographers to the amateur efforts of men & women with snapshot cameras. They serve as a kind of template, a jumping off point for a type of photography that paralleled the development of family photos & has evolved into the unchecked exhibitionism of the internet age.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":19694139,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60674559/-/IMG_3657.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60674559/-/IMG_3657.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60674589/-/IMG_3654.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60674589/-/IMG_3654.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60674599/-/IMG_3663.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60674599/-/IMG_3663.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60674655/-/IMG_3675.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60674655/-/IMG_3675.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60674727/-/IMG_3669.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60674727/-/IMG_3669.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2909547,"name":"AMPERSAND PUBLICATIONS","permalink":"ampersand-publications","url":"/category/ampersand-publications"},{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6179229,"name":"Women I Never Knew No. 1 - Signed w/ Vintage Photograph No. 1","permalink":"women-i-never-knew-no-1-signed-w-vintage-photograph","position":210,"price":75.0,"default_price":75.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/women-i-never-knew-no-1-signed-w-vintage-photograph","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-05-13T23:57:07.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Women I Never Knew No. 1 </i>\r\nMyles Haselhorst\r\n\r\n5 x 7 in. \r\nPerfect bound soft cover\r\n67 pages\r\n32 photographs\r\nPrinted on Mohawk Superfine paper\r\n\r\nDesigned & published by Ampersand\r\nPrinted & bound in Portland, Oregon\r\n\r\nEdition of 100\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Published on the occasion of a collaboration with <a href=\"http://dunderdonusa.com/blog/ampersand-gallery-fine-books-at-dunderdon-nyc\"> Dunderdon Workshop, NYC,</a> which is located at 25 Howard Street in SOHO.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Numbers 1-10 are signed & include an original real photo postcard from the collection (shown at left).

Editor Will Steacy asked each photographer to abandon the conventional tools needed to make a photograph--camera, lens, film--and instead make a photograph using words, to capture the image (and its attendant memories) that never made it through the lens. In each essay, the photograph has been stripped down to its barest and most primitive form: the idea behind it. This collection provides a unique and original interpretation of the experience of photographing, and allows the reader into a world rarely seen: the image making process itself. <i> Photographs Not Taken </I> features contributions by: Peter Van Agtmael, Dave Anderson, Timothy Archibald, Roger Ballen, Thomas Bangsted, Juliana Beasley, Nina Berman, Elinor Carucci, Kelli Connell, Paul D’Amato, Tim Davis, KayLynn Deveney, Doug Dubois, Rian Dundon, Amy Elkins, Jim Goldberg, Emmet Gowin, Gregory Halpern, Tim Hetherington, Todd Hido, Rob Hornstra, Eirik Johnson, Chris Jordan, Nadav Kander, Ed Kashi, Misty Keasler, Lisa Kereszi, Erika Larsen, Shane Lavalette, Deana Lawson, Joshua Lutz, David Maisel, Mary Ellen Mark, Laura McPhee, Michael Meads, Andrew Moore, Richard Mosse, Zwelethu Mthethwa, Laurel Nakadate, Ed Panar, Christian Patterson, Andrew Phelps, Sylvia Plachy, Mark Power, Peter Riesett, Simon Roberts, Joseph Rodriguez, Stefan Ruiz, Matt Salacuse, Alessandra Sanguinetti, Aaron Schuman, Jamel Shabazz, Alec Soth, Amy Stein, and others.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":19693117,"name":"Default","price":14.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60670627/-/photographs-not-taken-stack.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60670627/-/photographs-not-taken-stack.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":6021469,"name":"I'll Find Another One Prettier Than You - Jefferson Hayman (signed)","permalink":"i-ll-find-another-one-prettier-than-you-jefferson-hayman","position":216,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/i-ll-find-another-one-prettier-than-you-jefferson-hayman","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-25T01:48:26.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> I'll Find Another One Prettier Than You </i>\r\nJefferson Hayman\r\n\r\n5 x 7 in. \r\nPerfect bound soft cover\r\n98 pages \r\n45 photographs\r\nPrinted on Mohawk Superfine paper\r\n\r\nForward by Robert E.

He lives & works in Tappan, New York,  a small town located minutes outside of Manhattan & filled with the history of the American War of Independence. From his training & environment, Hayman has forged an individual visual sensibility. The photographs themselves are handcrafted gelatin silver, platinum & pigment prints that seem historically timeless, captured with a delicacy of tonality that harks back to the highest traditions of graphic art. \"When viewing his photographs,\" Robert E. Jackson writes in the foreword, \"we are captivated by a sense of stillness & timelessness. Each image, whether depicting something man-made or containing a face, exists as a still life. Flesh is mutely rendered as if the skin of some exotic fruit. Objects take on the somber persona of a timeworn visage.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/category/books\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":19256861,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59120151/-/hayman-web1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59120151/-/hayman-web1.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59120159/-/hayman-web2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59120159/-/hayman-web2.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59120167/-/hayman-web3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59120167/-/hayman-web3.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59120175/-/hayman-web4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59120175/-/hayman-web4.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59120183/-/hayman-web5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59120183/-/hayman-web5.jpg","width":800,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2909547,"name":"AMPERSAND PUBLICATIONS","permalink":"ampersand-publications","url":"/category/ampersand-publications"}]},{"id":5958993,"name":"Gabe - Nick Haymes (signed)","permalink":"nick-haymes-gabe-signed","position":217,"price":40.0,"default_price":40.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nick-haymes-gabe-signed","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-17T23:03:34.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Gabe </i>\r\nNick Haymes\r\n \r\n8 3/4 x 11 in. \r\nHardcover\r\n128 pages\r\n\r\nText by Gus Van Sant\r\n\r\nPublished by DAMIANI\r\n\r\nFirst edition, 2012\r\n\r\nSigned by Nick Haymes & Gabe Nevins\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Nick Haymes first met Gabe Nevins on an editorial assignment in the summer of 2007. Gabe had just wrapped up his lead role in Gus Van Sant’s <i> Paranoid Park </i>, in which he had played a teenage skateboarder who accidentally kills a security guard. Gabe had never acted prior to starring in the film; he had heard about Van Sant’s casting call from a skateboard store and initially auditioned as an extra. Meeting the teenager, Haymes recalls: “Initially, Gabe was fairly shy, but it quickly transpired that he had seen some of my skateboarding images online and an instant friendship was struck. When the assignment was over, I approached Gabe about the possibility of working on more photographs as there was something entirely captivating about him and his energy.” This volume tracks the highs and lows of Gabe’s teen years, from stardom to emotional breakdown and homelessness.\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\nShipping in USA is $4\r\nInternational shipping is $20\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/category/books\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":19071343,"name":"Default","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58514643/-/IMG_3680a.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58514643/-/IMG_3680a.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58514667/-/IMG_3685.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58514667/-/IMG_3685.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58514691/-/IMG_3688.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58514691/-/IMG_3688.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58514707/-/IMG_3700.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58514707/-/IMG_3700.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58514755/-/IMG_3696.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58514755/-/IMG_3696.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"},{"id":2846891,"name":"COLLECTIBLE & RARE","permalink":"collectible-rare","url":"/category/collectible-rare"},{"id":3375767,"name":"SIGNED","permalink":"signed","url":"/category/signed"}]},{"id":5981431,"name":"Six by Six No. 3 - Christenberry, del Valle & Gómez, Divola, Moriyama, Müller & Weems","permalink":"six-by-six-no-3-christenberry-del-valle-gomez-divola-moriyama-muller-weems","position":218,"price":4500.0,"default_price":4500.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/six-by-six-no-3-christenberry-del-valle-gomez-divola-moriyama-muller-weems","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-20T05:28:01.000Z","description":"Carrie Mae Weems: \"Slow Fade to Black\".\r\n\r\nClick images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Six by Six No. 2 </i>\r\n\r\nWilliam Christenberry, <i>House Near Akron</i>\r\nEduardo del Valle & Mirta Gómez, <i>On View</i>\r\n John Divola, <i>LAX NAZ: Los Angeles International Airport Noise Abatement Zone (Exterior Views)\", 1975</i>\r\nDaido Moriyama, <i>Fishnet</i>\r\nKarin Apollonia Müller,<i> Timber Cove </i>\r\nCarrie Mae Weems,<i> Slow Fade to Black</i>\r\n\r\nEach book contains a separate exhibition-quality original print, numbered and signed by the artist, on 11 x 14 inch paper.\r\n\r\nSix books in custom-made slipcase.\r\n12 x 15 in. \r\nHardcover with dust jackets\r\nPage count varies\r\n\r\nPublished by Nazraeli Press \r\nMarch, 2012\r\n\r\nLimited to an edition of 100\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> \tAmpersand is pleased to offer set #37 in the award-winning limited edition series of books<i> Six by Six</i>.

Yet they look beyond the mere science of a corpse & instead investigate the implied narrative of a life that has ended, asking whether we are tethered to the point at which we die or if there is indeed a shape to what exists beyond death. \r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n0\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":18051985,"name":"Default","price":85.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55074433/-/hall1010.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55074433/-/hall1010.jpg","width":800,"height":541},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55074353/-/IMG_2666_ltd.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55074353/-/IMG_2666_ltd.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55074361/-/IMG_2670_ltd.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55074361/-/IMG_2670_ltd.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55074329/-/IMG_2643.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55074329/-/IMG_2643.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55074345/-/IMG_2644.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55074345/-/IMG_2644.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2909547,"name":"AMPERSAND PUBLICATIONS","permalink":"ampersand-publications","url":"/category/ampersand-publications"},{"id":2846891,"name":"COLLECTIBLE & RARE","permalink":"collectible-rare","url":"/category/collectible-rare"},{"id":3375767,"name":"SIGNED","permalink":"signed","url":"/category/signed"}]},{"id":5487001,"name":"Unarmed - Clayton Cotterell - Signed w/ Pigment Print","permalink":"unarmed-clayton-cotterell-signed-w-pigment-print","position":232,"price":125.0,"default_price":125.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/unarmed-clayton-cotterell-signed-w-pigment-print","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-17T02:51:00.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Unarmed </i>\r\nClayton Cotterell\r\n \r\n9 x 11 in. \r\nPerfect bound soft cover \r\n48 pages \r\n22 color photographs\r\n\r\nPreface by Myles Haselhorst\r\n\r\nPublished by Ampersand\r\nPrinted & bound in Portland, Oregon\r\n\r\nEdition of 100\r\n\r\nNumbers 1-10 are signed & include\r\nan 8x10 inch pigment print that is signed,\r\ndated & numbered by Cotterell on verso,\r\nwhich is shown at left.\r\n\r\n(Purchase standard $25 copy <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/product/unarmed-clayton-cotterell\"> here</a>)\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Coinciding with an exhibition at PNCA & Ampersand, <I> Unarmed </I> features photographs of Clayton's brother, Ian, who joined the military shortly after Clayton began actively photographing him in 2007.

Jackson from his extensive collection of vintage snapshots. Having been actively collecting for well over a decade, Jackson is a superb example of one who collects not merely to accumulate, but to seek out, arrange & ultimately form the images he finds into groupings that make statements about photography & culture at large. In <i> Pure Photography, </I> Jackson provides visual evidence of the uncanny manner in which snapshot photography isolates aspects of the world in a way the human eye alone cannot. \"Some alchemy of chance,\" Jackson writes, \"a misreading of surface detail, a mechanical error within the camera, or emulsion issues have caused these photographs to exist outside the standard notion of what a snapshot is meant to be. Being pure in the sense that they are visually unencumbered by a photographic intent which can be easily understood, one must approach the photos from a personal point of view. As aesthetic objects which cannot be read in the traditional sense, they steadfastly recoil from interpretation & exist simply to be experienced.\"\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Coinciding with this publication, our winter exhibition in the back gallery features a selection of original snapshots & pigment print enlargements from photographs featured in the book. \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Robert_E._Jackson_-_Winter_2012.html\">  HERE </a> for more information & images. \r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> Robert E. Jackson has collected snapshots since 1997. In the fall of 2007, his collection was the subject of an exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. & a catalogue entitled The Art of the American Snapshot:1888-1978. In early 2008, the exhibition traveled to the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth, Texas. Jackson actively collects all types of found photography, including cabinet cards, tintypes, photomatic portraits, arcade photographs & photo-collages from the 1870s through the early decades of the 20th century.  Jackson has a MA degree in art history from Chapel Hill, North Carolina and a MBA from the University of Texas, Austin. He has lived in Seattle since 1991.  \r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/products\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":16840251,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50991865/-/purephoto_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50991865/-/purephoto_cover.jpg","width":700,"height":700},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50991881/-/purephoto_spine.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50991881/-/purephoto_spine.jpg","width":700,"height":467},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50991849/-/purephoto_1unsigned.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50991849/-/purephoto_1unsigned.jpg","width":700,"height":467},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50991841/-/full_img_25.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50991841/-/full_img_25.jpg","width":800,"height":794},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50991815/-/full_img_01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50991815/-/full_img_01.jpg","width":484,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2909547,"name":"AMPERSAND PUBLICATIONS","permalink":"ampersand-publications","url":"/category/ampersand-publications"},{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"}]},{"id":4304359,"name":"Mug Shots - Chris Crites","permalink":"mug-shots-chris-crites","position":235,"price":22.0,"default_price":22.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mug-shots-chris-crites","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-08-23T04:07:29.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Mug Shots </i>\r\nChris Crites\r\n\r\n5 x 7 in. \r\nPerfect bound soft cover\r\n98 pages \r\n44 color illustrations\r\n\r\nPrinted & bound in Portland, OR\r\n\r\nEdition of 100\r\n\r\n <p align=\"justify\">  Coinciding with an exhibition at Ampersand titled <I> War.

But the gradual steps by which he transformed from an unknown into a leading artist are less well known. Steidl has undertaken to trace these steps in an ambitious series of publications. Before Color (Steidl, 2010) explored Eggleston’s revelatory early black and white images, while Chromes is an edit of more than 5,000 Kodachromes and Ektachromes taken from ten chronologically ordered binders found in a safe in the Eggleston Artistc Trust. This archive had once been used by John Szarkowski who selected the forty-eight images printed in Eggleston’s seminal book William Eggleston’s Guide, while the rest of the archive has remained almost entirely unpublished. This book presents Eggleston’s early Memphis imagery, his testing of colour and compositional strategies, and the development towards the ‘poetic snapshot’. In short, Chromes shows a master in the making.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> \r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"http://shop.ampersandvintage.com/category/books\"> here</a> to take a look at other books currently available for purchase.  \r\n\r\n Click <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> here </a> to return <a href=\"http://www.ampersandvintage.com/Ampersand_Vintage/Home.html\"> Ampersand. </a>","options":[{"id":17458599,"name":"Default","price":345.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":65.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53095187/-/eggleston_003.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53095187/-/eggleston_003.jpg","width":991,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53095211/-/eggleston_021.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53095211/-/eggleston_021.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53095243/-/eggleston_007.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53095243/-/eggleston_007.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53095299/-/eggleston_008.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53095299/-/eggleston_008.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53095339/-/eggleston_023.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53095339/-/eggleston_023.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2708795,"name":"PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS","permalink":"photography-books","url":"/category/photography-books"},{"id":2846891,"name":"COLLECTIBLE & RARE","permalink":"collectible-rare","url":"/category/collectible-rare"}]},{"id":5401505,"name":"Historia, Memoria y Silencios - Lorena Guillen Vaschetti","permalink":"historia-memoria-silencios-lorena-guillen-vaschetti","position":239,"price":45.0,"default_price":45.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/historia-memoria-silencios-lorena-guillen-vaschetti","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-05T07:04:22.000Z","description":"Click images to enlarge.\r\n\r\n<i> Historia, Memoria y Silencios </i>\r\nLorena Guillen Vaschetti\r\n \r\n7 3/4 x 9 1/4 in. \r\nHardcover with band\r\n84 pages\r\n43 Photos\r\n\r\n\r\nSchilt Publishing\r\n\r\nFirst edition, 2011\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"> 'My mother and I are the only members left of a big Italian family.
