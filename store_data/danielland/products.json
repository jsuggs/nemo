These aren't typical \"acoustic\" sets exactly, as I use an electric guitar and a modulation delay pedal, so the result is something that's stripped down but that also still has a nice atmospheric, shoegazey aspect to it. \r\n\r\nI've finally gotten to the point where I feel that the shows are something unique and interesting, and the kind comments I've received from people (including the Cocteau Twins Robin Guthrie!) about them have made me think that it might be worth making a record that reflected this aspect of my work. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, I'm pleased to announce that I've recorded an album called \"A Single Man\" (the title is from a Christopher Isherwood novel) which contains studio recordings done in this style. \r\n\r\nThe album includes some exclusive songs which I've only ever performed in this format and which won't be released anywhere else, including \"Amsterdam\", \"Fragments Shored (Lundy Island)\", Limerick\", and \"Drowning Song\". \r\n\r\nThere are also stripped-down renditions of Daniel Land & The Modern Painters songs including \"Benjamin's Room\", \"Lostening\" and \"Sleeping With The Past\" and solo versions of the tracks \"Cinderella City\" and \"The Sweetest Lover\", the full versions of which will be on my next 'proper' album.\r\n\r\nHere is the full tracklisting:\r\n\r\n1.
