I then let it dry and harden for a day inside the pretty shiny silver plated setting. \r\n\r\nIt acts different to the light. Sometimes it looks like I've encapsulated a piece of pink velvet and if you watch closely, you can see the bits of flowers. The color it is all natural, the grinded flowers have naturally tinted the resin and created this unique piece that will never be reproduced ever again. That is part of the wonders of handmade jewelry and working with natural elements. \r\n\r\nThe resin is so clear it acts sometimes as a mirror and will reflect what's in front of it and create beautiful imagery, as you can see in the pictures. \r\n\r\nThe pendant is <b>25mm</b> or <b>1 inch</b> and comes with a 16 inch (40.6cm) link <b>chain</b> that is free of nickel and will hang around your neck very nicely. \r\n\r\nThe good thing about resin jewelry is that it will last forever and a day. I wouldn't get it in the shower or a swimming pool though, because of the setting, but the resin is scratch resistant and won't get yellow with time. It will basically be here forever along with cockroaches but <strike>let's not think about that</strike>. ;)\r\n","options":[{"id":12153870,"name":"Red Flowers","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12153902,"name":"Yellow Flowers","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35376042/-/Red-Flower-003-big-cartel.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35376042/-/Red-Flower-003-big-cartel.jpg","width":1000,"height":845}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2050550,"name":"Pendants","permalink":"pendants","url":"/category/pendants"}]}]
