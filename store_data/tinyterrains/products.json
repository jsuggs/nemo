I am happy to include a card, just leave me a note with your message when ordering.\r\n\r\nNo need to worry about watering this terrarium, lichens are very hardy and do not die when they dry out. Lichens become brittle and stiff when not watered, but look pretty much the same. Spritz lightly with a little water and they become soft, pliable and spongy. Lichens need to dry out between waterings so you can water when it is convenient for you. \r\n\r\nLichens are unusual creatures and are not a single organism the way most other living things are, but rather a combination of two organisms living together intimately. They are a combination of fungi and algae working together. \r\n\r\n***SHIPPING***\r\nI personally handmake and ship each order, so please allow up to 7 business days before shipping.
