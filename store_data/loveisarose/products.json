We begin with special hand-selection of premium cut roses. Once we find our perfect rose, we carefully preserve it using true birth-month colors. Next, we hand trim our rose millimeter-by-millimeter to give it a sleek edging, and finally electro-plate it using 24K gold to perfect our masterpiece.\n\n\tThe entire process takes over 3 months, but we feel the end result is worth every minute.\n\n\tYour rose will be sent using <span class=\"caps\">FREE</span> ground shipping via <span class=\"caps\">UPS</span>, which normally takes 2-5 days from when the order is processed. The rose is carefully packaged and delivered in a beautiful keepsake gift box. Note: Please e-mail us if you prefer expedited shipping, since this will increase the total cost.\n\n\tFeel free to contact us with any questions.\n\n\t-Love Is a Rose\n\n","options":[{"id":315858,"name":"Default","price":64.97,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/132024/-/300.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/132024/-/300.png","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":71672,"name":"Wedding Favors","permalink":"wedding-favors","url":"/category/wedding-favors"}]}]
