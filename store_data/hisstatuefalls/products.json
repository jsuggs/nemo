Although the time of an EP is short HIS STATUE FALLS succeed in showing all their strengths: They still sound catchy and diverse with a groovy sound that doesn't allow standstill. The poppy roots aren't denied by the melodic vocals of Dennis Fries and the shouts of Jan Vergin show more facets than they did in the past. \"I Am The Architect\" draws the picture of a band that allows the pleasant feeling of having arrived and gathers positive energy for the upcoming tasks. With this release the musicians take a look back on the last months, what is specifically reflected by the lyrics. The title-track sends a clear message: The luck and the future lies in everyone's own hands. You grow by your tasks and mistakes, so ever give up but always give your best.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n1. Solid Ground\r\n2. I Am The Architect\r\n3. Pictures\r\n4. The End Is Yet To Come\r\n5.

The electronic parts are more varied, less striking and fit way better into the songs. When they wrote the songs for the new album “Mistaken For Trophies” the band tried to avoid obvious clichés: The songs are not buried beneath tons of effects like auto-tune, guitars are not just tuned down, and breakdowns are not only self-serving. “We considered what will come after the trend and we wanted to create a record that is still relevant in a couple of years“, the band said. “Mistaken For Trophies“ is darker, more grown-up and more personal than the band's previous record. The songs are about grief, loss and anger. They are simply referring to a normal life where relationships suddenly end and where you have to suffer the loss of loved ones.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01. Mistaken For Trophies\r\n02.
