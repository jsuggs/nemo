His chimeras are frozen with animalistic intensity in explosive and tortured positions.

Although Dau's work is not pinned-down to one style, it often combines representational and expressionistic elements, usually with pop and political references and  biting cynicism and wit.  By allowing mistakes and automatism to enter his process, his works are often left open to a multiplicity of readings.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, Dau founded the design studio Creative Superstore, and has worked with commercial clients from the action sports, fashion, music and corporate worlds.  He has contributed writings on art and music to Anthem Magazine and Monster Children Magazine, and is a collector of vinyl records, an enjoyer of books, the outdoors, tuna melts, red curbs, powder days, single-track and south swells.

The artist's indomitable spirit of creativity and resistance fractures and realigns old divides between street and gallery, and reinterprets the universal human struggle for freedom and control in a world bent on self-destruction.\r\n\r\nSince 2006, Whalen’s work has shown in a constant stream of sold-out gallery exhibitions in Los Angeles, London, Berlin, and Australia.  He was also included in 2009’s Apocalypse Wow! Exhibition at MACRO Museum of Contemporary Art in Rome, Italy.

Catching the collective eye of the design world with his album cover for The Presets’ Apocalypso in 2008, Jonathan has since created a breadth of work for clients including Ksubi, Surface to Air, RVCA, Nylon, Coca Cola and BMW. He has been awarded an ARIA and a British D&AD award, participated in judging panels for the likes of AWARD and presented at several conferences, including AGDA and Semi Permanent. Jonathan has become best known for his varied approach to the discipline of design, his personal ventures (including the mathematical style guide, Fashematics) and his projects as one third of TRU$T FUN!, which include an accessories range and the hit fashion comic, Petit Mal!\r\n\r\nRunning parallel to Jonathan’s career as a graphic designer is his work as a practicing visual artist, with which he participates in exhibitions regularly. His smooth illustrations demonstrate his uncanny understanding of depth and perspective, with a play on dimension that never compromises the credibility of the end result.  Jonathan has had three solo exhibitions at Monster Children Gallery in Sydney and frequently contributes his work in group shows throughout the world.","options":[{"id":9740220,"name":"Default","price":6.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26897682/-/cs_editions-jonathan_zawada.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26897682/-/cs_editions-jonathan_zawada.jpg","width":864,"height":628},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26897686/-/zawada-flat.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26897686/-/zawada-flat.jpg","width":720,"height":546},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26897690/-/collection.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26897690/-/collection.jpg","width":720,"height":546}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":476201,"name":"Notebook","permalink":"notebook","url":"/category/notebook"}]},{"id":818091,"name":"Ramsey Dau \"Bad Dreams\" Pocket Notebook","permalink":"cs-editions-artist-notepad-ramsey-dau-bad-dreams","position":14,"price":6.5,"default_price":6.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cs-editions-artist-notepad-ramsey-dau-bad-dreams","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-12-03T02:12:19.000Z","description":"<i>Back By Popular Demand.</i>  Due to the popularity of this design, we've carried it over from the first series.\r\n\r\n<b>Creative Superstore Editions</b> pocket-sized notebooks feature cover art from established and emerging artists from around the world.\r\n\r\n• Size: 3.5” x 5.25” - Perfect for keeping in your back pocket, bag or jacket!\r\n\r\n• 48 pages of creamy smooth acid and chlorine-free 60 lb. unlined off-white paper.

Although Dau's work is not pinned-down to one style, it often combines representational and expressionistic elements, usually with pop and political references and  biting cynicism and wit.  By allowing mistakes and automatism to enter his process, his works are often left open to a multiplicity of readings.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, Dau founded the design studio Creative Superstore, and has worked with commercial clients from the action sports, fashion, music and corporate worlds.  He has contributed writings on art and music to Anthem Magazine and Monster Children Magazine, and is a collector of vinyl records, an enjoyer of books, the outdoors, tuna melts, red curbs, powder days, single-track and south swells.

His dystopian scenes evoke Thomas Hobbes’ description of life as war between individuals: “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” Many of Peterson’s paintings feature images of hostility removed from any scenery that might bring reason to bear a sense of justness to the brutality; the only context given is the mélange of evisceration coating the floor. Peterson describes his bedlam as “a gray world where law breakers and law enforcers are one in the same; a world where ethics have been abandoned in favor of personal entitlement.” The Los Angeles-based artist has shown at galleries internationally, including, New Image Art in Los Angeles, ALICE Gallery in Belgium and Deitch Projects in New York.","options":[{"id":17557311,"name":"Default","price":70.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":32.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53413825/-/cleon_peterson.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53413825/-/cleon_peterson.jpg","width":679,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":434541,"name":"Art Print","permalink":"art-print","url":"/category/art-print"}]},{"id":5439669,"name":"Kill Pixie - Serigraph Print","permalink":"kill-pixie-serigraph-print","position":20,"price":70.0,"default_price":70.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kill-pixie-serigraph-print","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-10T06:35:19.000Z","description":"Monochrome serigraph print on heavy weight (100% cotton) paper\r\n\r\nSigned and numbered by the artist\r\n\r\nEdition of 42\r\n\r\nSize: 15\" x 22\" with 2 deckled edges\r\n\r\nWe stumbled upon a secret stash of prints from a group show we did in 2009.

The artist's indomitable spirit of creativity and resistance fractures and realigns old divides between street and gallery, and reinterprets the universal human struggle for freedom and control in a world bent on self-destruction.\r\n\r\nSince 2006, Whalen’s work has shown in a constant stream of sold-out gallery exhibitions in Los Angeles, London, Berlin, and Australia. He was also included in 2009’s Apocalypse Wow! Exhibition at MACRO Museum of Contemporary Art in Rome, Italy. His work has appeared in publications such as Juxtapoz, Modart Europe, Arkitip, Art Ltd., Anthem, and Monster Children. In 2008, Whalen was awarded the Sydney Music, Arts & Culture Award for Best Visual Artist, and in 2009 he was named in the Top 100 Creative Catalysts by the Creative Sydney festival. He currently lives and paints in Los Angeles, California.","options":[{"id":17557223,"name":"Default","price":70.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":32.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53413487/-/kill_pixie.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53413487/-/kill_pixie.jpg","width":679,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":434541,"name":"Art Print","permalink":"art-print","url":"/category/art-print"}]},{"id":5439615,"name":"Deedee Cheriel - Serigraph Print","permalink":"deedee-cheriel-serigraph-print","position":21,"price":70.0,"default_price":70.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/deedee-cheriel-serigraph-print","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-10T01:27:58.000Z","description":"Monochrome serigraph print on heavy weight (100% cotton) paper\r\n\r\nSigned and numbered by the artist\r\n\r\nEdition of 42\r\n\r\nSize: 15\" x 22\" with 2 deckled edges\r\n\r\nWe stumbled upon a secret stash of prints from a group show we did in 2009.

Born in the hippie town of Eugene, Oregon, she began her own band and record label at the age of 19.  Influenced by the popular DIY culture of that time, she played in several all-girl bands (Juned, Adickdid, The Teenangels, The Hindi Guns) and co-created the semi-autobiographical film Down and Out with the Dolls. This artist has lived and studied abroad: Honduras, Chile, England, Portugal, Spain and her native India.\r\n\r\nNow residing in Los Angeles, Cheriel’s work explores narratives that recognize the urgency and conflict in our continuing attempts to connect to the world.  With influences derived from such opposites as East Indian temple imagery, punk rock, and her Pacific Northwest natural environment, her images are indications of how we try to connect ourselves to others and how these satirical and heroic efforts are episodes of compassion and discomfort.  Bold elements drawn from landscapes -both urban and natural- and pop culture suggest the ability to find commonalities and relationships between ourselves and our surroundings that inevitably confirm our greater humanity and quest towards love.","options":[{"id":17557073,"name":"Default","price":70.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":32.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53413001/-/deedee_cheriel.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53413001/-/deedee_cheriel.jpg","width":679,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":434541,"name":"Art Print","permalink":"art-print","url":"/category/art-print"}]},{"id":5439433,"name":"Albert Reyes - Serigraph Print","permalink":"albert-reyes-serigraph-print","position":22,"price":70.0,"default_price":70.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/albert-reyes-serigraph-print","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-10T06:01:47.000Z","description":"Monochrome serigraph print on heavy weight (100% cotton) paper\r\n\r\nSigned and numbered by the artist\r\n\r\nEdition of 40\r\n\r\nSize: 22\" x 15\" with 2 deckled edges\r\n\r\nWe stumbled upon a secret stash of prints from a group show we did in 2009.

Recognized for his ubiquitous “GIVE “ tag, Albert has a distinctive artistic approach inspired not only by street art, comic books, and American pop culture; but also by contemporary and classical “high art “.

Since her cast of characters is sewn over flat backgrounds, the pieces resemble color field paintings with little specks of color. A closer look reveals a tiny cigarette held by a Yeti or a golden necklace worn by an Elf.\r\n\r\nMegan Whitmarsh lives and works in Los Angeles, California. Her work has been shown internationally to great acclaim, including recent exhibitions in New York (Sixtyseven Gallery), Iceland (Kling & Bang), and Los Angeles (New Image Art & Sixspace Gallery). She received a B.F.A. in painting from the Kansas City Art Institute (1993) and completed her M.F.A. at the University of New Orleans (1997) with the aid of a full fellowship. Upon graduating she migrated to Williamsburg, Brooklyn where she magnified the role of embroidery in her art. Concurrently, she made short films, comics and played keyboards in band, “The Hong Kong”.
