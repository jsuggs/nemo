Love it Amazing Botanicals! Thank You\" Sherise- Las Vegas, NV\r\n\r\nMy daughters hair is course and hard to style, we have tried everything and nothing has helped.  I purchased the Aloe Mint Spritz and Green Pomade a few weeks ago and used them to twist her hair.  You now have a customer for LIFE! Her hair was soft and the waves from the twists lasted 4 days!  Her hair doesn't last 4 hours, let alone 4 days!  Thank You so Much for making those products my Amanda is so happy and so is Mom.\" Sharon-Little Rock\r\n\r\n\r\nI just received the Green Pomade in a subscription box and was skeptical about a \"liquid pomade\"  It had separated from the heat but, I shook it and it was nice and creamy.  I used your Black Soap Shampoo and Honey Condish and twisted with the pomade.  The pomade was light and I didn't think it would do much in my 4C hair.  I didn't use any heat and when I took the twists out I was convinced!! My hair was soft, defined and the twist out lasted 4 days.  It took a while for the frizz to set in and when it did my hair was still soft!  I Love these Products!
