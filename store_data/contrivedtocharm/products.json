It can however, hold many different sized decks.\r\nCase measures:\r\n3 1/8 wide by 5 1/2 inches long by 1 1/8 deep.\r\nIf you choose to leave your cards boxed, the original Rider deck box fits right inside this leather case, or you can do as I've done and wrap your cards in a small silk scarf and place inside.\r\n\r\nCase is 100% leather and is two pieces riveted together, with an antique brass- hooking clasp. Leather is stained in an antique wash. Gold or silver hardware available. Please leave your preferance in the message to seller box at checkout. I can also customize colors upon request, or cut slits in the back if you would like to loop this over an existing costume belt etc..\r\n\r\nThis listing is for ONE tarot card case only. Tarot deck and scarf not included. Thank you!
