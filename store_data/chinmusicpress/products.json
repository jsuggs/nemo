In his first book, <i>Lynzsea Sky</i>, we hear from a twentysomething female college student. The conversations between Rozek and Lynzsea make you see young American women with new eyes.

In Todd Shimoda’s classic blend of science, philosophy and character development, the book slowly reveals one island community’s haunting past marked by betrayal, jealously, lust and loss.\r\n\r\nEndo, a young physician unjustly charged with a patient’s death, is banished to the island to care for the few remaining elderly residents. Determined to remain on their crumbling island and resuscitate their defunct fishing industry, the aging islanders plot against all outsiders. After a suspicious death and attacks on Endo and his fellow newcomers, he discovers why the islanders don’t wish to leave: years ago, jealousies, lust, and violence ripped apart their lives, and the wounds haven’t healed. The aftershocks of the islanders’ pasts, as well as Endo’s own troubled history, replay violently in the present just as a massive earthquake strikes.\r\n\r\nExquisitely designed with L.J.C. Shimoda’s brushstroke artwork throughout, <i>Subduction</i> also features a four color, sixteen-page illustrated retelling of the myth of Kashima, the Japanese god who controls a giant, thrashing catfish that causes earthquakes.

It also weaves in historical quotations from Louis Armstrong, Lafcadio Hearn, Walker Percy and many others. Their words give context to the topic of living in this culturally complex place. The culture of New Orleans can be as obvious as Bourbon Street or as subtle as a trumpet. Always, though, there is a passion for the culture and for the city. \r\n\r\nThose who choose to leave or are unable to come back still have an intense sense of what this city is all about.

In fact, if \"A Confederacy of Dunces\" were written by Lewis Carroll, Buddy would appear! Tracey Tangerine's debut novel is at turns zany and contemplative, and the lesson learned is a profound one that resonates in New Orleans like nowhere else.
