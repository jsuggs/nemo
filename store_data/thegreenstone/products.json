Now, the racial disparity isn't the only thing that gives her pause; she has no idea who this Brandon Greene person is or why he's so important. And while she attempts to convince her mother that a man can take care of her just as well as she, Brandon's parents look to her as though they've never seen a black person a day in their lives.

Sure it seems simple in the grand scheme of things. After all, she's got her family supporting her, and family is all that matters. She is ostracized in her dorm for being just a little bit quiet and a little bit conservative. But that doesn't bother her…initially. Her roommate is loud and wild and white, drinks beer and has sex with her boyfriend. They are polar opposites in every sense of the word. But when Natalie decides to accompany her roommate to a house party off-campus in a cozy house of blue siding, her world is turned upside down the moment that she's knocked unconscious with a flying beer bottle. Yes, you read that correctly. When she comes to (in more ways than one) she is face to face with Brandon Greene, a preppy, oatmeal-skinned New Yorker, with a loud mouth, a grand smile and an open heart. Brandon makes his intentions clear from the beginning: he is hopelessly in love with his girlfriend, Sophia, but does not want to marry her. He does, however, want to be friends with Natalie. \r\n\r\nNeither Brandon nor her curiosity about him make sense to her at all, and her sense of complacency begins to tumble as she and Brandon grow closer.
