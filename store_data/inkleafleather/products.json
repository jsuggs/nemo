They feature solid brass hardware and are secured with hand hammered solid copper rivets. The edges are hand burnished and finished with beeswax.\r\n\r\nOver time the leather will darken first to a honey color and then to a deeper warmed brown. Each belt will take on a different character based on the use and wear of the owner. Direct exposure to sunlight will darken the leather, as will oil and wax. There are a variety of oils and conditioners that can be applied to veg-tan leather. My own preferred method is to first apply neatsfoot oil, let that dry, then apply a beeswax based conditioner while gently heating the leather. The heat (not too hot, you don't want to damage the leather) will melt the wax and help it to soak into the leather. After waxing, let it sit for 20 minutes to an hour and buff off the excess with a soft cloth.\r\n\r\nMeasuring: \r\nDo not enter your pant size. Measure your waist through your belt loops. This is your belt size, which is where the middle hole will be. Please contact us if you have any questions about sizing, as belts are custom cut, making all belt sales final and non-returnable unless there is a mistake on our part.\r\n\r\nIf your size isn't listed, please contact us.
