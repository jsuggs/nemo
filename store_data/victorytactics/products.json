Historically, tactical pens have had a screw-off cap that is cumbersome to use and often leads to the cap being lost or the pen sitting in a drawer unused. Since 99.99% of a tactical pen's life will be spent as a pen and not a self-defense device, it makes sense to make that pen as user friendly as possible. The Gerber Impromptu really shines in this regard; from its lightweight, slim profile, to its extremely convenient push-button activation. \r\n\r\nThe Gerber Impromptu Tactical Pen utilizes a \"Rite in the Rain\" ballpoint pen cartridge and can write in just about any conditions. Additionally, the Gerber Impromptu features a hardened glass-breaker and a cerakote finish that is durable and good looking. Also, unlike other tactical pens, the Gerber Impromptu is actually sized like a normal pen so it fits in pen slots.
