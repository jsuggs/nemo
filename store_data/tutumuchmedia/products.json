It’s a rocky relationship.   In the summer, I enjoy him all night long, dining and dancing until the sun calls me home.  During the winter, MANhattan turns cold on me, icy, and I want to leave him for St Bart’s.  I end up staying, waiting for him to embrace me with warmth once again. MANhattan is not always a good boyfriend he can leave you worn and torn, bitter, angry and low, like you don’t belong.  It’s a wear and tear kind of relationship.  But it doesn’t mean you get to leave him, no, you have to do the exact opposite, hold on tight and wear the storm.  .  \r\n\r\nOur days are filled with business, but in the night time we are all about fun.  I won’t bore you with tales of everyday work, I want to excite you.  I want to entice you to try him out yourself (I don’t mind sharing). In a city full of illusion, dating and mating comes with a price, but when you do it right, you are the one left feeling full not empty.   Embrace it with open arms, and though it may initially feel like a horrible roller coaster, it quickly becomes a joy ride and you will raise your hands high in the air at every bump and turn.  The city may have been named after man but it’s made up of fabulous women.  \r\n\r\nDating in New York is not about following the rules of the game, there are too many, but you need to be highly aware of the rules and all the players to properly assess the field.  If MANhattan is a war zone this book is your boot camp. Let’s make being single fun again.
