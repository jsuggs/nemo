Already having released a hand full of tapes and vinyl on obscure labels such as Kassettbolaget Svart Pyramid and Hästen & Korset and the aforementioned Moptaco Dics, during the late summer of twentyten a mp3 stream crossed a number of European borders which Knife Slits Water released as the 'Korriderna' cassette. Although visually dedicated to that magical zone called Swedish Summer, mentally the man is looking down to the lower regions of his counterpart, while the third corner of the triangle that is Korriderna is sequenced sound. The six songs on this cassette are humming, vintage synthesizer loops backed up with tucked away, droning, industrial drum rhythm. These layers are topped by panting, hissing and whispering vocals, old television samples and flanging, swirling melody. The analogue squeaks are as repetitive as those insane number stations from the cold war, and just as haunting - \"Korriderna is everywhere and beyond\".\r\n\r\nSongs:\r\n01 Floatings\r\n02 Korrider\r\n03 Wasp Mind\r\n04 With Horse Rack\r\n05 A Bond To Wonder\r\n06 Goose God\r\n\r\nPressing Info:\r\n50 pro taped white cassettes, full color sleeve. \r\nReleased in September 2010","options":[{"id":9992047,"name":"Default","price":4.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":125,"name":"Hungary","code":"HU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":142,"name":"Liechtenstein","code":"LI"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":150,"name":"Malta","code":"MT"}},{"amount_alone":1.76,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.75,"amount_with_others":0.0},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":184,"name":"Poland","code":"PL"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":190,"name":"Russian Federation","code":"RU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":203,"name":"Slovakia (Slovak Republic)","code":"SK"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":204,"name":"Slovenia","code":"SI"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27774409/-/korriderna01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27774409/-/korriderna01.jpg","width":434,"height":680}],"artists":[{"id":47495,"name":"Optic Nest","permalink":"optic-nest","url":"/artist/optic-nest"}],"categories":[{"id":686701,"name":"Tapes","permalink":"tapes","url":"/category/tapes"}]},{"id":229124,"name":"K/W #04: Empire Cheese 'Efficient use of Space' 7\" EP","permalink":"k-w-04-empire-cheese-efficient-use-of-space-7-ep","position":3,"price":4.5,"default_price":4.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/k-w-04-empire-cheese-efficient-use-of-space-7-ep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-02-03T18:00:25.000Z","description":"Some bedroom projects should stay there. Or even better, be hidden under the bed, covered up by piles of empty beer cans, dust and dirty laundry. This is definitely not the case with Empire Cheese, the moniker chosen by Matthias Kreutzer. Empire Cheese manages to give you a glimpse in the personal space of the bedroom loner. Sitting there, recording sketches, ideas and traces of lo-fi pop and delay drenched melodies while downing a bottle of cheap red wine, without the limitations and reservations you feel when writing songs intended to be heard by 'others'. In his own words, after being asked to do a 7\" EP  \"…the idea of efficiency became part of this activity, all of a sudden I have the responsibility for the space they are providing me, which is literally the 15 minutes on the vinyl and in a more abstract way their dedication and trust in what I am doing.  The title is a somewhat ironic comment on this situation which I almost find a bit scary since I never thought of Empire Cheese as a project with which I would release records.\"\r\n\r\nNon-the-less, Empire Cheese was made available on vinyl.  The first song, Trap, starts off with a distorted, almost danceable, beat but after the plastic sounding 1970's Bontempi organ combined with his low, layered vocals come in, the atmosphere of the song completely changes into an intimate lo-fi pop song with a beautiful melody that sticks into your mind. The second song, 'The Gap Between What I Should and Will do Tomorrow', somewhat connects to Trap, but includes more layers of organ, vocals and guitars. Despite the absence of drums the song is very rhythmic: one staccato guitar playing just three cords (remember punk?), while another plays a melodic loop, all accompanied by sober vocals.\r\n \r\nThe flip side features the song 'Distant', a 6-minute drone of  delayed guitars and vocals that's like a long drive in summer through a landscape similar to the one pictured on the sleeve: a clear blue sky, crystal clear lake, green treetops and majestic mountains in the distance…","options":[{"id":990411,"name":"Default","price":4.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":142,"name":"Liechtenstein","code":"LI"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":125,"name":"Hungary","code":"HU"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":150,"name":"Malta","code":"MT"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":184,"name":"Poland","code":"PL"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":190,"name":"Russian Federation","code":"RU"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":203,"name":"Slovakia (Slovak Republic)","code":"SK"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":204,"name":"Slovenia","code":"SI"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1632077/-/EC.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1632077/-/EC.jpg","width":150,"height":150}],"artists":[{"id":5885,"name":"Empire Cheese","permalink":"empire-cheese","url":"/artist/empire-cheese"}],"categories":[{"id":111304,"name":"7\" Vinyl","permalink":"7-vinyl","url":"/category/7-vinyl"}]},{"id":107863,"name":"K/W #02 Chronic Heist 'Quick Fix With Repairs/The Brighter Lights' 7' EP","permalink":"k-w-02-chronic-heist-quick-fix-with-repairs-the-brighter-lights-7-ep","position":4,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/k-w-02-chronic-heist-quick-fix-with-repairs-the-brighter-lights-7-ep","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2008-05-27T02:34:02.000Z","description":"The guys in Chronic Heist (from Stockholm, Sweden) gathered their musical tricks in post-hardcore bands like Jr Ewing, Trapdoor Fucking Exit and 8 Days of Nothing. Chronic Heist, however, differs very much from those previous bands, not approach-, but sound wise. With Chronic Heist they took the winding road to 'free dudes'-state. After their impressive, debut album their new songs take 'it' further and sound even more 'out there' in a solid way. What this 'it' is is hard to describe. Chronic Heist passionately plays a modern version of '70's art/krautrock that's dynamic and nervous, yet raw and stiff. It's progressive spaced out glam or suburban goth (like they describe their music themselves) that was directly implemented into the 'here & now'.\r\n\r\nThe title track 'Quick fix with Repairs' immediately kicks in with loud electronic piano's and psychedelic bass riffs. It's a great song with even greater hooks that combines the best parts of the songs on their first album. The B-side 'The Brighter Lights' has an odd, meandering atmosphere.
