You can use Woolly Pockets both indoors and out; they have built-in moisture barriers to help protect furniture, and they're equally at home outside in the elements. They're perfect for creating urban gardens where you have space to garden but no land to garden in. Woolly Pockets are lightweight and can be folded flat, which makes them very easy to use, move, and store just about anywhere. Woolly Pockets have two main components: the breathable felt and the built-in moisture barrier. The breathable portion is made of 100% recycled plastic bottles that have been industrially felted. The moisture barrier is made according to military standards for impermeability from 60% recycled plastic bottles. Each pocket is stitched together by hand with a double lock stitch and strong, UV-resistant nylon thread.\r\n\r\nEasy to install yourself and durable enough for professional use, Wallys create an instant lush living wall.

A natural wood fired tub with a modern use and view on how to re-experience your environment.  With its fast natural heating system and its lightweight (75 kgs) you can easily transport the dutchtub to any place you like and use it as long thereâ€™s water and wood. The durable materials make it a high quality and hygienic product.  After the tub has been filled with water, the fire can be started in the  spiral. This sets a natural circulation in motion drawing cold water from  the bottom of the tub and adding hot water to the top of the tub. The  natural heating system will quickly heat the cold water in just two hours up to a comfortable temperature. \r\n\r\nBasic Tub 800lt Capacity (Includes tub, lid, coil, turbo, basket and ashtray)\r\n\r\nFreight costs are billed separately.
