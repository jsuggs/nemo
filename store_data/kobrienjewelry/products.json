The form is simple, allowing my focus to be mainly on the process of fusing colored glass to metal. These earrings are made of fine silver discs formed by hand, measuring 9mm round. I sift crushed glass into these silver cups and use my torch to fuse glass to metal. I repeat the process a few times to achieve a rich, vibrant color. Once I am pleased with the hue I solder a post to the back and clean the silver to a shine. \r\n\r\nThese are made of fine silver discs formed by hand. I filled the fine silver cups with blue enamel and torch-fired them. This process was repeated many times to achieve a rich color. I also played with allowing the flame to oxidize the sifted glass. *please note that the color may vary slightly as they are handmade*\r\n\r\nThe first is a smoke dot, a basic shade of grey with a slight hint of green, the perfect neutral hue and the mustard dash adds a refreshing summery look.\r\n\r\nThe second pair is smoky grey, the perfect neutral tone to show off my favorite shade of aqua.\r\n\r\nThe last pair is a shade of minty green with a splash of marigold which reminds me of the sea and summer sun.\r\n\r\n*please allow 1-2 weeks for fabrication on this item*\r\n\r\nAll of my jewelry is sent in a kraft colored jewelry box made of recycled materials and tied with a bow.

After making some simple itty bitty necklaces I realized I needed another option, a piece just as simple and timeless but with a little something extra. I came to see I needed more circles and texture! Those rusty old hammers I collect have been growing in numbers but had yet to be used. They had a home on my hammer wall but didn't have a home in my line of jewelry. I tested a few, found some new textures I fell in love with, then played around with how I wanted these textures to mingle and fit together. Somehow my design quickly fell into place. One, oxidized circle would be front and center while one lined, hazy circle would fall to the right and one dappled, cratered circle would fall to the left. After showing off my new design I had heard over and over how this piece reminded folks of moons. \r\n\r\nCalling this \"to the moon and back\" came naturally. This necklace was made out of my love of playing with textures and the hammers that create them. It came out of my passion to push myself to create a new design to keep me inspired and in love with my work. This necklace came from a desire I had to wear something new. \r\n\r\nI hope you can find your own meaning from this piece. To me the circles represent the dark, stormy times we need to forge through, the hazy times which prevent us from seeing our lives clearly and the dappled days of sunlight and clarity when love is right there in front of us.\r\n\r\nEach moon is 5mm small and hangs on a 16 inch chain. The clasp is handmade and the chain is cut by me, so if you need a different size please don't hesitate to ask. [please note that there may be an extra charge depending on the amount of chain needed so please request a custom order.] Please allow 1-2 weeks for fabrication on this item.\r\n\r\nAll of my jewelry is sent in a kraft colored jewelry box made of recycled materials and wrapped with a twine bow. Your jewelry will be in wrapped in tarnish resistant paper for your storing convenience.\r\n\r\nIf this purchase is meant to be a gift I’d love to type a message for you.

After making simple itty bitty earrings for so long I realized I needed another option, just as simple and timeless but with a little something extra. I came to see I needed texture! Those rusty old hammers I collect have been growing in numbers but had yet to be used. They had a home on my hammer wall but didn't have a home in my line of jewelry. I tested a few, found some new textures I fell in love with.\r\n\r\nCalling this \"to the moon and back\" came naturally. These earrings were made out of my love of playing with textures and the hammers that create them. It came out of my passion to push myself to create a new design to keep me inspired and in love with my work. These earrings came from a desire I had to continue expanding lines of jewelry, offering pieces to mingle and match to compliment each other. \r\n\r\nI hope you can find your own meaning from these pieces. To me the circles represent the dark, stormy times we need to forge through, the hazy times which prevent us from seeing our lives clearly and the dappled days of sunlight and clarity when love is right there in front of us.\r\n\r\nEach moon is 5mm small, perfect for everyday and an accent to this necklace: http://www.kobrienjewelry.com/product/to-the-moon-and-back-necklace\r\n\r\nAll of my jewelry is sent in a kraft colored jewelry box made of recycled materials and wrapped with a twine bow.

The first pair is oxidized then tumbled allowing the edges to shine. The second pair is tumbled to a silver shine.\r\n\r\nI have two options for these earrings. The longer pair are about 5/8\" wide and the ear wire hangs about 2.5\" long. The short pair is 5/8\" wide and hangs 1.5\" long.\r\n\r\n**Please note that only the oxidized version are part of the flash sale. They are $10 off with free USPS Priority domestic shipping.

I took my inspiration from some nasturtium plants I had been growing on the fire escape. The irregular shape of the leaves intrigued me as I watered them day after day and with them in mind I stretched and hammered some perfect circles into a more organic shape. And since I had been using those perfect little circles for so long and grew so attached, I decided to add one as an accent.\r\n\r\nThis necklace has two lovely charms, the largest being about half an inch and in a lovely shade of plum and the smallest being 3/8 of an inch in a pale green I call first frost. Each has its own chain but is attached to the same clasp so they don't get tangled. The longer chain measures 16 inches while the shorter chain is about 15.5 inches. \r\n\r\nMy enamel work is made by sifting crushed glass onto a dapped disc of fine silver. Once the surface is well coated I torch fire the disc to fuse the crushed glass to the silver creating an even surface. I repeat the process until the surface of the silver is well covered in a rich hue. After I solder a bail to the pendants I clean them to a shine, string them on hand cut sterling silver chain and solder on a handmade clasp. \r\n\r\n**please allow 1-2 weeks for fabrication time on this item as it is made to order**\r\n\r\nAll of my jewelry is sent in a kraft colored jewelry box made of recycled materials and tied with a bow.

I took my inspiration from some nasturtium plants I had been growing on the fire escape. The irregular shape of the leaves intrigued me as I watered them day after day and with them in mind I stretched and hammered some perfect circles into a more organic shape. And since I had been using those perfect little circles for so long, I decided to add one as an accent.\r\n\r\nThis necklace has two lovely charms, the largest being about half an inch in the color of smoky grey with a splash of marigold and the smallest being 3/8 of an inch in a rich marigold hue. Each has its own chain but is attached to the same clasp so they don't get tangled. The longer chain measures 16 inches while the shorter chain is about 15.5 inches. \r\n\r\nMy enamel work is made by sifting crushed glass onto a dapped disc of fine silver. Once the surface is well coated I torch fire the disc to fuse the crushed glass to the silver creating an even surface. I repeat the process until the surface of the silver is well covered in a rich hue. After I solder a bail to the pendants I clean them to a shine, string them on hand cut sterling silver chain and solder on a handmade clasp. \r\n\r\n**please allow 1-2 weeks for fabrication on this item**\r\n\r\nAll of my jewelry is sent in a kraft colored jewelry box made of recycled materials and tied with a bow.

A wearable scale with my daisy necklace.\r\n\r\nThis hoop is two and a half inches long and hangs from a 17 inch, textured chain which closes with a handmade clasp. The hoop has a slight texture on it that I created with an old, rusty hammer. I added a daisy just off center.

I am drawn to the free forms of a heavy, industrial metal. What may attract me most is iron work generally has a lovely flower, often right in the center of a design. I took my love of forging and brought it to a smaller scale, a wearable scale, with my daisy hoops.\r\n\r\nThese hoops are two and a half inches and hang from a french ear wire. There is a slight texture on them I created with an old, rusty hammer. I added a daisy just off center. There is a sweet little bail at the top of the hoops which keep them in place, making the daisy stay put. This bail also allows the earrings to dance rather well from the ear wire. Though they may not look it, these daisy hoops are rather light.\r\n\r\n**please allow 1-2 weeks for fabrication time on this item**\r\n\r\nAll of my jewelry is sent in a kraft colored jewelry box made of recycled materials and tied with a bow.

I love the pop of color. \r\n\r\nThis necklace has two lovely charms, the largest being about half an inch and the smallest being 3/8 of an inch. Each has its own chain but is attached to the same clasp so they don't get tangled. The longer chain measures 16 inches while the shorter chain is about 15.5 inches. \r\n\r\nThe pendants are fine silver with torch fired enamels.

My dot collection is made by sifting crushed glass onto a dapped disc of fine silver. Once the surface is well coated I torch fire the disc to fuse the crushed glass to the silver creating an even surface. I repeat the process until the surface of the silver is well covered in a rich hue. After I solder a bail to the pendants I clean them to a shine, string them on hand cut sterling silver chain and solder on a handmade clasp.  \r\n\r\nThis pollen necklace a blue base like that of an anemone petal dusted with pollen. The teeny dot is a fresh blue, before the pollen sacs have shed their color.\r\n\r\nThis necklace has two lovely charms, the largest being about half an inch and the smallest being 3/8 of an inch. Each has its own chain but is attached to the same clasp so they don't get tangled.

My moon earrings were originally designed from some scrap silver which kept catching my eye on my jewelers bench. I had a commission to make a boutonniere for a wedding. It was made of silver sheet which was hand textured with a scribe and ruler. The texture was so lovely that I kept the scraps around waiting to make something of them. I finally punched some holes in the sheet and dapped them slightly. A post was soldered onto the back and violà, the moon post earrings came to being. They have proven to be popular and are now made from sheet purposely textured for these earrings. I still love their simplicity, ability to capture and reflect light and color and dainty charm.\r\n\r\nThe Details:\r\nSmall moon earrings are 6mm round.\r\nMedium moon earrings are 8mm round.\r\nLarge moon earrings are 9mm round.\r\nAll sizes come in either a shiny finish or oxidized. \r\nEach size + finish are also offered as a single earring.\r\n\r\nAll of my jewelry is sent in a kraft colored jewelry box made of recycled materials and tied with a bow.

Images of earrings were swimming in my head. I got out of bed and sketched them in my book and returned to my pillow excited about my new designs. The next day I went to the studio and put aside all of my work in progress and focused on these hoops. I love their simplicity and had fun making them. (And wearing a pair too!) They are formed on my bracelet mandrel, textured with an old hammer and completed with a lovely satin or oxidized finish.\r\n\r\nThese hoops hang on handmade french ear wires and dangle about 3 and 7/8 inches long and are almost 2.25  wide. \r\n\r\nAll of my jewelry is sent in a kraft colored jewelry box made of recycled materials and wrapped with a twine bow. The jewelry will be packed in tarnish resistant paper for your storing convenience. \r\n\r\n*If this purchase is meant to be a gift please let me know, I'd love to type a message for the recipient.
