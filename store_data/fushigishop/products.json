These darling bows are meant to be positioned upon your your ponytails, braids or buns. While they are not guaranteed to bring out the sun, they will encourage happy thoughts and sunny smiles!\r\n\r\nEach bow is made by me using hand-picked fabrics chosen for their high quality finish and beautiful prints and combined with the best quality durable hairbands that I could find.\r\n\r\nAs every bow is made by hand, each one will be unique. I have tried to make them in a way that they will last and last.\r\n\r\nSo, even after the hair elastic component goes, the bow can be fixed onto a new one and continue to be used.\r\n\r\nMo Coppoletta has an international reputation for unique and exquisite tattoos, so was the perfect choice to represent this collection inspired by the art of touch. \r\n\r\nJoy and Sorrow is derived from a fascination Mo has with nursery rhymes and their dark magic. He wanted to symbolise the Liberty peacock by using different kinds of birds. Mo adorned them with strings of pearls, deco brooches and surrounded them with dragonflies, all of which were inspired by Liberty archive prints from the 1920s, creating a surrealist design with deep dark grounds. \r\n\r\n\r\n☆*･゜ﾟ･ The lovely GlacialGlow showing off her Go Away Rain Cloud bow!

She is industrious and determined in all she does. Thoroughly eccentric, she is often heard muttering to herself or seen exploding into a wild jig to suite her fancy. These little very useful bags are inspired by her pernickety yet whimsical soul.\r\n“Things that bring us moments of joy and comfort must not be carted about the place in ugly plastic bags!” Exclaims the curious mistress of Stranger London. \r\n\r\n✝The Composition: \r\n\r\nHand made little boxy structured totes. Each of them made by me using hand picked fabrics to suit any fancy, predilection and penchant.  \r\nPerfect for the carrying of lunch boxes, books, canisters of tea, knitting, spying equipment (Mrs Marple may well have liked one for herself).\r\n\r\nThis is the very last that will be made.\r\n\r\n\"Forget-me-not Hello Kitty\", is made using a Hello Kitty and Liberty Japan exclusive cotton lawn and slubby soft denim on the exterior. I have lined with a lavender polkadot polycotton and added a vintage blue lace into the mix. The bag has been reinforced so it is structured and strong. The handles are made of cotton webbing that is soft on the hand yet durable and robust. \r\n\r\n\r\n✝The Size:\r\nThe bag (excluding the handles) measures about 26cm by 19cm. \r\n\r\n>> Hello Kitty  & Liberty have been collaborating in creating gorgeous fabrics and this is taken from their 1st season as is very rare and hard to find now.\r\n\r\n✝ A Note About Liberty Tana Lawn:\r\n\r\nLiberty Tana Lawn was launched in 1920 and originally used cotton from the shores of Lake Tana in Sudan. Liberty cotton in exceptionally fine, light and strong with a smooth sheen that makes it feel comparable to silk. There is no doubt why this is the most famous fine cotton in the world.\r\n","options":[{"id":47480658,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.8,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.2,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127095732/-/HKFMN.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127095732/-/HKFMN.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127095735/-/IMG_0095.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127095735/-/IMG_0095.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127095738/-/IMG_0098.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127095738/-/IMG_0098.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127095744/-/IMG_0101.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127095744/-/IMG_0101.jpg","width":1000,"height":667}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3345575,"name":"Useful Things","permalink":"useful-things","url":"/category/useful-things"},{"id":5290917,"name":"Useful Things--Bags","permalink":"useful-things-bags","url":"/category/useful-things-bags"}]},{"id":14637600,"name":"✝ \"Shimmer Pins\", earrings ","permalink":"shimmer-pins-earrings","position":52,"price":6.5,"default_price":6.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/shimmer-pins-earrings","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-05T16:46:56.000Z","description":"Be careful where you pin your hopes.\r\n\r\n✝The Construction: \r\n5 Swarovski Crystals that shimmer and sparkle are caught on gold plated safety pins.

He told me that his job is to scour the floors of the oceans to seek out lost keys. But, once a year he is allowed to rise from the sea and breath the fresh night air. He smelled of driftwood and ozone, of bracing cologne and salty air. It mingled the herbaceous fragrance of the sea facing trees and citrus.\r\n\r\n✝The Composition: \r\nTop notes of lemons and bergamot marry with juniper, rosemary and a gentle jasmine. The base is a clean medley of cedar wood and vetiver. \r\n\r\nThis is a generously scented candle created with a thoughtful blend of fragrance and essential oils. Each one is hand poured and made with a superior quality soy wax and a cotton wick.\r\n\r\n✝The Mortality: \r\nThis is a tinned candle, so you can try them out at a reasonable cost. I hope to make and stock glass candles soon.\r\n\r\nMeasures 7.5cm x 5cm and has an approx burn time of 25 hours.\r\n\r\n✝ A Note About Soy Wax: \r\nSoy wax is a clean burning wax as it contains 90% less soot than paraffin wax so it is ceiling and wall friendly. Soy wax is easy to clean up with just soap and water. When you come to the end of your candle, remove the wick, give the tin a quick wash and send it back to me for refilling :)\r\n\r\n✝ 1st Light: \r\nWhen you 1st light your candle, allow the soy wax to create an even melt pool that reaches all sides of the containers.\r\n\r\nUK DELIVERY ONLY (mean customs laws)","options":[{"id":47070552,"name":"Default","price":8.5,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.8,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.2,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126788583/-/IMG_6388.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126788583/-/IMG_6388.JPG","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126788565/-/IMG_6386.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126788565/-/IMG_6386.JPG","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126788568/-/IMG_6382.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126788568/-/IMG_6382.JPG","width":1000,"height":667}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4590065,"name":"Curiousities","permalink":"curiousities","url":"/category/curiousities"},{"id":6480741,"name":"Curiousities--Candles","permalink":"curiousities-candles","url":"/category/curiousities-candles"}]},{"id":14536215,"name":"✝ \"Glorious Claire-Aude\" passport/notebook sleeve *Free Gift*","permalink":"glorious-claire-aude-passport-notebook-sleeve","position":61,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/glorious-claire-aude-passport-notebook-sleeve","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-31T17:32:50.000Z","description":"✝The Composition:\r\nStranger London growls at tatty passports.

The interior is lined with navy gingham and has been reinforced so it is flexible and strong with firm bottom (tee hee).The handles are made of cotton webbing that is soft on the hand yet durable and robust.\r\n\r\nI have left the bag open in case you would prefer a shopper style.

Liberty cotton in exceptionally fine, light and strong with a smooth sheen that makes it feel comparable to silk. There is no doubt why this is the most famous fine cotton in the world.\r\n\r\nThis cloth is called \"Manning\" and takes its inspiration from William Morris’ poem; ‘Iceland First Seen’, the Liberty design team travelled to Iceland on an exploration of the senses to create a series of designs relating to the wonders of sight. \r\n\r\nManning is a digital design created using photographs of Icelandic glaciers and mountains.

These roomier useful bags are inspired by Madame Fushigi's pernickety yet whimsical soul. \r\n“Things that bring us moments of joy and comfort must not be carted about the place in ugly plastic bags!” Exclaims Madame Fushigi.\r\n\r\n✝The Composition: \r\n \r\nHand made curved top structured tote bag. Each of them made by me using hand picked fabrics to suit any fancy, predilection and penchant. \r\nPerfect for the carrying of books, magazines, shopping, spying equipment (Mrs Marple may well have liked one for herself).\r\n\r\n\"The Deep Blue\", is made using a cotton/linen cloth of high quality and lined with a rather raucous cotton featuring many coloured fans with gold lines throughout. The bag has been reinforced so it is structured and strong. The handles are made of cotton webbing that is soft on the hand yet durable and robust. \r\n\r\n✝The Size: \r\nThe bag (excluding the handles) measures about 36cm across by 28cm high.
