The soft colors and mixed blend of prints make this lap quilt one of my favorites.\r\n\r\nThe quilt is made up of 12 sampler blocks and was machine pieced and quilted.  It's bordered with a grey dot and bound with a cursive text print.  All fabrics and threads are 100% cotton and the batting is Warm and White.  The back is pieced bands of coordinating prints in shades of grey and white.\r\n\r\nGentle cycle cold wash is recommended along with tumbling dry on low or line drying.

I added a big blue cross at the bottom to bring out the scattered bits of blue. It is machine pieced. The blue binding was attached by machine and finished by hand. The back is an adorable zoo print with a small band of blue on one side. It is machine quilted in gold with a wondering diagonal pattern. \r\n\r\nAll fabrics are 100% cotton. The batting is Warm & Natural. As with most handmade goods, I would recommend a gentlest cycle with line drying when possible, but can be machine dried on low.

The central panel is made up of 4 oversized blocks that are based on a traditional block found in the book Encyclopedia of Quilt Patterns, listed as #713 Basket of Chips.  Yellow, green, and orange became my colors of choice because my son's favorite potato chips are regular, sour cream and onion, and cheddar and sour cream.  The borders are a study in precision piecing of triangles.  \r\n\r\nThis quilt is machine pieced and machine quilted with 100% cotton thread.  The quilting runs in diagonal lines across the quilt.  It's bound with a green dot print.  The back is pieced with a mix of coordinating colors and prints.\r\n\r\nAll fabrics are 100% cotton.  The batting is Warm and White.  I recommend the gentlest cycle for washing and line drying when possible.  A quilt of this size tends to roll into a ball in the dryer, so it will take forever to dry.  I find I have the best luck with line drying most of the way and finishing with a low temp tumble to fluff the quilt.  I have washed and dried this quilt once already.
