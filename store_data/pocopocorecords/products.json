Some of these pictures make up the artwork for the EP. \r\n\r\nNever settled with just one version of a song, Adam & Paula like to experiment with alternatives and re-imagine their own work.

It was this idea that led to the intimate acoustic affair which is The Daydream Clubs debut release. Of the title record they say, \"Overgrown is about losing sight of where you want to be but continuing on blindly regardless.\"\r\n\r\n“Overgrown is a simply delightful collection of thoughtful songs, arranged in modest and understated ways that allow you to touch their lyrical core.” \r\n<strong>Consequence of Sound 4/5 ✶✶✶✶ </strong>\r\n\r\n\"The Daydream Club take their own passion and create something so evocative that it has its own soul and that’s what I love about them as a band and about the album.\" \r\n<strong>Hive Magazine 4/5 ✶✶✶✶ </strong>\r\n\r\n“It’s absolutely extraordinary.” <strong> BBC </strong>\r\n\r\nThis 13 track album touches upon various musical genres. “The Affair” is a dark, heart-wrenching tale supported by a dramatic composition that is reminiscent of old movie scores, with elements of both classical and jazz piano. “Square”, with its simplistic lyrics, is more accessible and has an underlying pop sensibility. Folk influences are obvious in songs like “Be With You Always”, “The Record Shop” and “In The Arms of Another Day”. Warm vocal harmonies in “Alarms Ring Out” reflect on the impact of the recession. The rhythmically driven track “On The Move” showcases the percussive guitar skills of Adam Pickering, combined with the crystal vocals of Paula Walker.\r\n\r\nTRACK LISTING:\r\n1. On The Move\r\n2.

It features previously unreleased, cinematic instrumental B-Side <strong>The Musician</strong>. The specially designed vinyl sleeve features photographs of 40 independent UK record shops, plus each individual vinyl will be numbered. \r\n\r\n<b>With your vinyl you will also receive the digital mp3 downloads of the single (A + B Sides)</b>\r\n\r\n<strong>The Record Shop</strong> was written as a tribute to the golden years of vinyl and independent record stores. It reflects on the current state of the industry, noting the demise in value of the physical product in favour of digital technologies. This is highlighted in the song through the story of a fragile old man and his shop, with all of its wonderful quirks that his loyal customers have grown to love. “We didn’t know about Record Store Day when we wrote the track” explains Adam, “but the lyrics really seem to resonate with people, who like us, enjoy trawling through record shops and discovering musical gems.”\r\n\r\n\"WOW!... Really astonishing musicianship... they met at LIPA, so no wonder they're so bloomin' good.\" <strong>BBC 6 Music, Tom Robinson</strong>\r\n\r\n\"I listen to that song and want to visit my nearest independent record store straight away.\" <strong>Hive Magazine</strong>\r\n\r\n\"Gosh, their music is exquisite...
