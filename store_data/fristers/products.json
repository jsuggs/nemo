The little sterling book page tells us we have a new story to write for our lives, one of hope, restoration and courage. The white beads tell of purity and a new start. The pearl reminds us that we are all unique and the hand-engraved “loved”, etched forever in metal reminds us to live knowing that we are deeply loved. And GOD's love provides us with friends and sisters to walk along side us, forever.\r\n\r\nAbout the Artist\r\n\r\nStudio SUZAN is passionate about making jewelry that inspires women and those who they talk to on a daily basis. “There is something powerful about words etched in metal, that we can look at and touch as reminders to keep our faith as the center of how we define ourselves. I also love the way metal gets soft with years of wear and touch.”  Learn more about the artist at www.studiosuzan.com.\r\n\r\n*Shipping Information*\r\nIf you would rather pick up your bracelet at one of our Fristers locations during Fristers hours, select a country other than US and shipping will show as zero.
