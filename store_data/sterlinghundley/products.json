Poole resembled an enormous beached humpback whale. Visually, the bottom of the ship looked like the underbelly of one of the great mammals. Likewise, it posed the same problem- How to return it to the sea? Realizing that only an unusually high tide would offer any hope of reclaiming the ship, the Benjamin F. Poole was stranded on the shores of Virginia Beach. \r\n\r\nWith the honeymoon of Captain Hjalmar Charlton and his bride, in the Poole's refined captain's quarters, the shipwrecked Benjamin F. Poole evolved from a coal carrying sea vessel into a hotel with ocean front views. Over the course of the summer, the newlyweds hosted curious beach visitors aboard the stranded vessel. In September of 1890, the tide came calling for the Poole. After being overhauled, the Benjamin F. Poole spent many more years on the open seas. \r\n\r\nPlease allow 2-3 weeks for shipping.\r\n*international shipping will be billed at 30.00 and will be refunded to the exact shipping amount.","options":[{"id":748613,"name":"signed poster","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1066836/-/shipwreck_detail1_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1066836/-/shipwreck_detail1_.jpg","width":549,"height":576},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55276707/-/shipwreck.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55276707/-/shipwreck.jpg","width":480,"height":553}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":155985,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":10950324,"name":"THE SPOILS BLOG from Sterling Clinton Hundley: http://goo.gl/0Xbt3","permalink":"inside-the-artist-s-studio-blog","position":10,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/inside-the-artist-s-studio-blog","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-04T18:31:23.000Z","description":"Register and pay here: http://goo.gl/0Xbt3\r\n\r\nAs a painter, educator, writer and former illustrator, I've got things to say.
