Bursting out of a creative community in Copenhagen, they played their first show in a dark living room in a house belonging to their friends, The Woken Trees.\r\n\r\nThe sound descends from early 60's psychedelia but touches on different genres. The duo always appear live with more musicians on stage and their shows have a great element of improvisation. The atmosphere is raw, yet full of colors as heavy drones and rumbling fuzz-guitars clash with catchy, light melodies, and playful psychedelic guitar-bling all topped with a distinctive Danish accent. \r\n\r\nHello I Know The Blow You Grow Is Magic - Ltd 300 numbered copies. \r\n10\" vinyl.

The four-piece, which channels hazy energy from the very roots of rock n roll, has released an EP, which features four songs that are haunting and beautiful, slow and fast, loud and hushed but still always retain that certain excitement of electric garage rock. Some have said that the band sounds a bit like modern neo-psychedelic classics such as Brian Jonestown Massacre, Black Angels or BRMC. In the last couple of years the band has played a plethora of diverse live shows, during which they have managed to create their own, distorted signature sound.\r\n\r\nBlack Lizard 10\".
