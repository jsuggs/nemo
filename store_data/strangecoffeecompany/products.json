With French press brewing, you have control over steeping time, but heat loss and sediment in the cup can be a problem. Brewing with a paper filter is easy and convenient; the problem is lack of control over steeping time (i.e. the coffee begins to drain immediately). By adding a stopper to the filtercone, the Clever Coffee Dripper combines control over steeping time with a sediment-free cup. We call this a \"full immersion brewing\" method. Drippers come with a lid and have a \"Clever Coffee Dripper\" logo.","options":[{"id":15173483,"name":"Default","price":18.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/45417891/-/clever.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/45417891/-/clever.jpg","width":1000,"height":984}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2176322,"name":"Coffee Gear","permalink":"coffee-gear","url":"/category/coffee-gear"}]},{"id":4218103,"name":"Chemex Coffee Brewers","permalink":"el-savador-siberia-estate-bourbon","position":23,"price":41.0,"default_price":41.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/el-savador-siberia-estate-bourbon","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-08-07T22:07:09.000Z","description":"Pick a size and style. 6, 8, 10 cup brewers (30, 40, 50 ounces) in either the original design with a polished wood collar, or the glass handle design. 10 chemex FSU-100 unbleached filters squares included to get you started brewing.\r\n\r\nGlass handle 8 and 10 cup and wood collar 8 cup available now, others are back ordered and I will add them as they come in.","options":[{"id":15195235,"name":"Glass Handle 8 Cup","price":41.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15195237,"name":"Wood Collar 8 cup","price":41.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15195239,"name":"Glass Handle 10 Cup","price":43.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129391452/-/product_classic_8cup_01_large.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129391452/-/product_classic_8cup_01_large.jpg","width":450,"height":450},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129391455/-/product_glass_handle_10cup_01_large.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129391455/-/product_glass_handle_10cup_01_large.jpg","width":450,"height":450}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2176322,"name":"Coffee Gear","permalink":"coffee-gear","url":"/category/coffee-gear"}]},{"id":4152906,"name":"Coffee Brewing Filters","permalink":"costa-rica-finca-genesis","position":24,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/costa-rica-finca-genesis","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-07-26T15:48:24.000Z","description":"Filtropa #2 100 count box bleached\r\n\r\nFSU-100: 100 prefolded natural filter squares.
