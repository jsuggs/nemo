Our rail is made up of three extrusions offset at 120º that bolt together to create a full tri-rail system.\r\n\r\nAdjustable Shades and Legs:\r\nEach Individual shade can easily be adjusted to countless configurations. The legs can also be adjusted to increase or decrease the height of the overall lamp.  The picatinny mounts are adjusted using the included allen wrench to lock/unlock the legs and shades into place.\r\n\r\nStealth On/Off Switch:\r\nInspired by military and stealth operations. The on/off switch has been discreetly integrated into the lamp. \r\n\r\nHigh Quality Materials:\r\nThe Tri-rail itself is made out of aircraft grade extruded aluminum.   The Arms, legs and Shades are are all aluminum as well.  Other components include high quality ABS plastic, cloth woven electrical cord, and various anodized bolts.\r\n\r\nIncluded in Box:\r\nAndromeda Tactical Lamp (Black Hardware)\r\nEach lamp will come with a 40 watt nostalgic bulb.
