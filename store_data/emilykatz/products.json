If you want to bring beads with LARGE holes, or other items to tie into the plant hanger, I can instruct you on that process as well!\r\n\r\nI also suggest you bring the pot that will go in the hanger to make it easier to fit the right plant in it. It should NOT have a hole in the bottom, or if it does, please also have a saucer to catch water. \r\n\r\nLight snacks and beverages will be provided. \r\n\r\nI learned how to make these beautiful hangers from my mother who sold them at a salon when she was a teenager so she could buy her first guitar. \r\n\r\nPerfect as a gift or for yourself. \r\n\r\nLimited to 14 participants\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":47359467,"name":"Default","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127987167/-/macrame_workshop_image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127987167/-/macrame_workshop_image.jpg","width":512,"height":687},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126998757/-/Screen_shot_2013-11-04_at_2.38.24_PM.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126998757/-/Screen_shot_2013-11-04_at_2.38.24_PM.png","width":548,"height":450}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6584268,"name":"WORKSHOPS","permalink":"workshops","url":"/category/workshops"}]},{"id":10673809,"name":"It Was All a Dream Gown","permalink":"it-was-all-a-dream-gown","position":2,"price":3200.0,"default_price":3200.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/it-was-all-a-dream-gown","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-20T23:02:37.000Z","description":"Imagine walking down the red carpet in this exquisitely detailed one of a kind gown. \r\n\r\nThe perfect poppy colored silk crepe de chine with handmade freehand embroidered lace and real rubies sewn into the collar. \r\n\r\nSnap wrap dress style closure. \r\n\r\nsheer lace details on the side of the dress and on the leg opening. \r\n\r\n///Size Small///\r\n\r\nAvailable for custom order.
