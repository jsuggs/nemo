Most people think of Mimosa as a brunch drink made with orange juice and champagne.  We tried to combine both scents in the softly floral and orange scented soap.  This is a good example of why we love to use essential oils.  Fragrance oils are a little heavier and linger much longer as well as being made up of synthetic ingredients that could cause allergic reactions.  Essential oils are volatile...meaning they don't last a long time...and usually don't cause adverse reactions like headaches, for instance.  We are able to use these pure plant oils in aromatheraputic combinations that can do good things like lift our spirits, soothe our jangled nerves or even help us to have a great night's sleep.  Mimosa is a combination of all of these in a moisturizing formula that leaves you and your skin feeling soft and soothed.\r\nWe used a super deluxe combination of organic oils and butters and then added a little mild cosmetic clay to get you super clean and your skin toned and refined.\r\nMimosa....an homage to happy childhood memories, slow southern nights and celebratory brunches.

Not only is this an incredibly beautiful soap, it is an amazing bar all around.  We tried a new formula that is palm free and, wow!  The lather and hardness is just incredible.  This means your beautiful soap will last a really long time and you will get amazing lather until the last little sliver.  Not only do we use an impressive list of oils in our formula (like evening primrose, macadamia nut, rice bran...) but we also added two types of mild cosmetic clays to supply minerals and tone and refine the skin.  We usually talk about our more exotic oils (see above) and don't really mention our favorite workhorse...our organic, cold pressed olive oil.  A mainstay of every formula, this rich, green, fragrant oil is just full of everything your skin loves to keep it smooth, moist and happy.  \r\nWe have had lots of requests for a rose scented soap.  We have also had lots of requests for a lavender scented soap.  We found that an all rose scent is a little heavy for our tastes and an all lavender, as well as being a little plain, is somewhat astringent smelling.  We can't give the whole formula away, but we have combined Bulgarian rose absolute (expensive, yes, but worth it!) with lavender essential oil along with a couple of other essential oils to produce this softly rose scented blend that is not too sweet and heaven to use.  This is definitely a new take on rose!\r\nTopping this beauty off is a combination of organic tea roses and cosmetic safe iridescent glitter.  A girl just NEEDS a little glitter sometimes!!\r\n\r\nIngredients:  Organic Olive Oil, Organic Coconut Oil, Distilled Water, Sodium Hydroxide, Rice Bran Oil, Organic Shea Butter, Essential Oils, Evening Primrose Oil, Macadamia Nut Oil, Organic Castor Oil, Rose Clay, White Kaolin Clay, Ultramarine Oxides, Mica, Organic Rose Buds.","options":[{"id":41670063,"name":"Default","price":8.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.7,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.15,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123009846/-/IMG_0949_(800x550).jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123009846/-/IMG_0949_(800x550).jpg","width":800,"height":550},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123010155/-/dpi_organic_cert_(1024x747)_(640x467).jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123010155/-/dpi_organic_cert_(1024x747)_(640x467).jpg","width":640,"height":467}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3503611,"name":"Artisanal Soaps","permalink":"artisanal-soaps","url":"/category/artisanal-soaps"}]},{"id":13054827,"name":"Red Sky Soap with Tomatoes, Carrots and Buttermilk","permalink":"red-sky-soap-with-tomatoes-carrots-and-buttermilk","position":8,"price":8.5,"default_price":8.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/red-sky-soap-with-tomatoes-carrots-and-buttermilk","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-19T19:44:23.000Z","description":"Formulated to help with oily, troubled skin, Red Sky is packed with power.

Your skin is gently exfoliated,cleansed and neutralized with this refreshing, nourishing soap.  The acids in tomatoes make them especially effective when used on oily, troubled skin but we have noticed that most skin types love this soap.  \r\nWe also have included Brazilian red clay in this formula to tone, add minerals and refine pore size.  The beautiful color is completely from the tomatoes, carrots and clay and nothing else!  There is also a touch of activated bamboo charcoal for detoxifying the skin. Jojoba and Aloe oils make this spicy bar soothing and non-drying without being oily.\r\nYou will be able to detect a faint aroma from all the tomatoes and we complemented this with an herbaceous essential oil blend that will have you feeling like you just walked through a late summer garden.  \r\n\r\nIngredients:  Organic Olive Oil, Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Palm Oil, Organic Tomato Puree, Sodium Hydroxide, Organic Carrot Puree, Buttermilk Powder, Organic Castor Oil, Organic Jojoba Oil, Essential Oils, Organic Aloe Oil, Beeswax, Tomato Powder, Red Brazilian Clay, Activated Bamboo Charcoal, Organic Nigella Seeds.","options":[{"id":41665893,"name":"Default","price":8.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.7,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.15,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123008031/-/IMG_0938_(800x533).jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123008031/-/IMG_0938_(800x533).jpg","width":800,"height":533},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123008040/-/IMG_0936_(800x533).jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123008040/-/IMG_0936_(800x533).jpg","width":800,"height":533},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123008082/-/dpi_organic_cert_(1024x747)_(640x467).jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123008082/-/dpi_organic_cert_(1024x747)_(640x467).jpg","width":640,"height":467}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3503611,"name":"Artisanal Soaps","permalink":"artisanal-soaps","url":"/category/artisanal-soaps"}]},{"id":9864403,"name":"Soak!

Soak! is the result of my quest to satisfy both skin and muscles and, I have to say, I am truly addicted to it!\r\n\r\nWe are learning that soaking in a mineral rich bath with bicarbonate of soda actually provides us with hard to obtain minerals that we need to stay healthy and even stress free.  We also know that these salts are a wonderful way to detox our bodies and rid them of excess water.  We don't need much but this can make a huge difference in how we feel.\r\n\r\nSoak! can also be used as a scrub but not on the face.  Salt is an agressive scrub so use gently on wet skin.  Rinse off and pat dry.\r\n\r\nWe have taken lots of butters, Dead Sea Salts, Epsom Salts,  nutritious oils, Goat's Milk, Buttermilk and emulsifying oils like fractionated Coconut oil and added wonderfully aromatheraputic essential oil blends to create a truly unique product!  Just stir the contents (it tends to settle and slightly separate) and add one or two scoops to a warm bath.  The mixture dissolves almost imediately and the water will have a milky cast.

This might be just the solution!  No need to make a glamorous looking bar.  This soap may not look like gold but when you use it for a week you may believe it is just as valuable.  The Dead Sea is invaluable for producing natural products that are loaded with healing minerals.  In addition, we have included Moor Mud.  Moor Mud is an ancient soup of nutrients and phytonutrients deposited there centuries ago by decaying plant matter.  It is healing, can help muscle aches and reduce joint swelling, is a natural exfoliator and hydrates.  In fact, there is so much it can do that we encourage you to look it up.\r\n\r\nWe topped this soap with a layer of Dead Sea Salt as well as including some in the soap itself.  This salt is actually made up of minerals and very little salt.  This is so good for eczema and psoriasis, but if you have broken the salts in this soap might sting and be a little harsh.\r\n\r\nBecause of the high mineral content it might be harder to get a lather in the beginning.  Our testers have found that after one or two uses it lathers great.  We like how one tester has incorporated it into her shower routine...she loves our Refresh soap and has very sentitive skin so she uses Mineral Mud three times a week alternating with Refresh.  Others use it everytime they wash.  Up to you...but you will love what it does for your skin.\r\n\r\nThe scent....a light mint with citrus.

Always take care when using a product containing oils in the shower or bath…oils can get slippery when wet!<br/>\r\nAlways check the ingredients to make sure you are not allergic.<br/>\r\nMade with organic and responsibly harvested oils and herbs.\r\nNet wt. 4 oz<br/>\r\n","options":[{"id":22135093,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.7,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.15,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68695707/-/stardustscrub.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68695707/-/stardustscrub.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3503613,"name":"Bath/Scrubs","permalink":"bath-scrubs","url":"/category/bath-scrubs"}]},{"id":6808499,"name":"Handmade Eastern Aromatic Cedar Soap Deck","permalink":"handmade-eastern-aromatic-cedar-soap-deck","position":42,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/handmade-eastern-aromatic-cedar-soap-deck","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-27T19:15:03.000Z","description":"To really take the best care of your handmade soaps and make them last a lot longer, you need the best method of keeping your bar dry between uses.  We have found that our unfinished Eastern Cedar Soap Decks do a superior job at this.  We make these ourselves so that they are large enough to comfortably hold our large bars of soap.  One of the most durable weather resistant woods there is, this aromatic soap deck can be put on a shelf in your shower and it doesn’t need a dish under it. (A dish under the deck is a little neater by the tub or sink though.) The grooves in the top and bottom and the raw, unfinished wood make quick work of draining your soap.\r\n\r\nYou will be tempted to slip this deck into your sweater drawer or coat closet to discourage moths but don’t do that.  Just ask us and, if we have them,  we will send you a couple of small chunks of scrap in with your order to use for keeping your woolens insect free.
