At one time, Shyheim was the youngest Wu-Tang affiliate and was nicknamed The Rugged Child. Now he's all grown up and so his is style. Disrespectfully Speaking is Shyheim's first official release in nearly five years and on it he brings the emotion, lyrical skill, and gritty East Coast sound he's been known for since he was 14. The only difference is now he's lived a lot more of life and his subject matter is a lot more diverse because of that. With Disrespectfully Speaking, Shyheim shows why people have been talking about his skills for over half his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n01: Intro\r\n[Performed by Shyheim]\r\n[Produced by ]\r\n\r\n02: Staten Island\r\n[Performed by Shyheim]\r\n[Produced by ]\r\n\r\n03: Evil Bitches\r\n[Performed by Shyheim]\r\n[Produced by *BP for 11701 Productions]\r\n\r\n04: Look At Me\r\n[Performed by Shyheim]\r\n[Produced by ]\r\n\r\n05: Love Letters\r\n[Performed by Shyheim, and *Mya]\r\n[Produced by ]\r\n\r\n06: Dust Juice \r\n[Performed by Shyheim, and *Castro]\r\n[Produced by ]\r\n\r\n07: Wake Up\r\n[Performed by Shyheim]\r\n[Produced by ]\r\n\r\n08: Safe\r\n[Performed by Shyheim, and L.E.O.]\r\n[Produced by ]\r\n\r\n09: Just Be U\r\n[Performed by Shyheim]\r\n[Produced by *BP for 11701 Productions]\r\n\r\n10: Pettle 2 the Metal\r\n[Performed by Shyheim]\r\n[Produced by ]\r\n\r\n11: Pain\r\n[Performed by Shyheim]\r\n[Produced by *Shroom]\r\n\r\n12: Bond\r\n[Performed by Shyheim]\r\n[Produced by ]\r\n\r\n13: Yea Yea\r\n[Performed by Shyheim]\r\n[Produced by ]\r\n\r\n14: Flowers In A Vast\r\n[Performed by Shyheim]\r\n[Produced by ]\r\n\r\n15: The Bottom Pt. 2\r\n[Performed by Shyheim]\r\n[Produced by ]\r\n\r\n16: Bank Money\r\n[Performed by Shyheim]\r\n[Produced by ]\r\n","options":[{"id":10455653,"name":"Disrespectfully Speaking ","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29500329/-/disrespectfully_speaking_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29500329/-/disrespectfully_speaking_.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1748277,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":3042463,"name":"The Greatest Story Never Told ","permalink":"the-greatest-story-never-told","position":2,"price":8.99,"default_price":8.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-greatest-story-never-told","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-12-18T04:34:06.000Z","description":"\r\nThe Greatest Story Never Told (album)\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Greatest Story Never Told\" (featuring Jasmine Rae)\r\n\"160.15\"\r\n\"I'm Back, It's Great\" (featuring Lex[disambiguation needed])\r\n\"The Bottom\"\r\n\"I Am Good, Play Your Part\" (featuring The Embassy[disambiguation needed])\r\n\"Carry On\"\r\n\"His.Story\"\r\n\"Pardon the Noise\"\r\n\"Ya Not No Killa\" (featuring Bars-N-Hooks, and V12)\r\n\"New Producers\" (featuring Yumi)\r\n\"The Surah\" (featuring Gutta)\r\n\"True Story\" (featuring King Just)\r\n\"After All These Years\"\r\n\"No Cup\"\r\n\"Easy Street\" (featuring La the Darkman)\r\n\"Annamette\" (featuring House Gang[disambiguation needed])\r\n","options":[{"id":10456205,"name":"The Greatest Story Never Told (album)","price":8.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29502521/-/Shyheim_-_The_Greatest_Story_Never_Told.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29502521/-/Shyheim_-_The_Greatest_Story_Never_Told.jpg","width":320,"height":320}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1748277,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":3042273,"name":"MANCHILD  - SHYHEIM","permalink":"manchild-shyheim","position":3,"price":8.99,"default_price":8.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/manchild-shyheim","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-12-18T03:19:09.000Z","description":"Shyheim the youngest member of the Wu-tang family has once again hit us wit a dope cd.
