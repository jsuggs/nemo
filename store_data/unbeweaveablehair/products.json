After a wash and air dry, straight virgin hair tends to have a slight wave. This can be fixed with a use of a straightener. Curly/wavy virgin hair seems to be more curlier and wavier when air dried. If blow drying is a must, use a diffuser on a low heat setting to set curls/waves. DO NOT SCRUNCH CURLY OR WAVY HAIR. Scrunching creates frizz. Brazilian hair is also more unlikely to frizz in humid conditions unlike Indian. \r\n\r\nGrade: 5AAAAA\r\nLengths: 12\"-26\"\r\nStyle: Straight\r\nType: Brazilian\r\n# of Bundles in Package: 3 bundles (10.5-12oz of hair)\r\nColor: Black\r\nLife Expectancy: At least 1 year if properly taken care of\r\n\r\n*12\"-16\" can probably get away with 2 bundles for a FULL sew in. 3 bundles are recommended. Better to have too much hair than not enough. Plus whatever you don't use, can be used in the next install/touch ups. \r\n\r\n**Hair can be colored but is not recommended because it may dry out your hair.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":45187170,"name":"3x 12\"","price":138.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":45187173,"name":"3x 14\"","price":151.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45187176,"name":"3x 16\"","price":168.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45187179,"name":"3x 18\"","price":182.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45187182,"name":"3x 20\"","price":186.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45187185,"name":"3x 22\"","price":199.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45187188,"name":"3x 24\"","price":203.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45187191,"name":"3x 26\"","price":236.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45187194,"name":"12\" 14\" 16\"","price":152.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45187197,"name":"14\" 16\" 18\"","price":167.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45187200,"name":"16\" 18\" 20\"","price":182.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45187203,"name":"18\" 20\" 22\"","price":196.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45187206,"name":"20\" 22\" 24\"","price":209.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45187209,"name":"22\" 24\" 26\"","price":223.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45187212,"name":"24\" 26\" 28\"","price":236.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":6.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125412354/-/1.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125412354/-/1.jpeg","width":1440,"height":1440}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6266298,"name":"Brazilian","permalink":"brazilian","url":"/category/brazilian"},{"id":6266550,"name":"Bundle Packages","permalink":"bundle-packages","url":"/category/bundle-packages"}]}]
