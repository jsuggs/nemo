Not because it's a great record (it's not). The Past In Present is riddled with imperfections and quirkiness throughout. There are truly great moments on this album, while others stumble and fall just short — the markings of a band that knew what they wanted to do, but wasn't quite there yet (they'll be there in early 2014, though, I assure you). Mostly, this record is special because it captures a snapshot of the early stages of a promising band's missteps and triumphs over the course of a heart-on-sleeve album. It's altogether endearing and youthful. It's You Blew It!.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original artwork was made for CD and frankly, was really, really pixelated even at that size. Realizing this wouldn't work for a 12\" LP, we enlisted the help of long-time goto art guy, Ben Sears. The result is an homage to the original with Ben's trademark touch. He's also done the rest of the album layout as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This item is for a copy of <i>The Past In Present</i> on vinyl and features an etched B-side and a digital download of the album.

The sounds are welcomingly familiar; inspired percussion amid a sea of imaginative guitars and impassioned vocals. However, the underlying unrest is more complex and touching than any previous Touche Amore release before it. Simply put, these are not simple \"love\" songs that dwell in the past, but complex \"life\" songs about living in the present. Throughout the entire album vocalist/lyricist Jeremy Bolm digs deeper in search of personal catharsis, allowing us to relate to his drive to be clearly heard, truly understood, and unapologetically remembered. \"Is Survived By\" not only shows growth in subject matter but musicianship for Touche Amore. The jangly guitar work of Clayton Stevens and Nick Steinhardt is on a new level here. Throughout the release they effortlessly entangle one another to construct beautiful yet unexpected melodies. While the explosive rhythm section of Tyler Kirby and Elliot Babin shines in the frenetic pace they keep. Achieving a stunning balance of hook laden listenability and emotion.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nWithout question, \"Is Survived By\" is another masterwork from Touche Amore. More importantly, it is a release that lives up to the promise of past releases while not repeating it. Not a departure, but a continuation down the remarkable road that they alone travel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This item is for a copy of <i>Is Survived By</i> on vinyl.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tracklist</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n01.

Ben Thompson & Lew Currie have been busy the past 18 months releasing their now sold out 7” ‘Feeling Better’, three splits and touring the UK up and down as well as mainland Europe.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n'Whatever' is Nai Harvest’s first full length release, featuring 10 tracks, moving towards a bigger sound and a change in tone. Still fast and fun like their previous material but with heavier guitar tones laced with reverb, some slower grungier phrases and overall more well-structured songs. This record is a lot less ‘fiddly’ and packs a lot more of a punch. Clearly influenced by 90’s acts like Cap ‘n Jazz and The Get Up Kids, but ‘Whatever’ has it’s own unmistakable ‘Nai Harvest sound’ that the band have carefully crafted over the last 2 years. Thick guitar lines, huge twiddly riffs, catchy vocals (more mellow and melodic than the bands older sound), courageous drum fills all held together by steady solid beats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This item is for a copy of <i>Whatever/i> on vinyl.</p>","options":[{"id":46610454,"name":"LP","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":12.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126452127/-/184422_10151164669051722_1085241735_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126452127/-/184422_10151164669051722_1085241735_n.jpg","width":960,"height":960}],"artists":[{"id":45014,"name":"Distro Artist","permalink":"distro-artist","url":"/artist/distro-artist"}],"categories":[{"id":980591,"name":"Distro","permalink":"distro","url":"/category/distro"},{"id":209292,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":14405172,"name":"Sainthood Reps - Monoculture LP","permalink":"sainthood-reps-monoculture-lp","position":11,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sainthood-reps-monoculture-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-25T13:18:19.000Z","description":"<h3>About</h3>\r\n<p>Formed in 2009, Sainthood Reps began as an instrumental post-rock act but quickly evolved into a different beast entirely—one that snarls, howls and kicks the shit out of your ears without remorse.

From the first organic stick clicks of opener \"Flowermouth (The Leech)\" musical chaos explodes in every direction imaginable. As their tangle of guitars and angular percussion violently lurches about, it's apparent that Code Orange Kids are unconcerned with following the predetermined path of any existing sub-genre (i.e. they are their own unpredictable animal). Code Orange Kids' dirges effortlessly become staccato bursts in \"Liars // Trudge\" and \"Nothing (The Rat), two songs with so many hairpin turns they are difficult to put into words. While adversely, songs like \"Colors (Into Nothing)\" and \"Calm // Breathe\" unfurl as beautifully layered musical expanses. As impressive as these dynamics are, it is Code Orange Kids' untamed heaviness and emotion in the title referenced songs \"Choices (Love is Love)\" and \"Bloom (Return to Dust)\" that will leave you floored. These two monstrous beasts smear the divisions between art-rock, punk, doom, and noise in a way never heard before. Without a doubt, \"Love is Love // Return to Dust\" is truly impressive, as much a work of art as it is an album. A shining example of the bright future that awaits the world of aggressive music. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRACK LISTING:<br/>\r\n01. Flowermouth (The Leech)<br/>\r\n02.

While traveling in the UK in 2011, they were invited to record at the legendary BBC Studios for \"The Punk Show\" with host Mike Davies. Being the music fanatics they are, Touche Amore excitedly accepted the offer. There they worked with acclaimed engineer Simon Askew (Pulp, PJ Harvey, Foo Fighters) during a half day of recording. With a trophy resume like that, you would think that Touche Amore would be presented here in a polished state, but the contrary is true.
