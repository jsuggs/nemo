Painting ‘still life’ is very quiet, just like the name. I represent objects, they don’t talk, they don’t move, they don’t change except with the light. I install them in front of me, building a little ‘set’, and then I paint them. The most recent paintings represent things I have constructed, so they look a bit different because people don’t know what the objects are and the paintings look less like ‘still life’ paintings even though they are.\" Nathalie Du Pasquier\r\n\r\nNathalie Du Pasquier was born in Bordeaux (France) in 1957, she lives in Milan (Italy) since 1979. Until 1986 she worked as a designer and is a founding member of Memphis. She designed numerous ‘Decorated Surfaces’: Textiles, carpets, plastic laminates, and some furniture and objects. In 1987 painting became her main activity. \r\n\r\n24 Pages, 24.5 x 24.5 cm, Color Offset, First Edition 2013\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nathaliedupasquier.com","options":[{"id":30640663,"name":"Default","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96217660/-/nathaliecover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96217660/-/nathaliecover.jpg","width":307,"height":307},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96217042/-/nathalie3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96217042/-/nathalie3.jpg","width":595,"height":425},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96217012/-/nathalie2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96217012/-/nathalie2.jpg","width":595,"height":425},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96217060/-/nathalie4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96217060/-/nathalie4.jpg","width":595,"height":425},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96217096/-/NathalieDuPasquer.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96217096/-/NathalieDuPasquer.jpg","width":595,"height":425}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1659482,"name":"Other books","permalink":"other-books","url":"/category/other-books"}]},{"id":6380321,"name":"Maija Luutonen: Works","permalink":"maija-luutonen-works","position":14,"price":7.5,"default_price":7.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/maija-luutonen-works","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-06T13:30:06.000Z","description":"The latest book in A5 series introduces new works by the talented Helsinki artist Maija Luutonen.
