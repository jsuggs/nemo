In practice it had been available from banks in bags for some weeks previously.\r\n\r\nThe decimal half penny, worth 1.2 pre-decimal pence, enabled the prices of some low-value items to be more accurately translated to the new decimal currency. It also allowed the pre-decimal sixpence to remain in circulation (with a value of 2½ new pence) alongside the new decimal coinage. In the same vein, a decimal quarter-penny coin (to be struck in aluminium) was also proposed (which would have allowed the pre-decimal threepence to continue to circulate with a value of 1.25 new pence), but ended up never being produced.[1]\r\n\r\nThe half penny coin was minted in bronze. It was the smallest decimal coin by both size and value, weighing 1.78 grams and measuring 17.14 millimetres in diameter.\r\n\r\nwood info : \r\n\r\nbloodwood\r\nColor/Appearance: Heartwood is a bright, vivid red. Color can darken to a darker brownish red over time with exposure to light. Applying a thick protective finish, and keeping the wood out of direct sunlight can help slow this color shift. Well defined sapwood is a pale yellowish color, though given the typically large trunk diameters, it’s seldom seen or included in imported lumber.\r\n\r\nGrain/Texture: Grain is usually straight or slightly interlocked.
