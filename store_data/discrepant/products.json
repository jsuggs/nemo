Through the use of augmented field recordings, Papillon uses the ‘exotic’ jungle as the starting point to develop a dense and evocative sound where ethnic recordings, impromptu synth jams, modular synthesis and foley art effects come together to create a quasi-mystical crackpot mix of esoteric visions, near death experiences, shamanism, fever deliriums and lucid dreaming.\r\n\r\nThe compositions were constructed from raw and digitally treated analogue modulators by Cédric Stevens, edited acoustic recordings by Laurent Jeanneau aka Kink Gong, lo-fi synthesizers by Gonçalo F Cardoso as well as guest drums by David Naan.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\nA1. Un Radeau Dans Une Tombe\r\nA2. La Cavale Des Chinois\r\nB1. Petite Viande\r\nB2. Le Chemin De La Pourriturre\r\n\r\nAll tracks were composed and edited by Gonçalo F Cardoso in London 2013.\r\nArtwork by Thomas Wood.\r\nSpecial vinyl pressing to 300 copies\r\nMastered and Cut at Dubplate @ Mastering by Christoph Grote-Beverborg\r\n\r\nPress:\r\n\r\n\"A strangely compelling adventure into aural experimentation.\" Norman records","options":[{"id":43260366,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124147125/-/Papillon_Cover_CREP09_Discrepant.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124147125/-/Papillon_Cover_CREP09_Discrepant.jpg","width":1400,"height":1400},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124147062/-/label.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124147062/-/label.jpg","width":886,"height":880}],"artists":[{"id":232497,"name":"Papillon","permalink":"papillon","url":"/artist/papillon"}],"categories":[{"id":4681329,"name":"LP Vinyl","permalink":"lp-vinyl","url":"/category/lp-vinyl"}]},{"id":14843796,"name":"Small Path Documentary (DVD SF082)","permalink":"small-paths-documentary-dvd-sf082","position":2,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/small-paths-documentary-dvd-sf082","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-14T14:21:50.000Z","description":"56 minutes, 16:9 NTSC DVD all regions, English with Mandarin subtitles.\r\n\r\n''Small Path Music was shot on location in Southeast Asia in 2010 with Laurent Jeanneau on his relentless quest to capture audio recordings of vanishing indigenous music from ethnic groups of this vast region. The documentary (shot over a period of 8 months) takes us traveling with Laurent in the field through remote northern Laos and Yunnan Province of Southwest China and invites us into the world of the folk artists he explores. \r\n\r\nFrom shamanic rituals to love songs, historical epics to lamentations, his microphones document what he discovers there. Laurent tells us of the state he finds these artists in today, how this music speaks to him, and we learn what drives the urgency of his work. As perhaps the most committed and accomplished procurer of rare and threatened music from this part of the world, Laurent recounts experiences from a decade of recording in Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and China and we gauge his perspective on the musical traditions of the area. We see how he relates to them and how his work has led his life in new directions. Along this journey he met his wife, Tanding and together they established a recording label (Kink Gong) to release their field recordings.

Since meeting in the mid 90's the duo started translating their musical ideas by making industrial music using a mixture of field recordings, broken synths, found sound and, what became a constant motif on their output, church pipe organs - Sergey's father was a church organist of 40 years giving the duo plenty of material to tamper with.\r\n\r\nIsolated from any western influence and attention, the duo released a handful of extremely limited K7s on a now defunct Russian label. The results were unique slabs of industrial music with strong nods to primitive techno, sound design and noise music. For lack of an audience as well as poor distribution the tapes were mostly handed out to friends and family until one reached the 'discrepant' radar a couple of years back.\r\nToday, Discrepant presents an exclusive EP of their first work in years, constructed around the sounds recorded on the ex-USSR Baltic port city of Ventspils, Latvia. During a recent visit in 2010 the duo were inspired by the decaying post-industrial charm of the city and decided to re-activate their 'musical' activities. \r\n\r\nPressed on 250 vinyl only editions packed in luscious printed outer & inners with photography by Sergey Gorsky.\r\nDistribution: Cargo UK, Forced Exposure\r\n\r\nPress says:\r\n''What a scintillating ride Олд Комм’s Ventspils is.

He quickly established himself as a pivotal figure in the Belgian underground, producing over a dozen 12’’ and EPs. \r\nIn 1997, driven by his growing interest in experimental music, he launched his side project: \"The Syncopated Elevators Legacy\" (S.E.L.). The project served as a vehicle for Cedric to explore a more ambitious sound, based around experimentation rather than repetitive beats. Across the next decade, several EPs and mini LPs were released on different labels, each one with its very own specific approach. From experiments in electric currents and serpent patching (Siamese Level EP) to his own take on ‘musique concrete’ (Still Between the Battle & the Sheet EP) S.E.L.’s sound never ceased to investigate the most improbable sound sources as compositional tools. \r\nDespite having little exposure outside his native Belgium, the S.E.L. records were enthusiastically received by a number of prestigious artists, namely Christian Fennesz and My Cat Is An Alien, as well as being played on rotation by the late John Peel.\r\nLeaving the techno sound completely behind, Cédric’s experimentations with S.E.L. soon pushed him to create other projects both solo and as a member of a live band (South Of No North). The S.E.L. project eventually faded away but its experiments remain the foundations of Cédric’s musical language, making this anthology a perfect introduction to his future work.\r\n\r\nThis anthology compiles some of Cédric’s best pieces released between 1997 & 2005 under the S.E.L. moniker.  Remastered by Rashad Becker at D&M and pressed on 185g vinyl it comes with previously unreleased material and with remixes from Fennesz, Leyland Kirby, My Cat Is An Alien, Burning Star Core, Sylvain Chauveau & Motion Sickness Of Time Travel.\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\nA1- The Siamese Level (Playground Emulation)\r\nA2- Trapezoid Bondage Fancy\r\nA3- The Siamese Level\r\nA4- Flatliner\r\nA5- The Siamese Level (Linear Enlightenment mix)\r\nA6- Vanda\r\nB1- Disguised Telescopes On Their Way To Planet Bottle\r\nB2- Saccharin, Mr Dowland!\r\nB3 Siam Electric Skyline\r\nC1- Between the Battle and the Sheet (Fennesz Remix)\r\nC2- Siam Electric Skyline (Sylvain Chaveau Remix)\r\nC3- The Siamese Level(Playground Emulator Remix)\r\nD1- Disguised Telescopes on Their Way To Planet Bottle ( Burning Star Core Remix)\r\nD2- The Siamese Level (Motion Sickness Of Time Travel Remix)\r\nD3- The Siamese Level (Leyland Kirby Remix)\r\n\r\nPRESS:\r\n\r\n''An excellent collection and a killer set of remixes’'' Boomkat\r\n\r\n''Instead of vintage throwback, S.E.L. provides bubbles of early 21st century electronic futurism, the kind that starts with a steaming, industrialized landscape vibe before panning up to a crystal clear, multi-colored skyline.'' - Keith Rankin, Experimedia\r\n\r\n''There’s also something very tangible and three-dimensional about Stevens’ sound creation. He displays a captivating understanding of the ways in which audio can appear to adopt an illusionary presence within physical space, conjuring not only mental imagery, but striking flashes of texture and taste.'' (ATTN: Magazine)\r\n\r\n''The remixes will serve as ample reason to snort this double-LP up for a lot of people, and that’s always a good situation for everyone, but I implore you to focus on Stevens’ originals. As well as the remixers do in their retellings of the Syncopated Elevators Legacy story, nothing’s going to surpass the definitive electronic artifact by folding over its sound a few times like arms of dough and adding tinsel and melted butter here and there. Go original, then give the hotter hands a chance once you’ve absorbed what SELhas to offer. It’s only fair.''

He spends his time recording ethnic minority music, mostly in Southeast Asia and releasing the results on his own CDr label, Kink Gong Recordings as well as occasionally contributing to Sublime Frequencies compilations. He also composes electronic music that includes and transforms those recordings. \r\nFor Xinjiang, Laurent based his soundscape around the recordings he made on a 2009 trip to the frontier region of Northern China, Xinjiang. Spreading from Mongolia to Afghanistan, it is the biggest Chinese province. From various locally made recordings, including Kazakh Dongbra jams, Uyghur Dotar riffs and various regional radio interferences, Laurent constructed a melting pot of ethnic related weirdness packed with mind blowing virtuoso recordings. \r\nSimple and beautiful, this music makes people fall into visionary reality.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\nA1. AT (horse) \r\nA2. KHOSA (sheep)\r\nB2. KIKZU ( Kazakh Hut )\r\n\r\nSpecial vinyl pressing to 300 copies mastered and cut at Dubplate @ Mastering by Rashad Becker.  All tracks were recorded on location in the ILI prefecture, Xinjiang province, China by Laurent Jeanneau.\r\n\r\nPRESS:\r\n\r\n''Beguiling, fragmented collages of exotic voices and instrumentation knitted together with filigree electro-acoustic processing. Always singular thanks to his precious, compelling palate of otherworldly source material.'' (Boomkat)\r\n\r\n''Keep coming back to this stunning record. Turning out to be one of my favs of the year so far. A most enjoyable listening experience.''
