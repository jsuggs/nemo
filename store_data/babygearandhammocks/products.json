The only lightweight, portable, robust, foldable multi function toilet on the market today.  .... Making inconvenience, convenient.\r\n\r\nAn absolute essential for the boot of any car containing children!!\r\n\r\nBoginaBag (Bog in a Bag) is a unique portable toilet that is extremely light weight, portable and very robust. It provides the owner with a solution to that age old question of needing to go and having nowhere to go! It folds out as a normal seat that can be used anywhere, but when nature calls you then remove the cover, insert one of our specially designed degradable bags, relax and relieve yourself.\r\n\r\nOnce you have finished, the magic crystals in the pad will absorb any liquid. You then remove the bag, tie the top and dispose of the bag in a bin. The bags completely cover the seat of the stool so there is no mess and it is completely hygienic and ready to be used again and again.\r\n\r\nRemember BoginaBag can also be used as a general purpose stool.\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n'Magic Crystals\" \r\n\r\nThe revolutionary super absorbent \"magic crystals\" hold liquid like no other substance!

Push the central section and the pad down into the hole\r\n\r\nStep3: After use wait 30 seconds for absorption of the liquid then remove, tie and dispose of bag.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho is BoginaBag for?\r\n\r\n\r\nMen\r\n Women\r\n Children\r\n Festival Goers\r\n Campers\r\n Ramblers\r\n Mountaineers\r\n Cyclists\r\n Bird Watchers\r\n Police\r\n\r\nEmergency Services\r\n The Armed Forces\r\n Disaster Site Victims\r\n Aid Workers\r\n Backpackers\r\n Gardeners\r\n Labourers\r\n Holiday Makers\r\n Anglers\r\n Long Distance Drivers\r\n Yachtsmen & Women\r\n Beach hut owners Allotment owners \r\n IBS suffers \r\n The elderly \r\n\r\n\r\nBoginaBag - the unique portable toilet that provides its owner with a solution to that age old question of needing to go and having nowhere to go!\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestions and answers\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do the pads work?          \r\n\r\nOur pads contain a granular powder which is contained inside the fibrous cellulose of the pad. When it absorbs water it swells into a gel which traps the liquid.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat impact is BoginaBag having on the environment?\r\n\r\nWe strive to do everything we can to minimise the impact we are having on the environment. Our bags are degradable and we have made them as simple as possible so we minimise wastage. BoginaBag is hygienic without the need for environmentally damaging chemicals.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow much liquid can the pad within the bag absorb?\r\n\r\nThe pad can absorb up to 700ml of urine.\r\n          \r\n\r\n\r\nCan you use BoginaBag for both toilet functions?\r\n\r\nOur leakproof bags are designed to catch and hold both liquid and solid waste.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat are the dimensions and weight of BoginaBag?\r\n\r\nWhen folded, BoginaBag is only 65cm in length with a diameter of 13cm.

The baby carrier is evenly distributed from the back of one knee to the back of the other, facilitating a healthy posture and avoiding pressure points.\r\n*  Amazonas baby carriers ensure that your baby's bottom is down and his legs are flexed and straddled, which is very important for healthy hip development.\r\n2)  Close physical contact with mummy or daddy meets your baby's fundamental need for security, and ultimately helps him become a self-confident and independent individual.\r\n3)  Amazonas baby carriers evenly distribute your baby's weight across the whole of your upper body.  This helps prevent back ache, even when you carry your baby for long periods.\r\n4)  Amazonas baby carriers are made of 100% cotton, so are breathable and pose no health risk whatsoever.\r\n5)  Detailed instructions with pictures are enclosed, so it's easy to learn how to tie your baby carrier.\r\n","options":[{"id":19996059,"name":"Default","price":59.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27341258/-/ringslinglowres.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27341258/-/ringslinglowres.jpg","width":696,"height":708},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27341270/-/ringsling_pocket.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27341270/-/ringsling_pocket.jpg","width":120,"height":180}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1677084,"name":"Baby slings and carriers","permalink":"baby-slings-and-carriers","url":"/category/baby-slings-and-carriers"},{"id":2025812,"name":"Sale items","permalink":"sale-items","url":"/category/sale-items"}]},{"id":2824531,"name":"AMAZONAS Molly all purpose waterproof blanket","permalink":"amazonas-molly-all-purpose-waterproof-blanket","position":43,"price":49.95,"default_price":49.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/amazonas-molly-all-purpose-waterproof-blanket","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-10-27T08:38:42.000Z","description":"The AMAZONAS ‘Molly’ blanket is a picnic blanket, baby blanket, outdoor blanket all in one – Molly does it all!  \r\n\r\nMolly is a real all-rounder among outdoor blankets.

All this combined is the ideal condition for achieving an intimate and favourable breastfeeding relationship between mother and child.\r\n\r\nWe use Elltex hammocks ourselves and after almost a year of being completely exposed to the harsh Queensland elements, they are still in perfect condition with NO mold spots, NO fading and NO signs of wear or tear.\r\n\r\nWe have a selection of suspension options available for this hanging chair:\r\n\r\n* Amazonas Powerhook\r\n\r\n* Amazonas Smartrope\r\n\r\n* Amazonas Jumbo / Liana set\r\n\r\n* Amazonas Jumbo / Swivel set\r\n\r\n* Amazonas Palmera rockstone stand\r\n\r\n* Amazonas Atlas stand\r\n\r\n* Amazonas Luna rockstone stand\r\n","options":[{"id":19996193,"name":"Default","price":89.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.5,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":52.75,"amount_with_others":40.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61563087/-/A331-10-F-01_320.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61563087/-/A331-10-F-01_320.jpg","width":320,"height":671},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61563117/-/A331-10-FP-04_320.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61563117/-/A331-10-FP-04_320.jpg","width":320,"height":747},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61563135/-/A331-10-OP-04_320.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61563135/-/A331-10-OP-04_320.jpg","width":320,"height":481},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61563147/-/havanna_MARINE1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61563147/-/havanna_MARINE1.jpg","width":320,"height":620},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61563183/-/elltex.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61563183/-/elltex.jpeg","width":671,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1677076,"name":"Hanging chairs","permalink":"hanging-chairs","url":"/category/hanging-chairs"},{"id":5069161,"name":"Weatherproof hammocks and chairs","permalink":"weatherproof-hammocks-and-chairs","url":"/category/weatherproof-hammocks-and-chairs"}]},{"id":5907573,"name":"AMAZONAS ‘Madera’ hammock stand - The 2nd tree!","permalink":"amazonas-madera-hammock-stand-the-2nd-tree","position":59,"price":29.95,"default_price":29.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/amazonas-madera-hammock-stand-the-2nd-tree","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-04-11T07:34:10.000Z","description":"Madera - The 2nd tree!\r\n\r\nThis ingenious product from AMAZONAS puts an end to the woes of having only 1 hanging point for your hammock and allows you to determine a position for the 2nd suspension point yourself.\r\n\r\nIn the garden, or when camping, it's easy to find ONE tree or ONE wall of a house - it's finding the second one thats the problem.

A happy, stress free, well rested baby - isn't that what we all want for our little ones?\r\n\r\nThe AMAZONAS Kangoo baby hammock cradle is suspended at one single point above the hammock.  \r\n\r\nKangoo is also a great option for taking on your travels because of the multiple suspension options. (see below).\r\n\r\nKangoo can be buttoned up so that the baby feels absolutely safe and snugly, making it very similar to the womb. It's the ideal place for baby to relax in as it is wrapped cuddly and softly without being hidden from view, whilst swaying gently to and fro.   \r\n\r\nOr, it can be left unbuttoned for curious babies who just like to sit and watch the world go by!  The Kangoo makes the little ones feel the same comforting floating state that they enjoyed in mums tummy for 9 months.\r\n\r\nThis hammock has a multitude of safety feature that make it one of the safest on the market. - There is a built in 5 point safety harness for the ultimate peace of mind - it is impossible for babies to roll over whilst properly secured in this hammock.  The hammock is a 'bag'' type design so the weight of the baby weighs it down - it doesn't have a firm stable bottom which means that baby cannot roll back and forth.  The mattress /blanket can go underneath the lying surface so the baby cannot get between mattress and hammock.  The Kangoo hammock also allows adequate airflow.  \r\n\r\nAll AMAZONAS products comply with the strictest of safety standards.  Copies of safety certificates and test reports are available on request.\r\n\r\nThe Kangoo simply clips onto your choice of suspension which means that it can quickly and easily be moved to another room, allowing baby to follow you round the house as required!\r\nSuspension options from the AMAZONAS range include:\r\n\r\n* Wooden 'Hippo' stand\r\n* Powerhook - a rotating ceiling hook\r\n* Jumbino ceiling hook and woopy spring\r\n* Door clamp\r\n\r\nSpecifications:\r\n\r\nAge range: birth to nine months\r\nMaximum weight: 15kg\r\nCradle measurements: 70cm x 40cm\r\nSpreader bar width: 40cm\r\nWeight of hammock: 1.15kg\r\nMaterial: 100% cotton\r\nMachine washable\r\n\r\nClick on the product video link to see more of this stunning hammock.","options":[{"id":9873805,"name":"AMAZONAS Kangoo hammock cradle","price":119.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":60.0,"amount_with_others":50.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":30.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/48243601/-/A287-09-F-02_P_1024.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/48243601/-/A287-09-F-02_P_1024.jpg","width":666,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/48243649/-/A287-11-FD-04_P_1024.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/48243649/-/A287-11-FD-04_P_1024.jpg","width":665,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/48243679/-/A287-11-IPG-07_800.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/48243679/-/A287-11-IPG-07_800.jpg","width":666,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/56913159/-/Kangoo_detail.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/56913159/-/Kangoo_detail.gif","width":180,"height":137}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1677075,"name":"Baby hammocks","permalink":"baby-hammocks","url":"/category/baby-hammocks"}]},{"id":2824459,"name":"AMAZONAS Kaya Natura baby hammock","permalink":"amazonas-kaya-natura-baby-hammock","position":76,"price":119.95,"default_price":119.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/amazonas-kaya-natura-baby-hammock","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-10-27T08:05:44.000Z","description":"The gorgeous Kaya Natura baby hammock from AMAZONAS allows you to always be close to your baby virtually anywhere inside your home or in the garden – and still have your hands free! \r\n\r\nThis beautiful hammock can be used as a daytime napping place / rocker, or simply for somewhere for baby to relax and watch whats going on around them.

Copies of safety certificates and test reports are available on request.\r\n\r\nThe Kaya Natura can be suspended in many ways - the AMAZONAS options are:\r\n* Wooden Leo stand\r\n* Wooden Hippo stand\r\n* Door Clamp\r\n* Powerhook (rotating ceiling hook)\r\n* Jumbino ceiling hook and woopy spring\r\n\r\nClick on the product video link to see more of this stunning hammock.\r\n","options":[{"id":9873965,"name":"AMAZONAS Kaya Natura baby hammock","price":119.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":61.0,"amount_with_others":61.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27340410/-/Kaya_Natura.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27340410/-/Kaya_Natura.jpg","width":640,"height":961},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27340426/-/Kaya_Natura2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27340426/-/Kaya_Natura2.jpg","width":640,"height":578},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27340434/-/Kaya_Natura_safety_harness.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27340434/-/Kaya_Natura_safety_harness.jpg","width":640,"height":426}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1677075,"name":"Baby hammocks","permalink":"baby-hammocks","url":"/category/baby-hammocks"}]},{"id":9902605,"name":"AMAZONAS Brasilia Apple double+ XL Brazilian hammock with spreader bars","permalink":"amazonas-brasilia-apple-double-xl-brazilian-hammock-with-spreader-bars","position":77,"price":129.95,"default_price":129.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/amazonas-brasilia-apple-double-xl-brazilian-hammock-with-spreader-bars","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-13T09:24:33.000Z","description":"The Extra large Brasilia hammock is one of the most popular in the entire range - AMAZONAS have managed to make the spreader bar hammocks as comfortable as the classic Brazilian hammock with no bar.\r\n\r\nThis is achieved by firstly using a special, amazingly soft and flexible thread in a high quality thickness (350 g/m²), and secondly by making the material significantly wider than the bar: 140 x 100 cm bar.

It is cuddly and safe, yet flexible enough to be set up anywhere.     \r\n\r\nThis beautiful hammock can be used as a a daytime napping place, a travel crib, or simply as somewhere for baby to relax and watch whats going on around them.  The gentle swaying motion of a hammock quickly settles and calms baby, thus making it a perfect solution for the little one, and a sanity saving solution for mum and dad!  As well as helping to develop your baby's sense of balance, hammocks are excellent for easing wind, flatulence, colic and general tension.\r\n\r\nThe result?  A happy, stress free, well rested baby - isn't that what we all want for our little ones?\r\n\r\nTwo in one:  The ‘Koala’ set includes a baby hammock and stand and allows babies to be close to their parents anywhere within the house, in the garden, or on the road.  The ‘Koala’ is lightweight and can be set up quickly and easily.  This way, active parents can relax anywhere while their babies are swinging comfortably and happily, being able to observe attentively and with interest in what is happening around them.  The hammock has a sewn in, adjustable  5 point safety harness, and a swing limiter which is particularly handy if there are other children, or pets around the home.\r\n\r\nOnce a child is born, it initially feels deprived of the protective mechanism and the feeling of security from the womb which is why rocking in the Koala baby hammock gently and quickly lulls your baby to a super-relaxed state, gives comfort and security, and promotes baby's sense of balance.  Further, the hammocks snug shape helps your baby to learn hand/foot co-ordination, and, by taking weight of baby's tummy, provides relief when s/he has trapped wind.  In order to optimally take advantage of this positive effect, it is not recommended to use any stiff / hard underlays in the hammock.\r\n\r\nGuaranteed mobility: The Koala baby hammock is suitable for indoor as well as outdoor use. The hammock cords can also be adjusted so that baby's head lies higher than it's legs, enabling them to be able to look out of the hammock. \r\n\r\n* Easily assembled without tools\r\n\r\n* Adjustable suspension cords\r\n\r\n* Space-saving fold away design\r\n\r\n* Sewn in safety harness for secure support\r\n\r\n* Lockable position, when necessary to prevent unsupervised rocking\r\n\r\n* Easy removal of the spreader bars for washing\r\n\r\n* 100% natural eco-tested cotton (machine washable)\r\n\r\nAll hammocks in the baby world range are tested to, and conform to, the strictest and highest of safety standards available - copies of safety certificates and test reports are available on request.\r\n\r\nThis hammock is really quick and easy to dismantle without the use of tools.  It folds up extremely compactly which makes it a perfect portable solution.\r\n\r\nIt carries the ‘eco tested’ logo which means that it has been tested for harmful substances and has been approved for use next to a babies delicate soft skin.\r\n\r\nSpecifications:\r\n\r\nHammock measurents:                 110cm x 58cm\r\n\r\nStand dimensions:                         161cm x 45cm x 55cm\r\n\r\nUnit weight:                                   3.4kg\r\n\r\nLoad capacity:                               15kg\r\n\r\nAge range:                                     0-9 months (depending on activity level of baby)\r\n\r\nTo make the Koala hammock an even cosier spot for your little one, we recommend the use of the AMAZONAS Sunny blanket liner.\r\n\r\nClick on the product video link to see more of this stunning set.","options":[{"id":9873585,"name":"AMAZONAS Koala baby hammock","price":129.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":100.0,"amount_with_others":100.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":62.0,"amount_with_others":50.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27339418/-/Koalalowres.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27339418/-/Koalalowres.jpg","width":945,"height":957},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54254377/-/A010-11-FP-03_800.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54254377/-/A010-11-FP-03_800.jpg","width":800,"height":804},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27339194/-/Koala.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27339194/-/Koala.jpg","width":640,"height":303},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/56836151/-/Koala_and_Sunny_Cacao.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/56836151/-/Koala_and_Sunny_Cacao.jpg","width":639,"height":354},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/56836263/-/A010-11-IP-03_800.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/56836263/-/A010-11-IP-03_800.jpg","width":800,"height":533}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1677075,"name":"Baby hammocks","permalink":"baby-hammocks","url":"/category/baby-hammocks"}]},{"id":5916373,"name":"AMAZONAS Palmera rockstone space saving hanging chair stand for indoor or outdoor use.

The gentle swaying motion of a hammock quickly settles and calms baby, thus making it a perfect sleep solution for the little one, and a sanity saving solution for mum and dad!  As well as helping to develop your baby's sense of balance, hammocks are excellent for easing wind / flatulence, general tension and colic. \r\n\r\nThe result?

(see below).\r\n\r\nKangoo can be buttoned up so that the baby feels absolutely safe and snugly; this makes Kangoo very similar to the womb and thus the ideal place for the baby to relax in as it is wrapped cuddly and softly without being hidden from view, and sways gently to and fro.\r\n\r\nOr, it can be left unbuttoned for curious babies who just like to sit and watch the world go by! The Kangoo makes the little ones feel the same comforting floating state that they enjoyed in mums tummy for 9 months.\r\n\r\nThis hammock has a multitude of safety feature that make it one of the safest on the market. - There is a built in 5 point safety harness for the ultimate peace of mind - it is impossible for babies to roll over whilst properly secured in this hammock.  The hammock is a 'bag'' type design so the weight of the baby weighs it down - it doesn't have a firm stable bottom which means that baby cannot roll back and forth.  The mattress /blanket can go underneath the lying surface so the baby cannot get between mattress and hammock.  The Kangoo hammock also allows adequate airflow.  \r\n\r\nAll products in the AMAZONAS range comply with the strictest safety standards.

A happy, stress free, well rested baby - isn't that what we all want for our little ones?\r\n\r\nThe Kangoo is gorgeous hammock which is suspended at one single point above the hammock.  Kangoo can be buttoned up so that the baby feels absolutely safe and snugly;  this makes Kangoo very similar to the womb and thus the ideal place for the baby to sleep in as it is wrapped cuddly and softly without being hidden from view, and sways gently to and fro.   Or, it can be left unbuttoned for curious babies who just like to hang out and watch the world go by!  The Kangoo makes the little ones feel the same comforting floating state that they enjoyed in mums tummy for 9 months.\r\n\r\nThe Kangoo has a number of features which make it one of the safest baby hammocks on the market:\r\n\r\n* The Kangoo has a sewn in 5-point safety harness for the ultimate peace of mind.\r\n\r\n*  The Kangoo is hammock is a 'bag' type design so the weight of the baby weighs it down - it doesn't have a firm stable bottom which means that babies cannot roll back and forth. \r\n\r\n*  The mattress /blanket can go underneath the lying surface so the baby cannot get between mattress and hammock. \r\n\r\n* The Kangoo hammock allows adequate airflow. \r\n\r\nThis set includes the Kangoo hammock and an absolutely stunning wooden 'Carello baby' stand which is a real eye catcher -   it's a gorgeously shaped hammock stand and acts as a great modern feature in your home. \r\n\r\nThis exclusive design makes Carello baby a real gem in your home or garden; it is easy to carry so that you can be close to your baby at all times.  Made of untreated sprucewood.  If you wanted to coat this stand with non-toxic varnish, it would withstand any weather condition. \r\n\r\nThe stand is absolutely stable and tilt proof. \r\n\r\nThe stand measures approx 130cm in height.\r\n\r\nDimensions are: 82.5 x 130 x 99.4cm\r\n\r\nLoad capacity is 35kg\r\n\r\nStand weight is 10kg. \r\nThe stand comes in 5 parts, but, once assembled, can easily be taken down into 2 main parts making it really portable.  It would easily fit in the back of the car once the 2 main parts are separated.\r\n\r\nAlso included is a ‘Sunny’ blanket which is a beautifully soft, cushioned blanket to warm baby’s back, and turn the hammock into an even cosier napping place.  There are slits in the blanket to accommodate 5 point safety harnesses which means that the blanket can also be used as a pram liner or car seat liner.  \r\n\r\nThe spreader bar is removable so the hammock can be machine washed.\r\n\r\nThe Kangoo hammock and Sunny blanket both carry the ‘eco tested’ logo which means that they have been tested for harmful substances and has been approved for use next to a babies delicate soft skin.\r\n\r\nThe postage cost on this item could be reduced significantly depending on your location - please call or email us with your suburb for a cost confirmation.","options":[{"id":20689809,"name":"Kangoo, Carello Baby and Sunny red","price":299.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":20689811,"name":"Kangoo, Carello Baby and Sunny cacao","price":299.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":40.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":170.0,"amount_with_others":170.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":170.0,"amount_with_others":170.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63889303/-/A2882-09-F-15_640.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63889303/-/A2882-09-F-15_640.jpg","width":640,"height":913},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63889277/-/A288-09-F-01_800.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63889277/-/A288-09-F-01_800.jpg","width":666,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63889285/-/A288-09-F-02_800.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63889285/-/A288-09-F-02_800.jpg","width":666,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63889405/-/A287-11-F-01_640.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63889405/-/A287-11-F-01_640.jpg","width":640,"height":961},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63889429/-/Kangoo_open.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63889429/-/Kangoo_open.jpg","width":494,"height":959}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":6505925,"name":"AMAZONAS Kaya Natura baby hammock & Wooden Carello baby stand","permalink":"amazonas-kaya-natura-baby-hammock-wooden-carello-baby-stand","position":99,"price":299.0,"default_price":299.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/amazonas-kaya-natura-baby-hammock-wooden-carello-baby-stand","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-21T08:32:40.000Z","description":"This AMAZONAS set includes the Kaya Natura baby hammock, timber Carello baby stand and a Sunny blanket liner. \r\n\r\nThis beautiful hammock can be used as a daytime napping place, travel crib, rocker, or simply for somewhere for baby to relax and watch whats going on around them.

There are slits in the blanket to accommodate 5 point safety harnesses which means that the blanket can also be used as a pram liner or car seat liner. \r\n\r\nThe spreader bar is removable so the hammock can be machine washed.\r\n\r\nThe Kaya Natura hammock, and Sunny blanket  both carry the ‘eco tested’ logo which means that they have been tested for harmful substances and been approved for use next to a babies delicate soft skin.\r\n\r\nThe freight cost for this set could be reduced depending on your location so please email or call us with your suburb/postcode to confirm cost.\r\n","options":[{"id":20690117,"name":"Kaya Natura, Carello Baby & Sunny red","price":299.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":20690119,"name":"Kaya Natura, Carello Baby and Sunny cacao","price":299.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":40.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63890433/-/96160_4_image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63890433/-/96160_4_image.jpg","width":665,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63890445/-/A288-09-F-01_800.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63890445/-/A288-09-F-01_800.jpg","width":666,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63890461/-/A288-09-F-02_800.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63890461/-/A288-09-F-02_800.jpg","width":666,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63890485/-/A2882-09-F-02_P_800.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63890485/-/A2882-09-F-02_P_800.jpg","width":666,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63890493/-/A2882-09-F-11_P_800.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63890493/-/A2882-09-F-11_P_800.jpg","width":666,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1677075,"name":"Baby hammocks","permalink":"baby-hammocks","url":"/category/baby-hammocks"}]},{"id":7092601,"name":"AMAZONAS Apollo wooden hammock stand - The little brother!","permalink":"amazonas-apollo-wooden-hammock-stand","position":100,"price":379.0,"default_price":379.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/amazonas-apollo-wooden-hammock-stand","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-29T08:31:11.000Z","description":"This gorgeous wooden hammock stand is the perfect addition to any home, deck or back yard.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe stunningly designed stand is made from Spruce wood which comes from sustainable European forests.
