I didn't like him when I first saw him in the raw clay stage. I entertained the idea of smashing him to bits before he ever saw the inside of the kiln. But I kept him, bisque fired him, sat him on my work table and glared at his odd alien appearance for a few weeks more.\r\n\r\nI applied some glazes, and let him sit again. Finally, I fired the glazes on this strange bear, and I still did not like him any better. He might have still been a mistake at that point. \r\n\r\nSo I threw caution to the wind and decorated him with some gold luster overglaze. It is the most extravagant glaze I own. He went through the kiln for a third and final time.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in that final firing, the magic happened. The bear came alive and was finally complete. He has really grown on me now, and I love the way he looks!\r\n\r\nHe is made from a dark brown clay with white, blue and green speckled glazes applied. The small, bright spots are beads of real silver. His carvings are accented with real gold luster overglaze.\r\n\r\nThis sculpture is fairly heavy, but when you pick him up, large clay beads roll around inside his hollow body!\r\n\r\nSize: 5.5 inches tall, 3.5 inches wide, 9 inches long ","options":[{"id":48806082,"name":"Default","price":335.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":30.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":65.0,"amount_with_others":60.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128049039/-/bearside2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128049039/-/bearside2.jpg","width":864,"height":687},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128049099/-/bearside1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128049099/-/bearside1.jpg","width":864,"height":687},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128049063/-/bearfrontback.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128049063/-/bearfrontback.jpg","width":864,"height":1368}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6570234,"name":"Sculptures","permalink":"sculptures","url":"/category/sculptures"}]},{"id":15029343,"name":"Green Polymer Clay Beast","permalink":"green-polymer-clay-beast","position":4,"price":48.0,"default_price":48.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/green-polymer-clay-beast","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-22T16:45:31.000Z","description":"Meet Moss!

These three ceramic monsters are very happy to be a family. Their bright, shiny eyes are made of real silver!\r\n\r\nThey are hand-carved from stoneware clay.

I added a face and cut out the mouth opening so air could escape during the firing.\r\n\r\nI used some tools to texture the body and spikes of each monster. After they dried completely, I fired them in my kiln to partially harden the clay. Then I glazed them in some lovely colors. \r\n\r\nThe darker spots break a warm brown around the edges of the texture while greens and blues pool in the center. I mixed up a beautiful minty green for the spikes and the rest of the body. Finally the monsters were fired again to a higher temperature to fully mature the clay and glazes.\r\n\r\nThe large clay monster is 4 inches wide, 4 inches tall, and 4.5 inches long.\r\n\r\nThe little monsters are 2.5 inches wide and tall.

Every last bit of this sculpture was created by hand without the use of any molds. The craters on her back were added one at a time. The leaves adorning her antlers are made of polymer clay, each carefully sculpted and painted by hand. The moss is sculpted and textured with a small, fine brush. The chain in her antlers has been glued in place to make it a permanent part of the sculpture.\r\n\r\n*********************************\r\n\r\nThese dragon beasts are my favorites to make, but due to their time-consuming process to make them, they are very limited in number.\r\n\r\nI used artist grade acrylics to paint her with, in white, shimmering bronze and several shades of green.

Some have horns or spikes, some monsters have tails, and others wear mischievous grins.\r\n\r\nMy monsters are made from porcelain and stoneware and fired in my kiln to a final temperature of over 2000 degrees.\r\n\r\nThese little monsters are for decoration only. They are not toys and should not be given to children.

Which is very fortunate for us as they have short tempers and like to bite. They are rather plump and don't fly very well.\r\n\r\nThis particular Owlasaurus is a lovely shade of mossy green and creamy white with metallic gold details.\r\n\r\nHe is 2 inches tall, 2.25 inches long and 1 inch wide. He is made of stoneware clay, glazed and fired to over 2000 degrees in my kiln. You won't find another just like him.\r\n\r\nThe rock in the photo is not included in this sale.
