This necklace will let you do just that, and also bring conversation, joy, and fresh air along with you. The icosahedron is a form that has inspired artists and scientists for centuries with its symmetry and elegance. This piece adds a pop of color and a bit of geometric flair to any outfit as well!\r\n\r\nThe original idea for the wearable planter came from the desire to create something with an heirloom quality out of plastic. It's a material that last for thousands of years, yet its applications are usually only temporary. This solves that inherent contradiction in use, something beautiful can be made out of this material. \r\n\r\nThis wearable planter is created digitally with modeling software and is then 3d printed out of nylon and hand dyed a lovely tangerine and sealed. This planter works best with a clipping from a succulent that has been allowed to take root.\r\n\r\nThis planter measures 6/10\" in diameter and comes on a 29\" long leather cord. \r\n\r\nProducts Photos & description: Wearable Planter","options":[{"id":50338713,"name":"Coral","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50338716,"name":"Teal","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129209550/-/s1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129209550/-/s1.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129184662/-/il_fullxfull.355300915_4caf.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129184662/-/il_fullxfull.355300915_4caf.jpg","width":1000,"height":664},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129184677/-/il_fullxfull.293497261.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129184677/-/il_fullxfull.293497261.jpg","width":1000,"height":664},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129184686/-/il_fullxfull.355300983_5wob.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129184686/-/il_fullxfull.355300983_5wob.jpg","width":1000,"height":664},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129184698/-/il_fullxfull.263054548.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129184698/-/il_fullxfull.263054548.jpg","width":1000,"height":660}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6876108,"name":"Our Friends","permalink":"our-friends","url":"/category/our-friends"}]},{"id":15476583,"name":"Twisted Handlebar Vase, by Wearable Planter","permalink":"twisted-handlebar-vase-by-our-friend-wearbleplanter","position":19,"price":35.0,"default_price":35.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/twisted-handlebar-vase-by-our-friend-wearbleplanter","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-11T00:36:16.000Z","description":"Ever dreamed of carrying some flowers on your bike?
