I have the solution for you.\r\n\r\nNote: a Swag is a hanging light that is plugs into an electrical socket. If you want a hard-wired hanging fixture, choose the Pendant style instead.\r\n\r\nFor my Cloth Cord Light Kits I’ve chosen the same high-quality materials and components that I use in my own high-end creations. \r\nAll the kits are assembled-to-order here in my workshop studio in Pine Plains, N.Y.\r\n\r\nYou have the choice of ten colors of beautiful twisted cord: red, blue, brown, green, putty, ivory, black, silver, gold and copper. \r\nMeasure how long you need the wire to be and all will arrive ready for you to let your creativity go wild.\r\n\r\nThis listing is for a \"Cloth Cord Swag Light Kit\" with putty cord, you can choose between nickel, brass and antique brass hardware. \r\nWhat you get: Porcelain socket wired to your cord. Comes with 12', 15' or 18’ of cord. If you need more cord, please email me and I will custom make a kit for you. Inline switch, plug, hooks & hanging hardware. Instructions for assembly.\r\n\r\nA word about wattage!!!!!!\r\n\r\nI DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE HANGING, SO WITH THAT SAID I WILL CAUTION YOU TO USE A 40-WATT MAX BULB.
