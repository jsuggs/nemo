I met Mikey this summer when he was jamming with Adam for his solo project. Dude can shred. Anyways, he told me about his EP that he was releasing on cassette Black Friday this year. Needless to say, it’s a solid debut.\r\n\r\n\"...The E.P. starts with “Nicole and Carl Sagan”, a song that’s intro and verses have synths that remind me of Wavves, while Mikey’s heavy bass distortion reminds me of Ty Segall. What separates Little Viking from being a knock off of either band is the fast paced, cymbal-heavy drumming of drummer Joey Cantrell on the first two tracks, and the grunge/shoegaze influenced guitar work of Mike Frazier. The band meshes well enough together to make a pretty damn good song....\"\r\n","options":[{"id":10745835,"name":"Red Cassette","price":3.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10745837,"name":"Yellow Cassette","price":3.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10745839,"name":"Purple Cassette","price":3.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.25,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30506011/-/littlevikingcover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30506011/-/littlevikingcover.jpg","width":350,"height":350}],"artists":[{"id":50687,"name":"Little Viking","permalink":"little-viking","url":"/artist/little-viking"}],"categories":[{"id":1824483,"name":"Cassettes","permalink":"cassettes","url":"/category/cassettes"}]}]
