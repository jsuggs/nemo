Hinting at vague memories of microbiology and rotating through a cool organic spectrum of greens, blues, browns, blacks and whites; this motion-based work will entrance its viewer as the forest evolves. The Interpretation is set to a minimal score filled with authentic sounds of nature, complimenting the environmental essence of the visuals. DVD contains over 36:00 minutes of content.

And every vibration has its own pulse, its own pace, its own motion.  Enter the Dragon is an experimental video compilation exploring the nuances of type. The videos don't just spell out words; each video embodies the spirit of the typeface it features. Over 40 minutes of motion graphics that are alternately blessed, enameled, processed, alloyed, selected, exposed, composited, and otherwise thrown-down in a no-holds-barred battle reminiscent of Andy Kaufman's wrestling career.\r\n\r\nArtists who contributed: MK12, Matt Owens of Volumeone, Joshua Davis, Nando Costa, Gmunk, Michael Paul Young, Greyscale, Shilo, Jens Karlsson of Chapter3, GHava, Typevsm, U-C-E-R*, C505, Justin Harder, Joost Korngold of Renascent, Danny Yount, Chandler Owen, Suk Koch, Feel Good Anyway, Lance Sells of Normal Natural, Quinta-feira, Laundry, Eddie Pak of Suction, Burkom, Rocketpowered Mice, and Yann Orhan.\r\n\r\nOriginally published by YouWorkForThem.\r\nNTSC/Regional ALL","options":[{"id":13181231,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38688399/-/YWFT_DVD_08.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38688399/-/YWFT_DVD_08.jpg","width":1000,"height":669}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2155012,"name":"DVD","permalink":"dvd","url":"/category/dvd"}]},{"id":3968095,"name":"Shilo: We Make it Good","permalink":"shilo-we-make-it-good","position":4,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/shilo-we-make-it-good","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-06-22T09:38:09.000Z","description":"In true Shilo fashion, this book/DVD is not merely a compilation of the studio’s past projects, but rather a thoughtful collection that brings a whole new dimension to the work by showcasing conceptual pieces that both inspired, and were inspired by, the projects themselves. The studio sheds light on these new conceptual pieces presenting them in full motion as an array of never-before-seen experimental pieces. The disc also offers a rare glimpse into the thought process of the team in a number of behind the scenes featurettes focused on Shilo’s work for Angels & Airwaves, Audio Bullys, and Converse. \r\n\r\nOriginally published by YouWorkForThem\r\nNTSC/Regional All","options":[{"id":13181315,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38688375/-/YWFT_DVD_13.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38688375/-/YWFT_DVD_13.jpg","width":1000,"height":669}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2155012,"name":"DVD","permalink":"dvd","url":"/category/dvd"}]}]
