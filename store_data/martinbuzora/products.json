Few gardens can match the sheer grandeur of the setting of Kirstenbosch against the Eastern slopes of Cape Town’s Table Mountain.\r\n\r\nKirstenbosch was established in 1913 to promote, conserve and display the extraordinarily rich and diverse flora of Southern Africa, and was the first botanical garden in the world to be devoted to a country's indigenous flora. Kirstenbosch displays a wide variety of the unique plant life of the Cape Flora, as well as plants from all the diverse regions of Southern Africa, both outdoors and in the Botanical Society Conservatory. There are more than 7,000 species in cultivation at Kirstenbosch, including many rare and threatened species.\r\n\r\nThe garden covers 36 hectares in a 528-hectare estate that contains protected mountainside, supporting natural forest and fynbos, along with a variety of animals and birds. Kirstenbosch lies in the heart of the Cape Floristic Region, also known as the Cape Floral Kingdom. In 2004, the Cape Floristic Region, including Kirstenbosch, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site; another first for Kirstenbosch, it is the first botanical garden in the world to be included within a natural World Heritage Site.\r\n\r\nKirstenbosch is the largest of a country-wide network of nine National Botanical Gardens administered by the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI). Their mission is to promote the sustainable use, conservation, appreciation and enjoyment of the exceptionally rich plant and animal life of South Africa, for the benefit of all people.","options":[{"id":17628253,"name":"12 x 18 Photo (Glossy)","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":17628255,"name":"16 x 24 Poster (Lustre)","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17628257,"name":"20 x 30 Print (Glossy)","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17628259,"name":"30 x 45 Print (Glossy)","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17628261,"name":"40 x 60 Print (Glossy)","price":275.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17628263,"name":"20 x 30 Stretched Canvas","price":230.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17628265,"name":"30 x 45 Stretched Canvas","price":390.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17628267,"name":"40 x 60 Stretched Canvas","price":600.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/52917057/-/11.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/52917057/-/11.jpg","width":1000,"height":664}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2857799,"name":"Fine Art Prints","permalink":"fine-art-prints","url":"/category/fine-art-prints"},{"id":2887601,"name":"Trees","permalink":"trees","url":"/category/trees"},{"id":2887603,"name":"Africa","permalink":"africa","url":"/category/africa"},{"id":2887683,"name":"Cape Town","permalink":"cape-town","url":"/category/cape-town"}]},{"id":5383849,"name":"Kobo Kobo Hills","permalink":"kobo-kobo-hills","position":6,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kobo-kobo-hills","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-02T12:46:43.000Z","description":"Namibia\r\n\r\nKobo Kobo Hills is a rustic and restful retreat at the foot of the Khomas Hochland Mountains in central Namibia, situated halfway between Windhoek and the coast, on the edge of the Namib Desert.

It winds its way between Noordhoek and Hout Bay on the Atlantic Coast on the South-Western tip of South Africa. The nine-kilometre route, with its 114 curves, skirts the rocky coastline of Chapman’s Peak (593m), which is the southerly extension of Constantiaberg.\r\n\r\nHacked out of the face of the mountain between 1915 and 1922, the road was at the time regarded as a major feat of engineering. Chapman's Peak Drive was closed in the 1990s, after a rockfall caused a death and a subsequent lawsuit. It re-opened after being re-engineered to protect motorists from falling rocks. The road was again closed for a number of months beginning on June 19, 2008 \"as a result of risk areas identified on the mountain above the road\", but has since been re-opened indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe top of Chapman's Peak consists of flat, sedimentary rocks related to those that form Table Mountain. The base of the mountain, however, consists of Cape Granite and the two formations meet at a geological unconformity that is world-famous amongst earth scientists. Two different endangered vegetation types can be found along this road, which correspond to the two main geological formations. Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos and Cape Granite Fynbos are both endemic to the city of Cape Town, and occur nowhere else in the world.","options":[{"id":17628317,"name":"12 x 18 Photo

The <i>Deadvlei</i> of Sossusvlei is truly one of the most remarkable places on Earth. All the trees here, though dead, have been nearly perfectly preserved for centuries: there is not even moisture enough for normal decomposition to occur. \r\n\r\nLocated in the Namib Naukluft park, the largest conservation area in Africa (and fourth largest in the world), the sand dunes of Sossusvlei in the Namib Desert are the highest dunes in the world. Sossusvlei is a mud pan created by a river that flows through the Namib every five to ten years. The river never reaches the Atlantic Ocean, but drains away between the dunes of Sossusvlei.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of <i>Sossus</i> is \"place of no return\" and walking among these ancient ghosts, it is easy to see why.","options":[{"id":17628523,"name":"12 x 18 Photo (Glossy)","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":17628525,"name":"16 x 24 Poster (Lustre)","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17628527,"name":"20 x 30 Print (Glossy)","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17628529,"name":"30 x 45 Print (Glossy)","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17628531,"name":"40 x 60 Print (Glossy)","price":275.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17628533,"name":"20 x 30 Stretched Canvas","price":230.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17628535,"name":"30 x 45 Stretched Canvas","price":390.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17628537,"name":"40 x 60 Stretched Canvas","price":600.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/52923153/-/56.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/52923153/-/56.jpg","width":1000,"height":664}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2857799,"name":"Fine Art Prints","permalink":"fine-art-prints","url":"/category/fine-art-prints"},{"id":2887601,"name":"Trees","permalink":"trees","url":"/category/trees"},{"id":2887603,"name":"Africa","permalink":"africa","url":"/category/africa"}]},{"id":5391181,"name":"Noordhoek","permalink":"noordhoek","position":33,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/noordhoek","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-03T12:10:00.000Z","description":"Western Cape, South Africa\r\n\r\nA peaceful equestrian community in the greater Cape Town area, Noordhoek offers a relaxed countryside-getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city.
