Cape Heartache, the anticipated new release from Imaginary Authors, covers new territory for the line in the form of a deep, woodsy Pacific Northwest scent that captures the melancholy of lost love. A surprising interlude of strawberry hides among the cedar trees like memories that become sweeter only when you know they are lost forever. \"If you are looking for the pieces of a broken heart,\" our imaginary author Philip Sava says, \"you might try rifling through the twigs and needles on the forest floor.\"\r\n\r\nNOTES: Douglas fir, pine resin, western hemlock, vanilla leaf, strawberry, old growth, and mountain fog.\r\n\r\n\r\n60mL Eau de Parfume\r\n\r\nImaginary Authors","options":[{"id":46862811,"name":"Default","price":85.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":12.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126630057/-/IMG_9092_square.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126630057/-/IMG_9092_square.jpg","width":2259,"height":2259},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126630084/-/IMG_9088.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126630084/-/IMG_9088.jpg","width":4198,"height":2799}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6336942,"name":"Bath","permalink":"bath","url":"/category/bath"}]},{"id":14476020,"name":"Memoirs of a Trespasser ","permalink":"perfume-1","position":49,"price":85.0,"default_price":85.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/perfume-1","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-29T02:59:19.000Z","description":"The early exploration writing of Philip Sava bent the limits of post-modern fiction, revealing fantastical worlds that fooled many into believing they were, in fact, real. Sava’s kaleidoscopic collections, of which Memoirs of a Trespasser is the undeniable centerpiece, drew upon true experiences from his exotic travels but were infused with a hallucinatory inventiveness that set his work apart from others in the genre.\r\n\r\nThough Sava had associates all over the world, he spent most of his time living in solitude on a ranch in southern Madagascar. When interrogated by the press on his cloistered lifestyle he notoriously answered, “Who needs love when you have cognac?”\r\n\r\nWHEN TO WEAR: A true adventure scent, wear Memoirs of a Trespasser when travelling, and again when you’re back home to conjure comforting memories.\r\n\r\nNOTES: Madagascar Vanilla, Guaiacwood, Myrrh, Benzoin Resin, Ambrette Seeds & Oak Barrels\r\n\r\n60mL Eau de Parfume\r\n\r\nImaginary Authors\r\n","options":[{"id":46862376,"name":"Default","price":85.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126630204/-/IMG_9090_square.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126630204/-/IMG_9090_square.jpg","width":2274,"height":2274},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126629865/-/IMG_9088.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126629865/-/IMG_9088.jpg","width":4198,"height":2799}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6336942,"name":"Bath","permalink":"bath","url":"/category/bath"}]},{"id":14509053,"name":"White Pine Candle in Porcelain Faux Bois Keepsake Cup","permalink":"white-pine-candle-in-porcelain-faux-bois-keepsake-cup","position":50,"price":35.0,"default_price":35.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/white-pine-candle-in-porcelain-faux-bois-keepsake-cup","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-30T14:30:53.000Z","description":"Porcelain container made from a mold of a birch log by Philadelphia ceramicists and designers, Heirloom Home and Studio \r\nEvergreen with a hint of sweet pine sap with pure White Pine essential oil \r\nHand poured in small batches no greater than 35 candles\r\n\r\nMade by Greenmarket Purveying Co., a group of people who love candles and natural bath products, organic soaps and extraordinary scents—scents that transport them to different times and places, scents that smell pure and fresh; like the plants and flowers that actually inspired them.
