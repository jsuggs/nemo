These adorable Flower clips ad a bit of style to wherever you choose to stick them. Clip them to bags, shirts, hair, ...I even have used them as curtain tie backs! Your imagination is the only limit. All flowers are attached to fully covered alligator clips, so there are no edges to snag on fabric or pull hair, and finished in the center with a rhinestone. Available in Plum, Cream, Coral, Creamy Peach, and Pink. If you need another color just message me, I'm happy to create custom ones! Thanks for visiting Gracie Bug Boutique.
