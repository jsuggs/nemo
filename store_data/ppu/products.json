At the age of two Dwight and family moved to Kalamazoo, Michigan where he would remain for most of his younger years.  At the age of nine Dwight started his musical career singing background vocals with a spiritual group, Airs of Harmony, Jr., now known as the Michigan Nightingales.  After three years of signing, Dwight started playing guitar.  He joined his first r&B band, The Kenyatahs, at age thirteen and then played for five years with the group.  Following the break up of the group and the death of his mother, Dwight enlisted in the U.S. Army.  During that time he played guitar and drums for the band 100% Pure Poison.  They played throughout Germany for 18 months.  After being honorably discharged, and back in the states, Dwight started playing in numerous local Michigan bands including Domain, and Chaos. Eager to write his own material, Dwight created the group Jahari.  They toured for a couple of years in the Michigan area until another break-up.  Still under the Jahari alias, Dwight wrote \"Situations\" which received respectable air-play on Michigan local radio stations, WKMI, WQXC, WRDR, WKZO and WKDS.<BR><BR>\r\n\r\nDwight now resides near Atlanta, Georgia. He continues to write and produce songs on his Tascam 464 four track console.  Although he uses other avenues to provide for the upkeep of himself and son, his love of music keep the hope alive that he will one day get that big break in the music business.  Dwight Sykes - Songs Volume One is a collection of material written, produced and recorded by Dwight Sykes on 4-Track Cassette, in his home studio L.U.S.T. Productions.   <BR><BR>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://ppudc.com/audio/PPU044.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">LISTEN</a>\r\n","options":[{"id":32027005,"name":"Default","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100570963/-/sykeslp1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100570963/-/sykeslp1.jpg","width":900,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100570975/-/sykeslp2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100570975/-/sykeslp2.jpg","width":900,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100570987/-/sykeslp3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100570987/-/sykeslp3.jpg","width":700,"height":700},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100570999/-/sykeslp4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100570999/-/sykeslp4.jpg","width":700,"height":700}],"artists":[{"id":189466,"name":"DWIGHT SYKES","permalink":"dwight-sykes","url":"/artist/dwight-sykes"}],"categories":[{"id":238539,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]},{"id":15463377,"name":"MERWYN & INKSWEL \\ CLOUD EATERS \\ HOT SHOT SOUNDS 12\" EP","permalink":"merwyn-inkswel-cloud-eaters-hot-shot-sounds-12-ep","position":2,"price":13.99,"default_price":13.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/merwyn-inkswel-cloud-eaters-hot-shot-sounds-12-ep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-10T16:16:28.000Z","description":"Merwyn Sanders formerly of VIRGO FOUR & Trax records adds his introspective soulful touch to INKSWEL's Future soul productions. 3 original jams pushing the boundaries of current trends, complemented by stellar remix work from LINKWOOD & GB aka Gifted & Blessed.

Benedek's \"Saturday Jam\" hits us with melodic synths and intricate baselines over a silky groove has us gliding up and down the block anticipating the nighttime! Henning's vinyl debut - \"Peak of Summer\" electrifies us with his intensity , blistering synth and talkbox arrangements that creates a dialogue that is most commonly felt on the hottest days of the year, dripping wet modern funk !

Extremely limited second pressing! Silk screened black covers, the works! We'll only have these for a short time.  <a href=\"http://ppudc.com/audio/PPU038LP.mp3\">LISTEN </a><BR>\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's the full bio:\r\n\r\n\"The Earle Hotel was located in downtown Richmond, Virginia, at the corner of West Main and North Adams. It was a massive yet fairly nondescript 1920's era building that took up over half the block, but by the end of the 70's, years of mismanagement and neglect had turned it into a shell of its former self. Even The Earle's distinguished neighbor, The Jefferson, was not immune to downtown's decline. The once grand 19th century hotel had turned shabby and was months away from permanently closing. Its days of hosting US Presidents, movie stars and Elvis Presley were ancient history. In its shadow, the low-rent, low-profile Earle struggled to hang on.\r\n\r\nIf The Earle had any reputation left it was as a place to be avoided, a flophouse, where the down and out and desperate could find a room for the night, cheap, no questions asked. It was also home to nearly a hundred month to month residents ranging from drunks and prostitutes to street preachers, abandoned senior citizens, struggling artists and scores of working poor. One occupant, Max Monroe, was a writer and musician who had been staying at The Earle since he was a teenager in the early 70's. Back then it wasn't such a bad place. There were hotel maids, even a restaurant downstairs, Fodool's, with room service, but things had gotten out of hand fairly quickly. Despite the rapidly deteriorating conditions, Max would continue to rent Room 111 for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile and a half from The Earle at 2049 West Broad Street was Alpha Audio. In the Spring of 1979 Max Monroe entered the state of the art studio to cut a record with his band The Trash Company. The session lasted about six hours and yielded three finished tracks. Only one of these recordings would see the light of day. \"Come To Me Softly\" served as both sides of a 45, the lone release on Monroe's label Kinky Blu, and the only thing the band would ever put out.\r\n\r\nThe Trash Company was formed back in February of 1975 in the lobby of the Earle Hotel. Three brothers, the Cheathams, had come to recruit Max for a new band they were trying to assemble. Watusi, Bee and Pop were familiar with Max from the Jackson Ward neighborhood they all grew up in. The brothers had already been in some bands together. As The Naturals, they once played the legendary Sahara Club on the city's Northside. That group eventually mutated into something called Rich Gypsy & The Wax Dollar Bills. It didn't take much to convince Max to join the Cheathams in their latest brainchild. \"They had a band. I wanted to be in a band.\" Simple as that. Max was in.\r\nThe new group could have passed for Funkadelic's kid brothers as they took it to the stage the following week for a Valentine's Day talent show at their old stomping ground, Maggie L. Walker High School. The six piece line up included Max (vocals and guitar), Watusi (Linwood Cheatham- guitar), Bee (Victor Cheatham- drums), Pop (Gregory Cheatham- percussion), Fisto (Tyrone Claude- keyboards), and Wounded Knee (guitar). Rounding out this ragtag crew was the band's friend Wolf, a dread-locked karate black belt, whose nomadic lifestyle included sleeping on park benches and under city bridges. It seemed only fitting that for The Trash Company's introduction Wolf would empty a garbage can full of paper into the audience. As the band's first few notes rang out in the stunned auditorium, the school principal ordered the curtains dropped and it was over.\r\nThis inauspicious debut would set the tone for the handful of years that followed. The Trash Company gigged sporadically, mostly Jackson Ward bars, rarely or barely getting paid, seldom venturing outside of their downtown neighborhood. Max, who had become the leader by default, grew increasingly frustrated with the band's inactivity and the prevailing lackadaisical attitude. He had been writing a lot of new material that seemed to be going to waste. His decision to book studio time and make a record was essentially a last ditch effort to get something going.\r\n\r\nFor the session that produced \"Come To Me Softly\" Max sang, played the guitars and bass, while Bee played drums. Watusi and Pop contributed the eerie \"chimes\", which were actually the sound of a toy xylophone being run through a ring modulator by Alpha Audio engineer Carlos Chafin. The backing vocals were supplied by Bee's wife Florence Cheatham and Robinette Gravely, niece of U.S. Navy pioneer Admiral Samuel L. Gravely.\r\nThe 8-track reels were left at Alpha, and a couple months later Max received 500 newly pressed copies of the single from Cincinnati's QCA. The eye-catching 45 with its swirling blue label, was sent out to a number of record companies as well as an array of influential producers and artists. Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire sent back a nice hand-written note of encouragement. Frank Sinatra even replied with a signed letter of thanks. Country star Jerry Reed was not so kind. He took the time to mail the 45 back to Max... shattered into pieces.\r\n\r\nThe new record showed quite a bit of growth since The Trash Company's wild beginnings, but it did little to change the group's fortunes. \"Come To Me Softly\" possessed an offbeat beauty, but only a few heard it, and most who did weren't sure what to make of it. The song was difficult to classify, hard to promote and sell, and the band itself didn't really fit into any scene. They seemed snake bitten, or at least unable to get out of their own way. More often than not Max found himself at odds with his bandmates, and as the decade of the 80's rolled in, the only thing left to do was part ways. He quit the band, never to join another.\r\n\r\nMax continued to write songs on his own, capturing them on his Bell & Howell cassette recorder. The music was taking on the harder edge he had originally envisioned for The Trash Company. Watusi would drop by The Earle every now and then, sometimes bringing his guitar, which now had a couple of strings removed in tribute to one of his favorite bands, The B-52's. He and Max would hang out, reminisce and occasionally collaborate on new tracks. The two had been like brothers, practically inseparable. They had their differences, they fought, but years of shared experiences, good and bad, forged a connection between them that seemed unbreakable.\r\n\r\nEver since Max knew him, Watusi had a thyroid condition which produced a goiter on his neck. He would cover it with scarves or buttoned up shirt collars, but a decade plus of not taking care of himself led to Watusi's situation worsening to the point that it could no longer be ignored. Max recalls walking into the emergency room of MCV Hospital with Watusi and seeing the horrified expressions on the nurses' faces. The size of the goiter was the type of extreme case you'd see documented in a medical publication. The nurses made him sit in a wheelchair and immediately whisked him away to see a doctor. Watusi, as usual, was very nonchalant about the whole thing, amused by all the fuss, cracking jokes as he was pushed down the corridor.\r\n\r\nWatusi received treatment, and his condition seemed to be under control, but gradually Max saw a change. He attributes most of it to the toll disease had taken on his friend physically and emotionally. His mood and psyche were altered by illness. After years of health struggles, Linwood \"Watusi\" Cheatham left this world at the age of 47, September 3, 1996. Max remembers his charismatic \"brother\", as looking like a cross between Jimi Hendrix and Bootsy Collins back in the day, with a larger than life personality. \"The guy was magic...I saw him perform hypnotism on people just by walking into a room.\"\r\nThrough the first half of the 1980's, Max Monroe spent most of his time holed up in Room 111 creating new material through the chaos and squalor of his surroundings. He'd encountered some characters during his stay at The Earle. There was the guy who claimed to once be part of Elvis's Memphis Mafia, the two retired circus clowns, one of whom had appeared on the cover of Life Magazine in the 30's, the reputed rich eccentric, Dick Griffith, who happened to be President of The Richmond Rose Society and Secretary of the local chapter of the Archeological Society of Virginia. He'd lived at the Earle since moving to Richmond in the late 50's. By far the longest resident, Dick inexplicably was still there. \"Look around.\", Max philosophizes, \"There is something you are to learn, someone you are to meet or a gift could be hiding in the clutter of dismay.\" He quickly adds, \"Of course, sometimes this idea is pure bullshit and you need to get the hell out of there.\" He finally made his exit in 1985, but the darkness and grit of The Earle remained present in the music he was creating.\r\n\r\nIn May of 1986 the remaining residents of The Earle were handed eviction notices. Just a few weeks earlier, The Jefferson had reopened under new ownership. As The Jefferson Sheraton, it had undergone three years and 30 million dollars worth of renovations and was on its way to becoming a five star hotel. Its latest acquisition, The Earle, sat boarded-up, a haven to homeless squatters who routinely broke in and set it ablaze. Public outcry led to the bombed-out, blighted property finally being demolished in the Winter of 1989. Today the ground where The Earle Hotel once stood is a parking lot for The Jefferson.\r\n\r\nMax Monroe has spent the last three decades making music. This collection focuses on a specific period from his prolific and widely varied output, a time when Monroe was diligently mailing demo cassettes to record labels in the hopes of making it as a songwriter.  One such tape, sent to Capitol Records in the early 90's, garnered this curt response from then President of the R&B Division, Joy Bailey: \"Some music was never meant to be heard.\" In hind sight, the odds were more than stacked against Max and his songs, but there is something undeniable about these recordings, starkly honest, deeply personal, yet demanding attention. The story behind these tapes is one of conviction and persistence in the face of rejection and indifference. It is time for this music to be heard.","options":[{"id":28783148,"name":"Default","price":16.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126463095/-/earlehotel_black.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126463095/-/earlehotel_black.jpg","width":938,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90332810/-/trashcoa.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90332810/-/trashcoa.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90332822/-/trashcob.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90332822/-/trashcob.jpg","width":988,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":127171,"name":"THE TRASH COMPANY","permalink":"the-trash-company","url":"/artist/the-trash-company"}],"categories":[{"id":238539,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]},{"id":14319636,"name":"DAZZLE / EXPLAIN / C ON THE FUNK / IN THE DISCO / PROMO 12\" ","permalink":"dazzle-explain-c-on-the-funk-in-the-disco-promo-12","position":22,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dazzle-explain-c-on-the-funk-in-the-disco-promo-12","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-21T19:00:50.000Z","description":"<b>DAZZLE aka \"C\" ON THE FUNK<BR><BR></b>\r\n\r\nMilwaukee disco funk holy grails right here.

rolled deep. Very deep. In the 1980s, it wasn't unusual for the Milwaukee-based group to show up at various Midwest night clubs in a caravan of 30-40 cars and vans. Their live following was hard won over a career that spanned 20+ years, many line up changes, and a handful of project names. Friends, family, and fans made the journey with them weekend after weekend, a testimony to both the musical prowess of the group and the tight-knit community that they emerged from. \r\n\r\nDonald Smith, band leader, was there the whole time - joined by many of his siblings and friends - first as founder of the Ghetto Players, a early 70's nine-piece which also included siblings Michael, Ronald, and Charles. They played hard funk in the style of early Kool and the Gang, and although they sadly left no recordings, the strength of their live act managed to catch the eye of local Milwaukee R&B music entrepreneur Cobie Joe Payne. Cobie had made a couple of records locally in the early/mid 70s as a singer, including the impossibly weird and amazing rare afro-blues-funk 45 \"Sweet Thing\", but had never enjoyed national success. When the Ghetto Players disbanded in the early-mid 70s, Donald soon put together a new group, C on the Funk (the 'C' referring to lead vocalist and sibling Charles), under Payne's tutelage. Sister Lorrie Smith came in as the drummer, the line-up being fleshed out by brothers David and Melvin Johnson, and friend Robert Mitchell.  After a few years as a strictly live attraction, they drove to Chicago and produced a single, \"In the Disco\" / \"A Place\" for Payne's small record label Sweet Thang Records in 1980. Lacking the financial backing needed to supply the local R&B disk jockey's \"promotional fees\" , this single sadly languished in obscurity, gathering dust inside the local tavern jukeboxes and manilla promo envelopes that comprised Payne's DIY distribution network.\r\n\r\nC on the Funk were traveling the Mid West extensively at this point, and making some important friends on the road. Ike Wiley Jr. of the Dazz Band/Kinsman Dazz took particular interest and the band was re-christened Dazzle, partially as a tie-in with Dazz, partially to embrace the new sounds that would distinguish the 70s disco scene from what record collectors and DJs would now refer to as the \"Boogie\" era. There no doubt was a stigma attached to the word \"Disco\" as the eighties began, and as we see in this collection C On the Funk's \"In the Disco\" is remixed and transformed into the psychedelic synth instrumental of Dazzle's \"Disco's Out\", a title which embodies both the next-step approach Smith and company were pushing for, and humorously comments on the state of black dance music in the early 1980s. The Dazzle recording, done in Chicago in 1982, updated the sound and featured an expanded line up, most notably a second synth player (Charles Washington), and a percussionist/second lead vocalist (Greg McDonald). The added synth textures and deep percussive grooves give the Dazzle recordings an elegant late night vibe that resonate just as well in a good pair of headphones as they do on the dance floor. The trance inducing cough syrup-warble of \"Explain\" may best exemplify this here. Sadly, a pressing flaw in the 12\" halted production and promotion, and the EP and the songs within were lost to the ages. The group, having done a much better line in the live music business, followed that path instead all the way to the early 90s.  -- <i>bio provided by andy noble </i><BR>\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n<a href=\"http://ppudc.com/ppu/ppu049.mp3\">LISTEN</a>","options":[{"id":38642205,"name":"Default","price":16.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120202170/-/ppu049j.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120202170/-/ppu049j.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120202182/-/ppu049j2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120202182/-/ppu049j2.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120202257/-/ppu049a.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120202257/-/ppu049a.jpg","width":800,"height":800}],"artists":[{"id":177945,"name":"DAZZLE","permalink":"dazzle","url":"/artist/dazzle"}],"categories":[{"id":238539,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]},{"id":10984449,"name":"UKU KUUT / I FEEL LOVE & SANTA MONICA PIER / PPU TEST PRESS 12\"","permalink":"uku-kuut-i-feel-love-snata-monica-pier-ppu-test-press-12","position":38,"price":10.99,"default_price":10.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/uku-kuut-i-feel-love-snata-monica-pier-ppu-test-press-12","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-06T17:46:50.000Z","description":"<div style=\"text-align: center;\">PPU-046\r\n\r\nLimited Edition 1995 UKU KUUT recordings from his years living in Santa Monica.

At the age of two Dwight and family moved to Kalamazoo, Michigan where he would remain for most of his younger years.  At the age of nine Dwight started his musical career singing background vocals with a spiritual group, Airs of Harmony, Jr., now known as the Michigan Nightingales.  After three years of signing, Dwight started playing guitar.  He joined his first r&B band, The Kenyatahs, at age thirteen and then played for five years with the group.  Following the break up of the group and the death of his mother, Dwight enlisted in the U.S. Army.  During that time he played guitar and drums for the band 100% Pure Poison.  They played throughout Germany for 18 months.  After being honorably discharged, and back in the states, Dwight started playing in numerous local Michigan bands including Domain, and Chaos. Eager to write his own material, Dwight created the group Jahari.  They toured for a couple of years in the Michigan area until another break-up.  Still under the Jahari alias, Dwight wrote \"Situations\" which received respectable air-play on Michigan local radio stations, WKMI, WQXC, WRDR, WKZO and WKDS.<BR><BR>\r\n\r\nDwight now resides near Atlanta, Georgia. He continues to write and produce songs on his Tascam 464 four track console.  Although he uses other avenues to provide for the upkeep of himself and son, his love of music keep the hope alive that he will one day get that big break in the music business.  Dwight Sykes - Songs Volume One is a collection of material written, produced and recorded by Dwight Sykes on 4-Track Cassette, in his home studio L.U.S.T. Productions.

Written and recorded at UKU's home studio in Los Angeles and Stockholm between 1982 & 1989. Some tracks co-written with Maryn E. Coote, famous jazz vocalist who had her beginnings in 1960s Soviet Union. \"That's my MOM\" recalls UKU, \"I remember when I was little, sitting under the mixing board at her sessions\".

Spider played lead guitar, and Mojo held the brass section.  Sam \"Spider\" Rice was also the music director for a vocal group called \"La Pinch\" which included vocalist Gary Pinchom (Pinch).  As the 80s approached La Pinch was looking for a new sound.  After relocating to the East Coast \"The Pinch\" was born.  New York and Jersey was quite a change.  Spider wanted to write a song to address the drug abuse he was seeing all around him.  \"Shot Out was a street term we used to describe someone with an excessive drug habit\", recalls Spider. \"We built a voice box from a horn driver, a couple of switches, and some tubing\". They had some money stashed from a Zodiac gig and picked up a Prophet 5 and Roland Drum machine.  After recording the track in 1981, the song was mastered at the legendary Power Station in NYC (famous for the CHIC sound). That would prove to be the major limitation for the release, since they were out of money now and could only afford to press 200 copies of the 7\".  Distributed in Texas and locally on the east coast, \"Shot Out\" would be the only release from The Pinch.  UNTIL NOW!  Re-mastered for the first time on 12\" vinyl, this 80s funk masterpiece is finally back on wax.  \r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://ppudc.com/ppu/ppu016.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">LISTEN</a> ","options":[{"id":6696571,"name":"Default","price":11.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/17656061/-/ppu-016.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/17656061/-/ppu-016.jpg","width":1000,"height":987}],"artists":[{"id":30311,"name":"THE PINCH","permalink":"the-pinch","url":"/artist/the-pinch"}],"categories":[{"id":166538,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"}]},{"id":5056821,"name":"PPU-033 / SUPERLIFE - GO BANANAS / DETROIT TECHNO FUNK 2x12\"","permalink":"ppu-033-superlife-go-bananas-detroit-techno-funk-2x12","position":77,"price":16.99,"default_price":16.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ppu-033-superlife-go-bananas-detroit-techno-funk-2x12","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-12-11T20:39:49.000Z","description":"<BR> SHIPPING NOW!!<BR>\r\nPeoples Potential Unlimited's most anticipated release to date.

Over the next  few years  the duo would  produce  dozens of  instrumental  sketches.  Terry  always recorded these backing arrangements to cassette tapes  so  they could  easily  listen to  them later in the car.  Cruising  the  streets  of Rock Island IL, vocalist Robbie M would write  the additional  melodies and lyrics.  The plan was to  release  a full  length  studio  album, combining all parts and adding vocals, but the group dispersed  in 1985 before  their  dream  was realized. The Terry tapes, which  were  never intended  for commercial release, are all that  remain.   When  we  first  heard them, they  were inaudible  with  almost  no tones left to preserve, but thanks to a few   small miracles and genuine  science  the shroud  of noise has been lifted to reveal an unexplainable haze of funk.  <BR><BR>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://ppudc.com/ppu/ppu015.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">LISTEN</a></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br />\r\n</p>","options":[{"id":9126467,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/24800826/-/ppu015.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/24800826/-/ppu015.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/24800830/-/ppu015a.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/24800830/-/ppu015a.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/24800834/-/ppu015b.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/24800834/-/ppu015b.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[{"id":5063,"name":"MIDNIGHT EXPRESS","permalink":"midnight-express","url":"/artist/midnight-express"},{"id":8740,"name":"TRI-FIRE","permalink":"tri-fire","url":"/artist/tri-fire"}],"categories":[{"id":166538,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"},{"id":238539,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]},{"id":182801,"name":"TF-693 MIDNIGHT EXPRESS / DANGER ZONE 12\"","permalink":"tf-693-midnight-express-danger-zone-12","position":83,"price":11.99,"default_price":11.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tf-693-midnight-express-danger-zone-12","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-11-12T15:37:01.000Z","description":"<p>&quot;The best 80s funk group you have never heard of...&quot;<br />\r\n</p>\r\n<p />\r\n<p style=\"padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;\">&quot;Possibly the greatest boogie discovery in the last decade..&quot;</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;\">Includes Long Version EDIT by Andrew Morgan, Original Version,&nbsp;Instrumental Edit by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://superiorelevation.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;\">Tom Noble,</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;\"><br style=\"padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;\" />\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;\"><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;\"><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;\">TF -693 &nbsp; &nbsp;  &quot;<a href=\"http://ppudc.com/ppu/tf693.mp3\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;\">Danger Zone&quot; (Listen)</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","options":[{"id":823645,"name":"Default","price":11.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1203582/-/trifire.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1203582/-/trifire.jpg","width":300,"height":305}],"artists":[{"id":5063,"name":"MIDNIGHT EXPRESS","permalink":"midnight-express","url":"/artist/midnight-express"}],"categories":[{"id":166538,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"}]},{"id":6091239,"name":"UKU KUUT / VISION OF ESTONIA / CD with bonus tracks COOL M ","permalink":"uku-kuut-vision-of-estonia-cd-with-bonus-tracks-cool-m","position":84,"price":7.99,"default_price":7.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/uku-kuut-vision-of-estonia-cd-with-bonus-tracks-cool-m","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-05-03T04:03:23.000Z","description":"UKU KUUT \"Vision Of Estonia\" PPU-034 CD\r\n\r\nWritten and recorded at UKU's home studio in Los Angeles and Stockholm between 1982 & 1989.

At that time Danan was hanging around the Recording Institute of Detroit where Juan Atkins was training in production. Danan was interested in Atkin's style of dance music and quickly recorded \"Go Bananas\" (soon the be re-released on PPU records). Bananas was released locally on Southern Sun Records in hyper limited quantity, it is today one of the most sought after underground detroit techno recordings of all time. Only a year later Danan would find himself back at the Recording Institute working with Orlando Cash on his second release \"Psycho For Your Love\".

Poet, Actor, Producer, Singer, Professional Boxer, the multi-talented Kurtis Scott does it all. While working on the re-release of \"Get Up And Dance\", Kurtis mailed me a tape of his script from the biopic \"T. Lewis Stone\" the story of Kurtis Scott's boxing career.  The tape plays for about 30 minutes and it's just Kurtis talking describing the scenes and acting some of the parts.. During the workout training montage the music \"Uncrowned Champion\" is playing in the background, on the tape Kurtis begins to improvise over the organ instrumental.. That is the origin of this recording, and most likely it was recorded with a hand held tape recorder or boombox, if you listen close you can hear Kurtis shuffling to the music in the background.. That being said I make no apologies for the sound quality because this song is phenomenal and having it available for all to hear is enough for me.
