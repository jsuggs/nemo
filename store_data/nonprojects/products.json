It is a warm and inviting, yet ever far reaching work that yearns to find itself somewhere in the interstices of these aforementioned opposing spheres journeyed every day. \r\n \r\nA natural pairing from the beginning, the work of Ana and Ryan (whom are both currently PHD candidates in Psychology and Neuroscience, respectively) has produced nothing but stellar results in the form of collaborations - the debut self-titled Asura record and Ana’s breakout debut album, 'Basic Climb' (both 2010, Non Projects). Ryan’s production of African influenced percussion and modern synthesizer and textural workings twist, turn and meld with Ana’s unique and sumptuous vocals with a logic all it’s own. Carrying the listener with each track from start to finish is a testament to York’s skills as an experienced jazz bassist and improvising cellist who has most recently, and notably, lent his bowing skills to the also idiosyncratic vocals of Zola Jesus ('Conatus,' Sacred Bones, 2011). Gold and Soil's backbone is production from a musician who understands the very nature of how improvisation and composition combine to create wholes bigger than the sums of their parts. \r\n \r\nThe words that Ana so elegantly and effortlessly sing resonate and invoke a wide range of personal emotions. Topics vary immensely including the current and turbulent political climate of Iran - the place of Ana’s family origin and the inspiration for “Pure Place.” Elsewhere, as Ana describes it, “the depths of wild childish play that grown adults can only fully experience in the context of giddy love” set the vocal beds for “Alone.” The digging down into one’s personal history charges the deeply moving ambient motion of “Selloana,” a re-contextualization of a found haiku written by Ana’s mother – a search for her child within. It is this search for the hidden joys beneath our surfaces that is the impetus for the music of Gold and Soil and it moves us all time and time again.\r\n \r\n\"Vulnerable child, I want to find you again.

While sharing similar stripped down recording approaches to the companion ‘Acquiescence’ EP, the music of ‘Inner Hue’ is an entirely different journey. With ‘Acquiescence’, the source material of grand piano and tenor saxophone remain fairly transparent, letting the instruments themselves tell the story, but with ‘Inner Hue’ Brian goes far deeper inside of the notes and takes the instrumentation of Rhodes piano and tenor saxophone into entirely new territories, coaxing nuanced textures and sounds with distinctive vocabulary unique to each track. An album that moves with sonic intent and abstract narrative, ‘Inner Hue’ naturally demands listening from start to finish, always revealing new paths with each play. This is personal, patient and thoughtful music to live inside of, or rather the music that lives inside of us, aching to get out.\r\n \r\nThroughout ‘Inner Hue’, the sound of electric piano timbres remain prevalent - raw, elegant and crystallized into time, lucid tone colors embossed onto a tangible spectral audio field. Seductive and ruminating melodies run rampant, in shifting counterpoint with luxuriant, ageless textures, always with a corporeal melodic yearning. Sometimes physical and upfront, as when the saxophones roar over sturdy, cracking drums in “Murmurs” and layers of Rhodes build and amalgamate with double time percussive syncopations on the title track, or patiently ebbing and flowing through space on tracks like “Embers” and opener “Eighty-Four,” the timeless music of ‘Inner Hue’ is communicated with a unique and individualized finesse so rarely heard these days. A testament to Brian’s both formal and informal studies of composition over many years, ‘Inner Hue’ advances with a unique cinematic tension in the most organic of ways, coming to a harmonious close with “Entwine”, a highly visual piece of lullaby like high notes, raw bass tones, studied counterpoint and delicate ambience. An artist obsessed with building his own voice, no matter what palate he chooses, Anenon’s ‘Inner Hue’ truly marks only the beginning of a long and idiosyncratic life of music ahead. \r\n \r\nA\r\n1.

Whereas The Destroyer, a collection of Justin’s earlier work, dealt in dizzying cut and paste compositional techniques and songs with short run-times, Daizo, his full-length debut, takes us on an excursion of much greater distance. The same acute attention to sonic detail remains, however Daizo tracks take advantage of the long player format with songs stretching to upwards of eight minutes. Also, ‘Daizo’ ups the live performance quotient as well with vividly and wildly arranged instrumentation – most notably drums and percussion that carry a strong undercurrent throughout the album.\r\n\r\nDaizo is named after Justin’s grandfather and is an exploration in Music as genetics. It is a dedication to his ancestors that lived during the Great Depression era, yet maintains a celebratory and reflective vibe throughout. As Justin puts it, the idea is “of families of songs that share similar traits. Certain elements are directly sampled from other places on the album or share themes even if they are manipulated or mutated to different extents.” Right off the bat, Sister songs “Running Tangles” and “Mt Weather” are obvious examples of this, entirely different tracks that are culled from the same drum tracking sessions.\r\n\r\nAs with The Destroyer and most of RareBit’s work, Justin plays more of a conductor and composer role with several different musicians playing on the album and sounds being recorded on many different devices, in different places. As both a visual artist and a sonic illustrator, Justin is able to display a huge array of colors and feels in his music, all while keeping everything completely coherent. Ranging from the free jazz meets elegant electronics of “Convergence”, the subtle yet devastating poly-rhythms of “Mt Weather”, the loud and budding, yet impossible to ignore cries of “Phantom Wall” and exceedingly swift lines and contours of “Emergence”, ‘Daizo’ portrays a sculptor thinking deeply about his art, yet always moving forward with instinct.\r\n\r\n \r\nA\r\n1.

High quality 45 RPM pressing. Jackets hand pressed in Topanga Canyon, CA.\r\n\r\n'If I Am This Forest' marks the welcome return of Ryan York to Non Projects in the form of a surprise EP. While currently at work on both a proper follow-up to 2010’s Asura full-length and an album of experimental electronic pop with Ana Caravelle under the Gold and Soil moniker, Ryan has also been keeping busy with a one off cassette release for Matthewdavid’s Leaving Records and playing strings on Zola Jesus’ new record. With 'If I Am This Forest', Non Projects documents York diving much deeper into the pop inklings that have been hinted at in his previous work, combined with his unparalleled sense of immersive arrangement and texture. \r\n\r\nAn ode to Ryan’s current home deep in Topanga Canyon, California, the title track swiftly gets things started as Ryan croons “If I Am This Forest” on top of a vaguely familiar repeating pop chorale. Vocals and tones swell as the song blissfully and hypnotically drives forward, melding dynamic video game arpeggios with lushly organic vocal and instrumental textures. “Sea Water” is a meditative rhythmic journey turned searing percussion jam while “As The Darkness (After the Crash)” finds York in his most upfront pop scenario yet, complete with rich harmonic vocal arrangements, bouncy guitar punches and exuberantly skittering percussion. “Me and You” closes out the set with tinkling synths, lurching drums and playfully pitched vocal manipulations. A resident (along with Teebs) at the Alpha Pup presented monthly Futura, Ryan has used the regular concert as grounds for his constantly evolving forays into both electronic and acoustic experimentation.

There's a huge number of elements immersed in 'Foam on the Waves of Space-Time', displaying a keen understanding of advanced musical languages from astral jazz to tape music, pop and classic 20th century drone minimalism, referencing the likes of Aphex, Stockhausen and Gas. Guiding us from ebbing techno pulses in 'Supreme Sunlight' through 'Tactility Of Time's cosmic chaos, to lushly unique rhythm programming in 'The Softest Shade of Purple of a Powdery Hue' and OPN-esque synthdrone on 'Basho', A.D.L.R makes a very memorable first impression.

The five tracks of 'Silver Trees' capture LA's Asura drifting from electro etched Panda Bear inflections to brooding pop ambient via woozy beatless threads and more hyper junglist IDM structures. Anenon's 'Damiel' comes from the very outer edges of the cosmic electronic hiphop vibe, swirling with astral goodness and flecked with exotic sub-continental percussion. 'Damiel' itself is a glistening hyper-melodic IDM construct and 'Retold Endless' flickers between freeform jazz drumming and deeply padded electro surges.
