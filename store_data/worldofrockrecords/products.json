COMING EARLY 2014!</B>\r\n\r\nWorld of Rock Records is really happy to announce the upcoming limited edition pressing of “Applejack” by Australian band The Triangles on yellow seven-inch vinyl.\r\n\r\nReigning all the way from Melbourne, Australia, The Triangles have made quite a name for themselves in a short time. After releasing the album Magic Johnson in 2005 and spawning the regional hit “Applejack”, the band has reached the top of the Spanish iTunes Charts with the single a few years later, as well as peaking at No. 8 on the CD singles chart.\r\n\r\nThe New Jersey beach bums that we are, we really love the song Applejack and have enlisted its feel-good vibes in all of our future summer playlists to come. We got in touch with The Triangles and asked them if we can put it out on vinyl for them. Guess what they said?\r\n\r\nBundled with “Applejack” will be The Triangles’ classic “Let’s Replace The Cityscapes”, and each copy will be numbered by hand with its number etched right into the pressing. We hope only the biggest The Triangles and “Applejack” fans manage to grab a copy of this before they disappear!\r\n\r\nIn sunshine yellow with iconic band imagery and limited to only one hundred units, “Applejack” by The Triangles will be begging for a play or two as soon as the weather gets a little warmer.\r\n\r\n\"Raaiiise ya hands and sing it with me…\"\r\n\r\nHear “Applejack” by The Triangles from the upcoming limited edition 7” vinyl, click <a href=\"http://www.soundcloud.com/the-triangles/applejack\" target=\"_blank\"><b>here</b></a>!\r\n\r\nFollow World of Rock Records on Facebook for a steady stream of news updates by clicking <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/worldofrockrecords\" target=\"_blank\"><b>here</b></a>!\r\n\r\nJoin the WORR mailing list to get news delivered directly to your inbox by clicking <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/BYWVT\" target=\"_blank\"><b>here</b></a>!","options":[{"id":48519579,"name":"Default","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127886013/-/announcement.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127886013/-/announcement.png","width":559,"height":559}],"artists":[{"id":251202,"name":"The Triangles","permalink":"the-triangles","url":"/artist/the-triangles"}],"categories":[{"id":6059853,"name":"Vinyl Singles (7\")","permalink":"vinyl-singles-7","url":"/category/vinyl-singles-7"}]},{"id":13135596,"name":"Foreign Objects \"Test It Out\" Limited Edition 7\" Vinyl (ultra-clear)","permalink":"pre-order-test-it-out-limited-edition-vinyl-single-clear","position":4,"price":17.0,"default_price":17.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pre-order-test-it-out-limited-edition-vinyl-single-clear","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-08-23T19:23:18.000Z","description":"<B>RIGHT NOW: <I>Enjoy only $1 extra shipping for all US orders of 2 or more copies!!!

Back in 2003, the Foreign Objects album \"Universal Culture Shock\" was released, cementing its place in the hearts of progressive rock and metal fans around the world.\r\n\r\nNow, Distant Recordings and World of Rock Records are teaming up to bring you the Universal Culture Shock 7\" vinyl box set, comprised of each song from the UCS album bundled with an assortment of rarely/never-before-heard demo tracks, alternate versions, and more!\r\n\r\nWe are pressing one song from the album at a time to allow collectors to snag each one before they run out! By the end of the series, very little complete sets will exist, and each person that has purchased each set will have the opportunity to get a Foreign Objects collector's box to store and display their records in!\r\n\r\nIn a rare edition of only 250 with 125 in green and the other 125 clear, these iconic Foreign Objects 7\" 45rpm vinyl singles (bundled with brand new artwork by illustrator Michal Brodka and a new acoustic rendition of \"Victory Over Neptune\" as the B-side) are the first of the set to be pressed. They are going quick, and are meant to be held in the hands of only Foreign Objects and CKY Ålliance elite. Each copy is etched by hand with its number and the Square Root of Pi logo that dons the cover of each Foreign Objects release prior.\r\n\r\nThe clear copies are available exclusively through us, while the green copies are only available from Deron Miller's store, right <A HREF=\"http://ckyrockandmetal.bigcartel.com\" target=\"_blank\"><b>here</b></a>!\r\n\r\nShips within 7 business days.
