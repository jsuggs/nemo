That's just bad form.\r\n\r\nPrinted on a white 100% Gildan tee, which you will love more than you love your Ducks.

To be fair, I don't know if that is fast or not, but the point is that he can move.\r\n\r\nWhat will the DAT Shirt do for you? It will make you look cool. Things that it absolutely will NOT do are: make you fast; make you have a cool accent; make you Snoop Dogg's godson; make you a hit with the ladies; make you De'Anthony Thomas. Unless you are De'Anthony Thomas, in which case all the things I mentioned are already true for you, so the shirt will just be the icing on the cake.\r\n\r\nThe DAT Shirt is a green 100% cotton Gildan tee with yellow ink.","options":[{"id":28603775,"name":"Men&#x27;s Small","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28603778,"name":"Men&#x27;s Medium","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28603781,"name":"Men&#x27;s Large","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28603784,"name":"Men&#x27;s XL","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28603787,"name":"Men&#x27;s 2XL","price":17.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":28603790,"name":"Men&#x27;s 3XL","price":17.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.99,"amount_with_others":0.99,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.99,"amount_with_others":9.99}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89706086/-/DAT_Number_6_Resized.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89706086/-/DAT_Number_6_Resized.png","width":975,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4486235,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"},{"id":4494080,"name":"Oregon Ducks","permalink":"oregon-ducks","url":"/category/oregon-ducks"}]},{"id":9129872,"name":"T-Rex Ice Cream Truck Freezer Friday Shirt","permalink":"t-rex-ice-cream-truck-freezer-friday-shirt","position":3,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/t-rex-ice-cream-truck-freezer-friday-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-25T05:36:20.000Z","description":"Charlie Layton T-Rex Ice Cream Shirt- You probably caught this on <a title=\"Charlie''s Reddit Exposure\" href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/15w94c/i_see_your_whiteboard_drawings_and_raise_you/\" target=\"_blank\">Reddit</a> or <a title=\"Charlie''s Huffington Post Story\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/03/charlie-layton-freezer-art_n_2405005.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Huffington Post</a>, but if not, here's the scoop (pun very much intended):\r\n\r\nCharlie, a freelance illustrator in Pennsylvania, realized that the surface of his freezer is essentially a dry-erase board.
