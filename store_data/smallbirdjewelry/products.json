The silver content in these Hill Tribes silver beads is typically higher than sterling and they possess a lovely handmade quality. \r\n\r\nThe horseshoe shaped earwires are sterling silver and have been handformed and hammered to keep the silver beads from sliding off and to help them stay put in your earlobes. (A pair of clear plastic earring backs will also be included. You may wish to wear them to keep the earrings extra secure.) These earrings are .75\" in length and so light and comfortable that you'll want to wear them every day.","options":[{"id":1242577,"name":"Default","price":24.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2270917/-/horseshoesilver01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2270917/-/horseshoesilver01.jpg","width":864,"height":864},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2270925/-/horseshoesilver02.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2270925/-/horseshoesilver02.jpg","width":864,"height":864},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2270933/-/horseshoesilver03.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2270933/-/horseshoesilver03.jpg","width":864,"height":864}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":181189,"name":"earrings","permalink":"earrings","url":"/category/earrings"}]},{"id":283557,"name":"Ametrine Nugget Bracelet","permalink":"ametrine-nugget-bracelet","position":77,"price":46.0,"default_price":46.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ametrine-nugget-bracelet","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-04-23T05:54:30.000Z","description":"The focal point of this unique bracelet is a pair of beautiful ametrine gemtones which sparkle in hues of lavender and golden yellow.
