The mass produced chocolate memento will be accessible to celebrity exes at the 85th Academy Awards on February 24, 2013.\r\n\r\n“The ‘Banana Split’ will only exist as a print,” said XVALA.  “Consumption is the art, and it should be divine…and mass produced.”\r\n\r\n“We are currently working with several network channels on distributing interests of making celebrity consumption of failed relationships a fine art in chocolate form,” said Cory Allen.  “Hopefully this will help promote the bad tastes of our culture.”","options":[{"id":22874349,"name":"Default","price":125.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70834111/-/Banana1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70834111/-/Banana1.jpg","width":1000,"height":660},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70834239/-/Banana2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70834239/-/Banana2.jpg","width":1000,"height":634},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70834343/-/422927_350614401686363_1250185880_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70834343/-/422927_350614401686363_1250185880_n.jpg","width":612,"height":612}],"artists":[{"id":111635,"name":"XVALA","permalink":"xvala","url":"/artist/xvala"}],"categories":[{"id":2515529,"name":"Editions","permalink":"editions","url":"/category/editions"}]},{"id":6492259,"name":"Ryan McIntosh - \"Paintings For A Group Show, 2012\" - Acrylic on Canvas - 30\"x30\" - Edition of 10","permalink":"ryan-mcintosh-paintings-for-a-group-show-2012-acrylic-on-canvas-30-x30-edition-of-10","position":7,"price":450.0,"default_price":450.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ryan-mcintosh-paintings-for-a-group-show-2012-acrylic-on-canvas-30-x30-edition-of-10","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-19T22:29:09.000Z","description":"ARTIST - Ryan McIntosh\r\n\r\nTITLE - \"Paintings For A Group Show #1-5, 2012\" \r\n\r\nMEDIUM - Two-color screen print on raw canvas, stretched over high-quality wooden stretcher bars.\r\n\r\nSIZE - 30\"x30\"\r\n\r\nPRINT EDITION - 10 each.\r\n\r\nSigned, numbered, titled and dated on the rear by the artist.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE - When ordering, please specify which version of the painting you wish to purchase.
