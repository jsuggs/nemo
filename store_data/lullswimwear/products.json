This can definitely be worn out of the water!\r\n\r\nFANS PRINT: Set on a background of mother of pearl and gold leaf, this design has the softest pallet of colours in the collection. I wanted to bring dragonfly’s and fans into the range and in this design we managed to bring both of these quintessentially Japanese images into one design. This piece of artwork is delicate both in its gentle illustration and gorgeous pastel colours. I added beautiful Persian Crimson ties here to bring out the highlights in the fans in the image. A really feminine top, this print looks particularly good on girls with lovely pale delicate skin type.\r\n\r\nOther pieces in the collection that match beautifully with this top are the cheeky pants with gathered sides either in the Fans Print or the Silvery Blue. \r\n\r\n***The Halter neck tankini comes in sizes 8 thru to 16 for all shapes and sizes...please just indicate on the purchase page the size you require.

The maple leaf is just such a stunning image, invoking wonderful autumn colours and memories. My love for Japanese art and textiles is really epitomised in the image of the maple leaf and I couldn’t go past it when I first was looking for inspiration for my collection. The black background is of course timeless, classic and suits so many skin types and body shapes. A sexy and minimal design.\r\n\r\n***The Ring tankini comes in sizes 8 thru to 16 for all shapes and sizes...please just indicate on the purchase page the size you require.

I wanted to bring dragonfly’s and fans into the range and in this design we managed to bring both of these quintessentially Japanese images into one design. This piece of artwork is delicate both in its gentle illustration and gorgeous pastel colours. I added beautiful Persian Crimson ties here to bring out the highlights in the fans in the image. A really feminine top, this print looks particularly good on girls with lovely pale delicate skin type.\r\n\r\n............\r\n\r\nInspired by the delicate intricacy of nature found within Kimono and obi design, Lull's unique prints are created in-house, combining photography, hand-drawn sketches and digital graphics.
