Pittsburgh is named for William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. The three circles represent bezants, or coins, to commend the Chatham Family’s involvement in the Crusades. Local history tells an engraver mistook “bezants” for “pheasants” and placed birds inside the gold circles. The city walls are the traditional heraldic sign of a city and were added to the coat of arms as a crown.","options":[{"id":4055351,"name":"xs","price":24.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35163390/-/crest_c.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35163390/-/crest_c.jpg","width":891,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":589111,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]}]
