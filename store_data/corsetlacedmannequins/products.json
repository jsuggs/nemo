They match the colour of her cloth perfectly and cover up some of the damage, whilst adding some wonderful texture to her.  \r\n\r\nThe papier mache body is completely sound and intact. The stand is a beautiful warm hazel colour which has had some dreaded woodworm damage but these have been treated to be on the safe side.   I believe she dates from around the the 1930s. \r\n\r\nShe measures app 39\" bust, 30\" waist & 43\" hips\r\n\r\nShe is listed for sale on Ebay with a starting bid of just Â£4.99!

I love the colours and textures of old grain sacks and this one has some lovely detail. There are a number of original darns/mends to the fabric which add to the overall vintage industrial feel and the stenciling is simply awesome!  \r\n\r\nThe sack has been washed and tailored to fit a NEW, size 10/12, mannequin.

you have fabric that you would like me to use to tailor a mannequin with, please order her here. \r\n\r\nPlease contact me first to discuss the fabric type/suitability, however, generally speaking, for a small patterned, medium weight cotton/linen fabric I would need 1.25metres of 140cm wide fabric. \r\n\r\nLarger quantities are required for larger and or symmetrical patterns where matching up is required.  \r\n\r\nLightweight cottons are not suitable.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":12451584,"name":"beech

been asked several times for a more personalised mannequin. So where best to start than with my own logo. It's really lovely to have a mannequin tailored in fabric with my company name on it. Obviously completely useless to anyone else but I love it!\r\nI think it works beautifully for my company and I'm sure it will look great for yours too.  The design can be larger, smaller, coloured, patterned etc etc...the options are endless. All I need from you is your logo or idea and I'll do the rest, providing you with a proof before you commit.  Of course my mannequin had to have a corset and laced back finish but you could choose to have a hand finished side seam.\r\n\r\nYOUR CHOICES - please let me know at checkout which of the following you would prefer. \r\n\r\n-The finish at the back - corset laced or flat backed\r\n-The size - 10/12 or 8/10\r\n\r\nYour mannequin will be made to order so please expect to wait up to 28 days for delivery, longer if international.","options":[{"id":12338164,"name":"beech stand","price":205.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12338166,"name":"cream stand","price":222.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":12338168,"name":"black stand","price":222.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":16997061,"name":"white stand","price":222.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":100.0,"amount_with_others":30.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":65.0,"amount_with_others":30.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":18.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":18.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":99.0,"amount_with_others":50.0,"country":{"id":18,"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HK"}},{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":18.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":18.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":12.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":60.0,"amount_with_others":30.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49279525/-/il_570xN_211689352500logo.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49279525/-/il_570xN_211689352500logo.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35798314/-/il_570xN_211689716.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35798314/-/il_570xN_211689716.jpg","width":570,"height":756},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35798298/-/il_570xN_211689446.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35798298/-/il_570xN_211689446.jpg","width":570,"height":686},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35798282/-/il_570xN_211689248.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35798282/-/il_570xN_211689248.jpg","width":570,"height":701},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41132013/-/henry2.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41132013/-/henry2.JPG","width":780,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2046242,"name":"Male & Child","permalink":"male-child","url":"/category/male-child"},{"id":2046240,"name":"Contemporary & Other","permalink":"contemporary-other","url":"/category/contemporary-other"}]}]
