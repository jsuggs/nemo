I have hand sewn 3 soft blue roses and added a trim to finish the look. Her dress is fashioned from a vintage blue and white scarf (which still has the original tiny little tag on it which reads 'rain repellant') I think it just adds a little touch. Hand sewn detail of a feather like braid around top of the dress and a little ribbon choker.\r\nA small heart button and ribbon around her wrist. Her hand sewn features give her an air of dreamy contentment. Made as a decor piece or a keepsake she is not suitable for babies or young children. Ready and waiting for a place to sit and dream!
