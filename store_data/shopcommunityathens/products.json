The medium of jewelry design truly fuels Chelsea's\r\nappetite of curiosity, wonder, and fascination. \r\n\r\nThis falcon talon necklace is a unique piece made using the lost wax process. Chelsea took a mold of a real falcon talon and used it to create a wax mold. She then injects molten bronze into the mold to creat the metal talon. After the metal has been cast, it must be cleaned, filed, sanded, soldered, and polished creating the intricate and beautiful earring. The talon is hung from a 14 KT, yellow gold filled, lever back ear wire.\r\n\r\nTake a bit of nature with you wherever you go with Chelsea's original piece of wearable art.
