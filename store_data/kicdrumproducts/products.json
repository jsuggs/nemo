Witnesses saw him leaving his <a href=\"http://voices.yahoo.com/north-philly-most-dangerous-neighborhood-philadelphia-5262511.html\" target=\"_blank\">North Philly</a> residence around 7pm, smoking a cigarette of the menthol variety. He was wearing camouflage, baggy cargo pants, black Nikes, a KicDrum Products tee shirt, and a KicDrum Products <a href=\"http://www.kicdrumproducts.com/product/kdp-transformer-scratch-5-panel\" target=\"_blank\">Transformer</a> five-panel hat. Walt was reportedly traveling by foot to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olney_Transportation_Center\" target=\"_blank\">Olney transportation center</a> to head to his show. He never made his performance.\r\n\r\nThe people from the neighborhood whisper that Walt’s disappearance could be the work of any number of foes. The manner in which Walt Sicknin’ often dispersed his competition left many thinking that some “crazy, weak-ass-rapper” would kidnap Walt and hold him ransom for the teachings of his secret style many years ago; though this fate appeared destined to elude Walt Sicknin’ until recently. Now the myth who’s legend floats through Philly streets like a ghost trapped between worlds is missing, and fear and disappointment grow both inside and outside of the community.\r\n\r\nThe only evidence collected by inspectors, was a vinyl EP record, found just minutes from Olney Ave. and Broad St. Although the police have been generally mum on the contents of the record, sources have leaked that the material is the hardest rap music to come out of Philadelphia since the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tuffcrew\" target=\"_blank\">Tuff Crew</a>. My sources have confirmed that the six track EP is scored by the Philly area underground conductors Drumz & Llingo and features a special, exclusive bonus track produced by the one and only <a href=\"http://www.dabeatminerz.com/\" target=\"blank\">DA BEATMINERZ</a>. Walt drops a “treasure chest of gems on folk,” according to another person who has been privy to the records contents—which only makes investigators job more perilous, considering the “envy of his rap style makes every Philadelphia emcee/rapper an immediate suspect.\"\r\n\r\nThis morning on the streets of North Philadelphia, children, adults and elderly, could be heard throughout the neighborhoods asking passers by, “where’s Walt yo?” Thus, the search has begun.

The underside of the street has oozed from the depths that once contained it and it has refused to recede.  The shadows cast upon the block by the glimmering structures that tower over the city’s heart have begun to consume its source. Slowly making its way to the top floors, the once undaunted executive attempts to flee before being swallowed up by the fervor that is consuming the base.  Yet, he has nowhere to run, for he has already climbed the ladder to the top and now his journey can only lead down.  Those who rise-up burn the ink dyed parchment that litters the desktops and sign their name in ashes mixed with blood and sweat.   Prepare for <a href=\"http://kicdrumproducts.bandcamp.com/track/signature-time-tip-it-back-pt-ii\" target=\"_blank\">“Signature Time”</a>. \r\n\r\nScored by the SP1200 Titan’s: Gensu Dean and Drumz & Llingo.  KicDrum Products introduces their most recent 7’ series release, Signature Time (Tip it Back part II), the A-side produced by the Grand Imperial Gensu Dean--who's most recent work includes a long awaited link up with underground vet <a href=\"http://www.stonesthrow.com/store/12-inch/pbwolf/definition-of-ill-2\" target=\"_blank\">Planet Asia</a> on their new Abrasions LP--on Mello Music Group. The incredibly hard and funky beat features the acrobatic flow and lyrical styling’s of Drumz & Llingo’s Llingo Apt and introduces a new talent to the KDP team, Baltimore’s verbal assassin <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/shalaam\" target=\"_blank\">Kenobi</a> (the newest member of the KDP family). The triple threat of “Signature Time” is anchored by the “north Philly street mangler” himself, Walt Sicknin’ who’s microphone prowess electrifies the track and begs for a re-wind. \r\n\r\nThe B-side “Chamber Crack” (Sewer Mix) produced by Drumz & Llingo is an extremely dirty, grimy track that feels like it was actually created and recorded under North Broad St., although we can’t be sure.  Walt Sicknin’s original flow and unparalleled storytelling ability make “Chamber Crack” one of those tracks that remind you when hip-hop sounded like the blocks it came from. The modern day soundtrack to the North Philadelphia streets is being fleshed out right here on wax. This solo effort puts on notice all rappers who rep the street but whose product appeals to the club.  Most will not be shaking their ass to “Chamber Crack”, they will be shaking in their boots.  KicDrum Products continues to define the hard formidable sound long associated with underground hip-hop and Walt Sicknin's \"Signature Time\" B/W \"Chamber Crack\" only reinforces their ethic.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Side: SIGNATURE TIME\r\nfeaturing LLINGO APT and KENOBI \r\nproduced by <a href=\"http://www.mellomusicgroup.com/pages/gensu-dean\" target=\"_blank\">GENSU DEAN</a>\r\n\r\nRecorded/Mixed by GENSU DEAN and JIMI BOWMAN\r\nat <a href=\"http://www.klearlightstudio.com/wp/?page_id=9\" target=\"_blank\">KLEARLIGHT STUDIOS</a>  (Dallas, TX)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nB Side: CHAMBER CRACK (SEWER MIX)\r\nproduced by DRUMZ and LLINGO\r\nRecorded by DRUMZ and LLINGO\r\nMixed by DRUMAT!C and LORD DIO\r\nCuts/Scratches by DRUMAT!C\r\n\r\nEngineered and Mastered by John Fachet\r\nSilver Seven Series™\r\n\r\n300 Numbered,\r\nLimited Pressings\r\n\r\n120 Burgundy Blood Red\r\n180 Black\r\n\r\nSilver Metallic Ink\r\n18pt.

Ikou!\r\n\r\nLegend has it that the Golden one, Kintaro—later known as Sakata no Kintoki—did not wear headgear. But if he had, this KDP style \"Kabuto\" would surely have been his first choice. The mysterious fabric, like Kintaro, is from the wilderness of Mt. Kintoki, designed and woven by a Yama-uba (witch). The material has a mythical strength and the wearer of the object, is temporarily endowed with the attributes of the Japanese mythical warrior known as the “Kogane No Senshi”—or so it is whispered amongst the peasants whom work the land in the foothills of Mt. Kintoki. How KDP has obtained pieces of this fabric is of little importance; rather, we are making it available to you for a limited time in the form of our mystic five panel collection. \r\n<FONT COLOR=\"#CC3333\">\r\n<STRONG>LIMITED EDITION</STRONG>\r\n24 Units Only (Will never be reissued)</FONT>\r\n\r\nImported Fabric from Japan\r\nBlack Japanese Armor Visor\r\nSilver Stitched Woven Label\r\nAdjustable Velcro Strap\r\nCustom Engraved KDP Badge\r\nMade In USA\r\n\r\nUnique fit and finish\r\nONE SIZE FITS MOST","options":[{"id":28743743,"name":"Default","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.75,"amount_with_others":8.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90197246/-/KDP-5-Panel-Gold-Kogane-01-web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90197246/-/KDP-5-Panel-Gold-Kogane-01-web.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114322290/-/Emily-GoldenWarrior-1-2013-web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114322290/-/Emily-GoldenWarrior-1-2013-web.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114028206/-/Emily-Red-FoodOne-GoldenWarrior-Vinyls.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114028206/-/Emily-Red-FoodOne-GoldenWarrior-Vinyls.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/113570088/-/golden-warrior-web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/113570088/-/golden-warrior-web.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91809422/-/KDP-GOLDENWARRIOR-WOODS.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91809422/-/KDP-GOLDENWARRIOR-WOODS.jpg","width":750,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4728236,"name":"Five Panels","permalink":"five-panels","url":"/category/five-panels"}]},{"id":12413442,"name":"FORMULATIN' FATHERS LE TAPE","permalink":"kdp-lost-records-formulatin-fathers","position":16,"price":13.0,"default_price":13.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kdp-lost-records-formulatin-fathers","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-07-17T05:31:09.000Z","description":"<FONT COLOR=\"#CC3333\">NOW SHIPPING!</FONT>\r\n\r\nKicDrum Products and <a href=\"http://www.lostrecords.bigcartel.com\" target=\"_blank\">LOST RECORDS, TX</a> exclusive collaborative cassette tape release, Formulatin' Fathers - 'Sleepless Knights'.

Certified by E-mu Systems, this book celebrates 40 years of the SP-1200.\r\n\r\n\"In the chapters to come, PBODY will guide you through the world of the SP1200, its history, its underlying technology, and both conventional and unconventional techniques for making music with it. I am personally honored to have played a key role in creating such a time-honored instrument, and I must confess how delightful it has been to have a chance to pour over the schematics again and recall the whole design experience.

'BlakMarket', the duo's first full length LP, mixes the gritty sounds of the North East corridor (ala DITC) with the melodic, heavy bass laden sound reminiscent of the Dirty South's Organized Noize, all while supplied by their \"weapon of choice\" the E-MU SP1200. LLINGO APT - the duo's emcee and front man - provides a style quite versatile and unique as he paints the brains of listeners with images from topics as complex as imperialism and colonialization of the mind, to stories detailing after school \"Friday Night\" escapades; all the way to a step-by-step instructional about \"making a beat.\" Flow as well as production is woven seamlessly as LLINGO spins from topic to topic, keeping your brain as well as your feet moving. The supporting cast of exquisite emcees hailing from New York, Rhode Island and Philadelphia peppered throughout the album, act as palate cleansers, preparing the listener for each new dish cooked and served by the beat smith duo - sure to be feeding fans ear holes with organic analog meals for years to come.\r\n\r\nFormat: CD\r\nOriginal Qty: 200\r\nReleased: December 12th, 2008\r\n© KicDrum Products, LLC\r\n\r\nLyrics: Llingo Apt\r\nBeats/Cuts: Drumz and Llingo\r\nMixed/Recorded: South Philadelphia, PA\r\n\r\nFeatures: Dface, Doam, Calamity Chris, NeedNotWorry, Bamboo, Wise Dome, Ikan\r\n\r\nOUT OF PRINT\r\nSEALED COPY\r\nULTRA RARE\r\nMADE IN USA\r\nE-mu SP-1200 / EMAX 1\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"135\" height=\"65\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/-zpI9u7yVn8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","options":[{"id":29976691,"name":"Default","price":35.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94165739/-/drumandllingo-cd-front-web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94165739/-/drumandllingo-cd-front-web.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94165771/-/drumandllingo-cd-back-web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94165771/-/drumandllingo-cd-back-web.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94166443/-/drumandllingo-cd-side1-WEB.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94166443/-/drumandllingo-cd-side1-WEB.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94166435/-/drumandllingo-cd-side2-WEB.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94166435/-/drumandllingo-cd-side2-WEB.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94166535/-/drumandllingo-cd-open-web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94166535/-/drumandllingo-cd-open-web.jpg","width":750,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4678485,"name":"CD's","permalink":"cd-s","url":"/category/cd-s"}]},{"id":8136126,"name":"KDP WS FLIP SNAP 2012","permalink":"kdp-ws-flip-snap-2012","position":38,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kdp-ws-flip-snap-2012","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-22T11:17:38.000Z","description":"Venomous.

The roundness of the drum meets the crossing of the stick.  The flame from the match ignites the BOOM from the wick. Drumz & Llingo’s Philly sound meets a New York trio with unmatched wits.  KDP proudly introduces, Lewis Parker: UK native, SP technician, emcee extraordinaire with the golden sound.  T.R.A.C: Flow artisan, boom bap blesser and Koncrete Jungle repper. John Robinson: The Linguistic surgeon, operating with scientific precision.\r\n\r\nIndividually dynamic and collectively triumphant, John Robinson, TRAC and Lewis Parker display a unique ability to come together and murder an absolutely meddlesome beat.  The emcees provide unique and different styles while at the same time maintaining a cohesion rarely seen by actual multiple emcee rap groups.  While not a group themselves, these individually accomplished emcees, have worked together in the past.  Yet it is worthy to note that John Robinson, (previously known as Lil’ Sci from Scienz of Life) is reuniting with Lewis parker for the first time since their successful International Summers colab in 2010.  \r\n\r\nThe A side of this record is as hard as it gets.  Drumz & Llingo continue to define the modern rugged east coast sound, and also show producers what a remix should sound like; via a B side that sounds like an entirely different song, that is equally as good as the original, but flipped on its head with a totally different feel.  Learn from this.  This is what a remix should be.  KDP strikes gold again, this time with the help of Lewis Parker, TRAC and John Robinson.\r\n\r\nTic-Tac-Toe that's three in a row... lets go \r\n\r\nGame over.\r\n\r\nTIC-TAC-TOE - Vocal \r\nfeat.

The KicDrum Products beat team known for their unique SP-1200 production and hard, grimy underground sound, solidified their fast growing reputation as Philly’s go-to-production-duo on KDP’s latest Silver Seven Series™ release “Bar Buryin”,featuring two of Pittsburgh’s finest <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JonQuest412\" target=\"_blank\">Jon Quest</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jamarhubb\" target=\"_blank\">Hubbs</a>.\r\n\r\nWith terribly mean bass and drums that hit harder than a Mike Tyson hook, Llingo and Drumat!c have created a beat that is a legitimate head-banger, and could be the roughest track of the year. The Philly duo is consistent in their rugged approach to beat making and Bar Buryin’ does nothing but exemplify both their sound and style.\r\n\r\nPerfectly complimenting the Drumz & Llingo instrumental are the talented Pittsburgh emcees, Jon Quest and Hubbs. Hubbs starts off the track with a calm and stern flow that reflects his mid 90’s influences that include Biggie, Nas, Jay-Z, Wu-Tang and others, yet the style is all his own. Rapping clean up is Jon Quest. From P.H. he graduated, and was also nominated for Best Lyricist and Underground Artist during the 2009 Pittsburgh Hip Hop awards. Jon Quest has quickly made a name for himself and uniting with KDP has never sounded better. Perfectly in command, Jon Quest demands your attention; and you will give it because the production is amazing and the rap is top notch bar burying.\r\n\r\n<em>*Artwork subject to change.</em>\r\n\r\nSIDE A: VOCAL\r\nSIDE B: INSTRUMENTAL\r\n\r\nPRODUCED BY DRUMZ AND LLINGO \r\nMIXED BY DFACE \r\nMASTERED BY LEWIS PARKER\r\n\r\n200 Limited Pressings Total\r\n\r\nSilver Center Labels\r\nSilver Metallic Ink \r\n18pt.

Hunting Park, North Philadelphia flows through his veins. A grown man’s rapper…Walt is an emcee. With lyrical vengeance that strikes harder than the hammer of John Henry. His prowess and storytelling ability rival no one. Walt Sicknin’ is a street legend; a North Philadelphia myth since rhyming in Olney High lunch room back in ‘92, striking fear in the hearts of local emcees who dared to step.\r\n\r\nThe myth of Walt Sicknin grew for nearly ten years before emerging from the concrete of Broad Street, seeking refuge in the hard, gritty music of Drumz and Llingo.
