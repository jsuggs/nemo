While from an aerial photograph it may appear relatively level to anyone who has not had the pleasure of being there, the modern buildout has generally taken advantage of its varying elevations. Hilly terraces have become residential communities. Storied cliffs still surround the anchorage where its history began.” *</em>\r\n\r\nMejor Vista General: West of Del Prado explores the photographic power to embower the viewer in a displacing illusion - both in the realm of photography and bookmaking in general. The arch of the project is based on a stereoscopic view made by the artist which pictures a particular cove in Southern California. In order to create a seemingly comprehensive document of this pictured location, additional photographs were created from a myriad of angles, culled from a myriad of sources (from a myriad of time periods). The glut of resulting repetitious imagery at once extends the canvas of the original vantage point to the brink of immersion while dissolving it to the verge of absurdity.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>*Walker, Doris I.

They are everything about living except life, showing the effects of attention on a thing over time. <em>EXISTERS</em> harkens to all things slow, delicate, and sharp--music for drifters, onlookers, and aliens of the everyday. Following on 2011's <em>SHAPE TAPE</em>, which reduced music to pure harmonics--no concern for beginning, end, or time passing--lucky dragons begin the process of re-inserting the organic textures, playfully intricate handmade rhythms and repetitions that characterized their earlier work, such as 2008's <em>Dream Island Laughing Language</em> or 2006's <em>Widows</em>. By largely replacing the acoustic instrumentation and field-recorded sources of those records with the crackling pulse of modular synthesizer and alien sharpness of spectral processing, <em>EXISTERS</em> is both the wall and the push against it, a direct impression, a tribute to the boundary and how the boundary can be crossed.\r\n \r\n<b>About Lucky Dragons</b>\r\n \r\nLucky Dragons is an ongoing collaboration between Los Angeles-based artists Sarah Rara and Luke Fischbeck. Active as a band since 2000, they are known for their participatory approach to making music,  radically inclusive live shows, and their sprawling catalog of digital sounds crafted in playful humanism. They have presented performances and installations in a wide variety of contexts--including MOCA Los Angeles, The Smell, Smithsonian's Hirshorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Whitney Museum of American Art (as part of the 2008 Whitney Biennial), The 54th Venice Biennale,The Kitchen and PS1 in New York, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, REDCAT and LACMA in Los Angeles, Frankfurt's Schirn Kunsthalle, ICA London, ICA Philadelphia, and the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris.

Their first EP, \"Feral\" / \"Free\", was written in the summer of 2011. \r\n\r\nThe project began as a space of exchange between Hlebo and Hanson who began trading mix tapes in early 2011. The tracks that were sent were based on their use of phrasing, emotional space, texture, cadence and sonic quality. Following Hanson's move to New York, the project took shape as a free form collaboration with no discernible direction. \r\nUtilizing unformed W-H-I-T-E songs as a starting point, the two slowly built a new body of songs in the sweltering heat of the summer. The resulting album is one that is heavily influenced by D'Angelo, Brian Eno, Hot 97, Thelonious Monk, tall cans, Salem, Alan Lomax, the 'cool' of night, loud fans, and Gregorian chant. \r\n\r\nWhite Fold is a project presenting two visual artists' interpretation of these eclectic sources through self-conscious sounds. \r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nThe \"Feral\" / \"Free\" publication includes a unique download code for the EP.

The disorienting compositional space of the pictured flat planes inhibits the viewer to readily discern and give context to the objects presented. In these pictures, all efficiency, productivity, and elegance is in question ­ the mere fact that the desk is out of commission, being sold, points to an attendant deflation of these values.\r\n\r\nSCP009\r\nEdition of 1000\r\nB/W Offset on Newsprint\r\n5.5\"x8.5\"\r\nSaddle Stitched","options":[{"id":16365271,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":12.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49469315/-/PenelopeUmbricoDeskTrajectories-02.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49469315/-/PenelopeUmbricoDeskTrajectories-02.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49469323/-/PenelopeUmbricoDeskTrajectories-03.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49469323/-/PenelopeUmbricoDeskTrajectories-03.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49469331/-/PenelopeUmbricoDeskTrajectories-04.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49469331/-/PenelopeUmbricoDeskTrajectories-04.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49469339/-/PenelopeUmbricoDeskTrajectories-05.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49469339/-/PenelopeUmbricoDeskTrajectories-05.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49469299/-/PenelopeUmbricoDeskTrajectories-01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49469299/-/PenelopeUmbricoDeskTrajectories-01.jpg","width":1000,"height":667}],"artists":[{"id":43693,"name":"Penelope Umbrico","permalink":"penelope-umbrico","url":"/artist/penelope-umbrico"}],"categories":[{"id":309484,"name":"Publication","permalink":"publication","url":"/category/publication"}]},{"id":2314861,"name":"Sorrow | Jubilance Pt. 2: Nü Sensae/Okie Dokie","permalink":"sorrow-jubilance-pt-2-nü-sensae-okie-dokie","position":26,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sorrow-jubilance-pt-2-nü-sensae-okie-dokie","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-04-11T20:32:32.000Z","description":"THIS RECORD: \r\nNü Sensae's 'New Lies' is a journey into destruction and despair, reminiscent of the sounds a falling building.

like expansive celestial space sounds breaching the earth’s stratosphere and exploding, melting, and reforming as an ethereal yet grounded album, something to listen to in both caverns and cars.\r\n\r\nThe full album will be released as a CD in 2010 with Aagoo Records.    \r\nW-H-I-T-E is Cory Hanson, residing in Valencia, CA, has played with Magic Mountain, Blackagar Boltagon, Hellomynameischad, and yes, DEER. \r\nCory also recorded and produced OKIE DOKIE's untitled E.P.\r\nhttp://www.myspace.com/whitehorsesintechnicoloreverywhere\r\n","options":[{"id":2526631,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/12676711/-/WHITE-SUNNA_01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/12676711/-/WHITE-SUNNA_01.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/12676751/-/WHITE-SUNNA_02.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/12676751/-/WHITE-SUNNA_02.jpg","width":1000,"height":667}],"artists":[{"id":11111,"name":"W-H-I-T-E","permalink":"w-h-i-t-e","url":"/artist/w-h-i-t-e"}],"categories":[{"id":309482,"name":"Record","permalink":"record","url":"/category/record"}]},{"id":430347,"name":"_ Quarterly 03","permalink":"_-quarterly-03","position":30,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/_-quarterly-03","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-10-19T00:02:14.000Z","description":"In this issue of _ Quarterly, the selected artist create a world in which luxury is contested, or non-existent.\r\nDepression and lonliness become the main characters in this place we navigate.\r\n\r\nContributions from\r\nLemuel Barbour\r\nLeigha Mason\r\nCallie Barlow\r\nBryan Krueger\r\nJesse Hlebo\r\nSebastian Mlynarski\r\n\r\nAnd a musical contribution from Crime Novels (Ellery Widener Martin Samson)\r\n\r\n_ Quarterly No. 3\r\nBlack and White offset on newsprint\r\nLimited to 1000 copies\r\nIncludes a CD limited to 100 copies.","options":[{"id":1712041,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/6643711/-/issue_3_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/6643711/-/issue_3_1.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3560532/-/issue_3_5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3560532/-/issue_3_5.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3560536/-/issue_3_6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3560536/-/issue_3_6.jpg","width":1000,"height":667}],"artists":[{"id":9694,"name":"Bryan Krueger","permalink":"bryan-krueger","url":"/artist/bryan-krueger"},{"id":9695,"name":"Callie Barlow","permalink":"callie-barlow","url":"/artist/callie-barlow"},{"id":9693,"name":"Crime Novels","permalink":"crime-novels","url":"/artist/crime-novels"},{"id":8880,"name":"Jesse Hlebo","permalink":"jesse-hlebo","url":"/artist/jesse-hlebo"},{"id":8883,"name":"Justin Sloane","permalink":"justin-sloane","url":"/artist/justin-sloane"},{"id":9697,"name":"Leigha Mason","permalink":"leigha-mason","url":"/artist/leigha-mason"},{"id":8882,"name":"Lemuel Barbour","permalink":"lemuel-barbour","url":"/artist/lemuel-barbour"},{"id":9696,"name":"Sebastian Mlynarski","permalink":"sebastian-mlynarski","url":"/artist/sebastian-mlynarski"},{"id":21931,"name":"_ Quarterly","permalink":"_-quarterly","url":"/artist/_-quarterly"}],"categories":[{"id":309484,"name":"Publication","permalink":"publication","url":"/category/publication"}]},{"id":389182,"name":"_ Quarterly 02","permalink":"_-quarterly-02","position":31,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/_-quarterly-02","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-09-06T00:01:22.000Z","description":"_Quarterly is an experimental publication focused on the visual and literary arts.
