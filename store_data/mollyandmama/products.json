He was sketched by hand, and drawn into an applique design. Like all Molly and Mama appliques, the pieces were hand traced and then cut, placed, and blanket stitched by machine. The pattern for this cute little chap is also available in-store!\r\n\r\nThis design (like all our appliques) is made with lots of care and attention to detail, and with superior materials and trims, so that you receive a garment that continues to look great, wash after wash!\r\n\r\nThis item will be sent with regular postage.
