The modifications have NOT involved ANY alteration of the electrical circuitry. \r\nThe heating barrel has been bored parallel and fitted with a piston rod for manual wax injection. The nozzle is tapped M3 for an anti-dribble screw. The gun has been internally ‘potted’ for extra electrical insulation, in case an ‘over-charged’ operation forces hot wax inside the injector.\r\nThe injector is supplied with a thermometer which reaches right into the barrel to ensure consistent results.\r\nThe injector is supplied with a ‘loading funnel’ for pellets of pattern wax (recommended) or can be loaded with 11mm diameter by 65mm long ‘bullets’ of pattern wax which need to be cast or extruded by the user. These ‘bullets’ allow the maximum injection capacity of 6cc, but a load of 5cc of wax pellets is more convenient and gives ample volume for rings / charms / pendants etc.\r\nSupplied with instructions and a 50cc sample of pattern wax pellets.\r\n\r\nThe user needs to provide: A vulcanized rubber or silicone mould and mould clamp (a cheap wood-vice works well as shown in the photo) and a 5cc measuring cup. The ‘holster’ to support the injector in the vertical position for loading and heating is made from a kiddies plastic beaker with a cutout in the bottom and Evostuck to a piece of plywood.\r\n","options":[{"id":27774080,"name":"Default","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":12.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87010121/-/7___wax_injector.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87010121/-/7___wax_injector.JPG","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4344317,"name":"Jewellery Making Tools","permalink":"jewellery-making-tools","url":"/category/jewellery-making-tools"}]},{"id":8817989,"name":"Lost Wax Casting Course - for 1 person","permalink":"lost-wax-casting-course-for-1-person","position":2,"price":110.0,"default_price":110.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lost-wax-casting-course-for-1-person","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-06T22:03:35.000Z","description":"A one day course is offered in Coventry to support their new MICROFOUNDRY system for casting custom jewellery items in Brass, Bronze, Silver or Gold.

The lost wax casting of precious metals dates back to Egyptian times but can be bulky, dirty, expensive, and time consuming, so putting a lot of folk off. The Microfoundry was developed to make lost wax casting as 'doable'  as possible. Requiring just 1M of bench space, and little prior knowledge, the microfoundry uses a domestic microwave oven as a heat source as they are readily available, affordable, and non intimidating, hey if you can cook a pie you can melt a crucible of silver with microfoundry. It really is fun, honest, pleasetake a look at the photos and video clips on our facebook page www.facebook.com/steedcraft\r\n\r\nThe Microfoundry system contains a metal melting furnace, a wax burnout furnace, sprue plate, investment flask, 2 crucibels, safety equipment, and enough materials (wax, investment powder, BR10 casting grain, flux etc) to do your first several melts, and full instructions.\r\n\r\nWe offer support by phone, email, or post, and as a new year offer if you would like to arrange to pick your microfoundry system up in Coventry we will be pleased to provide a days free course to make your first silver casting.","options":[{"id":27685055,"name":"Default","price":350.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":23.0,"amount_with_others":23.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":105.0,"amount_with_others":105.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86712965/-/system.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86712965/-/system.jpg","width":960,"height":720}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4344317,"name":"Jewellery Making Tools","permalink":"jewellery-making-tools","url":"/category/jewellery-making-tools"}]}]
