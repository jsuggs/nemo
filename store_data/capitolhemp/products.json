Featuring over 90 artists and initiatives from around the world, the book provides insights into the resources that are being used to place activist messages in the heart of the everyday, documenting the rise of the media-guerrilla during the decade spanning from 1995 to 2005. All over the world, activists have disseminated their messages using an array of methods targeted to grab the attention of the public, as well as the perpetrators of the actions that have instigated the protestors.\r\n\r\nUrban Guerrilla Protest contains the collection compiled by Berlin-based graphic designer Ake Rudolf; its design and bilingual English/German layout is an homage to the Do It Yourself attitude that all of the examples champion in the name of questioning corporate hegemony. Examinations of Reverend Billy, the Yes Men, The Institute for Applied Autonomy, The Billboard Liberation Front, The Ruckus Society, Yomango, Surveillance Camera Players and more than 90 other examples from the US, the UK, Australia, China, Argentina and elsewhere illuminate how these messages are heard, and in many cases incite change.","options":[{"id":22931839,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71039483/-/DSC01259.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71039483/-/DSC01259.JPG","width":750,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3694865,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":7307775,"name":"Ear Peace - Ear Plugs","permalink":"ear-peace-ear-plugs","position":51,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ear-peace-ear-plugs","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-09-20T23:40:23.000Z","description":"Local DC company, Ear Peace, brings you the Thievery Corporation edition ear plugs.

In 1984, he rashly agreed, for $500, to deliver a package containing four and a half ounces of cocaine for a gambling acquaintance. It turned out to be a sting, and Papa was convicted and sentenced to 15 years to life. Although at first suffused with melodramatic regret, the account becomes leaner when Papa arrives at Sing Sing and describes the hazards and absurdities of the notoriously crowded, grimy prison. He found spiritual release from despair and violence through educational programs on painting, writing and law. Papa's public stature rose after a painting of his was exhibited at the Whitney Museum, and after numerous travails threatened his health and sanity, he was granted executive clemency after 12 years behind bars. Papa has since been active with the group Mothers of the Disappeared and the movement to repeal the overly harsh Rockefeller drug laws; his paintings combine surrealist overtones with hard-edged subjects often derived from the prison-industrial complex, and they reflect the material of his book memorably.\r\nCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

From the 1890s to the 1930s, hardly a year passed without a serious—and often deadly—clash between workers and management. Written in the 1930s, and with a new introduction by Mike Davis, Dynamite recounts a fascinating and largely forgotten history of class and labor struggle in America’s industrial beginnings.\r\n\r\nIt is the story of brutal exploitation, massacres, and judicial murders of the workers. It is also the story of their response: when peaceful strikes yielded no results, workers fought back by any means necessary.\r\n\r\nLouis Adamic has written the classic story of labor conflict in America, detailing many episodes of labor violence, including the Molly Maguires, the Homestead Strike, Pullman Strike, Colorado Labor Wars, the Los Angeles Times bombing, as well as the case of Sacco and Vanzetti.","options":[{"id":22931753,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71039667/-/DSC01252.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71039667/-/DSC01252.JPG","width":750,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3694865,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":7241901,"name":"Everything I Want To Do Is Illegal","permalink":"everything-i-want-to-do-is-illegal","position":79,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/everything-i-want-to-do-is-illegal","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-14T03:48:42.000Z","description":"Drawing upon 40 years' experience as an ecological farmer and marketer, Joel Salatin explains with humor and passion why Americans do not have the freedom to choose the food they purchase and eat. From child labor regulations to food inspection, bureaucrats provide themselves sole discretion over what food is available in the local marketplace. Their system favors industrial, global corporate food systems and discourages community-based food commerce, resulting in homogenized selection, mediocre quality, and exposure to non-organic farming practices. Salatin's expert insight explains why local food is expensive and difficult to find and will illuminate for the reader a deeper understanding of the industrial food complex.","options":[{"id":22931697,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71039691/-/DSC01250.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71039691/-/DSC01250.JPG","width":750,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3694865,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":7241895,"name":"My Mother Wears Combat Boots","permalink":"my-mother-wears-combat-boots-a-parenting-guide-for-the-rest-of-us","position":80,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/my-mother-wears-combat-boots-a-parenting-guide-for-the-rest-of-us","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-14T03:47:39.000Z","description":"My Mother Wears Combat Boots- \r\nA Parenting Guide For the Rest of Us\r\n\r\nJessica Mills, a touring punk musician, artist, and political activist, gives readers a delightful, information-packed guide to having and raising kids without giving up your politics, art, or life.\r\nDisappointed by run-of-the-mill parenting books that didn't speak to her experience, Jessica set out to write a book tackling the issues faced by a new generation of moms and dads. The result is a parenting guide like no other. Written with humor, extensive research, and much trial and error, My Mother Wears Combat Boots delivers sound advice for parents of all stripes. Amid stories of bringing kids (and grandparents) to women's rights demonstrations, taking baby on tour with her band, and organizing cooperative childcare, Jessica gives detailed nuts-and-bolts information about weaning, cloth vs. disposable diapers, the psychological effects of co-sleeping, and even how to get free infant gear.

Through an objective examination of the two drugs and the laws and social practices that steer people toward alcohol, the authors pose a simple yet rarely considered question: Why do we punish adults who make the rational, safer choice to use marijuana instead of alcohol?\r\n\r\nMarijuana Is Safer reaches for a broad audience. For those unfamiliar with marijuana, it provides an introduction to the cannabis plant and its effects on the user, and debunks some of the government's most frequently cited marijuana myths. For current and aspiring advocates of marijuana-law reform, as well as anyone else who is interested in what is becoming a major political battle, the authors spell out why the message that marijuana is safer than alcohol must be a prominent part of the public debate over legalization.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, for the millions of Americans who want to advance the cause of marijuana-policy reform--or simply want to defend their own personal, safer choice--this book provides the talking points and detailed information needed to make persuasive arguments to friends, family, coworkers, and elected officials.\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":22931659,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71039731/-/DSC01245.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71039731/-/DSC01245.JPG","width":750,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3694865,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":7241879,"name":"The Cannabis Closet-First Hand Accounts of the Marijuana Mainstream","permalink":"the-cannabis-closet-by-andrew-sullivan","position":82,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-cannabis-closet-by-andrew-sullivan","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-14T03:44:09.000Z","description":"From Andrew Sullivan's Pioneering Blog, The Daily Dish\r\n\r\nFor decades, middle-class marijuana use has been America's best kept secret.
