We're Singing Our Last Breath will have you pumping your fist, hopping on stage and grabbing the mic to sing along. Punk rock where you can understand the lyrics and the melody grabs you, \"Zero To Sixty\" and \"The Last Rope\" are so catchy you can't help but hit repeat on your iPod.

'Bowling With Stalin,' the bands first release on Winter Street Records is 19 tracks of true hardcore. Drago, much like on their debut album, truly wears their heart and influences on their collective sleeves. Staying true to the late 80's hardcore sound, in the vein of Judge, Sick Of It All, and Gorilla Biscuits that is intertwined with lyrical comedy that is reminiscent of Southern California Punks The Vandals the album Bowling with Stalin is a standout amongst hardcore records of 2007. Recorded At Fallen Angel Studios in May of 2007 \"Bowling With Stalin\" proves an improvement in production over 90 Miles while remaining true to the band's initial hardcore sound. If you're tired of metalcore and rapcore being passed off as hardcore, Drago's \"Bowling With Stalin\" will remind you that hardcore has not died.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing\r\n\r\n1. \tHigh Value Target \r\n2. \tCheif J.
