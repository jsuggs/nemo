Its luster is low to medium.\r\n\r\nBecause of the density of Brazilian hair, you may not want to use as many bundles as you would normally use with other textures to create a full look. Due to its natural density, with this hair, less is more. Also because of its density, it is less likely to frizz than other hair types like Malaysian or Indian Hair.

What make our closures different from the rest is:\r\n\r\n1. Our Closures are not bulky, and do not appear weavy- we worked with the best company in china, who hand crafted and customized our lace silk base closures to our specifications. This is the single most important point that makes our closures different; the size is perfect (4x4), and is designed in more of a square design rather than an oval design.  Ever looked at a person, who appear to have a lot of hair sitting on their heads, and nothing looks natural (ie. Rapper Trina Lace Wig, or Classy from Real Chance of Love Lace Wig)? Our Design and particular Measurements and Specs are what set our Lace Front Closures apart from any other company out there. \r\n\r\n2. Our Closures have nothing but the best quality hair, and will last through multiple installs.  Our Closures will usually last 3-6 months if properly taken care of or longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Our company does not offer a small closure and a large closure for a higher price, we have one size, and that’s it. The measurement of our closures are the perfect size of 3.5x4\" .  Companies often offer both small and large in order to get more money out of a customer, often selling out of the large Closures, and having nothing but Small Closures in inventory, that don’t even compare, in terms of styling options. \r\n\r\n5 .Our Lace Front Closures blend very well with most skin tones. Our lace closure flesh has more of a light brown coloration as oppose to a pale flesh tone, which is found on most silk base closures. \r\n\r\n\r\n·Hair type - 100% Virgin Hair\r\n \r\n·Dimensions - 3.5x 4\"\r\n \r\n·Lace Color - Light Brown\r\n \r\n·Hair Color - 1b Dark brown/Black\r\n \r\n·Texture - Soft\r\n \r\n·Density - 120%\r\n \r\n·Lengths Available – 12” - 20''\r\n \r\nIf you are interested in purchasing a different length, please email info.eyes4u16@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASE ALLOW 3-5 DAYS For closure to arrive to us, EACH CLOSURE HAS TO BE CUSTOM MADE.  \r\n\r\nSILK BASE CLOSURE \r\n\r\nSilk Base Lace Top Closures 3.5x4\" \r\n\r\nBrazilian Virgin Hair \r\n\r\nBODY WAVE 12\"-20\" \r\n\r\n\r\nYour silk top is custom made so please allow 7-10 days for it to be shipped.","options":[{"id":21366721,"name":"12\"  (wavy)","price":120.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21573513,"name":"14\" (wavy)","price":135.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21573515,"name":"16\" (wavy)","price":145.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":25500861,"name":"18\" (wavy)","price":160.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":31880830,"name":"12\" (Kinky Curly)","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":31880833,"name":"14\" (Kinky Curly)","price":160.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":31880836,"name":"16\" (Kinky Curly)","price":170.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":31880839,"name":"18\" (Kinky Curly)","price":180.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":39222438,"name":"12\" (loose curl)","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":39222447,"name":"14\" (loose curl)","price":160.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":39222444,"name":"16\" (loose curl)","price":170.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":39222441,"name":"18\" (loose curl)","price":180.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50016348,"name":"12\" Ombré BODY WAVE silk base closure","price":165.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50016345,"name":"14\" Ombré BODY WAVE silk base closure","price":175.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50016342,"name":"16\" Ombré BODY WAVE silk base closure","price":185.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50016339,"name":"18\" Ombré BODY WAVE silk base closure","price":195.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50016336,"name":"20\" Ombré BODY WAVE silk base closure","price":205.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50037258,"name":"12\" BODY WAVE silk base closure","price":140.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50037255,"name":"14\" BODY WAVE silk base closure","price":155.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50037252,"name":"16\" BODY WAVE silk base closure","price":160.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50037249,"name":"18\" BODY WAVE silk base closure","price":170.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50037246,"name":"20\" BODY WAVE silk base closure","price":180.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50039865,"name":"12\" Straight Silk base Closure ","price":130.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50039862,"name":"14\" Straight Silk base Closure","price":140.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50039859,"name":"16\" Straight Silk base Closure","price":145.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50039856,"name":"18\" Straight Silk base Closure","price":155.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50039853,"name":"20\" Straight Silk base Closure","price":165.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100097431/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100097431/-/image.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128940024/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128940024/-/image.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128954745/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128954745/-/image.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4709449,"name":"Lace closure/Silk base Closure","permalink":"lace-closure-silk-base-closure","url":"/category/lace-closure-silk-base-closure"}]},{"id":6447997,"name":"Ombre/Full color service/ Highlight service ","permalink":"ombre","position":15,"price":45.0,"default_price":45.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ombre","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-14T11:41:02.000Z","description":"We offer Ombre and full coloring services.\r\n\r\nHow it works: Add this service option to your cart along with your hair purchase.

Remember Less is more! \r\n \r\nStep 1: Type of Hair?\r\n \r\nHair care depends on a variety of things; one of most important of them all is texture! if your new to virgin hair I always recommend going with an easy and manageable style such as Body Wave or straight. Textures such as Curly, Kinky Curly, Loose curl, and  wavy tend to give ladies new to virgin hair a little trouble as a little shedding and tangling which is normal may occur more when these textures are neglected.\r\n \r\n \r\nStep 2: Find a professional stylist!\r\n \r\nDoes he or she have 1500 hours? And updated license, no matter how good or how much a person says they know what to do if he or she does not have 1500 hours they should not be touching your hair. Most professional stylist work at salons, and has clientele to show their work. Don’t let someone ruin your investment you did wait 3-4 business days or longer and spent your hard earned money for a bad install.\r\n \r\n \r\nStep 3: Seal your wefts!\r\n \r\nSeal those wefts seal those wefts! Many complaints on virgin hair come from cutting the track line (weft) without resealing your weft. Please let your stylist know if you plan on cutting the hair please seal the wefts!\r\n \r\n \r\nStep 4: Washing/conditioning your hair!\r\n \r\nPlease pay close attention to this section washing your hair is very important!! This is virgin hair and should be treated and cared for just as your hair. Below are some products to wash and condition your hair with. You should wash your hair every two weeks or when needed\r\n \r\nProducts are listed below\r\n \r\nDesign Essentials Moisturizing Shampoos and Conditioners\r\nCrème of Nature Sulfate Free Argon Oil Conditioner\r\nMacadamia Natural Brand Oil Shampoo and Conditioner\r\nOrganic Root Stimulator Revitalizing Conditioner (for extra dry or damaged hair)\r\nPaul Mitchell The Detangler\r\nSuave Professionals Sleek Moisturizing Shampoo\r\nOne 'N' Only Restorative Mask\r\n \r\nSilicone mix shampoo and conditioner (highly recommended)\r\n \r\n \r\nStep 5:  Products not to use!!! This will cause tangling shedding and matting.\r\n \r\n \r\n•    Tresemme Shampoo and Conditioner\r\n•    Dove Shampoo and Conditioner\r\n•    Garnier Fructis Shampoo and Conditioner\r\n•    White Rain Shampoo and Conditioner\r\n•    Aussie Shampoo and Conditioner\r\n•    V05 Shampoo and Conditioner\r\n•    Pantene Pro-v Shampoo and Conditioner\r\n•    Head and Shoulders Shampoo and Conditioner\r\n•    L’Oreal Shampoo and Conditioner\r\nMixed Chicks Shampoo and Conditioner\r\n \r\n•    Herbal Essence Shampoos, 2in1, and Conditioners\r\n•    Organix Moroccan Shampoo/Conditioner (blue bottles)\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nStep 6: Styling your hair??\r\n \r\nIn addition to continuous moisture, a quality styling serum should be a staple used to calm your hair, prevent frizz, seal in your hairs moisture, and add shine.\r\nWhen applying heat to your hair, always use a quality heat protectant. As your own hair; your extensions will become damaged by excessive heat. If your hair becomes heat damaged, it will lose its natural curl/wave pattern, and/or have many damaged dry or brittle ends. Heat damage cannot be reversed. Coarser textures are more prone to heat damage and dryness.\r\n \r\nStep 7: Tangling and matting???\r\nIf your hair is tangling it means its DRY or has product buildup. If all of your hair is dry, then try another conditioner or regimen that works better at moisturizing your hair. All conditioners and product will not work well with every bundle. Each bundles comes from a single donor and May or may not respond well to your regimen. If one or more of your bundles is tangling, deep condition your hair with a rich conditioner or mask and allow it to sit on the hair for at least an hour. If your hair responds well to a deep condition and stops tangling, then continue to deep condition as often as your hair needs it. If your hair does not respond well to a deep condition, you will need to try a product that agrees with your hair. You may have a bundle of hair that doesn’t act or respond like the others. It doesn’t mean your bundle is \"bad\". It means that you will need to find a regimen that agrees with that bundle until they all cooperate harmoniously. If your hair has product buildup, wash your hair with a clarifying or sulfate free shampoo and recondition your hair as normal.\r\n\r\n***ALSO WHEN COMBING OUT THE HAIR WHILE WET USE A WIDE TOOTH COMB! You don't want anything with small teeth pulling out your Hair! This will cause shedding!\r\n\r\n\r\nVirgin hair (especially curly hair) is very high maintenance. If you aren't willing to maintain you’re hairs moisture and cleanliness or taking the time to find a good regimen?  You may want to consider another texture. Curly hair is definitely for advanced-intermediate Virgin hair wearers and extremely different than caring for hair from your local Beauty Supply Store.\r\n \r\n DYING/COLORING THE HAIR\r\n\r\nI RECOMMEND A PROFESSIONAL when getting the hair colored. Don't mess up your investment with the wrong type of dyes and harsh bleach!  \r\n \r\nIf all of these steps are followed! You will never have a problem out of your hair if you do and if you have it documented please email or call us during normal business hours for more tips.\r\n \r\nInfo.Eyes4u16@gmail.com","options":[{"id":18775525,"name":"Hair care tips","price":0.01,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121387161/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121387161/-/image.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5778294,"name":"Hair Care Tips","permalink":"hair-care-tips","url":"/category/hair-care-tips"}]},{"id":6079621,"name":"FAQs","permalink":"about-me","position":19,"price":0.01,"default_price":0.01,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/about-me","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-05-02T00:20:20.000Z","description":"Hello Beauties!
