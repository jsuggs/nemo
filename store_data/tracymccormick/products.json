I simply wanted to paint it and once I saw a \"wet paint\" sign I had my reason.\r\n\r\nBetween the guitar and the wet paint sign I couldn't help but think of Magritte.  \r\n\r\nClearly the wet paint sign was not wet nor was it paint.  I couldn't help but see \"et aint\" and find humor in the fact that using incorrect grammar could get you to the real Magritte-type truth of the sign.\r\n\r\nThe text \"et aint\" is superimposed on top of the guitar using Elmer's glue.  The glue helps give it a \"wet look\" and helps to address the notion of attaching meaning to arbitrary sounds and characters.\r\n","options":[{"id":11530080,"name":"Default","price":300.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/33175756/-/ET_AINT_HORIZONTAL.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/33175756/-/ET_AINT_HORIZONTAL.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1788781,"name":"Art & Accessories","permalink":"art-accessories","url":"/category/art-accessories"}]},{"id":3133561,"name":"FILE CABINET","permalink":"test","position":4,"price":300.0,"default_price":300.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/test","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-01-14T00:56:41.000Z","description":"Vintage 3 drawer file cabinet on casters.
