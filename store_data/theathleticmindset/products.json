Friedman and Webb have put a spin on the motivational book to incorporate century's old mental strategies used by top athletes into the process of thinking positive to achieve one's goals.\r\n\r\nThroughout the book, the authors encourage the attitude of \"keep on swinging,\" an idea born from the fact that baseball batters with the highest batting averages strike out more times than they get on base. This athletic philosophy can be applied in all aspects of life which is what Friedman and Webb teach readers in \"The Athletic Mindset.\"\r\n\r\nThis book can be used to teach managers and executives how to be more effective communicators and leaders while empowering employees and improving corporate moral. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PURCHASE THE E-BOOK</B>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Athletic-Mindset-Three-Success-ebook/dp/B008AS8G8W/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1339523605&sr=8-2\">Click HERE to go to Amazon.com</a>\r\n","options":[{"id":34555251,"name":"The Athletic Mindset Book","price":18.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34610970,"name":"Add a Gratitude Coin - (For .99)","price":19.94,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121756875/-/TAM_3d.jpg.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121756875/-/TAM_3d.jpg.jpeg","width":975,"height":1275},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121756851/-/Workbook_spiral.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121756851/-/Workbook_spiral.jpeg","width":975,"height":1275}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5239218,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":10987446,"name":"Your Inner Swing - Softcover","permalink":"your-inner-swing-softcover","position":2,"price":16.95,"default_price":16.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/your-inner-swing-softcover","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-06T20:00:18.000Z","description":"\"Having spent more than 28 years playing golf, I’ve read a lot of golf books in my time.
