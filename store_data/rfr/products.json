Jason Dwyer has played for a while now, solo and in bands like BOMBSHELTER, CRIMSON MIRE, COLD BLUE SKY and DOGS. \r\n\r\nAfter the release of the Saskatchewan EP, the So92 went through some major changes as alumni moved away for career or family. Throughout this time, they continued to play shows quite successfully after Gregg and Pete moved away, with new members staying on to present day. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, The SUMMER OF '92 band has a solid lineup with original bass player Duncan Spence returning to the group and moving to guitar, Hollywood Steve Tidy on bass, Danny the Mac on keys and accompaniment, and a few more surprises in store for next year. \r\n\r\nThis album was worked on in several stages with momentous passion from longtime music partner and drummer Ryan Elinsky (HOLOCRON, COUNTDOWN TO OBLIVION, LEGION DCLXVI).\r\n\r\nSummer of '92 have finally released a multifaceted contribution containing songs from the first acoustic EP reworked, 2 covers and a few oldies we have been hearing live for years*, finally put down in a great long player. Very happy for these guys for making the long journey to this. Released by the band\r\n\r\n1. GREEN AND WHITE\r\n2. CONSTANTINOPLE\r\n3. THIS SONG IS A BULLET\r\n4. ANYTHING, ANYTHING\r\n5.

Now the tracks are available as Equalize X Distort, The Studio 3 Sessions.\r\n\r\nThe album contains six renditions of Class Assassins tracks from previous albums, and two great covers; Breaking the Law by Judas Priest and Fortunate Son by Creedence Clearwater Revival. Included amongst the original Class Assassins tracks is the exceptionally catchy Treason, from the recently released The Treason 45 EP.\r\n\r\nThe great thing about this album is that the tracks are presented in their raw form without any fancy studio wizardry. This accomplishes two things. First, the album feels real and gritty, and preserves the classic Class Assassins sound. Second, it shows just how talented this band really is since it sounds pretty clear from the first track that all these guys need to kick ass is their instruments, and a spot to play them in. -Rebel Youth zine\r\n\r\n(session was mastered by Wounded Paw for this cd, you can find the original session and interview here: http://equalizingxdistort.blogspot.ca/2011/12/radio-sunday-december-4th-2011.html)\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"150\" height=\"450\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 150px; height: 450px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=563081988/size=tall2/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"http://theclassassassins.bandcamp.com/album/equalize-x-distort-the-studio-3-sessions\">Equalize X Distort - The Studio 3 Sessions by The Class Assassins</a></iframe>\r\n","options":[{"id":18646079,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/57065455/-/studio-3-front2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/57065455/-/studio-3-front2.jpg","width":450,"height":450}],"artists":[{"id":113377,"name":"The Class Assassins","permalink":"the-class-assassins","url":"/artist/the-class-assassins"},{"id":113379,"name":"Anxiety Attack","permalink":"anxiety-attack","url":"/artist/anxiety-attack"}],"categories":[{"id":417631,"name":"cds","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":350312,"name":"ZWEI TAGE:OHNE SCHNUPFTABAK / FORMER CELL MATES","permalink":"zwei-tage-ohne-schnupftabak-former-cell-mates","position":7,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/zwei-tage-ohne-schnupftabak-former-cell-mates","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-07-21T21:56:27.000Z","description":"Split 70g 7inch with FORMER CELL MATES from Sunderland/UK\r\n(2008 / Glurex#001 / Germany)\r\n","options":[{"id":1430692,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2761323/-/l_e4f97989193ea15cca6892d817c6784d.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2761323/-/l_e4f97989193ea15cca6892d817c6784d.jpg","width":567,"height":570}],"artists":[{"id":1845,"name":"Former Cell Mates","permalink":"former-cell-mates","url":"/artist/former-cell-mates"},{"id":8198,"name":"Zwei Tage:Ohne Schnupftabak","permalink":"zwei-tage-ohne-schnupftabak","url":"/artist/zwei-tage-ohne-schnupftabak"}],"categories":[{"id":417681,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"}]},{"id":7052279,"name":"Countdown To Oblivion - Discography 12\"","permalink":"countdown-to-oblivion-discography-lp","position":8,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/countdown-to-oblivion-discography-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-24T19:12:06.000Z","description":"COUNTDOWN TO OBLIVION:\r\nDiscography: LP\r\nStep back a little over ten years ago and marvel at how fast time moves and consider all the changes. Formed in 1998, this Canadian gang of thrashers (members of the Swarm One Blood, etc.) put out a demo, and two EPs (one a split with They Live) in the early part of this century. Their style was a mix of hardcore punk with some metallic elements (especially in the guitar riffs and some solos). A mix of Born Against, powerviolence and Y2K thrash, which was when these guys formed. The songs are fast, well executed, and the lyrics are sarcastic, but with a point, often critiquing the punk scene, as well as the insecurities and absurdity of society at large. The structure and riffs in “4 Alarm Fire...” is insane; a lot of near tech metal riffs, and there’s a crunching main riff that makes the song awesome. Comes on red vinyl and packaged in a gatefold cover with liner notes, as well as a separate lyric sheet. –Matt Average /razorcake (A389, a398records.com)\r\n\r\nCOUNTDOWN TO OBLIVION:\r\nDiscography: LP\r\nI’ll begin this by saying that Left For Dead was one of the most important bands in my young life, and that Chris Colohan’s vocal style, lyrics, and overall approach in those early years left an indelible mark on me. For those who don’t know, CTO was one of Colohan’s many late ‘90s/early ‘00s bands, and while not sounding terribly unlike Left For Dead or The Swarm, CTO ramped up the Euro metal influence and brought a more chaotic vibe to the table. This record combines the band’s Brain Surgery for Beginners EP, the split with They Live, and demo tracks. Remastered, repackaged, and finally seeing the slick release it deserves, thanks to the always classy gentleman that is Dom at A389.

In the winter of 2005/6, after jamming songs both old and new, the band made the decision to record a full band demo to check their progress. Settling themselves into a converted studio-shed in Willowdale ON, the band with the aide of friend Aldis recorded a handful of songs. Around this time a decision was made to take advantage of the relaxed studio environment and record another EP.\r\n\r\nBeginning in the late spring and ending in the summer, the band stripped down early full band songs, rerecorded some others and recorded a few brand new ones collecting enough jams to release 'Saskatchewan' the following year.\r\n\r\nReprinted in 2012 by Rubber Factory\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"150\" height=\"270\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 150px; height: 270px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3965334885/size=tall/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"http://summerof92.bandcamp.com/track/the-tempest\">The Tempest by Summer of '92</a></iframe>\r\n\r\n\r\nSaskatchewan 03:21\r\nThe Tempest 04:09\r\nUisge Beatha (Fire Water) 03:02\r\nYellowknife 02:43\r\nLong Road Back 04:52\r\nIle-De-La-Madeleine 01:32\r\nTrench Street 03:09\r\n","options":[{"id":22329743,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69191003/-/Screen_shot_2012-08-24_at_12.14.48_PM.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69191003/-/Screen_shot_2012-08-24_at_12.14.48_PM.png","width":746,"height":734}],"artists":[{"id":1782,"name":"Summer Of '92","permalink":"summer-of-92","url":"/artist/summer-of-92"},{"id":1652,"name":"Rubber Factory","permalink":"rubber-factory","url":"/artist/rubber-factory"}],"categories":[{"id":417631,"name":"cds","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":8297493,"name":"Peace Be Still - 64 LP","permalink":"peace-be-still-64-lp","position":15,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/peace-be-still-64-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-30T19:42:17.000Z","description":"Sounds like: 1995\r\n\r\nReleased 2012\r\nSometimes I get Drunk records\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"150\" height=\"450\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 150px; height: 450px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2033953996/size=tall2/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"http://peacebestill.bandcamp.com/album/64\">64 by Peace be still</a></iframe>\r\n","options":[{"id":26130909,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81586245/-/3070814855-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81586245/-/3070814855-1.jpg","width":923,"height":928},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81586161/-/DSC08260_16x9_620x350.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81586161/-/DSC08260_16x9_620x350.JPG","width":620,"height":348}],"artists":[{"id":157368,"name":"Peace Be Still","permalink":"peace-be-still","url":"/artist/peace-be-still"}],"categories":[{"id":417621,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"}]},{"id":8505582,"name":"V/A - GO!

It takes a touch of genius-and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction.\" -Albert Einstein\r\n\r\nA Poem\r\nThis isn't college. This isn't sensitivity training. This isn't a \"safe place.\" This isn't the utopia where everyone's wearing a shirt (but everyone has a monkey). This is America-from slavery to minimum wage to restraining orders to Mr. Mom. This is purgatory and alcoholism and weed and jerkdom and hanging with your buddies. This is the freedom of life, full of fuckups, divorces, and hot dog spinners. This is a celebration. This is Too Many Daves and this is Weekend at Daves. Fuck the fun killers.\r\n\r\nA Little Background\r\nToo Many Daves is named after a Dr. Seuss poem, \"Just The Right Number Of Daves\" sounded too NPR-precious, and the name \"Dude Jams\" was already taken.\r\n\r\nThe Creative Process\r\nOff of a steady diet of pizza, they trained hard in the dojo of the mind. First off, they tattooed \"Decker\" on that particular Dave's back, so the cops could always return him home and he could be spotted more easily in naked marathons. Then they hired Bruce Lee's ghost who said, \"If you make an ass out of yourself, there will always be someone to ride you.\"\r\n\r\nToo Many Daves ride themselves.

Although Toronto is home to plenty of full on hardcore punk bands, the Class Assassins are a cut above the rest, possibly due to some freak genetic mutation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is something in the water supply besides the usual toxic waste that causes otherwise normal mothers to breed children with an affinity for high voltage punk rock. If that is indeed the case, then the Class Assassins have absorbed enough of that deadly chemical to become Toronto’s reigning punk rock royalty, and they sit firmly atop that booze-drenched throne like the seasoned veterans they truly are. Or maybe there is nothing dangerous in the water. Maybe whatever Toronto has in the beer.\r\n\r\nThe Class Assassins have been around since 2001, but the members hail from many infamous Toronto acts such as Direct Action, Bitter Grin, Problem Children, Sinkin’ Ships, Chronic Submission, and Hockey Teeth. Despite this impressive pedigree, the boys are not overly ambitious, and have only released two proper studio albums and three singles to date. \r\n-Chris Walter\r\n\r\nChris Walter is an unrepentant degenerate who no longer fuels his writing with prodigious amounts of liquor and drugs.

Run through the rosters of many of the city’s local bands and you’ll find a lot of overlap in the members. Sometimes it seems like we are a scene made up of side projects and marriages of opportunistic convenience. While this no doubts engenders the kind of cliqueish atmosphere that turns some local music fans off, the other side of the coin is that it helps foster deeper musical ties and a more substantive sense of community.\r\n\r\nAtlanta punk outfit, Charges, is yet another product of our tightly-knit scene. Featuring members of established local acts 40 Hells and Authors Apology, the five-piece play restless, high-energy punk powered by scuzzy guitars and crashing drums and made unique by the addition of a fuzzed-out Farfisa organ. The organ’s distinctive pitch, classic and carnivalesque, lends Charges’ music a psychedelic ’60s garage rock vibe that sits well with their scruffy melodic punk and Mick Winters’ razor vocals. It’s hard-charging (no pun intended), uproariously fun stuff, perfect for maximum pint pounding and unabashed fist pumping. -Moe Castro/Latest Disgrace\r\n\r\nDownload <a href=\"http://latestdisgrace.com/music/charges_willyoubemine.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">“Will You Be Mine?”</a> from Latest Disgrace ATL\r\n\r\nSide A: \r\nLeave the Blade Bloody \r\nFace Time\r\nSide B:\r\n Believe It \r\nWill You Be Mine?","options":[{"id":26014197,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81162693/-/charges_consequentialistcommunique.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81162693/-/charges_consequentialistcommunique.jpg","width":615,"height":615}],"artists":[{"id":156630,"name":"Charges","permalink":"charges","url":"/artist/charges"}],"categories":[{"id":417681,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"}]},{"id":753111,"name":"LEGION 666 - Black Goat Armageddon 12\"","permalink":"legion-dclxvi-black-goat-armageddon","position":27,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/legion-dclxvi-black-goat-armageddon","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-11-27T00:09:45.000Z","description":"MRR:\r\n\"...Othewise I'm going ga-ga over the newest Legion 666 (or now DCLXVI) Lp Black Goat Armageddon on Schizophrenic Records from Canada.

Bright Stars\r\n\r\nIt’s taken some time but these Montrealers’ 2006 full-length, Dancing for Decadence, has been crawling into the hearts of dudes and ladies who love Leatherface and beer for the last two years. It’s safe to say that the Sainte Catherines are one of the strongest punk bands currently pounding the shit out of the Trans Canada highway, which is why The Soda Machine has arrived at just the right time. A full-length documentary about the band’s ten-year career, plus a disc of 25 rare and unreleased songs, it’s a full serving of gritty, honest and incredibly catchy punk rock. The film is an engaging look at what it means to be a touring act in this country, following the band from hall shows to no one to a huge 500th show in their native Montreal. \r\n\r\nWhile every band and their mother seem to have a DVD these days, few are actually worth watching but The Soda Machine is just a simple and compelling story about a group of people killing themselves to do what they love. The CD is a perfect complement; the unreleased tracks from the Dancing sessions are exciting, while demos from eight years ago show a band with a lot of promise and the endearing innocence of very, very teenage songwriting. Surprisingly consistent and listenable for such a large collection, it offers some real gems like \"Trade Your Life For Mags” and a cover of Three Penny Opera’s \"Sweetness Kills.” -Sam Sutherland\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://store.indica.mu/widget/the-sainte-catherines-the-soda-machine/?l=en&t=radio\" width=\"180\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\r\n","options":[{"id":26132283,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81592521/-/0623339308823.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81592521/-/0623339308823.jpg","width":455,"height":455}],"artists":[{"id":115225,"name":"The Sainte Catherines","permalink":"the-sainte-catherines","url":"/artist/the-sainte-catherines"}],"categories":[{"id":417631,"name":"cds","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":3211341,"name":"video","permalink":"video","url":"/category/video"}]},{"id":1870231,"name":"The Tim Version - Still Have The Nerve To Call Ourselves A Band collection cd ","permalink":"the-tim-version-still-have-the-nerve-to-call-ourselves-a-band-cd","position":29,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-tim-version-still-have-the-nerve-to-call-ourselves-a-band-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-03-08T08:33:17.000Z","description":"A collection of out-of-print, hard-to-find, half-of-splits, and hey-we-haven’t-used-that-yets.

Destroy!\r\nLosin' It\r\nSay What You Want\r\nOn the Outside\r\nChelsea Horror Hotel\r\nWasted\r\n\r\nThe record is a self-assured nine songs in a louder, faster, shorter 21 minutes and although there are traces of what they've done before present here, this is a group that's clearly come into its own. The punk rock sensibilities here are filtered through an early 80s New Wave/Power Pop filter that add some catchy bounce. The feel of this record had me thinking that some of these songs would fit well on the soundtrack of a circa 1982 teen coming of age comedy, especially on the song Losin' It.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to make comparisons to Blondie, Pat Benetar and Kim Wylde and you wouldn't be far off. The thing that makes this record unique though is that is doesn't come across as sounding retro. Page can really add some punk snotty-ness to her voice but she can actually sing as well. The songwriting is solid and because these guys can really play, most of what you hear will stick in your head without repeated listening. But if this is the kind of thing you like, then chances are you won't want to stop listening. Drink! Dance! Destroy! is bound to be your soundtrack for this summer.\r\n\r\nReview by EQUALIZINGXDISTORT\r\n","options":[{"id":18512041,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.25,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/56635179/-/teenage_x_CD_Cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/56635179/-/teenage_x_CD_Cover.jpg","width":400,"height":400}],"artists":[{"id":112531,"name":"Teenage X","permalink":"teenage-x","url":"/artist/teenage-x"}],"categories":[{"id":417631,"name":"cds","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":5849971,"name":"The Rebel Spell - Four Songs About Freedom","permalink":"the-rebel-spell-four-songs-about-freedom","position":33,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-rebel-spell-four-songs-about-freedom","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-03T21:00:44.000Z","description":"It has been a very, very, very long time since a punk band has reached through the speakers and made us believe something was going on beyond the requisite and obvious elements that make one stop and listen to a \"good\" punk band.

Austin and I have planned this project for sometime now, even though this record is considered a split collaboration between all of us involved. \r\n\r\nThe songs consist of 3 Chuck Ragan originals, 3 Austin Lucas originals, 3 Ragan/Lucas originals, 1 original by Bob Lucas, and 2 old time standards called Darling Corey and Distant Land To Roam. The record has a very strong sense of bluegrass, folk and old time gospel, with a certain feel of exactly where we were and what was going on when we laid it down, which was a group of strangers coming together to enjoy good food and music up in the hills on the highest point of Ohio for a week, and leaving as friends by the end. \r\n\r\nWe recorded this session at Bob Lucas and Laura Gayle's home on top of Bristle Ridge in Zanesfield, Ohio.

Great to see it alive and well from these angry old men. And because of it I can’t help think of bands’s like DEADSTOOLPIDGEON, MANLIFTINGBANNER, and BIRDS OF A FEATHER. Just ripping hardcore with a revolutionary message played by scene veterans. It gives me hope at a time when everything is so shit. A voice in the darkness if you will. AK47 come from the LARM school of hardcore, except that they do have melody in a “Screaming for Change” kind of way. The atrocity of ....New Orleans...., numerous examples of racism, injustice, oppression are not lost on this band. I particular love the song directed at the scene regarding apologetic approaches to SKREWDRIVER. Finally someone calls out this out. There is enough material to go into how righteous AK 47 just on their political stand but I feel the song “Burn it Down” sums it up just bringing this shitty system down. 24 songs deliver twenty four calls to action.
