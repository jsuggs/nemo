The  industrial styled back print on the rear is inspired by the brands roots to the Channel Islands in the UK. A combination of charcoal with hunter green sleeves isn't a regular among popular combinations however, combined with a pair of chino shorts this shirt turns into a great summer chiller. The cut on this shirt is generous in length and we recommend ordering a size down from your usual tee-shirt size. This particular cotton is lighter than our tee-shirts and feels incredibly comfortable time after time.
