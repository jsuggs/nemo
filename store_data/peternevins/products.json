Look at the image of the sheet next to a quarter dollar.\r\n\r\nTam Lin is an epic old english folk ballad that tells of a girl (Janet) who must hold onto her lover (Tam Lin) while he is transformed into many fearsome things by a spell he's under.   Her love must prove stronger than her fear, if she is to win her lover back from this spell.\r\n\r\nAnaïs Mitchell and Jefferson Hamer just recorded their new arrangement of this song on their new album Child Ballads, which has 7 of the 300 or so songs collected in the 1890's by a Francis James Child.
