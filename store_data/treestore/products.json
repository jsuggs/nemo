We made these bars with the same sweep options as all of our previous handlebars, but with three different height and width options so you can find the ones that best fit your set up in todays world of growing bar sizes and refined set ups.\r\n\r\n<b>Why it was made this way:</b>\r\nWhether you want to stack your bar height to the moon, or want to maintain your current height but loose the spacers for a cleaner looking set up we make four sizes of the Moto bars to fit your needs. The bars are also wider as they grow taller to meet the needs for wider bars which provide more stability and leverage. The bigger box shape like their name pays homage to the large box styles of BMX bars early on. While the box shape is larger, we managed to maintain our signature large radius bends, which have been present since our first set of Hot Bars in 2005; these larger radius bends  add to the over all strength of the bar.\r\n\r\n<b>Specs:</b>\r\n-11 butted\r\n-Made of post weld heat treated chromoly\r\n-Threaded for use with Tree bar ends, but works with any bar end\r\n\r\n<b>Sizes:</b>\r\n- 10\" Tall x 30.5\" wide\r\n\r\n- 12˚ backsweep\r\n- 1˚ or 4˚ upsweep\r\n\r\n<b>Color:</b>\r\nBlack or Matte Clear","options":[{"id":43627635,"name":"Black 10\" x 4* upsweep","price":94.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43627638,"name":"Black 10\" x 1* upsweep","price":94.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43627641,"name":"Raw 10\" x 4* upsweep","price":94.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43627644,"name":"Raw 10\" x 1* upsweep","price":94.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.7,"amount_with_others":3.35,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.95,"amount_with_others":6.7}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124403664/-/Super_Moto_Bars.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124403664/-/Super_Moto_Bars.JPG","width":3198,"height":1936},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124403655/-/photo.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124403655/-/photo.JPG","width":1224,"height":1224}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2430443,"name":"HARD GOODS","permalink":"hard-goods","url":"/category/hard-goods"},{"id":2394911,"name":"Bars","permalink":"bars","url":"/category/bars"}]},{"id":13480749,"name":"Sun Rims","permalink":"sun-rims","position":11,"price":49.99,"default_price":49.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sun-rims","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-10T19:30:30.000Z","description":"Lace your Tree hubs up to some of the best rims in the business!

So I decided to design my own.\r\nFirst we made the Thin Ergo seat because I think the rise in fat seat popularity is partly because people wanted a more comfortable seat. So the logic is just make the foam thicker. But just putting more foam on a seat doesn’t make it feel better if it’s the wrong shape. \r\n\r\n<b>HOW IS THIS PART DESIGNED SO THAT IT SOLVES THOSE ISSUES? \r\nAND WHAT OTHER IMPOVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE?</b> \r\nWe decided that if we could make a thin seat more comfortable then we could make a fat seat even more comfortable. The Fat Ergo seat has custom designed foam to be the perfect shape. It is ergonomically contoured to be as comfortable as possible. Watch the video to see the work that went in to getting the shape just right.

The outside diameter of the barends match the grips diameter, this reduces the amount of dirt that can get under the grips. The barend is made of 7075 T6 aluminum and is a simple bolt that can be tightened down with a 6mm Allen key, very tight, so they will not fall out while riding.\r\n\r\nUse instructions:\r\n\r\nOne size fits most. Barends can be used on handlebars with .065” thick ends, but please be cautious on multi-butted bars if they are cut down more than ½” width from original width because the tubing is thinner in the grip section of the handlebar. In this area the ID is too big for the tap to cut threads into it and the barend will strip out and be useless. Sorry, Sunday bikes handlebars are not compatible with Tree Barends.\r\n\r\nTo use these barends your handlebars must have a 20 x 1.5mm threads inside of the end of the bar. Since only Tree bars come with threading, all other bars will need to be tapped out. All mailorders and some bike shops will have the tap to thread your bars with. If your local bikeshop does not have the tap necessary to tap your handlebars please ask them to contact us to so they can get one. The most common way of getting the bars tapped out when ordering through mailorder is when purchasing a new set. But for a local bikeshop it is much easier to show up and have your current bars tapped as well as have a brand new pair tapped.\r\n\r\nSpecs.\r\n    \r\n    7075 T6 Aluminum\r\n    Threaded to prevent falling out\r\n    COLORS - Black\r\n\r\n    20 x 1.5mm thread into handlebar\r\n    6mm allen wrench hole\r\n    Head diameter is the same diameter as the grip\r\n    WEIGHT - 1.1oz.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":34320207,"name":"Black","price":13.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49677948,"name":"Blue","price":13.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49677951,"name":"Gold","price":13.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49677954,"name":"Red","price":13.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49677957,"name":"Silver -SOLD OUT!","price":13.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.7,"amount_with_others":3.35,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.95,"amount_with_others":6.7}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/107374425/-/Barends.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/107374425/-/Barends.jpg","width":716,"height":466}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2430443,"name":"HARD GOODS","permalink":"hard-goods","url":"/category/hard-goods"},{"id":5212425,"name":"Barends","permalink":"barends","url":"/category/barends"}]},{"id":8850092,"name":"Moto Bars","permalink":"moto-bars","position":38,"price":94.99,"default_price":94.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/moto-bars","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-08T22:50:20.000Z","description":"<b>Reason for making it:</b>\r\nWe made the Moto bars because we wanted an all around bar with the more classic styling of  bigger boxed bars that could handle the abuse of street, the boost of the trails, and anything in between. We made these bars with the same sweep options as all of our previous handlebars, but with three different height and width options so you can find the ones that best fit your set up in todays world of growing bar sizes and refined set ups.\r\n\r\n<b>Why it was made this way:</b>\r\nWhether you want to stack your bar height to the moon, or want to maintain your current height but loose the spacers for a cleaner looking set up we make three sizes of the Moto bars to fit your needs. The bars are also wider as they grow taller to meet the needs for wider bars which provide more stability and leverage. The bigger box shape like their name pays homage to the large box styles of BMX bars early on. While the box shape is larger and the height and width come in three sizes, we managed to maintain our signature large radius bends, which have been present since our first set of Hot Bars in 2005; these larger radius bends  add to the over all strength of the bar.\r\n\r\n<b>Specs:</b>\r\n-11 butted\r\n-Made of post weld heat treated chromoly\r\n-Threaded for use with Tree bar ends, but works with any bar end\r\n\r\n<b>Sizes:</b>\r\n- 8.5\"tall/28.5wide, 9\"tall/29.5\"wide, 9.5\"tall/30\"wide\r\n\r\n- 12˚ backsweep\r\n- 1˚ or 4˚ upsweep\r\n\r\n<b>Color:</b>\r\nBlack or Matte Clear\r\n\r\n<b>Weight:</b>\r\n8.5\" - 28.2oz\r\n9\" - 28.7oz\r\n9.5\" - 29.7oz","options":[{"id":27780860,"name":"Black 8.5\" x 1* Upsweep","price":94.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":27780866,"name":"Black 8.5\" x 4* Upsweep","price":94.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":27780872,"name":"Black 9.0\" x 1* Upsweep","price":94.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":27780878,"name":"Black 9.0\" x 4* Upsweep","price":94.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":27780884,"name":"Black 9.5\" x 1* Upsweep ","price":94.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":27780893,"name":"Black 9.5\" x 4* Upsweep","price":94.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":27780863,"name":"Raw 8.5\" x 1* Upsweep","price":94.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":27780869,"name":"Raw 8.5\" x 4* Upsweep","price":94.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":27780875,"name":"Raw 9.0\" x 1* Upsweep","price":94.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":27780881,"name":"Raw 9.0\" x 4* Upsweep","price":94.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":27780887,"name":"Raw 9.5\" x 1* Upsweep","price":94.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":27780890,"name":"Raw 9.5\" x 4* Upsweep","price":94.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.7,"amount_with_others":4.3,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":17.2,"amount_with_others":8.7}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87028121/-/tree_bars_raw_3_jpg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87028121/-/tree_bars_raw_3_jpg.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87028049/-/tree_bars_blk_3_jpg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87028049/-/tree_bars_blk_3_jpg.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87028307/-/tree_bars_raw_2_jpg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87028307/-/tree_bars_raw_2_jpg.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87028325/-/DSC_0301.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87028325/-/DSC_0301.JPG","width":1000,"height":665}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2430443,"name":"HARD GOODS","permalink":"hard-goods","url":"/category/hard-goods"},{"id":2394911,"name":"Bars","permalink":"bars","url":"/category/bars"}]},{"id":6958225,"name":"Collet Stem: Drop Load","permalink":"collet-stem-drop-load","position":39,"price":30.99,"default_price":30.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/collet-stem-drop-load","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-08-13T23:16:32.000Z","description":"SPECS\r\n•\tMade of 7075 T6 CNC machined aluminum \r\n•\tcollet steertube clamp\r\n•\tsmooth and compact design\r\n•\tmade by high tech 3D surface contour CNC machining\r\n\r\nSIZE\r\n•\tLength 53mm\r\n•\tRise: 8.4mm\r\n•\tStack height 30mm\r\n\r\nCOLORS \r\n•\tBlack, Blue, Red, Gold, or Raw \r\n\r\nWEIGHT\r\n•\t8.1oz/229g \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY MAKE THIS PART?\r\n\r\nI wanted to create a knee friendly stem that worked well and did not damage the steertube on your forks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW IS THIS PART DESIGNED SO THAT IT SOLVES THOSE ISSUES? \r\nAND WHAT OTHER IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE?\r\n \r\nThis stem is designed using a collet compression wedge device.

All the Tree bolts withstood 2 to 6 times the torque of 15 lb/ft, which is the point of a headset being so tight that it does not spin freely. That's tighter than anyone would want their headset to be. Generally people usually tighten their headset to 5 lb/ft which means that there is no concern of them breaking. Our headset caps are guaranteed against breaking.\r\n\r\nHEX KEY:\r\n\r\n ¼” stepped to a 6mm Allen Key hole. This allows the use of either a standard or a metric Allen key for the same bolt. The reason for this was to make adjusting the headset tension less of a hassle, since the bolt it's replacing is usually something that requires a crescent wrench. Our bolt allows the use of just one tool whether you have a stem with ¼\" or 6mm bolts. This is all in the pursuit of having fewer tools to lug around. The Allen key hole can withstand 55 lb/ft before distorting when the tool is properly seated.\r\n\r\nSIZES:\r\n\r\nH10, H18, H24, and H25.\r\n\r\nH10: Fits Fit, S&M, Standard, and the freestyle star nut.\r\n\r\nH18: Fits Failure ('06 and on), Macneil, Odyssey ('06 and earlier), Snafu, Cult Sect Fork, Sunday morning 1 & night 1 forks, We The People forks ('03 to '07).\r\n\r\nH24: FIts Black Label slimfast, Demolition concorde, Odyssey forks ('07 and newer), Primo, WTP ('08 & on),Sunday morning 2 & night 2 forks, Blue Six Bolo forks.\r\n\r\nH25: Fits BSD, Colony, Eastern, Fly Bikes, Federal, Hoffman, Kink, Nitrous afterburner, Premium taper lite, Shadow Conspiracy, Sputnic, Stolen, Subrosa, United, Verde, Volume feather weight & genesis forks, Amity RD forks, and Bone Deth Bottom Feeder forks.\r\n\r\n\r\n7075 T6 aluminum\r\n¼\" stepped to a 6mm universal allen key hole\r\nUsually lighter than stock headset cap bolts\r\nCOLORS - Black, Blue, Gold, Raw, Red\r\n\r\n\r\nWEIGHT - H10 - .39oz.\r\nWEIGHT - H18 - .1oz.\r\nWEIGHT - H24 - .6oz.\r\nWEIGHT - H25 - .6oz.\r\n","options":[{"id":22075047,"name":"BLACK","price":15.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":22075049,"name":"BLUE","price":15.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":22075051,"name":"GOLD","price":15.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":22075053,"name":"RAW","price":15.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":22075055,"name":"RED","price":15.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.7,"amount_with_others":3.35,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.4,"amount_with_others":6.7}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68369339/-/H25.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68369339/-/H25.jpg","width":716,"height":466}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2430443,"name":"HARD GOODS","permalink":"hard-goods","url":"/category/hard-goods"},{"id":2394919,"name":"REPLACEMENT PARTS","permalink":"replacement-parts","url":"/category/replacement-parts"},{"id":2681857,"name":"Headset Caps","permalink":"headset-caps","url":"/category/headset-caps"}]},{"id":15286071,"name":"Front Brake Headset cap H24 and H25","permalink":"front-brake-headset-cap-h24-and-h25","position":44,"price":10.99,"default_price":10.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/front-brake-headset-cap-h24-and-h25","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-12-03T01:49:46.000Z","description":"SPECS\r\n•\tMade of 7075 t6 aluminum\r\n•\tThese bolts have a stepped Allen key hole this allows the use of either a ¼” a 6mm Allen key for the same bolt.\r\n•\tLarge offset hole for brake cord to go through\r\n•\tLicensed US Pat.

I knew she had to be mine. I talked with her owner and we worked out a deal. I would do some welding work he needed done and in return the van was mine. I’ve had her for over six years now and In that span of that time I've had over 3 different motors in her, traveled across the country numerous times, and burned thousands of gallons of vegetable oil. She's been through a lot to say the least. It's like a second home to me. I chose this drawing of the grill of my van for a signature shirt because it's a big part of my life and my travels.”\r\n- Clint Reynolds\r\n","options":[{"id":49670880,"name":"XL","price":17.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.7,"amount_with_others":3.35,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.95,"amount_with_others":6.7}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128692518/-/tree_T_1_jpg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128692518/-/tree_T_1_jpg.jpg","width":3387,"height":2265}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2430433,"name":"SOFT GOODS","permalink":"soft-goods","url":"/category/soft-goods"},{"id":2371147,"name":"T Shirts","permalink":"t-shirts","url":"/category/t-shirts"}]},{"id":4303777,"name":"Swords Thermal","permalink":"swords-thermal","position":52,"price":5.99,"default_price":5.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/swords-thermal","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-08-23T02:04:57.000Z","description":"<p style=\"line-height:16px;\">The Sword shirt is the result of several different ideas I had coming together. I wanted to create a shirt that was more than just an image printed on a shirt.  I wanted it to be a symbol for something positive, and i wanted it to look cool and strong at the same time. A lot of my influence comes from the principles of sacred geometry, and from the ideas of self discovery and self transformation found in Alchemy.  There are three swords, three really is the magic number, but anyway, each of the swords is laid out 30 degrees apart from the next, this is according to the three main intersecting lines found in the Flower of Life Geometric Pattern. The sword is a symbol of clarity, it cuts through darkness and illusion to reveal more of the truth to us and help us grow as individuals.  Bringing all these ideas together accomplished my goals with the shirt, it has a message, and at the very least, swords are cool looking.  I laid out the design and asked Eben Fischer to draw it up, and there you have it, The Sword shirt. -Nathan</p>\r\n<hr style=\"margin-top:25px; margin-bottom:25px;\">\r\n<h2>SPECS</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Made and screen-printed in the USA</li>\r\n<li>Printed on American Apparel Baby Rib Thermal</li>\r\n<li>100% Fine Jersey cotton, combed for softness and comfort</li>\r\n<li>Flattering, stylish fit on virtually any body type</li>\r\n<li>COLORS - Steel Grey</li></ul>","options":[{"id":14166251,"name":"Small","price":5.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.7,"amount_with_others":6.7,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.95,"amount_with_others":13.95}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/42777809/-/swords-thermal.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/42777809/-/swords-thermal.jpg","width":716,"height":466},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/42777817/-/swords-thermal2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/42777817/-/swords-thermal2.jpg","width":716,"height":466}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2430433,"name":"SOFT GOODS","permalink":"soft-goods","url":"/category/soft-goods"},{"id":2371145,"name":"Hoodies","permalink":"hoodies","url":"/category/hoodies"},{"id":2371147,"name":"T Shirts","permalink":"t-shirts","url":"/category/t-shirts"},{"id":3601845,"name":"SALE ITEMS","permalink":"sale-items","url":"/category/sale-items"}]},{"id":5049369,"name":"Tree Web Store Gift Card","permalink":"tree-web-store-gift-card","position":53,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tree-web-store-gift-card","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-12-10T07:32:12.000Z","description":"Gift cards good towards any purchase on the web store.  \r\n\r\nCard will be mailed to you.","options":[{"id":16395007,"name":"$10.00","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16395009,"name":"$20.00","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":16395011,"name":"$50.00","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":16395013,"name":"$100.00","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49576691/-/giftcertificatestore.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49576691/-/giftcertificatestore.jpg","width":716,"height":466}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2430433,"name":"SOFT GOODS","permalink":"soft-goods","url":"/category/soft-goods"},{"id":2698093,"name":"Gift Card","permalink":"gift-card","url":"/category/gift-card"}]},{"id":5009119,"name":"Twigs N' Berries spokes","permalink":"twigs-n-berries-spokes","position":54,"price":16.99,"default_price":16.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/twigs-n-berries-spokes","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-12-05T11:33:11.000Z","description":"Stainless straight gauge and double butted spokes for Tree straight pull hubs. \r\n\r\nThe rear and front Tree hub use the same length spokes\r\n\r\nThese rims need 200mm length spokes\r\nERD\r\n388mm -Proper rim\r\n Alienation: Deviant, Skylark\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n389mm -Alex: Supra E lite,\r\nSun: Envy, Big City, Black Box, King Pin\r\n\t\t\r\n390mm -Alex: Supra J, Supra B\r\nDemolition: Zero\r\nFly Bikes: front rim \r\nSun: Envy\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPrimo: Balance 6061;
