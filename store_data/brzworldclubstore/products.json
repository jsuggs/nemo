The ultra-light weight construction decreases unsprung mass while the increased rigidity allows both higher clamping force and incredibly consistent pedal response. It features differential bore pistons to optimize car control during heavy braking. External hydraulic pipe design keeps the brake fluid temperature low by utilizing air-flow technology to increase the efficiency in heat dissipation. The result is a significantly lowered operating temperature of the caliper and a more balanced brake pressure to ensure vehicle stability. NEO Brake Systems are designed to meet your heavy duty braking needs in both road and track applications. At NEO, we test our products thoroughly on the road and on the track to bring you the confidence you need in your everyday road driving.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrake Pads\r\n\r\nNEO has developed a high performance, Taiwan-manufactured pad to match the upgraded performance of the brake system. Our brake ceramic pads are made from organic materials that are environmentally friendly. The Performance Silver pads are designed for everyday use without the need to change your brake pads for weekend track use. Our Performance Gold race pads are full carbon ceramic. It provides aggressive braking power with low brake noise and dust level. Our friction material is a special composite that is designed for NEO’s specific purpose. Under the Japanese Industrial Standard testing, our silver and gold pads both achieve consistent 0.51μ and 0.60μ in operating temperature range up to 662 degree F. It is capable of sustaining a high coefficient of friction over a wide temperature range for all kinds of high performance road and track applications.\r\n\r\nRotors\r\n\r\nLower rotational mass. Two-piece rotor design is generally 12-16% lighter than one piece design\r\nCooler Disc Surface. Ventilation holes between the hat and the disc to air cool the disc surface\r\nFull Sliding Design.

ProECU Programming Kits can be purchased from any EcuTek Master Tuner. \r\n\r\nAt its simplest, the programming kit can be used for diagnostics and datalogging. However, the kit's most impressive feature is to allow EcuTek Master Tuners to remotely tune customer vehicles. The Master Tuner supplies suitable ROM files to the vehicle owner. The customer can use the kit to program these ROM files into their own car. If any fine tuning is required, the customer can data log the car and send these logs to the Master Tuner, in order to assist with the tuning process. \r\nThe ProECU Programming Kit is licensed for non-commercial use only. \r\n\r\nThe ProECU Programming Kit does NOT allow ROM file viewing or editing. It is a data logging and programming tool only. \r\nDiagnostics & Data Logging \r\nThe ProECU Programming Kit comes bundled with data logging for vehicles that you program with the aid of the EcuTek Master Tuner. EcuTek's ProECU Diagnostic Tools for Subaru and Nissan GTR are also included. \r\nSupported Vehicles \r\nThe list of vehicles supported by the ProECU Programming Kit is constantly growing. It will be added to as EcuTek develop support for further vehicles. \r\nECU Programming \r\nEach ECU programmed will require a flash license, which is supplied along with your ROM files by your chosen EcuTek Master Tuner. You can use your programming kit to program as many ECUs as you like. Share a programming kit with your friends or your car club - there's no need to buy kits for each vehicle you want to tune! \r\n\r\nTuning Support \r\nAs the manufacturer, EcuTek does not directly support retail customers - this is done through our network of Master Tuners. All ROM files, tuning and technical queries are handled by your chosen EcuTek Master Tuner. \r\n\r\nThe exact tuning services offered to the ProECU Retail Customer may be chosen by the EcuTek Master Tuner. However, as a minimum, the Master Tuner must help the customer with any software installation problems, provide a suitable ROM file, help the customer program in the ROM file and verify the tuning has been successful by getting the customer to produce a data log of the running car. \r\nFurther Applications \r\nManufacturers of hardware kits, such as supercharger, turbo and exhaust kits will find the ProECU Programming Kit to be an essential tool for helping their customers achieve the very best end result from the any mechanical upgrades to the vehicle. Manufacturers can supply the kit along with their parts, allowing the customer to reprogram their own ECU with a new calibration to perfectly match the supplied hardware upgrades. \r\n\r\nIt is quite acceptable to loan, rent or hire the programming kits for purposes such as this. The customer can then return the kit for re-use. However, after using the data logging tools, the customer is likely to want to keep their cable, so bear this in mind! \r\n\r\n\r\nMSRP: $399.00 \r\nSave $49.00","options":[{"id":44245335,"name":"ECUTEK PRO KIT","price":350.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44369958,"name":"LICENSE & TUNE","price":865.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.28,"amount_with_others":2.95,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":16.48,"amount_with_others":2.95}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124997505/-/ECUTEKPROKIT.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124997505/-/ECUTEKPROKIT.JPG","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6311592,"name":"ECU TUNING","permalink":"ecu-tuning","url":"/category/ecu-tuning"}]},{"id":13688577,"name":"ECUTEK STAGE 1 TUNE ","permalink":"ecutek-stage-1-tune","position":17,"price":300.0,"default_price":300.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ecutek-stage-1-tune","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-09-20T17:33:48.000Z","description":"ECUTEK STAGE 1 TUNE \r\n\r\nDetails: This is a tune only.
