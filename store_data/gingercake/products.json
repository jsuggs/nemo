The pillow shape makes him perfect to cuddle with during nap time or a lovely decoration in a nursery or in the easter basket.  The simple construction of the bunny makes it an excellent project for beginners but also fun for more experienced sewers.  \r\n\r\nThe finished bunny measures 11\" x 11\" not including 7 extra inches with the ears!   You will need regular cotton fabric, polyfil, buttons for eyes, yarn for the pom pom tail, cotton woven fusible interfacing, and a sewing machine!  The instructions are 12 pages long including full pattern pieces and plenty of colorful pictures.  You should be able to properly run your sewing machine, know very basic sewing terms and be able to do a little bit of hand sewing.  \r\n\r\nThis sweet bunny is modern in its simple shape but also reminds us of a folksy, handmade past.  I know you will enjoy creating this simple and beautiful bunny!\r\n","options":[{"id":18265267,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55819941/-/bunnytitle.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55819941/-/bunnytitle.jpg","width":773,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55819525/-/IMG_1618.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55819525/-/IMG_1618.jpg","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55820341/-/2_turquoise_bunnies.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55820341/-/2_turquoise_bunnies.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55820373/-/3_bunnies_right.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55820373/-/3_bunnies_right.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55820413/-/turquoise_bunny.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55820413/-/turquoise_bunny.jpg","width":667,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2806387,"name":"pillows","permalink":"pillows","url":"/category/pillows"}]},{"id":5536071,"name":"3 Layer Clutch PDF Sewing Pattern","permalink":"new-3-layer-clutch-pdf-sewing-pattern","position":3,"price":9.0,"default_price":9.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/new-3-layer-clutch-pdf-sewing-pattern","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-02-23T19:40:10.000Z","description":"This is a PDF Sewing Pattern.  Once your purchase is complete, you will immediately receive an email with a link to download the pattern.  Download onto your computer and get sewing right away!\r\n\r\nI originally created this wallet for myself since I wanted to have a piece that I could keep in my bag or just bring the wallet alone.  I loved the idea of layers to make this wallet multifunctional- wallet, zippered pouch and notebook.  I have been using this wallet for months now and I love it!  It has all that I need and I love the versatility of carrying it in my purse or just using it as a clutch. \r\n\r\nThis sewing pattern is full of pictures and simple descriptions.  I would not recommend printing it out since the pictures would use up lots of your ink!   Instead, you can easily follow using your tablet or computer in your sewing room.   Printing out the final page as a reference guide would be helpful though.  For those sewers who are more visual, most of the steps are not only written but are clearly explained in pictures.  \r\n\r\nThis is a simple project but it does require some skills that are beyond the very beginning stage of sewing.  It is not suitable for a first project!  You need to have mastered a few basic skills and and be able to understand basic sewing language.  These skills include gathering, using a zipper foot (although you could hand sew the zipper with the same result), understanding terms like seam allowance, right sides of fabric, and being able to sew a confident straight line.  Easy!  \r\n\r\nThe magic of creating 3 layers is so fun and will teach you lots of new simple sewing skills.  The first layer is a traditional wallet that features 6 credit card/ business card pockets and a 2 large pockets that are the perfect size for a check book and cash.  The lined zippered pouch is a great size to hold loose change, pens, your phone, lipstick, a mirror or whatever you choose!  The 3rd layer is a covered notebook in the standard 5 x 7\" size.  Perfect for making your lists, writing quick notes or jotting down ideas.  This section also features 2 more pockets that can be used for coupons, receipts or business cards.  The clutch is finished off with a fold over flap and magnetic snap.  The final size of the folded clutch is about 8\" by 6.5\".\r\n\r\nMaterial requirements include a combined 1/2 yard of coordinating cotton fabrics, fusible interfacing, duck cloth (recommended for its weight but not required), cotton batting, sewing machine with zig zag foot and zipper foot (again, you can get around this by hand sewing) and other basic sewing tools.  \r\n\r\nAre you ready to get sewing?  The possibilities of customizing this clutch to suit your needs are endless!   The result is a chic and super organized clutch!","options":[{"id":17833775,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54345389/-/clutchtitle.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54345389/-/clutchtitle.jpg","width":773,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54345477/-/IMG_1377.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54345477/-/IMG_1377.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54345565/-/IMG_1386.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54345565/-/IMG_1386.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54345701/-/2_clutches.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54345701/-/2_clutches.jpg","width":639,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54346069/-/IMG_1443.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54346069/-/IMG_1443.jpg","width":640,"height":427}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2806415,"name":"organizers","permalink":"organizers","url":"/category/organizers"}]},{"id":4980685,"name":"Annie's Penguin Pillow PDF Sewing Pattern","permalink":"annie-s-penguin-pillow-pdf-sewing-pattern","position":4,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/annie-s-penguin-pillow-pdf-sewing-pattern","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-12-01T10:16:32.000Z","description":"My daughter Anne loves penguins- wait, don't ALL kids love penguins?

No more trash to throw away after your lunch. Have you noticed how it really adds up? This is how you can start to make a difference!\r\n\r\nI designed this bag for my 9 year old niece who is recycling maniac! She already had a bag she brought to school but wanted one that hold her water bottle, sandwich and snack without everything getting all smooshed together. This bag does it all! It is meant to hold a sandwich, a snack bag, a small water bottle or drink, an apple, & a small yogurt. Obviously you can change all of this to fit your own lunch diet or your child's.\r\n\r\nThis is a pattern which you will receive electronically by email in PDF format. It is instructions for how to make your own lunch bag. You will receive the email as soon as you complete your order. Start sewing right away! \r\n\r\nThe finished bag measures 9.5\" tall by 9\" wide when full of lunch. It has a large interior pocket that fits a standard size snack bag. There is a divider in the middle to keep thing organized . A  velcro flap closure keeps everything closed.   Materials needed are cotton fabrics, insulbrite batting (for insulation to keep that lunch cold or hot!), fusible interfacing, velcro & thread.\r\n\r\nThe color and fabric combination choices are endless! You could also just use this bag as a purse and use the knowledge you gain from making this to make larger and smaller bags, add extra pockets, and custom fit it to your needs. \r\n\r\nIt is so important for kids (and adults!) to learn the benefits of creating less waste. What could be better than a fun sewing project that also helps them learn about doing their part for the planet?","options":[{"id":9878076,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67259877/-/WFLB_title.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67259877/-/WFLB_title.jpg","width":773,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67259997/-/empty_interior_lunch_bag.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67259997/-/empty_interior_lunch_bag.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67259957/-/3_lunch_bags.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67259957/-/3_lunch_bags.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67259973/-/all_five_lunch_bags.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67259973/-/all_five_lunch_bags.jpg","width":1000,"height":716},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67260053/-/open_lunch_bag_with_lunch.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67260053/-/open_lunch_bag_with_lunch.jpg","width":1000,"height":799}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2806389,"name":"lunch bags","permalink":"lunch-bags","url":"/category/lunch-bags"}]},{"id":2845859,"name":"Make Your Getaway Duffle Children and Adult Sizes!","permalink":"make-your-getaway-duffle-children-and-adult-size","position":16,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/make-your-getaway-duffle-children-and-adult-size","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-11-06T23:44:10.000Z","description":"This is a listing for you to purchase a PDF pattern/ ebook that will be sent directly to your email. You will receive the email as soon as you complete your order. Start sewing right away! \r\n\r\nI have a piece of stiff red luggage that has wheels that i take on the airplane for trips. I pack it up when i am going to check my bag and I know it will get the job done. But Ugh! It is ugly and not fun. Now that so many of us just do carry on and drive where we want to go, that ugly old luggage can be put high up in the attic.\r\n\r\nThis cute piece of luggage is so versatile and easy, you will be making matching duffles for everyone is your family! (maybe something in solid for your husband??). The directions are full of pictures and simple explanations. It is a great size for a 5 -7 day trip the beach or to visit family. The size can also be easily be adjusted to fit your needs. Optional interior pocket instructions are included.\r\n\r\nI have also included pattern pieces for child's size duffle. This size can also be used for you for a weekend and as compliment to your larger duffle. You can also adjust this bag yourself to create all different sizes!  The bags are great sizes, the larger is 19 1/2\" wide x 14 1/2\" tall x 7 1/2\" deep and the smaller is 18\" wide x 12 1/2\" tall x 5\" deep\r\n\r\nThe bag can be made with bright stylish cottons, canvas, upholstery fabric, or even a wool. You can choose to include the lining or not. Pockets are very easy to add if you choose.\r\nThe base is a quilted piece for extra strength. The closing is a zipper which you can hand sew or use your machine.\r\n\r\nYou may sell bags made from this pattern on a small handmade scale. I would greatly appreciate credit for the pattern.
