I was able to do some letter art with Isaiah and instead of just writing Isaiah 40:31 I used roman numerals, a good conversation starter haha for those who dont know numerals. I also tried using the Salt and Light from the #1 Design and plan on using the lightbulb and saltshaker as the company's mascot. :)\r\nI hope you are encouraged and blessed to Soar!\r\n\r\nIsaiah 40:31 (niv)\r\nbut those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength.
