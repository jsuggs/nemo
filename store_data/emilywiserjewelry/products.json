You can choose blue, purple, green, pink, or red colored handwriting on it. The locket is brass and copper and comes on a sterling silver chain. You can choose a 16, 18, or 20 inch chain. I color the locket also (this is called patina). \r\n\r\nChoose Color of Writing and Color of Patina:\r\nBlue\r\nPurple\r\nGreen\r\nPink\r\nRed\r\n\r\nYou may choose your own words to be engraved. I suggest the names of loved ones and/or special dates like anniversary and birthdates. Inspirational quotations or phrases from your wedding vows are also a good choice. This locket is about 1.5 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nI've engraved this locket with an original poem that I wrote. The locket itself is made of vintage brass and copper. I've applied different patinas, and then colored selected parts with pencil. I've lacquered the locket to seal in the color.\r\n\r\nSince this is a locket for wearing (gently). I will not engrave or color the back of the locket. If you intend to put pictures on the inside, let me know and I will not engrave or color the inside. I do put a lacquer on the locket in order to protect the patina / coloring. As long as you handle the locket gently, the lacquer will not wear off (except for the very back). As for the lacquer on the back wearing off, you may either relacquer it at home with clear nail polish, or send it back to me for touchups for a minimal charge. You can also let the lacquer wear off in the back, which allows the brass to patina and gives it some character. I suggest this as the best way.\r\n\r\nThis locket is one of a kind. This particular locket has become part of one of my larger projects called Souls and Rain Curtain. Your locket will look different because of the randomness of the patina. But it will have the blue words on it and have the same degree/extent of patination.\r\n\r\nI'm limited as to the number of photos I can upload for each item on Etsy, so I'm putting up more photos of the lockets on my website http://www.crazypenguin.com/jewelry . Or, you can email me for additional photos.\r\n\r\nThe poem engraved on the locket reads\r\nI surfed on the wave,\r\nthe white and blue wave,\r\nthe wind blowing past my wet face,\r\nbrown and wrinkled from the sea water,\r\nwater which is eternal and unchanging,\r\nwater which is endless,\r\nexisting in infinite time,\r\nexpanding in infinite space.\r\n\r\nSee me making jewelry from scratch on Home and Garden TV!\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJvUp5ltOSU\r\n\r\nThis is a custom-made, made-to-order item and takes about 3 weeks to make.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":42983430,"name":"Blue #nmmmp1","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":42983433,"name":"Purple #nmmmp2","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":42983436,"name":"Green #nmmmp3","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":42983439,"name":"Pink #nmmmp4","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":42983442,"name":"Red #nmmmp5","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123957918/-/blue_locket.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123957918/-/blue_locket.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123957921/-/blue_locket1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123957921/-/blue_locket1.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123957924/-/green_locket.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123957924/-/green_locket.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123957927/-/pink_locket.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123957927/-/pink_locket.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123957930/-/purple_locket.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123957930/-/purple_locket.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5543748,"name":"Necklaces & Chains","permalink":"necklaces-chains","url":"/category/necklaces-chains"},{"id":5876325,"name":"Engraving etc.","permalink":"engraving-etc","url":"/category/engraving-etc"}]},{"id":13428072,"name":"Black Diamond Studs, Sterling Silver #esssm4","permalink":"black-diamond-studs-sterling-silver-esssm4","position":70,"price":120.0,"default_price":120.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/black-diamond-studs-sterling-silver-esssm4","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-08T00:21:35.000Z","description":"3mm black diamonds set in sterling silver.

A luminous 8mm wide moonstone set in a handmade 14k white palladium gold setting. Moonstone sits delicately on a 14k white palladium gold hammered band. \r\n\r\n14k white palladium gold is gold with *no* nickel in the alloy. instead of nickel as the whitening agent, they use palladium. Palladium is a member of the platinum family. Palladium gold is whiter than nickel white gold. It achieves the high white metal look found in jewelry stores without plating. (Most jewelry stores plate their white gold with rhodium to get the high white color).\r\n\r\nI can also saw heart shapes outside of the back of the setting. When you take the ring off and hold it up to the light, there will be two light white hearts glowing inside the moonstone. When you put the ring back on, no light shines through the back, so the hearts disappear. Discreet, and just for you and your fiance.\r\n\r\nMy hammered 1mm and 2mm wedding bands will fit flush against this ring, making a perfect wedding set. \r\n\r\nMoonstone was a popular stone used in Art Nouveau jewelry of the 1920's.
