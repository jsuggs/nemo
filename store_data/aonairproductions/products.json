The five piece are collectively made up of Cris Bissell (drums), Logan Hauser (vocals), Erik Bolstad (guitar), Tim Bradley (guitar) and Will Strickland (bass).  Adam Clemens (Iron Thrones) also makes an appearance on ‘In Tides, I Wake’.\r\n\r\nThe band recently unleashed their second offering entitled Avohfasih, forty six minutes of positive aural brutality.  The concept of grieving is touched upon with such favourableness and beautiful musicianship, the ferociousness in Hauser’s vocals can be mistaken for bitterness if you did not read the lyrics, yet the album looks at the concept of loss in such an admiring and positive light.  Quite impressive, how the group manage to channel this awesome power in a direction much less travelled by artists of this genre.\r\n\r\n‘In Depths I Sink’ is an At The Gates style pummeling, whereas the closing ‘A New Awakening’ is a much calmer affair, although still tremendously heavy and wonderfully uplifting.\r\n\r\nThe limited edition physical copy of AVOHFASIH was put together completely by the band itself. Every last copy was printed, folded, stapled, glued, and finally wax sealed shut by the band. It includes a 16 panel booklet with corresponding photography by the band, all lyrics, and is hand numbered 1-300.\r\n\r\nAll paper materials used are 100% recycled.\r\n\r\n*less than 4 remaining*","options":[{"id":27012735,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.8,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84655629/-/Orwell_-_Avohfasih.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84655629/-/Orwell_-_Avohfasih.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[{"id":161829,"name":"Orwell","permalink":"orwell","url":"/artist/orwell"}],"categories":[{"id":3844029,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
