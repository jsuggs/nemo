They stand up beautifully as they're made from top quality tapestry and upholstery fabrics, and have a generous pleated base....they are, in a way...a portable pocket. No knitter can have too many!

Amazing, very special upholstery fabric with a jet black background and chickens (!) done in shades of yellow, marmalade red, turquoise, aqua and cinnamon.

On one side are three deep fully lined interior pockets and on the other side, is a large pocket that runs the width of the bag and has a magnetic closure. Like a bag within a bag, creating a lot of new space! All pockets are lined in a coordinating stripe.
