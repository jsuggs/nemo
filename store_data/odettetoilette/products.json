With over twenty ingredients preserved over months to intensify their innate fragrances, this blend is for those after a true olfactory adventure. It is homely, sophisticated, and utterly unusual.</h4>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div id=\"tabs-2\">\r\n        <p>\r\n<p>Each pot contains over two litres of rose petals, macerated until heady. This heart is surrounded by invigorating aromatics including lemon verbena, mint, Russian coriander, bay, sweet marjoram and cured lemon peel. Resins of benzoin, storax and tonka bean bring warmth and comfort. </p></p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div id=\"tabs-3\">\r\n        <p>The pot pourri's midnight-black clay pot has been hand-made in an artisinal pottery near York.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Remove the cork stopper whenever you wish to release the scent. Kept safely, the fragrance will last for months.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"morelinks\">\r\n<h2 class=\"textbg\"><a  href=\"http://www.odettetoilette.com/pot-pourri/photos\">See more Photographs</a></h2>\r\n<h2 class=\"textbg\"><a  href=\"http://www.odettetoilette.com/pot-pourri/ingredients\">Discover the ingredients</a></h2>\r\n<h2 class=\"textbg\"><a  href=\"http://www.odettetoilette.com/deliveries/\">Delivery Info</a></h2>\r\n<h2 class=\"textbg\"><a  href=\"http://www.odettetoilette.com/terms-and-conditions-refunds\">Ts&Cs and Returns</a></h2>\r\n</div>","options":[{"id":25018809,"name":"Default","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.69,"amount_with_others":3.69,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/77860572/-/PotPourriPic.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/77860572/-/PotPourriPic.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/77860560/-/2012_10_05_7295_under_1MG.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/77860560/-/2012_10_05_7295_under_1MG.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/77860536/-/2012_10_05_7291_nologo_under1mg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/77860536/-/2012_10_05_7291_nologo_under1mg.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
