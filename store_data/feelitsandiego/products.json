This particular house happens to be the historical Star Theater in downtown Portland Oregon. Built in 1911, the theater has a rich and seedy past. Known for many years as a house of ill-repute it hosted burlesque in the 40s (regularly featuring such legendary dancers as Tempest Storm, Candy Renee and Arabella Andre), adult films in the 60s, and an all nude revue in the 70s and 80s. Ultimately the building was shut down and left empty after being busted for housing a ''modern day speakeasy''. In 2011, 100 years after erection, the building was remodeled to look as it did in its heyday. The old neon marquee was rebuilt and the interior fully restored. The Historic Star Theater now hosts live concerts, variety shows, and of course burlesque. Cooper cut her performance teeth as a burlesque singer in Portland and jumped at the chance to play a show at this beautiful venue with a sordid past in the City of Roses.\r\n\r\nCOOPER\r\nIt has been a year and a half since Cooper packed up her VW van in Portland, OR and made the quest to Nashville, TN. The flame haired songstress had paid her dues in Portland playing in several bands, working two jobs to pay for college, and moonlighting as a burlesque performer at the wildly popular Sinferno Cabaret downtown. It was time to take a shot at her lifetime dream of recording her songs and forming a road band in music city. After months of knocking on doors, typical hard luck, and sleeping on an air mattress in a 60's hotel room-turned studio apartment, Cooper was able to make some headway. She assembled a twelve piece soul band in both Nashville and Portland and began rehearsing both. She started writing the record she had always dreamed of making, drawing from her love of old Soul and Motown records and her 60's and 70's Rock n Roll influences. Cooper played her first gig in Nashville opening for the Queen of Rock and Roll herself: Wanda Jackson, at a birthday bash held for fashion icon Manuel. Her music caught the ear of music industry notables and she recorded her full length album at one of Nashville's top recording studios: The Tracking Room.\r\n\r\nSIDE A- I WANNA LOVE YOU\r\nA retro nod to the likes of Ike and Tina Tuner, ''I Wanna Love You'' packs a punch. Sprinkled with soulful snaps and groovy back up vocals, the song sneaks up on the listener like a sugary spoonful of turpentine. Cooper's buttery vocals glide over the melody, then suddenly blast into a wild fit of raspy funk and sexy abandon. The thick bass line holds down the groove while the horns pour over the top. This dynamic and explosive tune fills the beautiful arched ceiling of the Star Theater and reflects off of the excited crowd lucky enough to have been there that night. The mix is sweet and is the type of music that was made to go straight to vinyl.\r\n\r\nSIDE B- BABY I LOVE YOU\r\nCooper covers this Aretha Franklin superhit with a tenacity not many young women can muster. Her powerful voice is soaked in soul and belts the tune with a voluptuous ease. This live recording is warm and full. The band is smokin' hot and includes a ripping tenor sax solo as well as a funky slap bass breakdown.

Country-rock was still in its formative stage and was certainly considered a commercial risk. The result was stunning. “Lyin’ Down the Middle” unveiled itself as an infectious, uptempo country rocker, featuring one of Gene Clark’s most inspired vocals and further enhanced by future-Eagle Bernie Leadon’s supremely tasteful guitar-picking. For a follow-up single release just a few short months later, Dillard & Clark cut the lushly orchestrated Clark composition “Why Not Your Baby.\" Boasting gorgeous harmonies and soaring strings, the recording remains one of the strongest in Clark's repertoire, and one of the finest examples of the sound of country meeting rock.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, both “Lyin’ Down the Middle” and “Why Not Your Baby” were issued ONLY as single sides at the time by A&M; they were not included on any original Dillard & Clark album. Proudly presented here from the original A&M mono masters, this re-imagined single reveals Dillard & Clark sailing forefront of the nascent California country-rock movement.\r\n\r\nTRACK LIST:\r\n1.

Internal band struggles had brought Gene down and he just wanted to feel better, a whole lot better, in fact. Thus, in early 1966, Gene flew solo and started recording his solo debut album for Columbia with trusted musical cohorts the Gosdin Brothers on backing vocals. From these sessions, a promotional single was pulled, “Echoes” b/w “I Found You,” with both sides written by Clark. The A-side features a tasteful orchestral arrangement by Wrecking Crew stalwart Leon Russell, supporting a declarative vocal by Clark. The lyrics, and their delivery, belie a distinct Dylan influence, proving that Gene had been paying close attention as the Byrds had filtered Bob’s missives for the masses. The B-side revolves around a snaky guitar duel laid down by Jerry Cole and Glen Campell while Clark and the Gosdins sing heavenly harmonies over the top. This should-have-been chart topper frustratingly failed to make a big impact at radio, having been sideswiped by the near-simultaneous release of The Byrds’ Younger Than Yesterday album. The single, along with its picture sleeve, became a prized item, as generations of Gene’s loyal acolytes searched for copies of this elusive gem. It is for these faithful followers that Sundazed has painstakingly recreated this single in a strictly limited edition for Black Friday. Sourced from the original analog tapes, bedecked with the Columbia promo labels and packaged in a replica of the promotional picture sleeve, this Sundazed single is destined to take its place among Clark’s most highly desired releases.\r\n\r\n• Official “Black Friday” 2012 Limited Edition release\r\n• Recreation of ultra-rare promo picture sleeve!\r\n• First EVER commercial release of this incredibly rare 45!\r\n\r\nTRACK LIST:\r\n1.

At 19 he moved to San Francisco and enrolled in the Interdisciplinary Program at the San Francisco Art Institute. In 1996 Soule became the Art Director and Co-founder of FIT Skateboards and Civilian Clothing. After art directing the brands for a number of years, he sold his portion of the business to pursue art full-time.

A graduate and former instructor at the Ringling School of Art and Design, Chris is now a painter and sculptor of all manner of critters that grace canvases as well as toy and print platforms.
