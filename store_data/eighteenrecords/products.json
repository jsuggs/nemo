SPRAY\r\nThe Catholics had to invent time travel or be attacked by Dr Krang just so they could snow upon our brain cells so much. At times as savage as a charging T.Rex and as doomed as a dyind succubus, they always keep their Jack the ripper’s lancet sharp fuzz guitar sound at hand.\r\nNonetheless, it is challenging to try and recite the composing elements of such a sound nebula. From bad KFC lunch memory fueled balads to the wailing laments of a disarrayed gallant, these four boys surf on grimy waters.\r\nSkipping from paradoxes to oxymorons and having fun with it, the Catholic Spray feels just like the wild bunch cast away in the lost world.\r\n\r\nASSASSINS88/TV COLOURS\r\nOne part noise, two parts punk, and one part pop, Assassins88 and TV Colours come from Canberra, Australia. The meeting of these two bands is as much of a kickass gutterpunk noise band as it is a glorious nostalgic pop punk band.

It’s punk with absolutely no pose, and honestly, this is pop done through a punk lens and it works perfectly. Shogun, the singer, is as manic a vocalist as ever before but has the best voice I’ve ever witnessed in person. The music doesn’t slack either, and though the arrangements are slightly amateurish at times, it all seems to work out exactly the way I hope it does through the course of the tunes.
