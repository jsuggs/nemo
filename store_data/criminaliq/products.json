Primitive and rythmic, Claw Toe sound like arty Troggs fans armed with a synthesizer.  Mixing up a few styles of early punk and post-punk ala Joy Division with a rawer dirtier sound Claw Toe sound unique and pretty fucking bombastic.  The Boris Karloff style vocal delivery combines with subtle humour and stylish \"noir\" moments that fit nicely with their druggy throb.\r\n\r\nRecommended if you like - The Stranglers, Tall Boys, Alice Cooper, Killing Joke, Metal Urbain, Ministry, Bauhaus, Chrome, Stooges, Toy Dolls.\r\n\r\nREVIEWS\r\n\r\n2012 cracking EP from local lads, CLAW TOE. Starts out tense & grungey, dips its wick in some circuit bending synthetic fodderstomp, & ends up riding roughshod over glam/psyche territory...and that's just side one! Flip it over for the creepy-as-hell, \"Stalker\". This is some dark, death-dealing post-punk/proto-punk industrial racket for those of you into KILLING JOKE, MINISTRY, WIRE, PIL, and early WARSAW. On CRIMINAL IQ &... H I G H L Y R E C O M M E N D E D !!! - Reckless Records\r\n\r\nIf you suddenly awoke to find yourself bound and gagged in a basement with a guy wearing a butcher’s apron, most likely Claw Toe would be playing in the background. The band’s new self-titled EP (Criminal IQ) is what a peeping tom with ear buds would be cranking in the bushes. This is coked-up Harvey Keitel in Bad Lieutenant moaning naked in the mirror. This is football hooligans in skull masks ready to push 20 opposing fans down an escalator and to the hospital.  \r\n\r\nThe dark, creeping \"death punk\" of Claw Toe exists in a space in our brains we all have- the passing evil thoughts and uncomfortable realities of daily reality. That said, the wonderful thing about this band is  that there is also a subtle subtext of humor. This makes songs like “Geriatric Stalker” and the slice-of-life brutish honesty of “Self-Help For The Hopeless” so engaging.  As one is drawn into the lo-fi basement murk of Claw Toe, you realize each tune is a simple, masterful pop song in its’ own right.  \r\n\r\nSongwriter and singer Darius Hurley started the project as a home four track venture and on the new EP is backed on most songs by a smoking full band (members of Chicago’s Red Denizen.) The Toe’s sound is made up of chunky, wailing punk guitar, dark synths, distorted electronics and Hurley’s deep Cockney (Darius is a U.K. transplant) vocals that move from a drugged groan to a panic-stricken howl, to whatever the hell he’s doing on “The Drugs Song.”  \r\n\r\nThis 6 song howl from the depths is out on Criminal IQ Records, Darius’ long-running record label.  A tip of the hat is given to former label mates and early naughts Chicago punk destructors, The Functional Blackouts with a blown out, rusty razor take on the F.B.’s classic “Kamikaze”.\r\n\r\nFew groups are mining a sound like Claw Toe and you enter Hurley and Co.’s world, you’re hooked like a cow slab in a walk-in freezer.  - Lauries Planet of Sound\r\n","options":[{"id":21867817,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":14.5,"amount_with_others":7.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67689341/-/clawtoeepart.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67689341/-/clawtoeepart.jpg","width":1000,"height":970}],"artists":[{"id":28711,"name":"Claw Toe","permalink":"claw-toe","url":"/artist/claw-toe"}],"categories":[{"id":308758,"name":"Vinyl - Album","permalink":"vinyl-album","url":"/category/vinyl-album"}]},{"id":1647391,"name":"CLAW TOE - Ingrown Ego 7\"","permalink":"new-claw-toe-ingrown-ego-7","position":2,"price":4.99,"default_price":4.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/new-claw-toe-ingrown-ego-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-02-18T23:20:20.000Z","description":"Hi, I'm Mary.

Unreleased tracks from FNU RONNIES, SICK UMP, KILL THE HIPPIES. THE CURTAINS, WHITE LOAD, and FLYING TRICHECOS - 300 press.  All killer no filla gorilla\r\n\r\nHere's a review from Terminal Boredom\r\nGuess what? Compilation singles are back in vogue! Thanks, World's Lousy?! Criminal IQ's entry into the V/A sweepstakes blows its wad early with the best cut first, a new FNU Ronnies jammer called \"Ain't No Place\". Trebly troglodytian sci-fi punk rock. They could've used this cut for the punk rock episode of Dr. Who. Daleks attack and shit. Great. Sick Jump! are band #2, and actually play some good and shitty hardcore punk. \"Fuck Kids\" basically falls all over itself, guitar/drums/vox attack similar to Shoot It Up, but not near the SIU level of genius. Still decent though, shitty bandname aside. Kent, Ohio's greatest rock band Kill the Hippies close out side A with \"No Control But Dance Control\", a standard example of their nerdy punk rock. As good as many other KTH songs, a band I enjoy more in theory than on record most of the time. No idea who The Curtains are or where they are from, but they start Side B off with the post-punk stylings of \"Hidden Agenda\". Prominent bassline, phased-out guitar, effected vox, paranoid vibes. Not bad. White Load, a band whose tapes I'm very fond of, contribute \"Nothing is Funny\", an abrasive couple of minutes of Killed by Death meets Killed By Hardcore. I like the cut of their jib. Cleveland's disaster squad, Flying Trichecos, close out the disc with \"Recidivist\". Firstly, I'm amazed the word recidivist is in the any of the Trichecos' vocabulary. Secondly, this song is better than any of the cuts on their debut single. A choppy and angry pulsator of punkitude. What the fuck does that even mean? I dunno. But the Trichecos may be one of the few true punk bands left roaming the country's dive bars and basements in this day and age. Overall, a nice little snapshot of the current slate of bands that exist where hardcore and punk collide, with a couple curves thrown in (KTH and Curtains). And any new FNU Ronnies material is must-have in my book. Scum stats: 50 test press copies with photocopied sleeves, full-scale release coming shortly.(RK)\r\nMRR Review  Jan 2010\r\nSix band compilation featuring FNU RONNIES, SICK JUMP, KILL THE HIPPIES, CURTAINS, WHITE LOAD and Cleveland's answer to the VIVIAN GIRLS the FLYING TRICHECOS.  That's a whole lotta pent up Midwest sexual frustration crammed onto one mean 7\"  Not a shitty song in the bunch, and each is different enough that it doesn't suffer from being a washout of sound-alike bands.  You get thrashy, kinda garagey, post punky, KILL THE HIPPIES madness and then FLYING TRICHECOS blown out mess of shit.  It kinda comes off sounding like one of the better early 80's punk comps (punk, hardcore, whatever having a big luvfest) without being all bullshit retro about it. Fucking great record.

It's an impossible question.  They're all worth getting.  \r\n\r\nKill Moto makes a good start.  It has a nice blend of full-on wall of sound 4 piece band M.O.T.O. and lets bang on some pots and pans and record in the kitchen weirdness that catagorize some of M.O.T.O.'s  earlier recordings.\r\n\r\nSo yeah - BUY This one.   \r\n\r\nHere's some MOTOlove from the All Music Guide:\r\n\r\nSince 1988 M.O.T.O has mined an area of punk music that doesn't lend itself easily to vast commercial success. Think Ramones with more and better jokes. Of course, punk music is more known for its rebellion and political stances than its comedy. Sophomoric humor like \"Crystallize My Penis\" (From Single File), \"It Tastes Just Like A Milkshake\" (from E Pluribus MOTO), or \"Drunk On The Nectar of You\" (from This Corpse is a Warning) just might not fly with some of the more humorless in the punk crowd. And certainly not with commercial radio. This is not to say that you won't find social commentary on a M.O.T.O. album. It just flies by so fast that you might miss it if you blink. \"Who cares about the starving people that you see in the street each day,\" belts out Paul Caporino, the band's founder, on Kill M.O.T.O.s second track. \"I wanna dance, dance, dance, dance to the radio. Turn the radio on.\" The bass-driven song proceeds at a dizzying pace for just over 2 minutes (and that includes one of the most extended guitar breaks in the M.O.T.O. canon) until you realize that that is all the lyrics you're going to get. Short and to the point. And if you think that it's the dancing that Caporino really cares about, M.O.T.O. returns a few songs later with \"Choking On Your Insides\" (Gagging On The Edge of The World).\r\n\r\nRabid M.O.T.O fans (a loyal and surprisingly widespread bunch) who appreciate the jokes won't be disappointed in Kill M.O.T.O. though. The humor remains intact. There's the musically hilarious \"Got To Get Away From The Cops\", done as a sloppy skiffle tune. And the best bad pun I've heard in eons on \"Where's My Money At?\" \"I'm not patient. I don't need no doctor.\"","options":[{"id":1579755,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.99,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.99,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.99,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3183691/-/moto-kill-moto.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3183691/-/moto-kill-moto.jpg","width":708,"height":702}],"artists":[{"id":8848,"name":"M.O.T.O.","permalink":"m-o-t-o","url":"/artist/m-o-t-o"}],"categories":[{"id":307552,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":1057221,"name":"Criminal IQ Releases","permalink":"criminal-iq-releases","url":"/category/criminal-iq-releases"}]},{"id":4093401,"name":"Population 7\"","permalink":"population-7","position":8,"price":5.99,"default_price":5.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/population-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-07-15T04:47:07.000Z","description":"3 song debut EP from Chicago's Population, a band made up from members of other HC bands have now turned their skills to forming an authentic sounding early 80's goth band.

Spazzed-out chord changes, throbbing rhythms, caterwauling guitars, art-damaged keyboards, and tough love vocals all mix into some fucked up ELECTRIC EELS with prog chops head stew. This is thug rock n roll covered in a Day-Glo sheen of weird!\r\n\r\nTERRIBLE TWO TALK FROM VICTIMOFTIME.COM\r\n\r\nCriminal IQ Records has released the spine-cracking debut LP by Detroit's Terrible Twos this week, and with all of the jabbering on about their collision of the Piranhas' greatest moments, along with an acidic and breathtaking stab into the 21st century's limitless punk fusions, it's without a doubt, one of the Motor City's best full-length releases in a long time. Almost as if the power and slanted viciousness of their odd angles were as eruptive as an unpredictable volcano, the Terrible Twos really pulled it together into a tight foot-long of furious and erratic punk carnage that will be tough to follow. As one of the premier groups in the post-hype Detroit aftermath along with fellow bands, Red Red Red, Tyvek, Odd Clouds, and Human Eye, it always seemed like the Terrible Twos were the bunch that had the most ambition to get their noise to the outer regions, and were perpetually on the road, paying their dues and winning over new fans on a daily basis. You could even tell from their debut 7\" on X! Records that what they were doing was just slightly off on their own tangent, and despite all the comparisons and affiliations, it's now time to hold Terrible Twos in their own regard as one of the high points of 21st century Detroit punk.\r\n\r\nWith songwriting that angrily stands on it's own without deriving any more than a nuance here and there, this album emerges as an agitated ball of organ-fried ferocity that always seems to be spinning out of control, yet brings it all back home with a consistency and audacious blasting that's exactly what the world needs right now. Add in dual-fired vocals from Craig and Chris raging from both sides, and it's got the momentum to creep right into your skull and dissolve into your corrupted core value system before you even have the chance to resist their writhing and scurrilous agenda of covertly taking over your impressionable mind. In the grand tradition of the equally damaged and delightful lineage of great rock'n'roll deconstructionists before them, Terrible Twos have put together 2008's first runaway hit album that should further reinforce their rightful position in modern punk's hallowed halls of acceptance and shoot them straight to the top of the theoretical \"charts.\"","options":[{"id":1622245,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.99,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.99,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.5,"amount_with_others":7.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3313183/-/terribletwoslp.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3313183/-/terribletwoslp.jpg","width":505,"height":504}],"artists":[{"id":8959,"name":"Terrible Twos","permalink":"terrible-twos","url":"/artist/terrible-twos"}],"categories":[{"id":308758,"name":"Vinyl - Album","permalink":"vinyl-album","url":"/category/vinyl-album"},{"id":1057221,"name":"Criminal IQ Releases","permalink":"criminal-iq-releases","url":"/category/criminal-iq-releases"}]},{"id":3641420,"name":"The Manikins - Crocodiles LP","permalink":"the-manikins-crocodiles-lp-oop","position":18,"price":11.99,"default_price":11.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-manikins-crocodiles-lp-oop","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-04-23T01:14:23.000Z","description":"US vinyl release on Full Breach Kicks Records\r\nThough the MANIKINS may have grown-up, they didn't feed their catchy bite to the crocodiles. On their already fourth album, the four Swedes definitely go sweeter and wear their hearts on their sleeves in a perfect blend of Punkrock and Power-Pop that still carries the typical MANIKINS guitars but gained a mouthful of smoothness and feeling. Don't worry, the boys didn't mellow-out and you still get faster tunes like the opener \"That train\", the title-track \"Crocodiles\" or \"Taste for sweets\" that are so unmistakably MANIKINS. But especially the slower pieces are the real meat here. \"If I see you cry\" and \"I want my baby dead\" are full of sweet bitterness and seem to come straight from any 60's Teen-Punk compilation, the harmonic mid-tempo songs \"Countless nights\", \"Without a word\", \"You're bad when you want to\" and \"It's not the wind you hear\" remind of a more insurgent, yet in no way less sugary version of their countrymen THE LOST PATROL BAND and in the heartbreaking \"Losin' streak\", \"Hangin' from a noose\" and \"She speaks perfect French\" you even get BOBBY FULLER style vocal- and guitar harmonies and castanets in the fills.

There is simply no compromising on this record. It's tough to listen to at times, yet it keeps your attention much like a Faces of Death video would. The only modern comparison I could make is Human Eye, but far nastier. They stretch out, chop up and repeat riffs and rhythms to breaking points, anchored by nearly tribal beats and some bass playing that manages to stay steady amidst the storm. Guitars squeal and grate and are made to do things they really don't want to. The vocals are caustic to say the least, almost a bit too much at times. But it all fits together, with the detailed collage work on the cover giving a good impression of what happens on the vinyl: an ear damaging noise massacre laden with near subliminal effects trickery, seemingly cut and pasted together at times and incredibly detailed in its fury. Complicated and feral at the same time. There are few bands doing this right now, and its defintely not a \"Let's party!\" record. It will make you wonder what is wrong with rock'n'roll today that made the FBs give birth to this. It seems as if everything anyone ever did wrong to these guys is balled up into this aurally assaultive, paranoic, homicidal thing that runs the gamut of uncomfortable situations. The more you listen, the deeper the shit gets. A 12\" vinyl beast that doesn't really care if you like it anyway.

Great song. \"Part Two\" doubles the tempo for a short reprise on the B-Side, buffered by \"Yeah, Right!\" which is a treble-jamming little dum-dum snort with an Angry Samoans vibe and some mock teen angst.

Formed in 1977 by a cross-section of childhood friends and misfits, the Pirates culled inspiration from The Stooges, MC5, and the New York Dolls, as well as 60's garage and the Mothers Of Invention. Quirky and fearless, these guys made it up as they went along, quickly becoming Chicago’s go-to opening band for the Ramones (five times), the Undertones, and the Pretenders. True to punk credo, they lived hard and played harder, and within a few short years the rot set in and the group disbanded. Yet despite their influence in and on the Chicago punk scene, the legendary Midwestern pioneers of punk never managed to release an album until now.

The debut album by Canadian Rifle is finally here.  If you've seen or heard this band before you probably know what to expect - driving, melodic, catchy but also quite dark in it's lyrical and musical appeal.  Canadian Rifle represent a sound that's often visited (especially around these parts) but not often done that well.  In fact out of the \"melodic punk\" genre there's not actually that much that we enjoy around here but this band brings so much more to the table - they fit in well with the Criminal IQ ethos that if you kick the genre/subgenre of the punk you're doing hard enough in the pants we will work with you.  They're also one of the better bands from Chicago and in many people's opinion THE best.

It's hard, fast, crazed, and careening hardcore punk played at supersonic speed teetering here and there at the brink of total destruction before crashing to a sudden abrupt knee-in-the-bollocks end then the whole process starts again.  \r\n\r\nKiller shit!\r\n\r\nFrom Collective Zine.co.uk\r\n\r\nWhen you call your band Holy Shit, your record sides are labelled \"Fuckin' A\" and \"B-Yotch\", and you make me screw around with my deck just to get it your album to play on 45RPM, your band better be \"off the hook\" or I will be pretty disgusted. Holy Shit are, thankfully, \"off the hook\", and this album is the least compromising, most belligerent slice of ugly that I have had the pleasure of hearing since the Functional Blackouts album (also on Criminal IQ, this label knows what's up).\r\n\r\nHoly Shit kick off from the word go, this is hardcore punk played with no thought for anything whatsoever. It is dirty, it is hopeless, it is screwball. Hardcore punk is so often played by the book, in the fashion that some band played it once upon a time. Played straight, played with mock fury or whatever other emotion is required to attract the required audience who will consume 1000 copies of the 7\" and move on to the next band that MRR has deemed worthy of your £3. Holy Shit dispense with all that baggage, and careen through this LP, in a seemingly desperate attempt to simply get to the end. They succeed, but barely. This is all fast, all the time, tracks fly by in the blink of an eye, it is impossible to differentiate where one starts, one ends, one coughs of blood, and one is stabbed in the eye with a drumstick. Immense. These guys and Homostupids have proven to me that just because I sometimes feel like an old fart, that doesn't mean I can't still enjoy this junk.\r\n\r\nHigh praise to the band that is willing to play hardcore punk in all kinds of wrong ways in 2007, for you are a shining beacon amidst the horrific waste of vinyl that this genre produces.","options":[{"id":1622202,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.99,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.99,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":11.5,"amount_with_others":7.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3313135/-/hscoversmall.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3313135/-/hscoversmall.jpg","width":960,"height":960}],"artists":[{"id":8847,"name":"Holy Shit!","permalink":"holy-shit","url":"/artist/holy-shit"}],"categories":[{"id":308758,"name":"Vinyl - Album","permalink":"vinyl-album","url":"/category/vinyl-album"},{"id":1057221,"name":"Criminal IQ Releases","permalink":"criminal-iq-releases","url":"/category/criminal-iq-releases"}]},{"id":405682,"name":"The Young - 4 Songs - 7\" E.P.","permalink":"ciq32-the-young-4-songs-7-e-p","position":47,"price":4.99,"default_price":4.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ciq32-the-young-4-songs-7-e-p","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-09-23T08:32:31.000Z","description":"The Young from Austin deliver four prime punk cuts that remain angry, committed and utterly timeless as the record rises skillfully into anthem mode .

Puristischer Punkrock between garage and three accords, that so before a couple of years also would have been able to appear on Rip-aped, that through once/female vocals bribes, whereby the Lady already one very voice would sharpen has. That is bound however to the good fortune well in the schnodderigen Gitarrensound so that that becomes never unpleasant. Music for of persons, who tend to the Hyperventilieren, that roar, until its face red is, that stop then after air snatching, before it goes on singed with the next. So simple, so charming, and who a song \"Reaffirming my hatred of humanity through failed relationships\" entitles, is anyway my friend.

In the Center Court with so few people in there to buffer the noise, the amps were turned up way too high. It would have been a great show with fewer decibles. You have a great stage presence and would be great to have back someday...just turn it down a bit so that people can actually hear you.
