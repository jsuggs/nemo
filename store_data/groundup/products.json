I was asked  by the Flood Gallery of London to contribute a piece to the \"Led Zeppelin 4 at 40\" show, where 8 artists were tasked with creating a print based on one song from the epic LP.\r\nThe original edition was exclusively available through the gallery and was a run of 200.  This artist's edition is 18 x 24 on Deep Gold paper.  Gold Metallic Ink is used, 3 layers total.  Signed and numbered edition of 100.\r\nThis was a really challenging piece for me to make.  The power of the songs opening riffs, with the relentless rhythms from the entire band set the pace.  Reading how Page and Co. took to creating the song as an abstract, I latched onto this as I’ve been making prints of semi-abstract landscapes recently.
