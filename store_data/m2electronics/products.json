The unique shape of Atomic Bass features a lengthened sound chamber to let those waves develop properly.\r\n\r\nWhile the sound is generated in the stylish bud, the angled tube chamber which sits in your ear canal acts as a tuned port. Penetration is deeper, and so is the rumble. This means clear, deep bass you can feel. Dont miss the sensation. Finally, most earphones are rated at 16 Ohms of impedance. Atomic Bass earphones are rated at 32 Ohms, which makes them easier to drive and more efficient. This added efficiency helps to produce enormous sound, and your iPod battery doesnt have to work so hard to do it.\r\n\r\nYour ears are unique and, for many people, the smallest available ear fitting is still too big for their ears. Factor in a variety of ear shapes, and getting the right fit becomes challenging. Atomic Bass earphones can be inserted from three possible angles, and the smallest of the three included fittings is among the smallest available. Three angles times three fitting sizes equals nine possible solutions to getting the most comfortable fit for your ears.\r\n\r\nLife can be hard, but today's lifestyles can be even harder on earphones. Atomic Bass earphones are built to last. The finished joint where the left and right earphones split looks sharp but its there to prevent the left and right cables from peeling apart as they do on cheaper earphones.","options":[{"id":9293395,"name":"Default","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":15.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25310323/-/radius.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25310323/-/radius.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":2746899,"name":"Sony Digital Reader Touch Edition","permalink":"sony-digital-reader-touch-edition","position":4,"price":165.0,"default_price":165.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sony-digital-reader-touch-edition","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-09-12T19:21:31.000Z","description":"    * Sony eBook Reader, Reader Touch Edition\r\n    * PRS-600\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Here are the details on the product you will be receiving:\r\n      Product Specifications:\r\n      -6 inch 8-level gray scale \"electronic paper\" display\r\n      -Rechargeable Lithium Ion Battery\r\n      -Battery Life: approximately 7500 continuous page turns while     reading\r\n      -User available memory capacity: approx 512 MB (about 160 average sized books)\r\n      -USB power supply\r\n      -Supported formats: BBrB book/PDF/EPUB/RTF/TXT/JPEG/PNG/GIF/BMP/MP3/AACC\r\n      -Dimensions: 4.8X6.9X0.4 inches\r\n      -Weight: 10.1oz\r\n      -Headphone audio output\r\n\r\n      Also Included:\r\n\r\n      -Sleeve\r\n      -USB Cable\r\n      -Quick Start Guide","options":[{"id":9639717,"name":"Red","price":165.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9639718,"name":"Silver","price":165.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9639749,"name":"Black","price":165.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":20.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26528540/-/sony-touch.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26528540/-/sony-touch.jpg","width":420,"height":315}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1561555,"name":"Readers","permalink":"readers","url":"/category/readers"}]}]
