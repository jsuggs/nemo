The title reflects my own experience of having some viewers make an assumption that the painting was done by a male artist. I cropped the faces, somewhat disguising identity and adding mystery, to pique the viewers interest, overall it reflects the idea of two different cultures uniting as one.\r\n\r\n\r\nDap: is a form of handshake and friendly gesture that has recently became popularized in western cultures. Often used in cricket (touching the gloves), referring to fist bump. The term dap may have originated as an acronym for dignity and pride, or may have been backronymed, legend is that it was introduced to and popularly used by African-American soldiers by Marine Captain John Dapolito during the Vietnam War. It appears to have been introduced to Western culture through film.\r\n\r\nIncludes Shipping and Handling\r\n","options":[{"id":9311586,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25376297/-/what.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25376297/-/what.jpg","width":576,"height":429}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":2633515,"name":"Love Mugs","permalink":"put-on-your-big-girl-panties-and-deal-with-it-2010-oil-on-canvas","position":5,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/put-on-your-big-girl-panties-and-deal-with-it-2010-oil-on-canvas","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-06-28T11:02:42.000Z","description":"Limited Edition painting on simple mug","options":[{"id":9311604,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38463190/-/love_mugs.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38463190/-/love_mugs.jpg","width":1000,"height":741}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
