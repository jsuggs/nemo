piece is part of our memory series and plays with ways to hold onto memory and keep loved ones close. \r\n\r\nInspired by Victorian mourning lockets, each hand-crafted sterling silver locket holds a miniature diorama, such as pressed flowers, stitched locks of hair, or dried lady bugs. Each locket also contains a tiny tea stained simple phrase. The locket is composed of two parts, the locket itself and the interior diorama casing that is closed off with a crystal plane of glass. \r\n\r\nHere the lockets read “in dreams we play”, “I think of you”, “my love” and “just like heaven”. The lady bug version is available (lady bugs are said to be lucky), but we can also mount custom items or phrases for you. (Phrases can read up to 17 characters long including spaces). Some ideas are: locks of hair to keep a loved one close, eyelashes for wishes, a clipping of a sentimental piece of lace or fabric, sand or soil from a place you hold dear in your heart, a beloved pet's whisker, or even a chunk of someone significant's familiar old sweater.\r\n\r\nIf you would like a custom phrase or would like a personal memento put in a locket for you, and have questions on limitations, please contact us by email. When purchasing,  select 'custom' on the drop down box and note your phrase in the paypal 'notes to seller' box. Space is limited for the number of characters used in the phrase, but we have many suggestions depending on the memento you are using or the situation at hand. \r\n\r\nIf you are crafty and enjoy doing things yourself, or of you are hesitant to send off something of meaning through the post, creating your own diorama within the locket at home is also an option and we provide directions with each locket purchased on how you can do this yourself.\r\n\r\nEach locket is approximately 5/8\" in diameter. The interior diorama casing is approximately 1/2\" in diameter and 1/8\" deep. Each locket comes on a 30\" sterling silver simple cable chain.\r\n\r\n(designed 2010)","options":[{"id":11714434,"name":"Antiqued Sterling Silver Locket 'my love' lady bug","price":220.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":11714436,"name":"Antiqued Sterling Silver Locket 'i think of you' lady bug","price":220.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":11714438,"name":"Antiqued Sterling Silver Locket-'in dreams we play'","price":220.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":17750233,"name":"Antique Silver Locket 'in all ways mystified'' lady bug","price":220.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":17750235,"name":"Antique Silver Locket-'just like heaven'","price":220.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":17751187,"name":"Antique Silver Locket-'so that I might wish'","price":220.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":17751189,"name":"Antique Silver Locket-'thoughts of you'","price":220.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":17750237,"name":"Antique Silver Locket-CUSTOM","price":220.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/34010226/-/2lockets.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/34010226/-/2lockets.jpg","width":368,"height":540},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/34008470/-/superclose_open.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/34008470/-/superclose_open.jpg","width":368,"height":540},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/34008734/-/superclose.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/34008734/-/superclose.jpg","width":368,"height":540},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/34009164/-/all.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/34009164/-/all.jpg","width":368,"height":540},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36262694/-/locket_test1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36262694/-/locket_test1.jpg","width":663,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1827079,"name":"jewelery","permalink":"jewelery","url":"/category/jewelery"},{"id":1827083,"name":"kids","permalink":"kids","url":"/category/kids"}]},{"id":7699353,"name":"Bronze Monster Pencil Topper","permalink":"brass-monster-pencil-topper","position":4,"price":35.0,"default_price":35.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/brass-monster-pencil-topper","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-26T20:25:51.000Z","description":"We referenced a vintage rubber pencil topper of one of our favorite old Japanese monsters!

Each band is inscribed with text.\r\n\r\nThis specific style includes 2 pieces, and is impressed with text from the Franny section from J.D. Salinger’s  Franny and Zooey. Other band styles are inscribed with different texts from music and literature.\r\n\r\n The phrase inscribed was chosen from the heroine, Franny's, near obsession with a custom she learns of while reading \"The way of the Pilgrim\". Her fascination is with the Pilgrim's belief that if one repeats a prayer enough times it will become synchronized with the beat of one's own heart so one will pray forever without ceasing. Franny points out that the word 'mercy' is a particularly poignant word for this custom, as it can mean so many things.

by our favorite memories of fort making, and our earliest experiences of defining our own space, we made this self standing tee-pee. Great for an impromptu pow-wow or club house meeting, or to just quietly enjoy a book together.\r\n\r\nOur Little Edie 'Read-To-Me' tee-pee® is made from 100% light weight unbleached cotton, and comes with custom cut iron-on synthetic felt decals to decorate your tee-pee cover in your own way. Iron-on decal shapes and colors are as per image in photo. Because it is light-weight cotton canvas, the tee-pee cover can also be painted, much like canvas. The cotton tee-pee cover comes with horizontal decorative zig-zag ribbons already sewn on (as shown in photo), but is other wise a blank canvas for how you would like it to look.\r\n\r\nPerfect for weddings and outdoor parties, patio sun-shades, portable/impromptu hotel room fort, private space in a small apartment.\r\n\r\nRecommended washing is hand wash, hang to dry.\r\n\r\nThe tee-pee stands approximately 6' high x 5' wide at the base.\r\n\r\nThe tee-pee disassembles to fit in a 3' x 8\" x 8\" box. \r\n\r\nBlank tee-pees are available.\r\n\r\nIntellectual property and design Becky Brisco 2010","options":[{"id":12466198,"name":"multi decals on unbleached cotton","price":350.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12971056,"name":"plain unbleached cotton","price":350.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":50.0,"amount_with_others":50.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36236766/-/teepee_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36236766/-/teepee_1.jpg","width":368,"height":540},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54061735/-/Picture_9.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54061735/-/Picture_9.png","width":557,"height":371},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41540629/-/kasper.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41540629/-/kasper.jpg","width":480,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36236798/-/teepee_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36236798/-/teepee_2.jpg","width":368,"height":540},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54952455/-/Picture_8.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54952455/-/Picture_8.png","width":369,"height":556}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1827083,"name":"kids","permalink":"kids","url":"/category/kids"}]},{"id":3632250,"name":"Milk Tooth Keeper","permalink":"little-edie-keeper","position":32,"price":85.0,"default_price":85.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/little-edie-keeper","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-04-21T06:38:05.000Z","description":"Just before I first moved away from home I was snooping in my father’s bedroom. In his dresser I found an antique ink well. When I opened it, there was a small glass vial inside, and when I pulled that out I was surprised to find all of my baby teeth that my parents had kept. I still have this special treasure and will always remember the joy and wonder I felt when I first discovered it.\r\n\r\nThis keeper was inspired by that antique ink well so that others may one day have a similar experience and keep sake.\r\n\r\n A vessel made of bronze houses a removable  glass bottle.  The interior glass bottle is screened with a place to write a meaningful word, date, or name. \r\n\r\nSome ideas for treasures one may keep: baby teeth, locks of hair, precious notes, affirmations, a beloved pet’s whiskers, sand or dirt from adored places, or anything else that you want to keep safe and close.\r\n\r\nThis is a great memento to start off a new little person’s life, that they can take with them when they are all grown up. It works great as a mini time capsule too. You can create your own heirloom!\r\n\r\nAvailable in silver by special order.","options":[{"id":12134736,"name":"Little Edie Bronze/Glass","price":85.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49860505/-/toothcontainer_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49860505/-/toothcontainer_3.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49860473/-/toothcontainer_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49860473/-/toothcontainer_1.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49860489/-/toothcontainer_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49860489/-/toothcontainer_2.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1827083,"name":"kids","permalink":"kids","url":"/category/kids"}]},{"id":3632204,"name":"Edie's Bath Time Fun Kit","permalink":"little-edie-bath-time-fun-kit","position":33,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/little-edie-bath-time-fun-kit","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-04-21T06:27:16.000Z","description":"Each kit includes an all natural sea sponge-on-a-rope (each with a primary colored block-bead), and a rubber ducky shaped soap.\r\n\r\nRubber ducky soaps are made with pure shea butter.\r\n\r\nSoaps are available in three scents; unscented; the gentle scents of organic lavender oil; or a  blend of sweet orange with vanilla and almond oils.\r\n\r\nRubber ducky soap measures approximately 2\" x 2\" .\r\nPlease note the wooden block on sponge rope varies in primary color.
