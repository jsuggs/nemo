We started using the hash-tag #doublewidelife on instagram and it kind of caught on. Double-Wide Life represents the lifestyle they've created, which involves eating delicious reclaimed food from grocery store dumpsters, creative thinking, DIY creations, enjoying the finer things in life at little to no cost, and riding your bike like madman. The bottom of the sticker reads \"Eat Garbage -  Drink Malort - Ride Your Bike\" Do those things and live a more fulfilling life.","options":[{"id":32718661,"name":"Default","price":0.25,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102678388/-/photo3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102678388/-/photo3.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5027650,"name":"Stickers","permalink":"stickers","url":"/category/stickers"}]},{"id":10445884,"name":"Bonk Off Sticker","permalink":"bonk-off-sticker","position":2,"price":0.25,"default_price":0.25,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bonk-off-sticker","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-09T21:14:24.000Z","description":"The Bonk Off sticker was inspired by a Slender Fungus ride that took place a couple years ago called The Bonkfest. During this ride, the word \"Bonk\" was frequently used, and proved to be endlessly entertaining. In the end, our friend Mike even earned the nickname Bonk King. We later printed out labels that said \"Bonk Off\" and stuck them to the rear of our seat tubes. This sticker is a much more refined version of the original. The bottom of it reads \"No Gears, No Fears\", because we dig single speed bikes.","options":[{"id":32718478,"name":"Default","price":0.25,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102678040/-/photoBonk.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102678040/-/photoBonk.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5027650,"name":"Stickers","permalink":"stickers","url":"/category/stickers"}]},{"id":10445863,"name":"Logo Sticker","permalink":"logo-sticker","position":3,"price":0.25,"default_price":0.25,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/logo-sticker","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-09T21:13:15.000Z","description":"Blog logo on orange with \"The Middle West\" on the bottom because that's where we reside and you might even say we're somewhat proud of that.","options":[{"id":32718385,"name":"Default","price":0.25,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102677692/-/photo2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102677692/-/photo2.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5027650,"name":"Stickers","permalink":"stickers","url":"/category/stickers"}]},{"id":8971796,"name":"Logo Button (only 2 left)","permalink":"logo-button","position":4,"price":1.0,"default_price":1.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/logo-button","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-16T07:40:04.000Z","description":"A button that bears the original Transit Interface logo, which made it's first appearance on the blog in late 2008.

The bottles include a small plastic goat which hung around the neck by a red string. After consuming, we would attach the goat to our saddles by the string. Members of our \"crew\" came to be identified by the saddle ornament, and prior to initiation, the phrase \"Put a goat on it!\" would be exclaimed in the presence of a bare saddle. Whether you're a fan of the Dopplebock or not, if you wanna be cool you'll put a goat on it!
