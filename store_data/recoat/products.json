Proof of this was his selection for the C215 “Blue Book”, “Graffiti Planet 2” by Alan Ket and Tristan Manco’s “Street Sketchbook”.\r\nIn 2010 Elph was flown out to Melbourne for a solo show with Backwoods Gallery\r\nand exhibited in a prestigious Manchester exhibition with China Mike. He also painted at the dramatic Red Bull Stereopticon live paint that saw his painting projected across the front of the entire University of Edinburgh building earlier this year.\r\nHis work narrates many wild and weird ideas, often inspired by hours of trawling the internet looking at cartoons, comic books, animation, war and sci-fi films, or even just his neighbourhood and his everyday life.\r\n\r\nElph creates all kinds of artwork and design, nodding to his graffiti past; his versatility, drive and style salute this culture but over the years he has developed painterly techniques that far surpass any pre-conceived ideas of what a “Graffiti artist” might produce. His artworks are multi layered, beautifully rendered, playful, funny, sometimes dark, but always appealing whether he is spray painting a wall or creating delicate illustrations in gouache. \r\n","options":[{"id":14026839,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49360635/-/Elph_new.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49360635/-/Elph_new.jpg","width":622,"height":850},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49360675/-/elph_new_head.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49360675/-/elph_new_head.jpg","width":479,"height":850},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49360667/-/Elph_new_detail.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49360667/-/Elph_new_detail.jpg","width":479,"height":850},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41631591/-/Elph_stamp.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41631591/-/Elph_stamp.jpg","width":850,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":308877,"name":"Limited edition print","permalink":"limited-edition-print","url":"/category/limited-edition-print"},{"id":2359889,"name":"Team Recoat","permalink":"team-recoat","url":"/category/team-recoat"},{"id":473121,"name":"Elph","permalink":"elph","url":"/category/elph"}]},{"id":4257995,"name":"Syrkus- Resourceful Hunters- Team Recoat Screen Print","permalink":"syrkus-resourceful-hunters-team-recoat-screen-print","position":79,"price":75.0,"default_price":75.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/syrkus-resourceful-hunters-team-recoat-screen-print","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-08-15T01:02:51.000Z","description":"Limited Edition Screen Print.

These are her first nudes, and the first time the artist herself has been depicted; here with her baby daughter, here with female companions in cave. “This is because the work is so personal, all the models are close friends who have shared intimate family moments with me for the work.” says Whiten. The scenes are set into uncanny landscapes with rough-painted foliage, often showing glimpses of day-glo and jarring texture beneath, a sense of threat and epic narrative pressing in from outside the frame. \r\n“I’ve thought so much about it since I have had my babies,” says Whiten, “Nature and Nurture; what’s natural, instinctual, innate.

Signed and numbered by the artist. This piece is not framed.\r\n\r\nThis work was created by Elph for a solo exhibition called “One One Three Three” at Recoat Gallery.\r\n\r\nHis last show with Recoat sold out, with over 50 pieces happily purchased by fans across the country, and similarly his print with Pictures on Walls sold out in under an hour. His inclusion in the C215 “Blue Book”, “Graffiti Planet 2” by Alan Ket and Tristan Manco’s “Street Sketchbook” are proof of his notoriety within the international Graffiti world.\r\n\r\nElph just returned from a solo show in Melbourne with Backwoods Gallery, and you maybe last saw his work at the dramatic live paint event called the Red Bull Stereopticon which had his painting projected across the front of the entire University of Edinburgh building last month.\r\n\r\nElph creates all kinds of artwork and design, nodding to his graffiti past; his versatility, drive and style salute this culture but over the years he has developed painterly techniques that far surpass any pre-conceived ideas of what a “Graffiti artist” might produce. His artworks are multi layered, beautifully rendered, playful, funny, sometimes dark, but always appealing whether he is spray painting a wall or creating delicate illustrations in gouache. For this show he will be creating all of these things plus a run of limited edition prints, a small book and wooden sculpture pieces.\r\n\r\nHis work narrates many wild and weird ideas, often inspired by hours of trawling the internet looking at cartoons, comic books, animation, war and sci-fi films, or even just his neighbourhood and his everyday life.\r\n\r\nAfter the opening the show will run from the 16th April to the 15th May 2011 open 12-6pm Tuesday to Sunday.\r\n","options":[{"id":12623278,"name":"Default","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36750868/-/print.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36750868/-/print.jpg","width":638,"height":850},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36750892/-/close_up.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36750892/-/close_up.jpg","width":850,"height":638},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36750956/-/signature.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36750956/-/signature.jpg","width":850,"height":638},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36750964/-/numbers.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36750964/-/numbers.jpg","width":638,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":308877,"name":"Limited edition print","permalink":"limited-edition-print","url":"/category/limited-edition-print"},{"id":473121,"name":"Elph","permalink":"elph","url":"/category/elph"}]},{"id":2963089,"name":"Kirsty Whiten- Coat of Arms- Limited Edition Giclee Print","permalink":"kirsty-whiten-coat-of-arms-limited-edition-giclee-print","position":86,"price":75.0,"default_price":75.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kirsty-whiten-coat-of-arms-limited-edition-giclee-print","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-12-02T02:00:10.000Z","description":"Limited Edition Giclee Print. 1/30.
