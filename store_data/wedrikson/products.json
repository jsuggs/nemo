(close to Bookham train station) – see map for location.\r\n I have almost 10 years teaching experience, tutoring pupils from ages 5 years to 70 years in both large groups & one to one tuition.   I teach a mixture of the RGT & Rock School syllabus (for which some pupils enjoy the focus of working towards a graded exam, although not everybody does) & a selection of songs that my pupils would like to play from their favourite band, youtube video or album.  All in all, it is a great idea to work towards a specific goal- whether this is a graded exam, or simply that you are now able to play the solo from your favourite song!\r\n \r\nPrices\r\n£25 for 1 hour lesson   / £20 for 45 minutes lesson / £15 for 30 minute lesson","options":[{"id":17216583,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/52254841/-/18643_101068249923798_100000618710762_29934_6371534_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/52254841/-/18643_101068249923798_100000618710762_29934_6371534_n.jpg","width":402,"height":604}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2830899,"name":"Guitar Lessons","permalink":"guitar-lessons","url":"/category/guitar-lessons"}]},{"id":5281109,"name":"Fireworks Sky EP ( coming soon)","permalink":"fireworks-sky-ep","position":3,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fireworks-sky-ep","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-01-19T04:35:46.000Z","description":"debut solo Ep from Adam Wedd coming soon.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, why not join Adam on facebook http://www.facebook.com/adamwedd & be kept up to date when the release of Fireworks Sky EP nears as well as other exciting future ventures, such as maybe , an album :)","options":[{"id":17100489,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/52252849/-/22_6_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/52252849/-/22_6_.jpg","width":512,"height":366}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":5321747,"name":"Monster Park EP -  Adam Wedd & the Independents","permalink":"monster-park-ep","position":4,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/monster-park-ep","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-01-25T01:18:49.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":17216131,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/52249417/-/15_monsterparkep.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/52249417/-/15_monsterparkep.jpg","width":1000,"height":707}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2811541,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":5281089,"name":"Nursery Rhymes for grown ups EP - Adam Wedd & the Independents","permalink":"nursery-rhymes-for-grown-ups-ep","position":5,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nursery-rhymes-for-grown-ups-ep","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-01-19T04:33:48.000Z","description":"recorded at mi7 & 333 studios.","options":[{"id":17100441,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/51859609/-/15_nurseryrhymesep-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/51859609/-/15_nurseryrhymesep-1.jpg","width":1000,"height":707}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2811541,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
