The two artists, who have never met in person, collaborated over email in a visual conversation where one would start a collage and the other would finish it. The starter collage is presented next to the finished collage. The reader sees how one artist takes the original thought of the other and finishes it by changing its reality completely. In a world where things are not always what they appear to be, where truth lies somewhere in the middle of a dialogue, Recycled Trophies is the perfect comment on contemporary life.\r\n\r\nAbout Zach Collins\r\n\r\nZach Collins’ collages are a personal expression of time, place, and thought. “I think of it as evidence of experience garnered from found overlooked fragments, discarded objects and vintage imagery collected from off the street, magazines, and second hand stores,” said Collins. “I bring pieces in and out of the composition to see how they react and respond to each other, and rely on instinct and inner experience as I decide what stays and what goes.”  Born in Grinnell, Iowa, he studied at Upper Iowa University and the University of Iowa. He is currently living in Minneapolis, Minnesota where he is pursuing an MFA degree at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. Collins is an active collaborator who as worked with over eighty artists to date. He has exhibited his work internationally.  \r\n\r\nAbout Aaron Beebe\r\n\r\nAaron Beebe's manual, cut-and-paste collages mainly consist of ephemera found through his daily travels. His artwork is made of tangible materials, which is a nice change of pace in a digital world.  Beebe, a self-taught artist and design school dropout, divides his time between collaging, screen-printing, and graphic design. Beebe grew up in Virginia Beach, where he was greatly influenced by surf and skate culture. His style stems from a collection of various visual artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, David Carson, and more recently, Fred Free, Kareem Rizk, and Brandon McLean.\r\n\r\nDETAILS: Recycled Trophies | 11.5″ x 8″ | Paperback, saddle-stitched | 44 pages | Maison Kasini Books | 2013\r\n\r\nISBN: 978-1-927587-13-3\r\nRelease Date: November 15, 2013\r\nPrice: $20.00\r\n","options":[{"id":47911722,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":8.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127419324/-/Recycled-Trophies-COVER.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127419324/-/Recycled-Trophies-COVER.jpg","width":500,"height":719},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127793994/-/Recycled-Trophies-Page-Shot-8.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127793994/-/Recycled-Trophies-Page-Shot-8.jpg","width":700,"height":420},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127794012/-/Recycled-Trophies-Page-Shot-4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127794012/-/Recycled-Trophies-Page-Shot-4.jpg","width":700,"height":420},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127794072/-/Recycled-Trophies-Page-Shot-7.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127794072/-/Recycled-Trophies-Page-Shot-7.jpg","width":700,"height":420}],"artists":[{"id":178443,"name":"Kolaj","permalink":"kolaj","url":"/artist/kolaj"},{"id":128569,"name":"Maison Kasini/Kasini House","permalink":"maison-kasini-kasini-house","url":"/artist/maison-kasini-kasini-house"}],"categories":[{"id":3391049,"name":"Artist Books, Catalogs, 'zines","permalink":"artist-books-catalogs-zines","url":"/category/artist-books-catalogs-zines"},{"id":3394599,"name":"Collage","permalink":"collage","url":"/category/collage"}]},{"id":7959870,"name":"The Wildest Ponies on the Range","permalink":"the-wildest-ponies-on-the-range-collage-by-billy-mavreas-jp-king","position":5,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-wildest-ponies-on-the-range-collage-by-billy-mavreas-jp-king","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-12T22:15:02.000Z","description":"\"The Wildest Ponies on the Range: Collage by Billy Mavreas & Jp King\" is a collection of thirty-six collages made by Jp King and Billy Mavreas as a collaboration in 2010.

Working in a rented room in Berlin, a youth hostel in Switzerland, on the beach in India, or his apartment in Montreal, Ruttan spreads out the fragments and brings the bits and pieces together in composition. When done, he slides the small 3.5”x2.5” collages into a plastic sleeve. Once home, Ruttan scans them, enlarges the image, and makes a print in edition of three. The final image presents a seamless photographic print that is akin to photomontage.\r\n\r\nThis catalogue presents the work exhibited at Galerie Maison Kasini in Montreal, January 6-23, 2010. The exhibition explored Ruttan’s collage practice and the relationship between the small collages and large prints of them. The catalogue contains an essay by Ric Kasini Kadour, an interview with the artist, and ten images.\r\n\r\nDetails: 7.25\"x5.25\" | 32 pages | 10 images | \r\nISBN

No, honey, it's just sleeping\" by Stephen Schaub.\r\n\r\nMatt Hovey is a modern day flâneur. He commits acts of peripatetic strolling to experience the places he visits. The act of taking photographs is as much a means of documenting his travels as it is a way of experiencing a place. To stop and compose a shot, to look at a scene and consider the objects in it and the objects around it and the light and air, and to view the image through a lens–these actions lead to a greater sense of looking and experiencing. The photograph that comes of it is an artifact of the experience and a living, breathing piece of art the viewer can use to engage the place from which it came.\r\n\r\nVermont born and raised, Matt is a consummate traveller. He is the creator of This Is What’s There, an ongoing photography project that seeks to capture and share the everyday of far away.\r\n\r\n<i>Curiosa</i> is a photo taken in Madrid, Spain as part of series exploring the poster culture of various cities.\r\n\r\nStephen Schaub is recognized in the photographic industry as an expert and innovator of hybrid shooting and progressive printing techniques, both digital and analog. His artwork has been featured in numerous print publications as well as many online publications.  A graduate of the Rochester Institute of Technology, he is the author of two collections of photographs as well as co-author of a book on the state of contemporary photographic practice. He lives in Vermont.\r\n\r\nOnline, Stephen is the leader of the Figital Revolution, whose mission is to challenge the assumption that digital and analog photography (film) must exist in isolation and opposition from each other.

He currently works as a freelance graphic designer and studies art. Living on the border between city and nature, he is inspired by both atmospheres and creates work through a mixture of digital and traditional methods. When he was 14, he was inspired by street-art and graffiti artists, and this formed his unique world of thinking and drawing. Being a VJ and a DJ as well, he is connected to music and art on more levels, the skills highly affecting each other, resulting usually in something powerful.

Genevieve Simms and Matt Prins have each made a name for themselves; Genevieve as an award-winning illustrator and co-creator of International Beauty Saloon (one of our favourite zines and highly coveted for its excellent content and beautiful screen printed covers), and Matt as a writer and the creator of Instant Books Are Your Future, a website and innovative publishing project that scans small books specially made in a clever format. Of the 300 documented on his website so far over half come from contributors around the world.\r\n\r\nGenevieve Simms is a Canadian illustrator based in Edmonton, AB. After graduating from the Alberta College of Art and Design in 2006 she attended a guest study program at the School of Visual Arts, New York. Since settling in Edmonton in 2007 Genevieve has worked on editorial illustration assignments for a variety of clients and self-published the serial zine International Beauty Saloon with Josh Holinaty. Genevieve’s illustration work has been recognized by The Art Director’s Club of New York, American Illustration, The Society of Illustrators, and Communication Arts. In 2011 she was awarded Gold for Spot Illustration at The National Magazine Awards in Toronto.  Recently, Genevieve has completed a diploma in Architectural Technology at NAIT. See more at www.genevievesimms.ca\r\n\r\nMatt Prins is an Edmonton-based writer who has published and exhibited fiction, non-fiction, journalism, poetry, photography and illustration around the world. His work has appeared in publications such as Colors Magazine, the Learning to Love You More book, V, and fancy things like this. His blog – Instant Books Are Your Future – has close to 300 mini-zines scanned in for your pleasure. Nearly a third of these come from guest contributors from around the world.\r\n\r\nMatt is currently in the midst of making a pirate radio station for Edmonton’s temporary art exhibit – Dirt City Dream City – and in the past has exhibited projects in Vienna’s MAK, Paris’ Pompidou, Milan’s Triennale, and Eindhoven’s MU. A former Creative Writing resident at Fabrica in Treviso Italy, and grad of Vancouver Film School, Matt has lived in many different neighborhoods in many different cities in many different countries and carries a piece of each of those living quarters with him.

The striped pattern is the result of masks placed in-camera, allowing the two images to blend together and at the same time keep them from fully fusing onto one another. Each photograph in the series holds a brief sense of continuity, almost like an animation, slightly cinematographic; however, though they provide a notion of movement and progression, their beginning and end is ambiguous and indistinguishable.\r\n\r\nOmar Mouallem is an Edmonton-based writer who has contributed to publications such as the <i>Globe and Mail</i>, <i>Eighteen Bridges</i>, and <i>enRoute</i>.

He sharpens his storytelling at Edmonton Story Slam competitions, where in fact his Papirmasse story won the 2012 Grand Slam. His debut album as rapper AOK (Assault Of Knowledge), <i>If You Don’t Buy This CD the Terrorists Win</i>, received international acclaim from music critics, who praised it for its edge and wit.

Primarily a painter, she is also the founder and editor of Papirmasse. Her paintings have exhibited nationally and her patterned drawings can be found on notebooks and apparel in stores around the world. When not working on her own she collaborates with the drawing initiative En Masse, whose work was recently shown in the form of a massive installation in the Musée des Beaux Arts in Montreal. See more at www.hellokirsten.com\r\n\r\nAbout the art: Featuring a male figure and someone without an ideal body (by North American pop-cultural standards), Luchadorable aims to turn the notion of the “pin-up” on its head. Lucha Libre wrestlers bear more resemblance to the classic female pin-up than at first meets the eye: utilizing idealized representations of masculinity in their performances and donning spectacular costumes, it can be said that they are not dissimilar from the stereotypical female pin-up, who represents an idealized vision of femininity in her high-heels, tight-binding corsets, and dramatic make-up. This “pin-up” is someone who by his profession is centre of attention, but in the role of sex symbol his bravado gives way to self-consciousness. It’s a feeling that we probably all know too well.\r\n\r\nDetails: 17.5\"x11.5\" | digital print on acid-free, recycled paper | 2012\r\n\r\nShipping : This print ships in a tube.","options":[{"id":32860273,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103110112/-/papirmasse-33-kirsten-mccrea.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103110112/-/papirmasse-33-kirsten-mccrea.jpg","width":650,"height":975},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103110280/-/papirmasse-33-back-newbio.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103110280/-/papirmasse-33-back-newbio.jpg","width":662,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":137927,"name":"Papirmasse","permalink":"papirmasse","url":"/artist/papirmasse"}],"categories":[{"id":3391163,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":11192601,"name":"Subscription to Ribbon Pig","permalink":"subscription-to-ribbon-pig","position":78,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/subscription-to-ribbon-pig","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-16T15:01:05.000Z","description":"Ribbon Pig is a project about curating literature.

Side 2 zooms in on the original, bringing it to life in a new way. It’s an unusual format from us, but we hope that you enjoy this take on an artist who is using collage in a new and unusual way. \r\n\r\nCarl David Ruttan is a collage artist who works in a very special way, completing small originals out of paper ephemera collected in city streets around the world, scanning them at an extremely high-resolution, and then making a single huge print of each collage image. Framed together, the original and the print form a single piece that at once reference and enhance each other. The resulting print is a sight to behold: a fantastic magnifying glass that illuminates incredible details invisible to the naked eye in the original. The intricate patterning of money becomes richly detailed in a way you can never appreciate when it’s in your hands, the paper “hairs” from a torn sheet of cardboard are suddenly as beautiful and wispy as a field of grass, and the slight misalignment of printed packaging forms a beautiful constellation of dots.\r\n\r\nDetails: 6\"x12\" | digital print on acid-free, recycled paper | 2012\r\n\r\nShipping : This print ships flat.","options":[{"id":32527915,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102100528/-/papirmasse-28-front-single.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102100528/-/papirmasse-28-front-single.jpg","width":600,"height":324},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102100648/-/papirmasse-28-back-single1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102100648/-/papirmasse-28-back-single1.jpg","width":500,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":128167,"name":"Carl David Ruttan","permalink":"carl-david-ruttan","url":"/artist/carl-david-ruttan"},{"id":137927,"name":"Papirmasse","permalink":"papirmasse","url":"/artist/papirmasse"}],"categories":[{"id":3394599,"name":"Collage","permalink":"collage","url":"/category/collage"},{"id":3391163,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":10489891,"name":"Papirmasse 2011-Complete Set","permalink":"papirmasse-2011-complete-set","position":81,"price":80.0,"default_price":80.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/papirmasse-2011-complete-set","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-11T19:35:05.000Z","description":"<i>Papirmasse</i> is a magazine, original artwork, and social experiment all rolled into one.

The result is a curious body of work: What is the significance to a North American viewer of a 21st century French artist painting 19th century men and women with the primitive markings reminiscent of the aboriginal people of New Zealand?\r\n\r\nOrfé was born and raised in the northern French city of Lille. After his studies, he began traveling. He spent six months in Dublin, Ireland. He traveled all 25,760 kilometres of the Australian coast. During Orfé’s 15-month sojourn in New Zealand, he traveled around the islands and made his way by doing seasonal work: working in the wine industry, picking fruit and pruning vines.

It was released in 1999 by Mr. Lady Records on Le Tigre’s self-titled debut album. Le Tigre at the time consisted of Kathleen Hanna, Johanna Fateman, and Sadie Benning. Benning was later replaced by JD Samson. The lyrics include the names of fifty-seven feminist icons.\r\n\r\nBetween 2006 and 2008, Montreal-based artist Kirsten McCrea painted a portrait of every single person named in the Le Tigre song plus the band members. The collection of sixty paintings makes up the “Hot Topic” series which was on view at Galerie Maison Kasini August 3 to September 10th, 2011.\r\n\r\n<b>About Kirsten McCrea</b>\r\n\r\nKirsten McCrea is a Montreal-based artist whose work explores issues of cultural memory, looking at pop vs. underground culture, the media, and popular mythologies. Known for her bright colours and figurative subject matter, Kirsten is quickly establishing herself as a prominent emerging Canadian artist. Primarily a painter, she is also the founder and editor of <a href=\"http://papirmasse.com/art/\">Papirmasse</a>, an affordable art subscription. Her paintings have been exhibited nationally, and her work has been reviewed in <i>The Walrus, Book By Its Cover</i>, and The Montreal <i>Gazette</i>, amongst others. She has illustrated for the Polaris Music Prize, the Under Pressure Graffiti festival, & <i>Poetry</i> Magazine. Papirmasse was nominated for an Expozine Small Press Award in 2010.\r\n\r\nKirsten says about her “Hot Topic” paintings: “In a world that celebrates manufactured pop stars but forgets the names of suffragists, I wanted to find a way to solidify the memory of the underground superstars whose creativity and ideas have made such a difference to feminists of my generation, I wanted to use the portrait for its ability to announce importance and greatness, without upholding the tired ideals of the brave and solitary hero or genius. Presented on the wall in a grid, the works no longer stand as individual portraits and instead form a pastiche that is indicative of the interconnectivity and community so integral to feminist culture.”\r\n\r\n<b>About the Catalogue</b>\r\n\r\nThe catalogue presents the work exhibited at Galerie Maison Kasini in Montreal, August 3 to September 10, 2011.

Writer/artist Megan MacKay‘s poetry is a good match with its subtle depictions of forlorn relationships.\r\n\r\nSarah Burwash graduated from UBC Okanagan in 2009 with a BFA, spending a semester abroad in Hamburg, Germany at the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences. Working in a variety of media from collage and watercolour to video and ceramics, Sarah’s work most often takes form in narrative drawings and installation. Her work is included in private and public collections and has been shown in Canada, the United States and Europe. She has participated in residencies in British Columbia, Ontario, Nova Scotia and Colorado and is Yukon-bound next to attend the KIAC residency. Sarah recently had a solo exhibition at the Ross Creek Centre for the Arts and completed her first animation through The Centre for Art Tapes Media Arts Scholarship program in Halifax where she currently resides, working full time as an artist and freelance illustrator. See more at www.sarahburwash.com\r\n\r\nWhen Megan MacKay moved to Fredericton, New Brunswick six years ago, she intended to become a journalist. Instead, she grew into a poet, a playwright, and performance artist. Although she finds herself working in an art gallery instead of a press gallery, the journalistic principles of presenting an honest view of the world have bled into her creative work. Her work of late has focused on the idea of being far from “home” in a traditional sense– be it in a person, or an actual physical location– and finding “home” in non-traditional places. She intends to relocate to Vancouver in the fall to study Creative Writing.

Chloé Beaulac is from Mississauga, Ontario. She currently lives and works in Montreal, where she obtained a BFA with a minor in Print Media from Concordia University. Her work is a combination of painting, drawing and printmaking. She is also interested in installation and integrating sculptural aspects in her research.

Her work is found in several notable collections in Canada and Europe. \r\n\r\nOn side 2 are excerpts from Dean Garlick’s forthcoming novella \"The Visitor\". Dean Garlick is a fiction writer and educator living in Montreal. His debut novel \"The Fish\" was published by <a href=\"http://www.anteism.com/\">Anteism Press</a> with illustrations by Victoria, B.C. artist Eric Volet. Dean is excited about the possibilities presented by illustrated fiction, both as a means of collaboratively exploring multiple modes of narrative and of representing the experience of reading as a creative act.

The issue features 3 cascading images from Px(c)’s series Eco-Friendly Jet Engine, and is accordion-folded so that you can show off either just one or all three, depending on your taste. Side 2 features a short story about a man who changes everything.\r\n\r\nSide 1: Eco-Friendly Jet Engine by Px(c)\r\n\r\nPx(c) is the corporate alter-ego of Montreal artist Ben Depelteau. It first appeared in the 1999 painting You never know when you’ll need Px(c), as a car parts brand name. Px(c) has been known, over the years, to mimic advertising strategies to sell dysfunctional products and ideas to people. Its catalogue includes car parts, eyes, fingers, tongues, sunglasses, do-it-yourself art, concepts for gallery art, mouse traps, packages and some collages and prints. By presenting himself as the corporate entity, Px(c), Depelteau makes a cultural statement about the dominance of commercial culture in everyday life. His work is a hybrid of American and British Pop Art. Find him online at <a href=\"www.the-px-corporation.deviantart.com\">www.the-px-corporation.deviantart.com</a>\r\n\r\nChristopher Olson is a writer and artist who is frequently mistaken for Christopher Olsen, who is neither an artist nor an actual person, although he often boasts credit for Christopher Olson’s work. He was born in 1986, coinciding with the release of some of his favourite movies, such as Aliens, David Cronenberg’s The Fly, Labyrinth, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, but also Howard the Duck. He is currently studying at Concordia University for a degree in English, although this may change as English is kind of hard.\r\n\r\nHe writes and illustrates Tremendous Tales, a quarterly anthology of microfiction.

The result is a body of work that plays with the imagery of colonization and cultural imperialism to make a unique cultural expression. Orfé is a 26 year-old artist, originally from Lille in the north of France. His constant travels over the past four years have taken him to Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and across Canada before landing in Montréal where he has spent the past six months. In his art, folk culture, mysticism, natural and spiritual themes meet colorful psyché patterns in a geometrical world. His materials and technical approach is informed by his travels.\r\n\r\nSide 1 features the image <i>Falling Through Singing Spirits</i> by David Orfé.\r\n\r\nSide 2 features 3 stories by Robert Yune.\r\n\r\nRobert Yune was born in Seoul, South Korea.  His fiction has appeared or is forthcoming in The Kenyon Review, Connecticut Review, and Green Mountains Review, among others. His poetry has appeared in J Journal and The Furnace Review. Some of his past jobs include landscaper, factory worker, census enumerator, and behavioral health interviewer.

Her passion for painting and love for birds were discovered simultaneously in childhood and have led her to explore the fusion of these two worlds. Although we have the ability to fly we sometimes choose to be still, and in that necessary stillness lies a kind of magic. Symbolizing awareness and the forever fleeting present, birds’ inherent beauty takes centre stage in Del Pinto’s large-scale oil paintings. Her meticulously sculpted frames, made from elements of our past – toy dinosaurs and soldiers, collected shells from seaside vacations, and silk flowers from grandmothers interior gardens – are a juxtaposition to the birds they surround.

The acrylic on wood panel paintings juxtapose industrial and natural imagery as a means of drawing a connection between man and the natural world.\r\n\r\nDave Todaro wishes to remind the viewer, “The flip of a switch puts into motion a series of actions which inevitably affect the peoples, wildlife, and the chemical balance of the world in which we live.”\r\n\r\n<b>About Dave Todaro</b>\r\n\r\nDave Todaro (b. 1978) was born and raised in Montreal, where he continues to live and work. He holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts and Teacher’s License in Arts Education, from Concordia University, Montreal (2007). He has been passionate about art since childhood. He worked as a visual arts instructor/teacher for several years, but in the end, took a leap of faith to devote all of his time and attention to his artistic practice. Todaro’s work is emotional and complex, juxtaposing humanity’s presence and intervention on the environment and its effects. The relationship between humans and their emotions, wildlife, environment, or humankind itself is represented both figuratively and abstractly in his paintings.\r\n\r\n<b>About the Catalogue</b>\r\n\r\nThe catalogue contains full-colour images of each of the paintings with an essay and interview by Maison Kasini Director, Ric Kasini Kadour.\r\n\r\n<b>Details:</b>\r\n\r\nISBN 978-0-9878094-0-7\r\nPublisher: Maison Kasini Canada | 2011\r\nSize: 10″x8.5″\r\nBinding: saddle-stitched paperback\r\n20 pages\r\n13 images\r\nPublication ©2011 Maison Kasini Canada\r\nImages ©2011 David Todaro\r\nText ©2011 Ric Kasini Kadour\r\nBook Design by Ric Kasini Kadour\r\n\r\nDetails: 11″x8.5″ | 20 pages | 13 full colour images | ISBN: 978-0-9878094-0-7 | 2011","options":[{"id":21425989,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66198093/-/Todaro-COVER-Image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66198093/-/Todaro-COVER-Image.jpg","width":600,"height":706}],"artists":[{"id":128569,"name":"Maison Kasini/Kasini House","permalink":"maison-kasini-kasini-house","url":"/artist/maison-kasini-kasini-house"}],"categories":[{"id":3391049,"name":"Artist Books, Catalogs, 'zines","permalink":"artist-books-catalogs-zines","url":"/category/artist-books-catalogs-zines"}]},{"id":6753917,"name":"Hunks of Ice: Keith Magnuson by Marie-Maude Polychuck","permalink":"hunks-of-ice-keith-magnuson-by-marie-maude-polychuck","position":107,"price":60.0,"default_price":60.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/hunks-of-ice-keith-magnuson-by-marie-maude-polychuck","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-21T00:42:01.000Z","description":"They walk on water with fire in their hearts and ice in their veins.

Jeff uses the unconventional drawing technique of taping string to a wall and cutting it until a unique and unexpected composition is formed.  He photographs the resulting linework and then translates it into a more conventional fine art form.  Jeff’s string drawings ultimately make their way out of the studio and into the world in the form of screenprints, digital prints, and photographs.

The walls are painted like sky and are decorated with polyester clouds. Two box fans hang to the side. The artist is suspended, naked, in the middle of the composition in various states of ascension and plummeting. The photographs are tableaux vivants that explore the artists folly in rich colors and classical compositions.\r\n\r\nIn the Putto series, Orme presents himself as a cherub dangling from a sculptural cloud. “I was inspired to create a photographic series/performance that created entertaining conflict in the relationships between earthly and celestial bodies, gravity and loft, artifice and nature, and fantasy and reality.”\r\n\r\nBorn in 1980, Orme studied art at the University of Vermont and the Marschutz School, Aix-en-Provence (France). He lives and works in Vermont and New York City. His works have been exhibited in the United States (Vermont and New Jersey), France and the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThis catalogue presents the work exhibited at Galerie Maison Kasini in Montreal. The exhibition presented the full Icarus series, selections from the Putto series, including “Putto Interior”, “Putto Dawn” and “Putto Night”, and the cloud Orme constructed to use in photographing the Putto series. The catalogue contains an essay by Ric Kasini Kadour, artist statements, reproductions of some of the artist’s preliminary sketches and 16  images.\r\n\r\nDetails: 6″x8.5″ | 32 pages | 16 images | ISBN: 978-0-9865298-1-8 | 2010","options":[{"id":21472043,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66358565/-/co-catalog-cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66358565/-/co-catalog-cover.jpg","width":600,"height":424}],"artists":[{"id":128569,"name":"Maison Kasini/Kasini House","permalink":"maison-kasini-kasini-house","url":"/artist/maison-kasini-kasini-house"}],"categories":[{"id":3391049,"name":"Artist Books, Catalogs, 'zines","permalink":"artist-books-catalogs-zines","url":"/category/artist-books-catalogs-zines"}]},{"id":6754447,"name":"Yvon Goulet: Animal by Maison Kasini","permalink":"yvon-goulet-animal-by-maison-kasini","position":138,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/yvon-goulet-animal-by-maison-kasini","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-21T01:59:45.000Z","description":"<i>“Yvon Goulet is not a pop artist in the truest sense of the term. Goulet uses the methodology of pop art and its unique ability to present the everyday, the mundane, without moral or personal comment. He employs some of the same techniques as pop art, that is, the use of appropriated or found imagery and photomechanical reproduction. His subject, however, is neither celebrity nor mass media; rather, his focus is on subjects often passed over by mainstream or mass culture.”</i>\r\n\r\nQuebec-artist Yvon Goulet has built a reputation for himself as an “urban folklorist”. He finds his inspiration in Montreal’s Gay Village and illustrates the cultural events and festivities of the gay community. He presents daily reality and features the male body. In his works, he represents the symbols, the uniforms and fantasies which are specific to the gay culture. In so doing, he takes situations and imagery reserved for the few and makes them accessible to all. He paints on polyester panels used during election campaigns. He uses the text of the political posters on which he paints as integral parts of his work.\r\n\r\nIn a departure from his typical subject, “Yvon Goulet: Animal” presents a menagerie of work where the subject is non-human: bears, pigs, cows, goats, wolves, bats, and mosquitos. He says, “I want to pay tribute to some animals that we eat or spend our life with everyday without looking at them anymore. A steer isn’t just some red meat wrapped in plastic on a plate of styrofoam…it is also a being who has feelings just like ours.”\r\n\r\n<i>Yvon Goulet: Animal</i> contains over 40 images of the artist’s animal-themed art work and an essay Ric Kasini Kadour.\r\n\r\nBorn 1956 in Quebec City, Yvon Goulet lives in Montreal. Since 1986, he has shown in many countries, including Canada, France, South Korea, Bulgaria, Austria, Japan, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the United States, Spain, as well as the United Arab Emirates. He finished a baccalaureate at Université du Québec à Hull in 1988. In 1989 he collaborated with the University of Ottawa’s Philip Fry on a land art project in Oxford-on-Rideau, Ontario. He participated in several national and international exhibitions. In 2003, he exhibited an artist’s book <i>Touche ça</i> at Galerie 303 in the Belgo Building, Montreal; he was part of the traveling exhibition “The Gay Body” at Vieux Palais, Saint-Jérome, Quebec, (2002); he presented an artist’s book, Danger, at IV Rencontres Internationales, Marseille, France (2001); L’art et le papier IV, Jean-Claude Bergeron Gallery, Ottawa (2000); Sen-Art, biennial, Vert-Saint-Denis, France (1998); Mostra Int.

One would be remiss to categorize Shulman’s paintings with other artists who subject the public to self-indulgent, narcissistic creative endeavors. Such painters claim “art is therapy”, by which we mean art is their therapy and we sould pay attention to them because, put simply, they want attention. Shulman offers the viewer a substance far greater. As she says, “While the act of painting is an entirely private affair, the result isn’t.”\r\n\r\n<i>Helen Shulman: A Catalog of Recent Paintings</i> features Ric Kasini Kadour’s essay “Helen Shulman’s Lyrical Abstrations” in which he documents the artist’s expert use of visual language to make deeply personal painting universally accessible.

Over the course of 40 years, five hundred juried artisans, who live and work in communities throughout Vermont, have been making craft by hand with loving care and attention to detail. Frog Hollow is the first state craft center in the United States and the organization has served as a model for countless others across the country.\r\n\r\nKasini House Books is pleased to announce the publication of Frog Hollow: <i>The First 40 Years of the Nation’s First State Craft Center</i>. “Frog Hollow” contains countless images, a foreword by Senator Patrick Leahy, a history by Rachel Esch, and first-person recollections by seventeen craftspeople and almost every organization director since Frog Hollow’s founding.\r\n\r\n<i>Frog Hollow: The First 40 Years of the Nation’s First State Craft Center</i> surveys the history of this pioneering organization and examines how a group of people came together to build and nurture Frog Hollow over the last 40 years. It documents the impact of the creative economy on Vermont and its small, rural communities. The book provides a snapshot of the influence of the Back to the Land Movement on Vermont and how Frog Hollow is part of its legacy.\r\n\r\n<i>Frog Hollow: The First 40 Years of the Nation’s First State Craft Center<i/> tells the story of how a disparate group of artisans, with the support of Coca-Cola heir Allen Johnson, came together in the spirit of community. The influence of craft and the role craftmakers play in Vermont is highlighted through biography, recollection and images, including Danforth Pewter, Peter Miller, Elfriede Abbe, Sabra Field, and Woody Jackson.\r\n\r\nThrough first person accounts and an early history written by Rachel Esch, the book follows the rise of Frog Hollow through the 70s, 80s and 90s; its struggles in the first decade of this century; and its continuing path today.\r\n\r\nDETAILS\r\n\r\nTitle: <i>Frog Hollow: The First 40 Years of the Nation’s First State Craft Center</i>\r\nEdited by Robert Hunter with text by Rachel Esch and others, foreword by Senator Patrick Leahy\r\nISBN 978-0-9771397-8-1\r\nTrim Size: 6″w x 9″h\r\nBinding: Paperback, perfect bound\r\nPage Count: 150+ pages\r\nCover: Full Color\r\nIllustrations: 75+\r\nPublisher: Kasini House Books\r\nRelease Date: September 1st, 2010","options":[{"id":21458975,"name":"Default","price":24.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66310317/-/Frog-Hollow-Cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66310317/-/Frog-Hollow-Cover.jpg","width":600,"height":900}],"artists":[{"id":128569,"name":"Maison Kasini/Kasini House","permalink":"maison-kasini-kasini-house","url":"/artist/maison-kasini-kasini-house"}],"categories":[{"id":4676655,"name":"Literature","permalink":"literature","url":"/category/literature"}]},{"id":6809401,"name":"Roleplay by Lizy Mostowski","permalink":"roleplay-by-lizy-mostowski","position":146,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/roleplay-by-lizy-mostowski","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-27T21:09:49.000Z","description":"“I itched, following the bugs crawling up my neck, like pins and needles, through my hair, to the crown of my head.

With double the page count, we’ve included twice as many beautiful two page photo spreads, interviews with some of L.A.’s most interesting homosexuals, and some great art and writing pieces from this city’s vibrant queer art scene.\r\n\r\nIssue No.2 Editor’s note:\r\n\r\n“The pigeons are humping, the Jacaranda trees are covering the city in purple and the first Summertramp of the season kicked it all off like a wet and  drunken, urban Bacchanal. It’s that time of year in Los Angeles when you just want be outside, in one of the many natural spaces Angelinos are lucky to have all around us. Whether barbecuing at Bellevue, hiking up Griffith, or cruising in Elysian, the parks are calling your name. Its time for day trips to El Matador, Angeles Crest or Topanga Canyon, and weekend getaways to the deserts of Joshua Tree, the redwoods of Sequoia, or the beach towns of the great California coast.\r\n\r\nWherever you choose to go to commune with nature, the important thing is that you get out there and you do it. Maybe you’re Phyllis Nefler from  Troop Beverly Hills and need a cappuccino by your campfire. Fine, grab your battery-operated bean grinder and go. The massive migration of gay people into metropolitan cities in search of acceptance and community has centered homo culture around urban things. I love bar nights and beer busts as much as the next fag, but the connections made among men while out in nature are unique.\r\n\r\nFor centuries queer authors have written about running off into the Greenwood, away from the stares and stigmas of society, to find the freedom to be our gay selves. Though we no longer have to seclude our sexuality, Brokeback Mountain style in remote mountain hide-aways, there’s still something special about taking it back to more primitive times. Connecting nature to the natural bonds of love and friendship we form with each other creates a dynamic that’s different than what we experience in our big city lives. This is not a radical call to action. You don’t have to abandon your cars and condos and move to Alaska (or Tennessee). I love the city too much for that. I simply urge you to appreciate the abundance of nature we have around us, and spend a bit more time among the birds and the bees.”\r\n\r\nDetails: 8.5″x5.5″ | 84 pages | black & white with full color cover | Published in Los Angeles, California, USA  | Summer 2011 ","options":[{"id":21473491,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66364437/-/jimmy-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66364437/-/jimmy-2.jpg","width":373,"height":551}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3391049,"name":"Artist Books, Catalogs, 'zines","permalink":"artist-books-catalogs-zines","url":"/category/artist-books-catalogs-zines"}]},{"id":6743439,"name":"Pinups No. 6 featuring Scott","permalink":"pinups-no-6-featuring-scott","position":148,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pinups-no-6-featuring-scott","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-19T22:00:17.000Z","description":"<i>Pinups</i> is a fresh take on the notion of the Pin Up Girl, as embodied by Betty Grable in the 1940s.

Unlike haiku, where the subject is nature, senryu trades in the foibles of man, treating its subject with dark humor and cynicism.\r\n\r\n“The point of combining senryu and nudes is to suggest that poems must evolve from a state of psychological nudity,” writes Awodey. The drawings in the book are poetic moments in and of themselves, rendered in a loose, gestural style.

For most of the twentieth century, this organization has fostered and supported artists in northern Vermont and held an annual exhibition of their art work. Maxfield Parrish, Francis Colburn, Stan Marc Wright, Alden Bryan Sr. and his wife Mary Bryan are just a few of their notable members. Artist and historian Robert Waldo Brunelle, Jr. offers this history of the organization. Brunelle has been president of the NVAA since 1995 and studied under former NVAA president, and renowned art professor, Roy Kennedy. This is the definitive history of this important art organization.\r\n\r\nThe phrase “Vermont Artist” fits no one better than Robert Waldo Brunelle, Jr. He is a seventh-generation Vermonter, with roots dating back to the 1750’s. He counts among his artistic ancestors a great-grandfather, great-grandmother and great-great grandfather, all of whom were painters. Brunelle was born in Rutland, Vermont in 1958. As he puts it, ”I learned to draw before I learned to write!” Although he drew incessantly as a child, he received no formal art training until attending St. Michael’s College in 1976. There he fell under the influence of former NVAA president, and renowned art professor, Roy Kennedy, well-known painter Lance Richbourg, and the namesake of the Sloane Art Center, Sy Sloane. Brunelle graduated in 1980 with a double degree in History and Fine Arts, and went on to earn a Master’s in Art Education at Castleton State College.

In this spirit, Maison Kasini is pleased to offer a folio of six prints by Costa Rican-born, Montreal artist Alan Ganev.\r\n\r\n“Amuse Bouche” is a folio of six, 12”x12” prints by Alan Ganev: <i>Passing By, F&B, Sterling, BUBLÉ, Pajarito, and Killing Appetite</i>.  The folios are presented in a black sleeve and signed by the artist. The folio will be officially released at Papier 11, Montreal’s contemporary art fair of works on paper, April 14th to April 17th, 2011. The original six works will debut at Rouge 58 in Brooklyn in May 2011.\r\n\r\n<b>About Alan Ganev</b>\r\n\r\nOriginally from Costa Rica, collage artist Alan Ganev has been calling Montreal home for several years. Ganev is meticulous in his process. He cuts the images delicately and is exact about the position and alignment of the elements in the composition. The compositions are rich, yet simple, using no more than three images, some geometrical shapes and bright colours.\r\n\r\nGanev says about his work: “I spend hours going through forgotten publications looking for images to steal my attention. Once I choose a couple of images I want to work with, these images start sending me messages, and as a result, I start making connections with them. Sometimes these connections are profound and emotional and some other times they are casual and humorous.”\r\n\r\nAlan Ganev is currently completing his Bachelor of Fine Arts in Design at Concordia University and is also a co-founder of CEASE, a non-profit artist collective in Montreal that diffuses art through events, blog, magazine and art initiative.\r\n\r\nDetails: 6 prints measuring 12” x 12” on paper | The folio is presented loose in a black sleeve with a white label | 2011 | Edition of 50","options":[{"id":20852793,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64431445/-/Alan-Ganev-Amuse-Bouche-All-Images.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64431445/-/Alan-Ganev-Amuse-Bouche-All-Images.jpg","width":403,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":128569,"name":"Maison Kasini/Kasini House","permalink":"maison-kasini-kasini-house","url":"/artist/maison-kasini-kasini-house"}],"categories":[{"id":3391163,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":6736427,"name":"The Hat Is the Worst Part by Rowan Cornell-Brown","permalink":"the-hat-is-the-worst-part-by-rowan-cornell-brown","position":157,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-hat-is-the-worst-part-by-rowan-cornell-brown","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-19T02:15:44.000Z","description":"“Some of the poems were very good and some were not.

The paintings are rendered in a style that combines contemporary graphic design and American Pop Art. As portraits, they are Warhol-esque: square with bold, deep colours and shapes reminiscent of screenprinting. London introduces texture and complexity with patterns that cast light and shadow onto a simple rendering. The result is big, bold paintings that convey their intense emotional experiences: joy, rage, surprise, helplessness. For adult viewers, these paintings are intended to be a connection between a current, developed emotional state and the raw, untempered emotions of our past.\r\n\r\n<i>About Luis London</i>\r\n\r\nLuis London comes from a traditional illustration and graphic design background. He began to experiment painting at an early age, following the teachings of his father, an art teacher by trade. He studied at the Bribiesca Design Institute in Guadalajara, Mexico. He lives and works in Montreal.\r\n\r\nThis catalogue presents the work exhibited at Galerie Maison Kasini in Montreal. The catalogue includes a 20-minute sound piece on CD-R created by the artist and also entitled Repercussions. Each situation that we live through during our childhood can have an impact as we grow up, these sounds are meant to express the aforementioned experiences and support each art piece and the series as a whole.

The two artists first met on a panel discussion hosted by Seattle’s 2006 Decibel Festival at the Henry Art Gallery, and both immediately recognized a connection between their two bodies of sound work; using altered field recordings and sharing a mutual interest in exploring the ability of sound to alter the atmosphere of spaces we inhabit–physically and emotionally.\r\n\r\nTwo months later, the two artists met once again at the Henry Art Gallery to perform <i>Auditorium</i>, which uses the performance space itself as a sonic point of departure. Recordings made by Novak of the empty space were amplified and layered to create a singular, modulating drone which enhanced the particular “fingerprint” of the space. Drouin’s approach was to define the space with a more scalpel-like hand, inserting sonic pings and rhythms which called attention to the depth and scale of the auditorium, and to interject more textual sounds which would occasionally push the listeners attention outside of the building, reminding them of the thin membrane between the inside/outside worlds.\r\n\r\nDetails: sound recording | 5″ CD-R | 48:17 | Publisher: Dragon’s Eye Recordings | Edition of 400 | 2007","options":[{"id":20930979,"name":"Default","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64686541/-/yn-auditorium.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64686541/-/yn-auditorium.jpg","width":164,"height":164}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3401981,"name":"Sound Art","permalink":"sound-art","url":"/category/sound-art"}]},{"id":6546149,"name":"Printoptik by Carl David Ruttan","permalink":"printoptik-by-carl-david-ruttan","position":175,"price":24.95,"default_price":24.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/printoptik-by-carl-david-ruttan","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-26T08:52:20.000Z","description":"Maison Kasini announces the publication of <i>Printoptik</i> by Carl David Ruttan.\r\n\r\nHow do we read the collage work of Carl David Ruttan? <i>Printoptik</i> acts as a lens presenting several points of view on this question. Essays by Mark Grenon, Meaghan Thurston, and Henri Michaud explore the different ways in which the artist uses collage in his work.\r\n\r\nRuttan produces a large body of small art collages while travelling. His source material is bits of found paper collected while walking the streets of lands both foreign and familiar. At home, he blows-up the collage to make a one-of-a-kind fine art print that explores the micro-world of paper.\r\n\r\nRuttan has also taken thousands of photographs of “found collage”: images of layered and torn posters, paints and textures. The processes of street photography, decollage and collage merge to take the reader on a visual journey.\r\n\r\n<i>Printoptik</i> is a visual feast. The book is lavishly illustrated with Ruttan’s colourful images. Three critical essays describe Ruttan’s work as reflections on collecting, diary keeping, ripping, tearing, reclaiming, printing, and especially seeing.\r\n\r\n<b>About Carl David Ruttan</b>\r\n\r\nA consummate traveler, Carl David Ruttan makes collages with graphic ephemera he finds along the way: Chinese cigarette cartons, Indian candy wrappers, torn bits of music posters from the street. Working in a rented room in Berlin, a youth hostel in Switzerland, on the beach in India, or his apartment in Montreal, Ruttan spreads out the fragments and brings the bits and pieces together in composition. When done, he slides the small 3.75” x 2.75” collages into a plastic sleeve. At Atelier Circulaire in Montreal, Ruttan scans them at extremely high resolution, and produces one unique print to accompany the original collage as the final, archivally stable work of art. The final photographic quality digital print creates a convincing tactile optic which the eye perceives as an original collage.\r\n\r\nCarl David Ruttan was born in 1976 in Oshawa, Ontario. He studied fine art at the University of Ottawa, completing his Bachelors of Fine Art in 2000. He has traveled extensively in Asia, North America, Europe and on numerous islands of the Caribean and South Pacific. Carl Settled in Montreal in 2001 after his first trip to Asia. Ruttan is an active member of both the printmaking workshop Atelier Circulaire and Montreal artist-run centre Articule.\r\n\r\nLike many contemporary artists, Ruttan’s art making practice includes many mediums. He makes small dry-point intaglio and relief prints that offer a unique aesthetic and a simple, accessible style. He takes macro photographs of found objects, urban scenes, and textures of various sorts—paint, plywood, brick—and blows them up. He has maked some sculpture and he paints with acrylic on canvas and wood. Yet, it is in his collage work that the dominant themes of his art practice come together. Multi-layered, texture-rich colour compositions are composed from the colours and images that printed media lay before the artist as he navigates the sea of symbols around him. They are both the vehicle for self-expression, and limiting agent, determining the palette and tiny details of paper quality that will define the final work.\r\n\r\n<b>About the Book</b>\r\n\r\nThe book presents the collage work of Carl David Ruttan. It was launched in conjunction with Ruttan’s solo show, “Trusted Everywhere by Everyone”, exhibited at Galerie Maison Kasini in Montreal, October 19-November 19, 2011. The book contains full-colour images with essays by Meaghan Thurston, Mark Grenon, and Henri Michaud.\r\n\r\nAbout Meaghan Thurston: Meaghan Thurston has published reviews of visual art and culture in <i>The Rover: Montreal Arts Uncovered</i> and an essay on the American photographer Francesca Woodman in <i>Forum: The University of Edinburgh’s Journal of Arts and Culture</i>. Her text and photographs on the site-specific art installations of British artist Katy Bentall were published in November 2011 in <i>Onsite Review</i>, Calgary.\r\n\r\nAbout Mark Grenon: A native of Ottawa, Mark Grenon has taught English in the Czech Republic, Taiwan, and Chile. He currently lives in Montreal, where his interests include poetry and poetics, digital photography, and painting.\r\n\r\nAbout Henri Michaud: Coming from a background in black and white film photography, Henri quickly jumped into the digital realm while refusing to surrender the processing of prints to commercial laboratories. He strongly believes that the photographic process does not end when the shutter closes. He has worked for years in the newspaper industry providing photo manipulation services and running pre-press departments.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\nISBN 978-0-9878094-1-4\r\nPublisher: Maison Kasini Canada | 2011\r\nSize: 9″x7″\r\nBinding: perfect-bound paperback\r\n66 pages\r\nfull colour images\r\nPublication ©2011 Maison Kasini Canada\r\nImages ©2011 Carl David Ruttan\r\nText ©2011 Mark Grenon, Henri Michaud, Meaghan Thurston, Carl David Ruttan\r\nBook Design by Patsy Hayes","options":[{"id":20811453,"name":"Default","price":24.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64294829/-/Printoptik-by-Carl-David-Ruttan-COVER.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64294829/-/Printoptik-by-Carl-David-Ruttan-COVER.jpg","width":467,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":128167,"name":"Carl David Ruttan","permalink":"carl-david-ruttan","url":"/artist/carl-david-ruttan"},{"id":178443,"name":"Kolaj","permalink":"kolaj","url":"/artist/kolaj"},{"id":128569,"name":"Maison Kasini/Kasini House","permalink":"maison-kasini-kasini-house","url":"/artist/maison-kasini-kasini-house"}],"categories":[{"id":3391049,"name":"Artist Books, Catalogs, 'zines","permalink":"artist-books-catalogs-zines","url":"/category/artist-books-catalogs-zines"},{"id":4676655,"name":"Literature","permalink":"literature","url":"/category/literature"}]},{"id":6742613,"name":"This Little Piggy 1 by Alan Alejo","permalink":"this-little-piggy-1-by-alan-alejo","position":176,"price":80.0,"default_price":80.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/this-little-piggy-1-by-alan-alejo","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-19T20:10:30.000Z","description":"Details: 2.75″x3.125″ | oil on wood | 2010","options":[{"id":21426515,"name":"Default","price":80.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66199169/-/This-Little-Piggy-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66199169/-/This-Little-Piggy-1.jpg","width":600,"height":515}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3394833,"name":"Paintings","permalink":"paintings","url":"/category/paintings"}]},{"id":6585945,"name":"Pinups #15 featuring Micka","permalink":"pinups-15-featuring-micka","position":177,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pinups-15-featuring-micka","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-01T00:04:55.000Z","description":"<i>Pinups</i> is a fresh take on the notion of the Pin Up Girl, as embodied by Betty Grable in the 1940s.

Paul Winter graced the site with his music and Floating World Dancers performed.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, on September 11th, 2001, in a spontaneous response to the events in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, DC, Sally Linder began walking the 500 pound <i>Ark of Hope</i> from Vermont to New York City. Hundreds of people participated in the walking journey that lasted two months, covered 350 miles through four states and included sailing on Pete Seeger’s sloop <i>Clearwater</i>. The <i>Ark of Hope</i> was exhibited at the United Nations in January and February 2002.\r\n\r\nSally Linder’s journey began much earlier. While traveling native lands in Arizona and Montana, Linder was moved to paint “Manifest Destiny”, a series of work about the American Indian experience. Upon hearing of an electrical fire at the Philadelphia Zoo that killed 23 primates, she painted their portraits and then with the help of the indigenous Dayak, Antandroy, and Bakweri, the 14 paintings of the 23 primates were buried in the jungles of Borneo, Madagascar, and Cameroon. Along with these performative acts, Linder created abstract, meditative paintings that reflect, what Cameron Davis calls, a “clarity of deep listening.”\r\n\r\nThe book documents the creative progress of Vermont artist Sally Linder. Her subjects are inspired by Earth’s beauty and the social and political issues that confront humankind. Her journey has taken her from the canyons of Arizona to the jungles of Borneo to the United Nations. <i>Sally Linder: Paintings 1992-2009</i> is more than a collection of paintings, it is a document of an artist’s ability to listen and respond to the world around them with impact, power, and remarkable sensitivity. This catalogue was published in conjunction with the exhibition, “Pilgrimage: Remote and Inner Landscapes”, held April 2-May 1, 2010 at the Firehouse Gallery in Burlington, Vermont. The volume includes introductory text by Amanda Sanfilippo and essay by Cameron Davis.\r\n\r\nDetails: 11″x8.5″ | 110 pages | 104 images | ISBN: 978-0-9865298-2-5 | 2010","options":[{"id":20926837,"name":"Default","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64675213/-/Cover-Sally-Linder-Paintings.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64675213/-/Cover-Sally-Linder-Paintings.jpg","width":600,"height":777}],"artists":[{"id":128569,"name":"Maison Kasini/Kasini House","permalink":"maison-kasini-kasini-house","url":"/artist/maison-kasini-kasini-house"}],"categories":[{"id":3391049,"name":"Artist Books, Catalogs, 'zines","permalink":"artist-books-catalogs-zines","url":"/category/artist-books-catalogs-zines"}]},{"id":6742597,"name":"The Hitchhiker’s Song by Alan Alejo","permalink":"the-hitchhikers-song-by-alan-alejo","position":184,"price":80.0,"default_price":80.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-hitchhikers-song-by-alan-alejo","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-19T20:07:35.000Z","description":"Details: 2.75″x4.25″ | oil on wood | 2010","options":[{"id":21426353,"name":"Default","price":80.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66198981/-/Alan-Alejo-HitchHikersong1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66198981/-/Alan-Alejo-HitchHikersong1.jpg","width":600,"height":388}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3394833,"name":"Paintings","permalink":"paintings","url":"/category/paintings"}]},{"id":6584785,"name":"Anniversary by Px©","permalink":"anniversary-by-px","position":185,"price":150.0,"default_price":150.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/anniversary-by-px","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-30T20:16:24.000Z","description":"Details: 10″x8″ image in 13″x17″ frame | collage | 2010","options":[{"id":20925387,"name":"Default","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64670197/-/anniversary_by_the_Px_corporation.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64670197/-/anniversary_by_the_Px_corporation.jpg","width":560,"height":700}],"artists":[{"id":128555,"name":"Px(c)","permalink":"px-c","url":"/artist/px-c"}],"categories":[{"id":3394599,"name":"Collage","permalink":"collage","url":"/category/collage"}]},{"id":6578129,"name":"JIMMY Issue #1: Male Intimacy","permalink":"jimmy-issue-1-male-intimacy","position":188,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/jimmy-issue-1-male-intimacy","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-29T21:40:48.000Z","description":"JIMMY, a new queer zine from California, is a forty-to-fifty page, 5.25″x8.25″ postcard from the L.A. underground.

Working in a rented room in Berlin, a youth hostel in Switzerland, on the beach in India, or his apartment in Montreal, Ruttan spreads out the fragments and brings the bits and pieces together in composition. When done, he slides the small 3.75” x 2.75” collages into a plastic sleeve. At Atelier Circulaire in Montreal, Ruttan scans them at extremely high resolution, and produces one unique print to accompany the original collage as the final, archivally stable work of art. The final photographic quality print creates a convincing tactile optic which the eye perceives as an original collage.\r\n\r\nMulti-layered, texture-rich colour compositions are composed from the colours and images that printed media lay before the artist as he navigates the sea of symbols around him. They are both the vehicle for self-expression, and limiting agent, determining the palette and tiny details of paper quality that will define the final work.\r\n\r\n“Big Winner” is a collection of ten small prints that showcase Ruttan’s approach to collage and printmaking. The edition is limited to fifty.\r\n\r\nCarl David Ruttan was born in 1976 in Oshawa, Ontario. He studied fine art at the University of Ottawa, completing his Bachelors of Fine Art in 2000. He has traveled extensively in Asia, North America, Europe and on numerous islands of the Caribbean and South Pacific. Carl settled in Montreal in 2001 after his first trip to Asia. Ruttan is an active member of both the printmaking workshop Atelier Circulaire and Montreal artist-run centre articule.\r\n","options":[{"id":20880899,"name":"Default","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64513445/-/Big-Winner-Folio-IMAGE.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64513445/-/Big-Winner-Folio-IMAGE.jpg","width":480,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68064115/-/big-winner-all-images.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68064115/-/big-winner-all-images.jpg","width":400,"height":764}],"artists":[{"id":128167,"name":"Carl David Ruttan","permalink":"carl-david-ruttan","url":"/artist/carl-david-ruttan"},{"id":178443,"name":"Kolaj","permalink":"kolaj","url":"/artist/kolaj"}],"categories":[{"id":3394599,"name":"Collage","permalink":"collage","url":"/category/collage"},{"id":3391163,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":6568305,"name":"Mononcle by Yvon Goulet","permalink":"mononcle-by-yvon-goulet","position":194,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mononcle-by-yvon-goulet","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-28T20:39:50.000Z","description":"Details: 16″x16″ | Mixed media on recycled plastic poster | Unique 1 of 1 | 2011","options":[{"id":20880113,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64511157/-/2011_Mononcle_mixte_m__dia_sur_plastique_recycl___16_X_16_50_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64511157/-/2011_Mononcle_mixte_m__dia_sur_plastique_recycl___16_X_16_50_.jpg","width":386,"height":378}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3394833,"name":"Paintings","permalink":"paintings","url":"/category/paintings"}]},{"id":6567987,"name":"Black & White Monument (making of) by Px(c)","permalink":"black-white-monument-making-of","position":195,"price":75.0,"default_price":75.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/black-white-monument-making-of","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-28T19:59:47.000Z","description":"Details: 5″ x 7″ | Collage on Canson mounting board (acid free) | Unique 1 of 1 | 2011","options":[{"id":20879179,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64507525/-/PXC-black-and-white-monument.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64507525/-/PXC-black-and-white-monument.jpg","width":600,"height":419}],"artists":[{"id":128555,"name":"Px(c)","permalink":"px-c","url":"/artist/px-c"}],"categories":[{"id":3394599,"name":"Collage","permalink":"collage","url":"/category/collage"}]},{"id":6560983,"name":"2009 Papirmasse–Complete Set","permalink":"2009-papirmassecomplete-set","position":196,"price":80.0,"default_price":80.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/2009-papirmassecomplete-set","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-28T00:09:51.000Z","description":"<i>Papirmasse</i> is a magazine, original artwork, and social experiment all rolled into one.
