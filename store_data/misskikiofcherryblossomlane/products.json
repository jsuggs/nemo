Destiny Rescue supports Fair Trade and by purchasing these dolls you will be giving these girls the opportunity to maintain a liveable wage while purchasing a doll worthy of a story to tell.\r\n\r\nEach doll arrives tagged with a new specially designed label that reads: Miss Kiki of Cherry Blossom Lane handmade by Destiny Rescue. They also have swingtags attached by Destiny Rescue acknowledging that they are handmade by the girls. Designs will vary in colourways pictured owing to their creativity and fabrics available at the time.\r\n\r\nTwo styles of dolls are available, representing the journey these rescued girls have traveled and their newfound freedom for themselves and their future children. Such are the \"Freedom Collection\" of Kiki Dolls and the \"Liberty Collection\" of BabyKiki Dolls.\r\n\r\n'Free Spirit' dolls are sewn by young rescue girls learning to sew. Although they are not quite representative of the quality of the collection, having a few quirky aspects and speak of their own creativity, we are making them available to honour their childlike charm, value their contribution and give these young rescue girls a sense of pride and achievement. \r\n\r\nPlease visit the blog to read more about our venture with Destiny Rescue and visit their website www.destinyrescue.org\r\n\r\nTheir presence in our collection is to give voice to this cause with the stability of our brand. All profits go back into materials for the girls to continue earning a liveable wage. They are very excited about creating this collection and are personally invested in each one, knowing it is voicing their freedom in Australia.\r\n\r\nQuality control will take place in Thailand by DR's head seamstress and our affiliate. We will also inspect each doll as they arrive to our studio ready for their finishing touches. You can be assured of purchasing a beautiful product with an even more inspiring story. Please appreciate that due to cultural differences there may be some imperfect or quirky elements on the dolls but, they are created with great pride and joy. These dolls are better suited as a conversational piece or an older child's toy.\r\n\r\nThank you for supporting their FREEDOM.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Boutique and Fair Trade Store orders most welcome**\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy FREE SHIPPING throughout Australia.
