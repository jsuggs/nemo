It measures 5.5\" x 5.5\" x 1\".\r\n\r\nAll edges and surfaces are hand sanded until the animal is incredibly smooth to the touch, and painted by hand with nontoxic, water-based paints (it's more of a stain than a traditional paint job; the natural pattern of the wood can be seen beneath the paint, and there's no chance that the paint will peel). The figure is then sealed with a nontoxic water lacquer, keeping the color intact.\r\n\r\nWe absolutely LOVE Holztiger and have carried their toys for years. In all this time, we've never seen a Holztiger product break or lose its paint. These toys are made to be handed down from generation to generation.
