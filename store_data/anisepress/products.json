In the interview, Sendak is quite sentimental and tender, and the advice he gives becomes a kind of valedictory statement for all he had experienced over eight decades: “Live your life.  Live your life.  Live your life.”</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:1.25em;line-height:135%;\">Our design approach was to visually match the deepening power of the repeated phrase by printing the quotation in darkening warm hues.
