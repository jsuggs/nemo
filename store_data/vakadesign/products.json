I have always felt quite strongly about using only natural, untreated gems. I've been a bit loud about this! So why am I now jumping on the moissanite bandwagon? \r\n\r\nMoissanite first caught my eye when Charles & Colvard recently introduced their newest moissanite line, Forever Brilliant. While older generations of moissanite were creamier-looking than real white diamonds, C&C's Forever Brilliant hit the nail on the head. It is as clear and white as a white diamond, with BETTER optical properties. It's light dispersion is 2.4 better than a natural diamond, and it is higher on the refractive index scale (meaning more brilliance). \r\n\r\nIt's very pretty, but lots of things are very pretty: how does it hold up? Nothing wears and holds up like a diamond, right? After all, it was diamond's hardness that propelled it to be used thousands of years ago as a symbol of unbreakable state contracts and treaties, eventually coming to be used to symbolize unbreakable wedding vows. A diamond is the hardest mineral on Earth, a 10 on the Mohs scale, followed by sapphires at 9. Well, moissanite is a 9.25. That is really, really hard, and moissanite is going to hold up to all the wear and tear you can give it. \r\n\r\nAnd the clincher? Charles and Colvard back their stone with a certification of authenticity and a life time warranty. \r\n\r\nI'm sold. Will I now stop using diamonds? No! A diamond is a diamond, but Forever Brilliant is a beautiful, affordable, earth-friendly alternative.\r\n\r\nFor the history of moissanite: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moissanite","options":[{"id":41165931,"name":"Default","price":425.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122640924/-/moissenitependant4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122640924/-/moissenitependant4.jpg","width":1781,"height":1336},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122640912/-/moissenitependant.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122640912/-/moissenitependant.jpg","width":1888,"height":1416},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122640915/-/moissenitependant2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122640915/-/moissenitependant2.jpg","width":2061,"height":1546},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122640918/-/moissenitependant3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122640918/-/moissenitependant3.jpg","width":360,"height":270},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122640930/-/moissenitependant6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122640930/-/moissenitependant6.jpg","width":2718,"height":3624}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":197728,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]},{"id":14621739,"name":"18k Groovy Dangle Earrings","permalink":"18k-groovy-dangle-earrings","position":16,"price":325.0,"default_price":325.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/18k-groovy-dangle-earrings","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-04T23:34:34.000Z","description":"When I was just a little Vakadesign, I used to love playing with my Mom's jewelry.
