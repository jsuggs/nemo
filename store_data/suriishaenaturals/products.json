The Organic Nilotica Shea Nuts are collected by local women’s collecting cooperatives within East Africa from organically certified trees. These Nuts are then transported to Kenya, where they are cold-pressed and no further processing is required to produce this most exquisite, distinct and beautiful butter. This production process ensures that the butter retains its many unique properties.\r\n\r\nIt has a rather unique fatty acid profile that gives it some remarkable moisturising properties.  It can help to retain skin elasticity and is incredibly useful for treating very dry, cracked and sun damaged-skin as well as psoriasis and eczema.  It can also help to reduce stretch marks.\r\n\r\nNilotica is a wonderful addition to hair care products (particularly for damaged, dry and brittle hair).  Can be used alone or as part of a formulation for dry lips. \r\n\r\nIt is also beneficial in helping to reduce swelling and inflammation and so is excellent for use in formulations for muscular aches and pains.\r\n\r\nNilotica is premium shea butter with some very distinct properties and advantages over paradoxa. \r\n\r\n· Lower melting point (15c – 18c)\r\n· Superior texture (very soft and creamy)\r\n· Higher nutritive value\r\n· Non-sticky\r\n· Milder/lighter nutty aroma\r\n· Incredibly moisturising\r\n· More readily absorbed into the skin and hair\r\n· Higher olein content\r\n· Minimal processing\r\n\r\nNilotica has a lower melting point to paradoxa and so is more sensitive to heat.  Please be aware that during transit, there is a possibility that it will be exposed to temperature changes causing it to melt.  When it resets, it may develop a gritty texture (quite common with shea as well as some other natural butters).  Sit in refrigerator for 10-15 or until butter solidifies.\r\n\r\nStore in a cool dry place away from heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage level up to 100%\r\nI personally use it as an all over body moisturizer and LOVE it!
