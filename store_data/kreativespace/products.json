The upholstery fabric is in a bold fuchsia colour as a feature. It is finished with a layer of wax to add protection and a light sheen. The overall look is slightly\r\n distressed.\r\n\r\nit is a vintage style wooden chair with lovely details, perfect for dining or in a cottage environment.\r\n\r\nDimensions: H seat 420mm, H chair 750mm, W 460mm, D 430mm\r\n\r\nThis is a second hand chair so it will show some sign of usage - but this just adds to the vintage feeling and is giving a history to the chair.\r\n\r\nCollection from Ipswich is free. \r\nAlternatively we can arrange delivery or courier service, please contact us for a quote.\r\nInternational delivery is also possible.
