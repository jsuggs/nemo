In a bold move, BRILLIG recorded and mixed in analogue to 2″ tape, a specialty of Mixmasters Studios.\r\n\r\nThe result is BRILLIG’s most engaging and hook-laden offering yet. Full of the warmth and clarity that defines the band’s ‘live’ sound, the album captures that bit of mystery and mischief that is the essence of BRILLIG.\r\n\r\nNow with FREE SHIPPING\r\n\r\nFor DIGITAL versions of this LP, go to \r\niTunes http://bit.ly/15ZIICt  \r\nor\r\nCd Baby http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/brillig2\r\n","options":[{"id":29393801,"name":"Default","price":26.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/92335694/-/Brillig_IAin_tEverGonnaSeeTheSea_COVERCROP_900w.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/92335694/-/Brillig_IAin_tEverGonnaSeeTheSea_COVERCROP_900w.jpg","width":900,"height":792}],"artists":[{"id":162603,"name":"Brillig","permalink":"brillig","url":"/artist/brillig"}],"categories":[{"id":1432821,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":9525653,"name":"Most Unlucky of the Lucky Deer (2012 Rarities EP)","permalink":"most-unlucky-of-the-lucky-deer-rarities-ep","position":2,"price":11.95,"default_price":11.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/most-unlucky-of-the-lucky-deer-rarities-ep","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-17T04:20:55.000Z","description":"Limited Edition EP of rarities, released at Brillig’s annual Xmas show.
