Der Name Xylinum ist abgeleitet von dem Bakterium Acetobacter Xylinum, welches künstlich Cellulose produziert und damit jede beliebige Form beschichten kann. Für diesen Prozess benötigt es lediglich in einer Flüssigkeit gelösten Zucker. Nach der Erzeugung kann das Material getrocknet werden. Das Resultat ist ein stabiles und 100% biologisch abbaubares Material. Die Umfangreichen Versuchsreihen und Erfahrungen mit dem Material Bakteriencellulose werden werden in dem Buch nach Komplexität gegliedert, bilderreich erklärt und gezeigt.","options":[{"id":25881459,"name":"Default","price":89.9,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/80743509/-/7.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/80743509/-/7.jpg","width":620,"height":460}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4086687,"name":"book","permalink":"book","url":"/category/book"}]}]
