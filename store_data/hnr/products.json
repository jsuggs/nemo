The woman there said that they had belonged to her father and were “field recordings” of a turn-of-the century orchestra. It took me maybe another year to actually load them up and transfer them to the computer. When I did, what I found was an incredible documentation of indigenous folkloric music that was meticulously recorded and then later transfered to 2-track tape sometime in the 1960’s. The tapes were labeled “Contact Field Orchestra”-- a collection of field recordings that seem to date from sometime around the turn of the 20th century (possibly a little earlier). \r\n\r\n\tAfter transferring the tapes and cleaning them up as best I could, I discovered that due to the frequency range, they must have been recorded largely with hand-made piezo transducers of some sort. Some of the tapes were partially destroyed, so I found that I had to re-play or play over the songs as best I could to fill-in and augment the original ideas. I tried to stay as true to the original recordings as much as possible. I’ll admit I took some liberties with the EQ (perhaps too much...) and where applicable added a small amount of delay and reverb to accent the track. (Okay, and maybe a few electric guitars...sue me.) \r\n\r\n\tThe result, I think, is an amazing collection of esoteric folk recordings of a mysterious band of San Gabriel miners turned musicians. Apparently having given-up after the gold boom, these folks stayed in what would later become Upper Mallard Canyon in Altadena -- living in the old Dawn’s Mine shaft, and crafting their own instruments from discarded mining equipment and whatever small guitars and banjos they had brought with them.\r\n\r\n        The sound this orchestra created is like something out of a Jim Jarmusch film, and reminds me of an old Library of Congress or Folkways recording. The music itself is full of opposites -- hypnotizing and odd; meditative and jarring. It’s strangely familiar, but also distantly unrecognizable. Some songs are more minimalist in their approach, building up a rhythm with mbiras and percussion, while others seem to have much more harmony and tonal structure and almost Blues/Country feel. Either way, they had me hooked from the first bar, and I find myself returning to it again and again, irregardless of my heavy-handed noodling...\r\n\t\r\nI’m really happy to have discovered this, and I hope you are too. \r\n\t\r\n\tAll the best, \r\n \tDamon Aaron\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWritten and Produced by Damon Aaron \r\nPublished by Fleischman Audio (BMI)\r\nAll songs Performed by Contact Field Orchestra\r\nAdditional Horns, Percussion & Melodica: Michael McDaniel\r\nMastered by Erick Labson\r\nMonogram by Cryptik\r\nArt Direction by  Brandy Flower\r\nJackets Screenprinted by Hit+Run Crew, Los Angeles\r\n\r\nwww.contactfieldorchestra.com\r\nwww.thehitandrun.com\r\n\r\n© 2013 HIT+RUN, P.O.

Years later; new life, new city, new day and age. I found the music again, which I never stopped loving and decided to send it all to Kutmah.” \r\n\r\nThis 8-song EP by SEVEN DAVIS JR, comes on heavy 12\" vinyl & housed in a hand-screenprinted chipboard jacket.

Nestled amongst the dank clouds of Marley's ghost and a storm of Hendrix's acid-drenched guitars, rests the gloomy and defiant oeuvre \"Constructs\".  The political skank of \"Liars\" and decaying jazz of \"Dreamers\" showdown with the dreggy drums of \"Dirt Nap\", and in the end the listener is transported to a place only known as \"The Nagual\". \r\n\r\nCHITLINS debut EP features an appearance by Norwood \"Fish\" Fisher, founding member of the legendary Los Angeles ska-punk band FISHBONE. The digipak cd showcases brilliant artwork by Los Angeles graffiti icon MEAR ONE of the notorious CBS Crew. The limited-edition full-color digipak cd features the CHITLINS logo (designed by Brandy Flower of HIT+RUN) embossed across the cover. Each copy of the album comes with one 4\" clear vinyl sticker, as well as a collectible 1\" metallic button pack (comes with 3 buttons).\r\n\r\nIn 2012, \"Dulce\" (the instrumental version of \"Dulce De Leche\") first appeared on the compilation HIT+RUN Presents \"Road Kill Vol. 1\" which featured 29 exclusive tracks by luminary Los Angeles producers THE GASLAMP KILLER, DAEDELUS, J.ROCC, RAS_G, KUTMAH, MONO/POLY, THAVIUS BECK and many more.  CHITLINS has lent his Mastering skills and studio production wizardry to over 20 albums for LA art Crew HIT+RUN since 2010, and this EP celebrates their 25th release. \r\n\r\nCHITLINS' work as a Recording Engineer for Interscope Records from 2000-2004 led to his current position as a Senior Writer/Composer for Beacon Street Studios located in Venice Beach CA.  CHITLINS is the mastermind behind many popular television commercial jingles and award winning spots for clients such as ADIDAS, MAZDA, BMW,  GEICO, MILLER, BURGER KING, and BACARDI to name a few.  CHITLINS' satirical vocal performance for WENDY'S is much-rumored to have inspired Jay-Z to write his infamous \"Death of Auto-Tune\".  CHITLINS currently lives in Venice, California.\r\n\r\nLook for limited-editon green & silver \"Wanna\" flexi-discs, limited-edition 1\" button packs, upcoming Los Angeles-area EP release parties, as well as CHITLINS live appearance at \"CRASH+BURN 2013\" the annual HIT+RUN Summer party on July 27th at the Echoplex. \r\n\r\nwww.chitlins.com","options":[{"id":36219156,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/113125602/-/chitlinscover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/113125602/-/chitlinscover.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/113125362/-/emboss.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/113125362/-/emboss.jpg","width":609,"height":609},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/115426158/-/chitbuttons.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/115426158/-/chitbuttons.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1600489,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"},{"id":5912559,"name":"HNR25","permalink":"hnr25","url":"/category/hnr25"}]},{"id":12216960,"name":"JEREMIAH JAE & OLIVER THE 2ND \"RawHyde\" (HNR23LP) ","permalink":"jeremiah-jae-oliver-the-2nd-rawhyde-hnr23","position":30,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/jeremiah-jae-oliver-the-2nd-rawhyde-hnr23","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-06T20:29:54.000Z","description":"Limited-edition Vinyl  of \"RAWHYDE\" by JEREMIAH JAE & OLIVER THE 2ND.

These previously-unreleased tracks were raw, unmastered bangers to be digitally unleashed in between 2011's \"Manifestations\" EP (Brainfeeder) & his forthcoming 2013 full-length opus \"Golden Skies\" (Rodriguez Lopez Productions). \r\n\r\nHIT+RUN longed to give these songs an official home, and have recently collaborated with MONO/POLY to release the \"KILLER B's\" Deluxe edition (HNR22) available worldwide on Monday, February 25th, 2013.  The classic 5-track EP was remastered and supplemented with 7 additional unreleased songs, mostly unearthed from that fruitful period in late 2011. \r\n\r\n'Ill Deal' & 'Boxing Gloves' made brief appearances on \"The Age Of the Soul\" (HNR14),  the otherworldly hour-long mix cd crafted exclusively for H+R by MONO/POLY in Fall 2011.  \r\n\r\n\"Crew\" is MONO/POLY's stand-out contribution from \"Hit+Run Presents: Road Kill Vol. 1\" (HNR19), and will also be featured in an upcoming episode of \"WORKAHOLICS\" on Comedy Central.  \r\n\r\nAlongside these 5 unreleased gems are two very special and exclusive remixes by Los Angeles luminaries Daedelus and Ras_G.  These inventive remixes were created in January 2013, showcasing the ethereal and visionary genius of each producer.\r\n\r\nOnly 1000 copies of this limited-edition cd were produced, so order now and receive a new MONO/POLY two-inch round collectible sticker.\r\n\r\nTRACKLIST:\r\n1.

It took me maybe another year to actually load them up and transfer them to the computer. When I did, what I found was an incredible documentation of indigenous folkloric music that was meticulously recorded and then later transfered to 2-track tape sometime in the 1960's. The tapes were labeled \"Contact Field Orchestra\"--a collection of field recordings that seem to date from sometime around the turn of the 20th century (possibly a little earlier).  \r\n\r\nAfter transferring the tapes and cleaning them up as best I could, I discovered that due to the frequency range, they must have been recorded largely with hand-made piezo transducers of some sort. Some of the tapes were partially destroyed, so I found that I had to re-play or play over the songs as best I could to fill-in and augment the original ideas.I tried to stay as true to the original recordings as much as possible. I'll admit I took some liberties with the eq (perhaps too much...) and where applicable added a small amount of delay and reverb to accent the track. (Okay, and maybe a few electric guitars...sue me.)  \r\n\r\nThe result, I think, is an amazing collection of esoteric folk recordings of a mysterious band of San Gabriel miners turned musicians. Apparently having given-up after the gold boom, these folks stayed in what would later become Upper Mallard Canyon in Altadena -- living in the old Dawn's mine shaft, and crafting their own instruments from discarded mining equipment and whatever small guitars and banjos they had brought with them. \r\n\r\n The sound this orchestra created is like something out of a Jim Jarmusch film, and reminds me of an old Library of Congress or Folkways recording. The music itself is full of opposites -- hypnotizing and odd; meditative and jarring. It's strangely familiar, but also distantly unrecognizable. Some songs are more minimalist in their approach, building up a rhythm with mbiras and percussion, while others seem to have much more harmony and tonal structure and almost Blues/Country feel.

With his lyrical alter-ego, JONWAYNE has recently collaborated with producers Flying Lotus, Kutmah, Dibiase (Dark Horsemen) and is currently finishing up his full-length debut rap album to be released on Stones Throw Records in 2013.\r\n\r\nGood work Stella, we never thought it would happen...\r\n\r\nRunning Time: 50:58\r\n\r\nSAMPLER: http://soundcloud.com/hit-run/jonwayne-how-stella-got-her","options":[{"id":13351789,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/85279805/-/stellamini.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/85279805/-/stellamini.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1600489,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"},{"id":5912643,"name":"HNR12","permalink":"hnr12","url":"/category/hnr12"}]},{"id":9863689,"name":"RAS_G \"Beat Soup Vol. 3\"  [HNR09]","permalink":"ras_g-beat-soup-vol-3-hnr09","position":42,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ras_g-beat-soup-vol-3-hnr09","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-11T21:46:23.000Z","description":"Volume 3 of the BEAT SOUP mix cd series by RAS_G.
