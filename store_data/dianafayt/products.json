The person who sits across from you while you sip will appreciate the attention I've given to the bottom of these tumblers.\r\n\r\nAnother special feature of this tumbler is that I designed them to fit into a standard car cup holder. So you can take your beautiful tumbler with you to your favorite cafe and make everyone envious as they drink from boring mass produced cups.\r\n\r\nThey hold 13.5 ounces of liquid and are finished off with a very durable clear glaze (all lead free of course) that can withstand dishwashers, microwaves and countless cups of your favorite beverages.\r\n\r\nThese tumblers are both strong and beautiful. Just the way we like them!\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":45505590,"name":"Default","price":85.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":17.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":12.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":12.5,"amount_with_others":9.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":17.0,"amount_with_others":16.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125669370/-/IMG_3099.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125669370/-/IMG_3099.jpg","width":1995,"height":2230},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125669391/-/IMG_3101.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125669391/-/IMG_3101.jpg","width":1960,"height":2071},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125669403/-/IMG_3104.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125669403/-/IMG_3104.jpg","width":2026,"height":2407}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1801345,"name":"cups & tumblers","permalink":"cups-tumblers","url":"/category/cups-tumblers"}]},{"id":13633917,"name":" small pale blue bowl","permalink":"bowl","position":10,"price":98.0,"default_price":98.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bowl","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-18T03:08:32.000Z","description":"6\"x6\"x4\" Stoneware bowl.\r\n\r\nHand painted a watery ice blue on the outside and a golden ochre yellow on the inside.
