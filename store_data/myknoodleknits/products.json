We wanted to make something that would showcase the vibrant colors and unique texture of this yarn.\r\n\r\nSari silk yarn is produced by recycling the selvedges of silk fabric during the sari making process. Rather than discarding it, the selvedge ends are stitched end-to-end to produce this colorful silk yarn. By it's very nature, no two skeins are alike, therefore no two hats that we make will be the same.\r\n\r\nWe obtain our Sari silk yarn from a supplier that works with women's development groups in Nepal. The women make this yarn in their homes in order to produce additional income to support and improve their family earnings. \r\n\r\nWe made the hat pictured in the main listing photo with a light grey wool yarn and strips of bright Sari silk ribbon. While we can try to match the listing photo, please understand that the unique nature of this product means that each hat is unique, and no two alike. If you have a specific set of colors in mind, please convo us and we can try to accomodate your request. \r\n\r\nOur Sari Ribbon Hat is a perfect newborn photography prop. You will receive the exact hat that is featured in the third photo.\r\n\r\nLike what you see?
