Recorded by one of the gurus of the genre, Brian McTernan, at his Salad Days studio, Interviews With David Frost is a spectacle of perfect-sounding distorted guitars that chug along toward a sinister future.

He moves easily between moods and textures, from spacious ambient plucking to abrasive drones, and at this premature stage in my exploration of his discography, his truly experimental style is still difficult to pin down.\r\n\r\nThis gorgeously packaged album contains a full live set, 40 minutes or so, recorded in Holland in 2001, along with a seven-inch EP containing two \"remakes\" by Tom Recchion. Sounds are by Ambarchi alone, using his guitar augmented by some basic processing and electronics. The show was presumably in a gallery or theater, because the vast pockets of space that Ambarchi leaves between the notes (especially on the first side) are filled by silence alone. No background noise is detected.\r\n\r\nThe calm is important, as Ambarchi's preferred technique on the A-side is to move between a small handful of tones, where he plucks a single guitar string and lets the sound slowly decay alongside prickly electric scrapes and pops. He alternates between a half-dozen or so notes, with silence predominating in the early going and sounds congregating into progressively dense clusters as time passes.\r\n\r\nBecause of the seemingly random movement between the small set of pitches, the first side is oddly reminiscent of wind chimes, sounding like a peculiar amplified version of a hanging clutch of tubular bells. There's a sensation that something other than two hands is causing the notes to sound, some silent and unknowable force setting things in motion and then moving in and around the vibrations. Because the music is still surprising and unpredictable after ten spins, Triste makes for excellent repeated listening.\r\n\r\nBoth the sound and approach changes on the second side. It definitely starts where the piece left off, but the tempo is accelerated and more urgent, and sub-bass drones intrude and then take over almost immediately. The crackling taps that accompanied the drawn-out notes remains, but slowly shifting layers of sound and feedback are the focus. The rumbling bottom end combined with nasally, flanged harmonics bring to mind a chorus of didgeridoos, and then the midrange swells imparts the sonority of dueling sine waves. In the piece's final half, wild electronic tones untraceable to a guitar bang in and out, buzzing around the space like large sheet metal insects.\r\n\r\nWhere the first side left ample space for contemplation, allowing the listener to make a minute dissection of each sound, the harshly textured blasts come and go far more quickly by the end of the show than they can be processed. Triste goes from Thursday Afternoon-style ambience to Mego-ish noise, and then, for a minute or two at the very end, back again. It's a mesmerizing ride.\r\n\r\nThe remakes by Recchion are excellent. Ambarchi's bell-like tones are prominent, but rather than focusing on a particular aspect of the original piece, Recchion uses the material to construct something new. Playing against the seeming randomness of Ambarchi's pieces, Recchion adds anchoring drones and sequences, thereby softening the material and making it more conventionally musical. Recchion's treatments are deeply affecting, occasionally even bordering on the sentimental, which is amazing considering the coolly removed nature of the source. All in all, Triste is a deeply satisfying exploration of abstract sound\r\n\r\n-Pitchfork","options":[{"id":31265746,"name":"Default","price":4.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.99,"amount_with_others":1.99,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.99,"amount_with_others":3.99}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98210503/-/tris.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98210503/-/tris.jpeg","width":591,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":185419,"name":"Oren Ambarchi","permalink":"oren-ambarchi","url":"/artist/oren-ambarchi"}],"categories":[{"id":29104,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":77678,"name":"NEW ITEMS!!!!","permalink":"new-items","url":"/category/new-items"}]},{"id":9998080,"name":"Boris \"Smile\" CD","permalink":"boris-smile-cd","position":8,"price":4.99,"default_price":4.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/boris-smile-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-18T06:18:59.000Z","description":"With this brand new studio album from Boris' the group plays deeply intense blistering psychedelia with mammoth hooks and truly innovative song-writing.

The weight of a mountain is what DIAL drops on you with their absolutely crushing 5-song debut EP. The austere New Zealand outfit originally self-released this as a demo, but the material contained within is leaps and bounds beyond what most bands accomplish even at their best. DIAL successfully channels the darkest corners of the AmRep catalog, the raw ferocity of classic hardcore, offtime kilter of math-rock, and the whole concept that music can actually be dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe air-tight composure of DIAL's debut recording is striking; focusing more on space and dissonance than technical shreddery. Obscenely heavy guitars collide with bludgeoning percussion and intense, vicious and scathing female vocals... turning the whole thing into a downright terrifying experience. Add an incredibly crisp recording, and this makes DIAL's debut EP one of the most impressive demos we've heard in years, let alone had the privilege to re-release.\r\n","options":[{"id":13905605,"name":"Default","price":4.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.99,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.99,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41205647/-/dial3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41205647/-/dial3.jpg","width":150,"height":150}],"artists":[{"id":76275,"name":"DIAL","permalink":"dial","url":"/artist/dial"}],"categories":[{"id":29104,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":77678,"name":"NEW ITEMS!!!!","permalink":"new-items","url":"/category/new-items"}]},{"id":4216039,"name":"Scatterbox \"Vice\" T-Shirt.","permalink":"scatterbox-vice-t-shirt","position":19,"price":8.99,"default_price":8.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/scatterbox-vice-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-08-07T07:18:54.000Z","description":"New Scatterbox shirt designed in house by the Blackhouse folks.

I would tack it up to being at the right goddamn place at the right goddamn time, that three degenerates from some pretty reputable punk rock bands, somehow managed to put their brains together (in as random and desolate of a place as tourist-trap Northern Idaho of all places), and write music. Why did this happen? Because number 1, It WAS a FLUKE. Number 2, it WAS (and IS) out of sheer BOREDOM, and number 3, LUCK.\r\n\r\nCall Me Renegade is not necessarily the group that will go out of its way to try and impress you. After all, YOU, the walking critic, will always be first in line to cast judgement. After all it is you who decides for yourself, right? You bet your ass you do. The only thing is, they strive to, and just may, impress you. With the speed and technicality of a mechanic after a cheap line of stepped on blow, this band does not break pace, engraining the aggressiveness of the 80's and 90's hardcore punk throwbacks, but all the while purging worthwhile hooks and thought provoking lyric matter without any means of sugar coating.\r\n\r\nI mean, they pretty much have no choice. They are from Idaho. If they can't make a mark there....they're fucked.\r\n\r\nWith members of well established Northwest bands such as Sledgeback, Linus, Scatterbox, Moral Crux, and Nothing Pretty, and having worked off and on over the years on various music projects over the years, these guys are dialed in and prepared to rape your ears sonically....with no lube.

From Philly, by way of Detroit, BF have been creating their poppy duo fun jams since the first 2 PIECE FEST back in 2008 where they ended their set with an epic memorable huge crowd group hug! You may be used to seeing these 2 dudes playing insane chaotic music from their previous/current bands Enkephalin, Letters in Binary, Slam Wedgehouse, etc.. however, this band is all about the positivity in life. With songs about friendship, skateboarding, the environment, high fiving, optimism, and hugging your friends, BF have created the soundtrack to FUN. These 10 songs are the first songs written by the band, recorded just months before their epic long-awaited relocation to Philly. Think pop punk, post punk, singy, yellin, heavily distorted guitar and super fast hard hitting drums. Technical impressive playing yet still melodic and poppy riffage that just sticks in your head. If you see them live, it is way too hard not to throw your first in the air and party along with the fun and intense feeling that is BEST FRIENDS!\r\n\r\nThe packaging is the most satanic posi record of all time! Comes on a 1-sided LP with the B side silk screened. Packaging also includes a screened chip board cover and two inserts. \r\nThis record is DIY and it rules hard!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nLimited to 333 copies on Black Vinyl.

Which is where it should be placed if you had any sense, any sense of authenticity or any common sense at all. So, there are bullshit detectors and there are bullshit detectors and if you lived through 1981 the best ones are the ones on the sides of your head. You see the ears are what keep you from thinking [wrongly so] that any band AFTER 1983 was worth any sort of goddamned thing. Like dirty hippies and old jazzbos trying to tell you that ainâ€™t shit happened after Janis or Miles, this type of logic comes from the gut. But it comes from the gut because the ears are not listening.\r\n\r\nWhich is why this SCATTERBOX shit appeals so much. It has successfully tricked the ear of yesteryear that itâ€™s at Ruthies, or the Wilson Center, or A7, or Rajis. Itâ€™s distilled all of what was cool about hearing this shit for the first time and managed to not make you feel bad about it THIS time. Fucking real deal? Goddamned right. Vintage AND new the music rises above the merely nostalgic to make you want to spray paint the walls, grab your skate, and fuck shit up. And with several and copious nods to post-punk sensibilities [via song titles, design aesthetic], it dawns that SCATTERBOX should be a lot bigger than they are with their heartfelt pre-post take on all of the loud fast rules. But they should be a lot of things probably: not living in Idaho, getting real and paying jobs, cutting out that racket.  However, it would be our sincere hope that they continue existing for the sheer and pure fact that they make hard music to play well look easy and sound like they fucking mean it in the process, which is much, much more than 98 percent of the things youâ€™ll hear this week thatâ€™ll work their way into your brain pans.\r\n\r\nHardcore the way hardcore was played when it meant something to play it.

Simultaneously and unapologetically intellectual\r\nand resolutely probing, The Birth of Tragedyâ€™s examination of SEX, DEPRESSION,\r\nFEAR, POWER, GOD, LOVE and the almost-soon-to-be-never-released MADNESS\r\nissue formed a sui generis basis for reinterpreting the entire premise of spoken word\r\nrecordings: how you said it mattered not, it was all about what you said.\r\nAnd pulling interviewed artists from the Fear, Power, and God issues of the Birth of\r\nTragedy was easy, as was aligning their varied interests and approaches. Recording\r\nwas full on guerilla style with everybody recording their contribution on whatever they\r\nhad available. Art was generated by the inimitable and now artist of some renown Jim\r\nBlanchard and with its white vinyl [also initially released on cassette tape] on the US\r\nreleases and black vinyl on the UK releases [the largely suspect Workerâ€™s Playtime\r\nRecords], most of the heavy lifting was done.\r\nRight in time to have its distribution done in by the folding of distributor [Jem,\r\nSystematic, and Rough Trade, in pretty short order] after distributor. Fitful later\r\nattempts to reissue the record, most notably by the Swiss German label Skin &\r\nSpeech, turned up little and in the intervening years since its 1988 release, in addition\r\nto the deaths of several of some of the original participants, no oneâ€™s approached who\r\nwas even remotely interested in resurrecting it in anywhere near to its original glory.\r\nUntil now.

Well, I don't know about \"pop\", when I think \"pop\"-punk, I think stuff that's a bit more Ramones influenced...this, being from Cali is obviously more Cali-influenced. ANYWAY...I'm getting off the point here. There are certainly bands more famous than Rhythm Collision, bands which were more consistent throughout the course of their career (you can never go wrong with mid-period Screeching Weasel records, The Queers 'Love Songs for the Retarded', or anything by Green Day - from '39/Smooth' right through 'Insomniac')....but, in the 15+ years I've been listening to punk rock, I have NEVER heard a better catchy punk record than Rhythm Collision's \"Clobberer\". Full of energy, and simple riffs that will stick in your head forever. This record is on eternal repeat, and it's awful that this band never got the respect they deserved. I saw them once, with about 30 people in the audience, and they blew me away. Every song is a concise punk rock masterpiece. This is the blueprint, and although their other records are good, too -- this is the ONE....their one bonafide moment of genius.  -J.
