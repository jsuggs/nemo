He is a rescue dog from the Crescent City and is a Rhodesian Ridgeback mix. Beyond that, Bruno's origins are shrouded in mystery.\r\n\r\nBruno's humans were not looking for a dog, but Bruno was looking for a home. At first, Bruno was a nervous and skittish addition to the family, not sure of his place, but eventually with TLC and time he came to love and be loved as he found his calling as an animal rights spokesdog.  \r\n\r\nBruno's passions are car rides, walks on the San Antonio River, and dark cool spaces under big old houses. His turn offs are domestic cheeses, water, and skunks.  \r\n\r\nHe is proud to be this year's co-medalist and looks forward to representing the honor that has been graciously bestowed upon him.","options":[{"id":28479002,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.3,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":0.3}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99714715/-/brunnoforshop.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99714715/-/brunnoforshop.jpg","width":417,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3060377,"name":"Fiesta Medals","permalink":"fiesta-medals","url":"/category/fiesta-medals"}]},{"id":9085832,"name":"Fiesta 2013 Cat Medal","permalink":"the-cannoli-fund-fiesta-2013-cat-medal","position":2,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-cannoli-fund-fiesta-2013-cat-medal","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-23T01:30:23.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":28478777,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.3,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99717553/-/cannoliforshop.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99717553/-/cannoliforshop.jpg","width":392,"height":789}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3060377,"name":"Fiesta Medals","permalink":"fiesta-medals","url":"/category/fiesta-medals"}]},{"id":5823713,"name":"Fiesta 2012 Dog Medal","permalink":"cannoli-of-king-william-dog-fiesta-2012-medal","position":3,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cannoli-of-king-william-dog-fiesta-2012-medal","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-03-31T06:23:28.000Z","description":"The Cannoli Fund's 2012 dog medal features Cannoli’s neighbor, Samson, a purebred English springer spaniel. Samson, a stray, was scheduled to be euthanized at the city shelter because of a broken rear leg and other health problems. Thanks to a generous benefactor, he had surgery to repair his leg and was treated for heartworms. A kind and loving dog, Samson was first fostered and then adopted by his current owner. He gets along with everyone and maintains an extensive clientele of dogs and cats that appreciate his grooming skills. Samson is the perfect poster dog for animal rescue.\r\n\r\nMedals are silver metal and enamel and hang from a grosgrain ribbon.
