Home decor by Two Cheeky Monkeys on Big Cartel.\r\n\r\nThis is a beautiful inkjet print of a vintage peacock illustration dating from 1869. It has been printed onto a vintage Oxford Dictionary page, creating a unique and beautiful artwork for your walls.\r\nThe resplendent peacock is perched on a branch waiting for passers by to shower him with compliments.  As each dictionary page is different, you will not receive this exact print, but it will be very similar.\r\n\r\nThe print is 5x7 inch in size and comes with YOUR CHOICE of a black or white photo mat. The finished size of the print and mat is 8x10 inches. Because the dictionary page is thin and delicate, the print has been backed with archival quality paper which matches the cream colour of the dictionary page. This print is perfect for those who adore the beauty of the peacock or for those with an ornithology bent!\r\n\r\n♦ PLEASE STATE IN THE NOTES TO SELLER WHETHER YOU WANT A BLACK OR WHITE PHOTO MAT. ♦\r\n\r\n♥ Looking for an art print with a different illustration?
