Because if there is a place where “no” is never non-negotiable, it is definitely in the area that stretches between Mexico and the South Pole. This cultural re-fashioning is achieved by gestures of varying scale; whether it is creating complete libraries out of cardboard and crayons, or by defying violence with music and fireworks, they each contribute to the bigger picture. Imagination and syncretism, so essential to the Latin American ethos, must be part of these newly-imagined identities that are being built right now in each countries’ imagination.","options":[{"id":21146629,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65279917/-/TED-Gopher-Toxico_Page_01.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65279917/-/TED-Gopher-Toxico_Page_01.png","width":614,"height":790},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65279949/-/TED-Gopher-Toxico_Page_05.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65279949/-/TED-Gopher-Toxico_Page_05.png","width":790,"height":508},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65279989/-/TED-Gopher-Toxico_Page_09.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65279989/-/TED-Gopher-Toxico_Page_09.png","width":790,"height":508}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1532622,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":3476884,"name":"The Gopher Illustrated - Vol. 2 \"On City Limits\"","permalink":"presale-the-gopher-illustrated-vol-2-on-city-limits","position":2,"price":16.0,"default_price":16.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/presale-the-gopher-illustrated-vol-2-on-city-limits","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-03-24T08:10:23.000Z","description":"Vol. 2 is still stickery, limited edition, and hand numbered. \r\n\r\nThis issue's theme, \"On City Limits\" has to do with reimagining the urban landscape, exploring ways in which people and cities interact.
