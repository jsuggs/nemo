I conceived the idea of the Jane Austen Journal one day while I was re-reading Mansfield Park. I was so excited about my idea, I began designing the pages of the journal, pulling together scrap book techniques I had learned with my collection of antique fashion plates. I imagined something which had an antique appearance combined with a fun, personal, interactive quality. It has been a little over a year since I made the first Jane Austen Journal and I want to offer this original curvy journal at the original price!\r\n\r\nThis delightful journal is the perfect place to dash off your thoughts. Each page is blank, some with lines, some embellished with word ruffles and paper flags that list each of Jane's novels. It is different from a traditional journal, it is only eight pages long and would make a very special gift to a fellow Janeite. Perhaps you could include pictures from your favorite book club gathering or record your trip to Chawton. \r\n\r\nEach journal comes with a two library pockets stuffed with journalling cards. You can place these pockets as you choose. Tuck a special thought into the hidden folder, or attach a picture with the photo corners that are included. Personalize your journal with your own handwriting and thoughts.\r\n\r\nSeveral tags also come with the journal so that you can easily pop one in your purse to have handy for recording your thoughts and then easily returning them to the journal.\r\n\r\nUnique and quite different. Designed to be a special, personalized gift or a concise place to save your special reflections.\r\n\r\nThe journal is one of a kind. All papers are designed by myself and the art comes from my private collection of 19th century fashion plates. No two journals are exactly the same. They differ slightly in page arrangement and paper choice. But, each one is lovely all by itself! Please allow up to ten business days for assembly. This is the original Jane Austen Journal using images which I own - the idea conceived by me using scrapbooking techniques learned in many design classes. . Please ask for additional pictures.

I have created a very simple journal to place your bird sketches or poetry about our lovely flying friends. Perhaps a bird has made a nest right outside your kitchen window or on the stoop outside your urban apartment and you are inspired to record the activities of the bird family. This journal will allow you to dash off a simple thought or impression.\r\n\r\nMade from card stock with vintage bird and nest images. I have created soft, digital collages for the papers used in the journal. Using pages from cast off paper back books which I find in the dollar bin at a local book store, I create paper word ruffle embellishments. This journal is quite simple in its design and feel. The gentle, curvy bracket shape is pleasing and feminine. The spine is bound in silky, soft green ribbon, much like a bird would use if it came across some blowing off a little girl's braid ...\r\n\r\nDone in soft, muted shades of pale aqua, pale blue, pale green and a shade close to that of willow bark, this journal is perfect for favorite quotes or random thoughts. The last page sports a simple library pocket with some journal cards for your extra long impressions and observances.\r\n\r\nThank you for looking.","options":[{"id":44616258,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125136093/-/naturebirdjournal.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125136093/-/naturebirdjournal.jpg","width":3900,"height":3900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125136081/-/naturebirdbook4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125136081/-/naturebirdbook4.jpg","width":3900,"height":3900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125136078/-/naturebirdbook2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125136078/-/naturebirdbook2.jpg","width":3058,"height":2373}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5050459,"name":"Journals","permalink":"journals","url":"/category/journals"}]},{"id":13889433,"name":"Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol Journal, Mini Moleskine Journal Facsimile Christmas Carol Journal","permalink":"charles-dickens-a-christmas-carol-journal-mini-moleskine-journal-facsimile-christmas-carol-journal","position":14,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/charles-dickens-a-christmas-carol-journal-mini-moleskine-journal-facsimile-christmas-carol-journal","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-30T23:12:54.000Z","description":"A Christmas Carol Mini Moleskine Journal.

This fun re-covered Moleskine is perfect for the Alice aficionado. \r\n\r\nThe journal measures 9\" x 6\" and would fit nicely in a bag or commodious pocket book, which is my original idea for re-purposed Moleskines!. Take it with you everywhere to jot your thoughts! The lined pages inside are ready for your thoughts - perfect for you to launch your own creative juices.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus, the journal will come with some journaling tags which coordinate with the theme of the journal.\r\n\r\nThe cover and back of the journal are my personal designs.\r\n","options":[{"id":44616687,"name":"Default","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125136321/-/alicemoleskine1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125136321/-/alicemoleskine1.jpg","width":3900,"height":3900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125136324/-/alicemoleskine3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125136324/-/alicemoleskine3.jpg","width":2448,"height":3264},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125136327/-/alicemoleskine4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125136327/-/alicemoleskine4.jpg","width":2048,"height":1536}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5050459,"name":"Journals","permalink":"journals","url":"/category/journals"}]},{"id":13892430,"name":"Six Paris Rose and Stripe Gift Tags, Pink Rose and Green Stripe","permalink":"six-paris-rose-and-stripe-gift-tags-pink-rose-and-green-stripe","position":21,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/six-paris-rose-and-stripe-gift-tags-pink-rose-and-green-stripe","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-01T01:50:00.000Z","description":"There are six tags - each of a different design.
