He seemed droopy old and filled with knowledge. I wondered what this knowledge would look like, how it would shine, what would his life have to uncover.\r\n\r\nTo stay true to the inspiration of this piece I decided to to create this piece with a vintage quill and french imported ink. The drips , the fades, the final touches are all done by ink and quill\r\n\r\nThe piece does come with a frame and is ready to hang, but it is not professionally mounted. It is done the DIY way.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please feel free to ask, I am also available for commissioned pieces.","options":[{"id":26604885,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":20.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/83206245/-/IMG_0681.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/83206245/-/IMG_0681.jpg","width":747,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":8460840,"name":"Anatomical Vibrance ","permalink":"anatomical-vibrance","position":4,"price":100.0,"default_price":100.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/anatomical-vibrance","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-10T00:46:48.000Z","description":"This is a 24 X 36 Canvas piece.\r\n\r\nThis is a very interesting one of a kind mixed media piece. It involves multiple types of acrylic ink, aerosol , crayons, markers, etc, the list goes on and on for every little detail.\r\n\r\nThe piece has taken a total of 5 days to complete, from sketching to the finished product. The reason for this extensive amount was due to the layering of the drips. Since achieve controlled drips is such a random affair, the layers needed to dry before the net color could be melted. From extreme patience and a artistic vision in mind , the layered look was achieved !\r\n\r\nThe anatomical face was based off of a real model from the late 1950's. the head is specifically oversized to add a comical feature to the mode, and to lighten up the mood. The surroundings were based off a graffiti technique also used in the begins of street art.\r\n\r\nThis will most likely be the last original piece with a crayon origin, the rest will be commissioned or reproduced. Don't wait on your chance to own this one of a kind original graffiti canvas piece!\r\n\r\nI apologize for the high shipping, the piece is delicate and requires care during transportation.","options":[{"id":26604792,"name":"Default","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":20.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/83205801/-/IMG_0636.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/83205801/-/IMG_0636.jpg","width":747,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4185759,"name":"ART","permalink":"art","url":"/category/art"}]},{"id":8460795,"name":"Faith","permalink":"faith","position":5,"price":120.0,"default_price":120.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/faith","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-10T00:43:56.000Z","description":"This piece is 11x14 on white canvas.\r\n\r\nThe pure beauty of this piece comes from the majestic hair and the feeling of hope , faith , and belief.
