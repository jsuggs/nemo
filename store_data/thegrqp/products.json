It seems surreal to exit the concrete sprawl and find yourself in the middle of a beautiful park and even more bizarre to come face to face with a bison. The herd in San Francisco formed when several bison were brought in from the Great Plains in the late 1800's — around this same time bison were facing extinction due to unmonitored poaching. But thanks to captive breeding with herds like the one in Golden Gate Park, bison numbers now surpass 200,000 in North America.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nFinal print is custom trimmed with a 1 inch border.
