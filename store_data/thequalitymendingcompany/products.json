Taken both by Connolly and an assortment of punk enthusiasts, BANNED IN DC is a set of vibrant shots that portray the anarchic spirit, pure energy, and camaraderie of the DC scene in a series of 450 black and white photographs. Major figures in the hardcore movement, like Dischord Records co-owner and then-Minor Threat member Ian MacKaye and Bad Brains vocalist HR, share space with naked musicians, ubiquitous scenesters, shaven-headed audience members, and riotous punks, in a freewheeling combination of pictures and quotes. Vividly capturing the scene's idealistic intensity, BANNED IN DC is an invaluable document of Washington hardcore's exuberance and aspirations.\r\n\r\nThese are the last of their kind.

The UK was sliding deeper into unemployment, reeling from strike after strike, power cuts, the three-day work week, and IRA bombs. It was time for a new order and in London’s restless streets a handful of snotty young men, feisty females, and first generation Jamaican musicians created the UK’s punky revolution. They made it up as they went along and it touched every corner of the Disunited Kingdom. For a few glorious years the UK was the center of the cultural universe.”\r\n—Vivien Goldman \r\n\r\nWhen punk first rocked, the rough and rugged style on the streets was a world away from the super-slick music videos and corporate stylists that were to follow. And photographer Janette Beckman was on the front line of that hyper-energized time, capturing “the look” of the musicians and kids who were loudly defining an era. Collected for the first time in Made in the UK, Beckman’s powerful portraits celebrate the music and the attitude of Punk, Mod, Skinhead, 2 Tone, and Rockabilly culture in the UK.\r\n\r\nMade in the UK: The Music of Attitude, 1977–1983 documents a time when British music pushed every boundary. Beckman began her career working for Melody Maker, one of London’s premier weekly music papers. She soon had extraordinary access to the musicians topping the UK charts—icons of an era when music had an agenda—including The Clash, The Sex Pistols, The Jam, The Undertones, The Specials, The Beat, The Police, The Ramones, The Rockats, The Raincoats (Kurt Cobain’s inspiration), Billy Idol, and Echo and the Bunnymen. Among these groups, this generation still had the radical idea that each and every punk, skin, mod, rude boy, and ted was just as important as the bands. Janette Beckman’s gritty aesthetic placed her on good footing among the kids on the street—and the portraits she made prove that attitude never dies.","options":[{"id":44088999,"name":"Default","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124861890/-/Screen_Shot_2013-09-25_at_1.27.33_PM.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124861890/-/Screen_Shot_2013-09-25_at_1.27.33_PM.png","width":930,"height":1285},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124861263/-/Screen_Shot_2013-09-25_at_1.20.17_PM.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124861263/-/Screen_Shot_2013-09-25_at_1.20.17_PM.png","width":486,"height":334},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124861266/-/Screen_Shot_2013-09-25_at_1.20.26_PM.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124861266/-/Screen_Shot_2013-09-25_at_1.20.26_PM.png","width":392,"height":293},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124861269/-/Screen_Shot_2013-09-25_at_1.20.52_PM.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124861269/-/Screen_Shot_2013-09-25_at_1.20.52_PM.png","width":297,"height":178}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4112952,"name":"GIFTS AND ACCESSORIES","permalink":"gifts-and-accessories","url":"/category/gifts-and-accessories"}]},{"id":5045105,"name":"TYPE A-1125 QUALITY MENDING WOOL WATCH CAP","permalink":"quality-mending-a1125-wool-watch-cap-navy","position":37,"price":38.0,"default_price":38.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/quality-mending-a1125-wool-watch-cap-navy","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-12-09T18:11:40.000Z","description":"Type A-1125 \"QUALITY MENDING A1125 WOOL WATCH CAP\r\n100% wool watch cap in black, od green or navy blue wool with recycled chino shirt trim.

That type of visual feast becomes even more enticing when it translates into an independently designed, written and published coffee table book that can be enjoyed by art and boardsports enthusiasts alike. Such is the case with the Surf to Skate - Evolution to Revolution, an over-sized book shaped like the first mass-produced skateboard - the \"Roller Derby\". The exhibit, designed by avid skateboard collectors Jason Cohn and Stanton Hartsfield, is an impressive extension of the book, showcasing 50's and 60's era skateboards from their personal collections. Their company, Scavenger Brand, swooped in on As Issued at The Lab Anti-mall in Costa Mesa November 16. Jason and Stanton's project took 6 months to pull together from concept to completion. It pays homage to the history of the skateboard through a vast collection of rare and vintage boards collected by both men throughout their lives. The exhibit consists of 150-500 skateboards in an impressive array of sizes, materials and colors. The book compresses these rare boards into a timeline from their inception to the point when skateboarding caught fire around the world.","options":[{"id":44255904,"name":"Default","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124865985/-/41yXqI6g1HL._SX258_BO1_204_203_200_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124865985/-/41yXqI6g1HL._SX258_BO1_204_203_200_.jpg","width":260,"height":63},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124865997/-/surftoskate635.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124865997/-/surftoskate635.jpg","width":635,"height":311}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":4776003,"name":"1920's SWISS MILITARY GLACIER GOGGLES","permalink":"1920-s-swiss-military-glacier-goggles","position":39,"price":78.0,"default_price":78.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/1920-s-swiss-military-glacier-goggles","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-04T19:27:47.000Z","description":"1920'S SWISS MILITARY GLACIER GOGGLES\r\nBeautiful antique Swiss 1920's glacier goggles.
