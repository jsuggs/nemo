Stamp them too if you like! All dimensions are in inches. For cm, multiply by 2.54. \r\n\r\nMade in the USA from quality 100% cotton fabric, not muslin, which is thinner and more transparent.\r\n\r\nNot every bag is exactly the same size. All dimensions are rounded measurements to the OUTSIDE of the bag. Please allow ample room for your contents, including an inch or two to close the drawstring. For example, a 5x7 card will not fit in a 5x7 bag, but fits perfectly in the 6x10.\r\n\r\nSold Individually. \r\n\r\nAsk about bulk discounts for 50+ bags.","options":[{"id":27585653,"name":"2x3","price":0.65,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":27585656,"name":"3x4","price":0.8,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":27585659,"name":"3x5","price":0.85,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":27585662,"name":"4x6","price":1.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":27585665,"name":"5x7","price":1.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":27585668,"name":"6x10","price":2.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":27585671,"name":"8x12","price":3.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":27585674,"name":"12x16","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.1,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86400185/-/20120423-134-16.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86400185/-/20120423-134-16.jpg","width":665,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2208693,"name":"Pack + Wrap","permalink":"pack-wrap","url":"/category/pack-wrap"}]},{"id":7519333,"name":"Solid Baker's Twine","permalink":"solid-baker-s-twine","position":2,"price":30.0,"default_price":30.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/solid-baker-s-twine","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-11T19:23:28.000Z","description":"Solid baker's twine makes a unique alternative to traditional baker's twine.
