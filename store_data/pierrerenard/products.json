If you are ordering a number of custom items for your clients, we can spread this cost amongst the items being embroidered.  \r\n\r\nOnce your artwork is in an embroidery format (the most popular is DST), we can embroider that design on virtually any item. Prices are based on the number of stiches in the design. \r\n\r\nTypically, high quality work, using premium materials ranges from $1.50 to $2.00 per 1000 stiches. So, for example, a very elaborate logo such as the Pierre Renard piece in the photo, contains around 80,000 stitches and would cost around $120. A smaller and more simple design, such as embroidery on a saddle pad, should range from $10 to $25. \r\n\r\nIf you plan to design a logo for your farm or business, and use it for embroidered items, call or email us for some pointers on how you can create an easily embroiderable design!

It has fleece pockets, velcro closures at the wrists, and the all important zippered chest pocket for the cellphone, money and car keys. \r\n\r\nThis size of the Pierre Renard logo requires more than 82,000 stitches and takes more than an hour to complete. The embroidery machine says \"phew\" when it gets done with this one! \r\n\r\nAt industry prices, this embroidery alone would cost more than $120, and yet we've priced this jacket--embroidery and all--at just $85 (with free shipping), knowing that if you wear it, people will notice it and remember our name! \r\n\r\nBy the way, the gorgeous Pierre Renard logo was designed by the talented graphic artist, Elizabeth Eadie, of Wellmade Design Co. right here in Baltimore, Maryland. We think she's magnifique!

It absolutely held up to the very demanding Pierre Renard logo on the back! If you'd like to use this particular jacket for your own embroidery design, let us know ASAP, because these jackets are in short supply at the season's end. They are really beautiful, high quality garments. In S M and L. The color is called Birch, but I would call it putty or off white.

Elizabeth sketched the original artwork during our first telephone conversation, and the little, sophisticated French fox of my dreams came to life over the next 10 days. Read more about the process here: http://wellmadedesign.com/small-business/character-illustration-logo/\r\n\r\nDigitizing the logo for embroidery required great time and attention to remain loyal to Elizabeth's design. Even scaled down into a small format for shirts, this design requires more than 30,000 stitches, and takes the better part of an hour to produce on our state-of-the-art machine. \r\n\r\nBy the industry's pricing scale, this embroidery alone (without the garment) should be priced at $50 to $55. Of course, we've priced it to be much more affordable, because Pierre loves the \"free advertising\"  aspect of Pierre Wear.
