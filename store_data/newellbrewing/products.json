These all-natural dog cookies are made from leftover spent grain after the brewing process is finished. The only other ingredients added are: peanut butter, flour, and eggs (cheese upon request). \r\n\r\nThese come packaged in a decorative goodie bag, with 10 cookies in each bag, shaped like the standard dog cookie.\r\n\r\nThese are made to order, so if you have any special requests, please feel free to email us. \r\n\r\nPackaging may vary due to the time of year, I will update listings as new, themed packaging becomes available.
