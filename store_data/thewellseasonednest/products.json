(1980's) The color combination offered here is scarcer than others, making it highly collectible.\r\n\r\nA little history:  In 1977, San Francisco based artist John Stymeist founded Stymeist designs. At the onset, he worked alone, creating every piece from start to finish himself. After the introduction of his Colorways line in 1984, the demand for his simple, yet colorful decorative accessories skyrocketed. He developed a partnership with Lindt and was able to find a small craft factory in Japan that could hand-craft each piece of stoneware utilizing the same process, including his distinctive firing and glazing techniques. Ultimately, the popularity of this \"Mix and Match\" line continued to gain popularity. As a result, they expanded the collection and introduced place settings. The rest is history!  The Colorways line has since been discontinued.\r\n\r\nAll of the Colorways pieces are hand shaped and glazed.\r\n\r\nThe pink teapot has a yellow top with rose colored ring;  it's base is green.  The original sticker is intact.
