This new design is slightly larger than my old kitsune and will fit most faces comfortably.\r\n\r\nIt is carved from one piece of leather & hand shaped, using no molds or forms. Then I painted it with a combination of colorfast Liquitex acrylics (in bright gold, red and black) & a water-based brown antique stain. The stain accentuates the natural grain of the leather & gives the whole mask the appearance of hand-finished wood. The entire mask is then sealed with a waterproof clear coat acrylic. Little imperfections are part of the charm of this piece...no two will be alike.\r\n\r\nThe mask will come with a suede loop for displaying on the wall & ties for wearing.

I made this new design in a variety of warm sepia tones; red ochre and black spots on a neutral tan fish.  This listing is for one pin.\r\n\r\nEach koi is meticulously carved & shaped by hand, then painted & sealed with acrylics. They are virtually waterproof & safe to wear in any weather, & they weigh practically nothing. I use 3 ounce leather for these, much thinner than the leather I use in my masks. They're created in the same manner, though, and are designed to be used & worn every day.\r\n\r\nEach tiny fish is about four inches long (7cm), with a one and one-half inch pinback. There are slight variations in the markings on each koi.\r\n\r\nShowa sanshoku koi (three-colored koi) are considered to be very good luck!
