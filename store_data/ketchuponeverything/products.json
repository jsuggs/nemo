These quirky, graphic characters are designed & printed by Kay Vincent in a studio in south east London. \r\n\r\n\" When screen printing my designs I like to drift off into the world of the character & imagine what they are up to! 'Scooting' around is a popular mode of transport for the little people of my local hood in East Dulwich, which inspired my letter 'S'. This Scooting Squirrel is going super fast, so fast that I think his yellow pom pom hat is about to fly off, which is not good as he uses it to store his nuts!\" \r\n\r\nInspiration comes from Kay's treasured collection of 50's and 60's children's storybooks and vintage picture flash cards, which she finds on her regular rummaging trips to vintage markets & junk shops, the nostalgic charm of which has been clearly captured in these visual delights which appeal to adults and children alike - perfect for a nursery.\r\n\r\nLimited Edition of 100, signed & numbered\r\nPrinted on 300gsm Somerset Soft White Satin paper.\r\nPaper size 28.5 x 38cm\r\nFrame not included but print cleverly fits in off the shelf frames\r\n\r\n\r\n****** You can keep in touch with the latest news about Ketchup on Everything by visiting the Facebook page & pressing the 'Like' button- see link below*********\r\n\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Ketchup-on-Everything/165433010228682?v=info\r\n","options":[{"id":22993573,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/106073613/-/S1RBC.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/106073613/-/S1RBC.jpg","width":1000,"height":760},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89770394/-/S_CLOSE.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89770394/-/S_CLOSE.jpg","width":1000,"height":721},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89770583/-/S_STYLE.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89770583/-/S_STYLE.jpg","width":1000,"height":721},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/106073673/-/S2RBC.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/106073673/-/S2RBC.jpg","width":1000,"height":760}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2376363,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":11788026,"name":"Rodeo Rabbit Melamine Placemat","permalink":"rodeo-rabbit-placemat","position":6,"price":8.5,"default_price":8.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rodeo-rabbit-placemat","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-14T14:58:16.000Z","description":"Melamine Placemat 'Rodeo rabbit' is dressed to impress at this years Rodeo Championships....Yeeeee haaaaa!\r\n\r\nMatching melamine coaster is also available to buy.
