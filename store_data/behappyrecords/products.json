SOON\r\n\r\n\r\nonly $6.66 ppd in the USA!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nMeet BEST FRIENDS: scott & greg!  From Philly, by way of Detroit, BF have been creating their poppy duo fun jams since the first 2 PIECE FEST back in 2008 where they ended their set with an epic memorable huge crowd group hug!  You may be used to seeing these 2 dudes playing insane chaotic music from their previous/current bands Enkephalin, Letters in Binary, Slam Wedgehouse, etc.. however, this band is all about the positivity in life.  With songs about friendship, skateboarding, the environment, high fiving, optimism, and hugging your friends, BF have created the soundtrack to FUN.  These 10 songs are the first songs written by the band, recorded just months before their epic long-awaited relocation to Philly.  Think pop punk, post punk, singy, yellin, heavily distorted guitar and super fast hard hitting drums.  Technical impressive playing yet still melodic and poppy riffage that just sticks in your head.  If you see them live, it is way too hard not to throw your first in the air and party along with the fun and intense feeling that is BEST FRIENDS!\r\n\r\nThe packaging is the most satanic posi record of all time!  Comes on a 1-sided LP with the B side silk screened.  Packaging also includes a screened chip board cover and two inserts.  \r\nThis record is DIY and it rules hard!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nlmtd to 333 copies with 69 random colors thrown in the mix.  \r\nSimply a beautiful DIY release!\r\n\r\nget it while it's still available... these will go quick!\r\n\r\n\r\nupdate: <b>MY COPIES OF COLOR VINYL ARE ALL SOLD OUT!!!  \r\nBLACK COPIES ARE THE ONLY ONES LEFT! they look sweeter anyways! </b>\r\n","options":[{"id":3606501,"name":"black vinyl","price":6.66,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":8.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/8859701/-/BHR09webstore11.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/8859701/-/BHR09webstore11.jpg","width":620,"height":539}],"artists":[{"id":17871,"name":"Best Friends","permalink":"best-friends","url":"/artist/best-friends"}],"categories":[{"id":162706,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]},{"id":605811,"name":"ALGERNON CADWALLADER fun 7\" w/ bonus CD","permalink":"algernon-cadwallader-fun-7-w-bonus-cd","position":2,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/algernon-cadwallader-fun-7-w-bonus-cd","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-11-15T09:22:28.000Z","description":"<b>SOLD OUT!!!! a list of distros carrying this will be posted soon...</b>\r\n\r\n\r\nFUN = the looooong awaited EP follow up to their debut full length last year!\r\n\r\nOver a year in the making, this EP finally sees it's release!!

ETIC is seven more tracks of  technical hardcore from one southern California's best D.I.Y. bands.  From start to finish this record is passionate and precise. The guitars and bass convey a barrage of notes that are both melodic and aggressive while drums keep the entire force together.  Politically minded and charged with fury, Rogue State has made the soundtrack for struggle.\r\n\r\npackaging includes a CD of the songs & an 8 page lyric booklet with beautiful illustrations done by FRITZ ARAGON.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESSING INFO:\r\n100 on white vinyl (only available through mailorder)\r\n500 on black vinyl","options":[{"id":1244231,"name":"White vinyl","price":6.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":1380908,"name":"Black vinyl","price":6.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2630885/-/bhr06ASMALL.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2630885/-/bhr06ASMALL.jpg","width":600,"height":451}],"artists":[{"id":7164,"name":"Rogue State","permalink":"rogue-state","url":"/artist/rogue-state"}],"categories":[{"id":162704,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":162706,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]},{"id":341330,"name":"ROGUE STATE / DOGS OF IRE split LP","permalink":"rogue-state-dogs-of-ire-split","position":4,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rogue-state-dogs-of-ire-split","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-07-11T03:53:10.000Z","description":"COMING BACK... SOON\r\n\r\n\r\nThis split is a double-benefit for Coalicion de Derechos Humanos and Bâ€™ TSELEM. \r\n\r\nDOGS OF IRE overthrow the senses and thrash the place with high energy and twisted noisy mayhem. Four hard hitting jams that are raw, dark and explosive. DOGS OF IRE end their side with a new version of \"This Is Why Airplanes Crash Into Buildings.\" This band is amazing.  For some strange reason, you can get into them if you are into hardcore, pop punk, or fucked up noisy stuff.  ex Falling Sickness... great dudes, such an awesome band!!!\r\n\r\nROGUE STATE finishes you off with six brutally technical assaults. Off-timed and rhythmic, ROGUE STATE deliver a pummeling wall of sound comparable to no one.  Noodly guitars, sing along parts, and tons of explosive melody.  This is very reminiscent of some stuff that would be on NO IDEA RECORDS with a bit more bite and energy to it. sooo good!!!  \r\n\r\nBest record to be released last year, for sure!!!
