He was an amazing trumpet player that originated out of New Orleans. Much of his prominence came from the instant recognition of his gravelly voice along with his ability to shift jazz from a collective performance to a solo performance. He also had great dexterity at being an improviser and great ability to blend melody and lyrics.\r\n","options":[{"id":13745150,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.95,"amount_with_others":3.95,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.6,"amount_with_others":9.6}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/40670286/-/la.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/40670286/-/la.png","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2176094,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":4151396,"name":"Darryl \"D.M.C.\" McDaniels","permalink":"louis-armstrong-2","position":2,"price":500.0,"default_price":500.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/louis-armstrong-2","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-07-26T07:32:19.000Z","description":"size: 24\"×48″\r\nAutographed by: Rev Run\r\n\r\nThis Audio art canvas of  Darryl \"D.M.C.\" McDaniels is complete with speakers so that you can bump jam like “It’s Tricky” or “My Adidas”.
