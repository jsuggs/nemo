Varying thicknesses. Wood houses painted with gold, white, and pink gouache. Clay house glazed with clear glaze.\r\n\r\nThe shipping is expensive because the thickness of the houses requires we send them as packets rather than in regular 'letter' post. However, this cost will allow a package of up to 350 grams, so if you purchase anything else with these (including if you purchase more than one ornament) we will refund the shipping for the rest of your purchase (unless the weight goes over 350 grams).\r\n\r\nPlease purchase your house with delivery confirmation if you are worried about the postal service. The Belgian post office is not amazing: both slow and prone to loss. We can't be held responsible for lost parcels that do not have paid proof of sending.","options":[{"id":50712612,"name":"A","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50712615,"name":"B","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50712618,"name":"C","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50712621,"name":"D","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50712624,"name":"E","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50712627,"name":"F","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50712630,"name":"G","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50712633,"name":"H","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50712636,"name":"Clay house with chimney","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50712639,"name":"A   delivery confirmation","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50712651,"name":"B   delivery confirmation","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50712648,"name":"C   delivery confirmation","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50712645,"name":"D   delivery confirmation","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50712642,"name":"E   delivery confirmation","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50712843,"name":"F   delivery confirmation","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50712840,"name":"G   delivery confirmation","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50712837,"name":"H   delivery confirmation","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50712834,"name":"Clay house    delivery confirmation","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.4,"amount_with_others":6.4,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":12.9,"amount_with_others":12.9}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129466542/-/houses-J-Vanhaelst.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129466542/-/houses-J-Vanhaelst.jpg","width":560,"height":537},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129466566/-/Screen_Shot_2013-12-16_at_14.07.35.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129466566/-/Screen_Shot_2013-12-16_at_14.07.35.png","width":552,"height":562},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129468642/-/Screen_Shot_2013-12-16_at_15.21.01.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129468642/-/Screen_Shot_2013-12-16_at_15.21.01.png","width":735,"height":430}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6917667,"name":"Occasional objects","permalink":"occasional-objects","url":"/category/occasional-objects"}]},{"id":15277494,"name":"in her garden | a calendar for 2014","permalink":"in-her-garden-a-calendar-for-2014","position":2,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/in-her-garden-a-calendar-for-2014","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-02T20:10:27.000Z","description":"* * * While we cannot guarantee the behavior of the Belgian postal service, we suggest that you order by December 6 to make delivery by December 24 more likely. * * *\r\n\r\nI spent many hours in my friend's garden and in her allotment, and as I've traveled—usually without meaning to—I find myself visiting gardens.

He was brought up in London and studied Fine Art in London and Leeds. His poems began appearing in national magazines in 1973 and his first book, <i>The Slant Door</i>, was published in 1979. It won the Faber Memorial prize the following year. Since then he has published more than a dozen books. He won the T. S. Eliot Prize in 2005, for <i>Reel</i>.\r\n\r\nHaving returned to Budapest for the first time in 1984, he has since worked extensively as a translator of poems, novels, plays and essays. His own work has been translated into numerous languages. Beside his work in poetry and translation he has written <i>Exercise of Power</i>, a study of the artist Ana Maria Pacheco, and, together with Penelope Lively, edited <i>New Writing 10</i>, published by Picador in 2001.\r\n\r\nGeorge Szirtes lives near Norwich with his wife, the painter Clarissa Upchurch. Together they ran The Starwheel Press. In 2006, Corvina produced <i>Budapest: Image, Poem, Film</i>, their collaboration in poetry and visual work.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nNote that we ship from Belgium.

We asked 23 artists and photographers to lend us a piece of their work, and invited 23 writers to respond to those images. Each image, paired with its text, will be printed on a heavy postcard. (There's space on the back for an address and a stamp—so yes, you can even send them.) We're calling this issue 11111111111111\r\n111111111111111111111111111\r\n11111.

A man watches a woman break a horse. The oddness and grace of Noah Webster’s language is heightened in a series of found prose poems. Attention to line and simplicity of image produce the feeling that nothing here is wasted motion.\r\n\r\nJosh Wallaert’s poems are modest but stubborn: they quietly and surely state their piece, then step back and allow form, image, and language to work. In <i>A Guide to the Northwest Territory</i>, we find ourselves on familiar ground (a dictionary, an instruction manual) rendered strange. Wallaert gently turns the seemingly innocuous daily over to reveal its intricate relation to the political.\r\n\r\nIn Wallaert’s poems, geography is a subjective way of knowing a landscape; definitions from Noah Webster’s dictionary are subjective ways of telling a story. There is no false objectivity here. The poems demonstrate the necessity of compassionate involvement with one’s terrain–physical, linguistic, national, political–and of maintaining a critical relationship to it.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAdvance praise for <i>A Guide to the Northwest Territory</i>:\r\n\r\nFrom Amanda Coplin, author of <i>The Orchardist: Wonderfully perceptive</i>, Wallaert parses language and landscape to show how we require the physical world to understand our most complex ideas and emotions. There is no such thing as passive language, Wallaert asserts: each word is alive, rooted in our deepest biological selves.\r\n\r\nFrom Nick Lantz, author of <i>We Don’t Know We Don’t Know</i>: Here, we learn the forgotten definitions of familiar words. Here, instructions and guides reveal more than they say. Here, we watch, amazed, as poems leap between subjects. Wallaert’s language is graceful and sublime, yes, but what sets these poems apart is his profound intuition for the startling yet unforeseen connection, the unexpected but illuminating turn.\r\n\r\nFrom Joseph Reed, co-editor of <i>Caketrain</i>: In this aptly-named Guide, Josh Wallaert leads his reader’s way through Noah Webster’s pioneering dictionary of American English, wringing the pages for hidden pockets of poesy, fallen ashes of meaning. His carefully curated findings––juxtaposed here with his own hypnotic verse––compel us to savor every word by reawakening us to the unexpected paths each one took to get there.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nA5, approx. 14 pp. Hand-bound in an edition of 100.\r\nISBN 9780957185937\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * Please note: We do not post daily, but we do post at least twice a week and often three times.

The landscape of a childhood Tennessee seen from the vantage of adulthood is populated by honey hives, purple martins, tall grass, and crying girls. There are dogs. There are brothers. Somehow things are held together.\r\n\r\n<i>A Piece of Information About His Invisibility</i> tracks the inevitable loss that takes place between siblings who must grow up; between places we come from and places we find in our dreams and our travels. Here, accumulations of line and of image bring us, in the end, back into a relationship with what we believed was lost forever.\r\n\r\n32 pp., hand-bound in an edition of 100.\r\nISBN 978-0-9571859-5-1\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdvance praise for Laressa Dickey’s A Piece of Information About His Invisibility:\r\n\r\nFrom Maggie Nelson, author of <i>Bluets</i> and <i>The Art of Cruelty</i>: “Using ordinary language and simple declarative rhythms, Laressa Dickey makes a poetry that is meticulous, smart, and strange—almost occult—while also rooted in earth, beauty, and understatement. <i>A Piece of Information About His Invisibility</i> is radiant with narrative mystery and language-made-music. It is a quiet, original, and gorgeous poem.”\r\n\r\nFrom Jonterri Gadson, author of <i>Pepper Girl</i>: “Laressa Dickey’s <i>A Piece of Information About His Invisibility</i> inhabits liminal space through fragmented narratives that fold into and over one another, guided by a lyric voice, an intriguing ghost, with a key quietly turning in the lock throughout this long poem. This work lives and thrives on the intersections of human experience. What captivates the most is how this poem plays itself out on the page the way fragments of memory inhabit the mind. It’s genius.”\r\n\r\nFrom Kathleen Ossip, author of <i>The Cold War</i>: “If <i>A Piece of Information About His Invisibility</i> reads like a detective story, we find its clues in an identifiable place (the rural South) and a past (time of 8-tracks, Little League, and long long days) reconstructed by longing. The poem doesn’t ask whodunnit, but who is gone. That question must be asked, the book suggests, because the boy who disappears is marginalized by time, class, and his own wonderful oddness. The answer is carefully and gorgeously constructed in lines that shimmer. Finally, all that’s left is ‘Gull above boy with hand raised/boy sitting at table waving.’ But <i>A Piece of Information about His Invisibility</i> is also an elegy: Poof! He’s invisible…but the poem remains.”\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * Please note: We do not post daily, but we do post at least twice a week and often three times.

What would happen if we tracked each thought as it passed? What new relationships might be possible if each thing we witnessed and lived were not relegated to this or that kind of experience, but were seen holistically, like leaves on one tree?\r\n\r\nIn this chapbook, Laressa Dickey allows us brief entry into the mind at work. A richness of imagery welcomes the reader—monks in tangerine robes, vinegar and cucumbers floating in a sink, tin pieces stripped from a barn—and Dickey complements this with an accumulation of moments, questions, and reported speech. Her speaker remembers, sees, asks, imagines, feels, and we are simply to follow and to make connections.\r\n\r\nFrom thought to thought, image to image, poem to poem, none of the directness of narrative. Take these poems purely on the surprise and wealth of their language; take them on the pictures they make in the mind; take them as the fragments of things you can barely recall. They answer all these approaches. In <i>Mimesis, synaptic</i>, Laressa Dickey manifests the way a mind moves, and shows the integrity even of disparate thoughts. All in one body, her speaker seems to say; all in one mind. “What you say is poetry if you mean what you say”, Dickey writes. And she means it.\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\nAdvance praise for <i>Mimesis, synaptic</i>:\r\n\r\nFrom Arlene Kim, author of <i>What have you done to our ears to make us hear echoes?</i>: Slipping into Laressa Dickey’s poems is like unexpectedly finding yourself in a museum you never knew was on this street, though you’ve lived here for years. But here you are: you’re walking through some strange, charming exhibit of small, quick things pressing against their frames, wriggling against the glass of their prose and poem bell jars (“every book a man book”).\r\n\r\nNo—it’s like wandering through a hallway of doors, all cracked open just enough for you to peep in (“look at my brother stand in my Easter dress,” “vinegar and cucumbers floating in the kitchen sink”), to eavesdrop at each (“I crossed the room to put my ear down”). No—it’s like the first time you watched one of those mesmerizing hand-turned projection films in grade school, someone’s hand turning the reel at every beep to the next picture (“flaps of fake brick siding”) and the next (“pack of hounds and inbred sheepdogs”).\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nPrinted in an edition of 100 (numbered).\r\nISBN 978-0-9571859-4-4\r\nOr, no—it’s like slowly recovering from or slipping into a lovely kind of amnesia—each marvelous poem like a memory coming back to you (“were we outside in an old metal lawn chair sunk back with the sitter”), or like a memory waving goodbye (“vernal rocket of her hair”), calling out next time, next time (“cover the mind with a hat”).  And when it’s gone, when it’s over, when you’ve left the hall, the gallery, the film—you turn around because you want it to happen again.\r\n\r\nFrom Maria Damon, author of <i>Poetry and Cultural Studies: A Reader</i> and <i>pleasureTEXTpossession</i>: Mimesis, synaptic maintains a delicate interrogative openness: paratactical observation of the present moment’s delights and debacles manifests as embodiment, emmindment, unalienated but pleasantly tentative. Non-imperialistic sentences. “Just say where you go if you know.” And if you don’t know, that’s okay too.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * Please note: We do not post daily, but we do post at least twice a week and often three times.

Across this wilderness move traveling medicine shows, ambulances, the memory of the mother, the heart. The language of these poems is spare; their syntax is abrupt. They circle around what they want. \r\n\r\nIn one poem, Dickey asks ‘If you weren’t raised that way, what would that way be—’. This is the collection’s central question: how can we talk about the most familiar things we know, once we’ve left them? The answer A Pictorial History of Wilderness offers is found in its form and its movements. We cannot return to our pasts, but we can collect their fragments and find in these the strange familiarity of those places and those ways. \r\n\r\nThese are postcards to an estranged past, the recollections that structure movement and its memory.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhat others have had to say:\r\n\r\n\r\nLaressa Dickey's A Pictorial History of Wilderness introduces the work of a vibrant poet. Part visionary, part observer, part loving participant, Dickey writes about the whole world through nature's lens. \"Why say wilderness when you mean body,\" she asks, but in these poems, the body is part of that wilderness, and Dickey is our guide through a compact, complex series of rich lyrics that move the reader across the face of a very beautiful, intimate landscape, one filled with \"rare herons,\" \"the world's tallest building,\" market stalls containing \"car parts, a booth of tires, one for chains or engines or fenders,\" and finally, love: \"Late in the night swindles of hair twined where you have run your fingers through.\" These poems are meditative, lush enough to read again and again.\r\n\r\n––William Reichard, author most recently of SIN EATER and editor of AMERICAN TENSIONS. More: http://www.williamreichard.com/\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nBy turns grounded and in motion, always reflecting a keen awareness of place, these poems remind us that wilderness lives in the gaps of the daily, where the fragment renders us whole and perpetually unfolding. Laressa Dickey's poems ask questions, leap from one stunning image to another, and open up a wandering space that nourishes the reader. “Do not anchor,” she writes, navigating the distances between now and then, here and there, self and other. The result is a poetry that places its trust in the image and music of language as original location.\r\n\r\n––Rachel Moritz, author of NIGHT-SEA and THE WINCHESTER MONOLOGUES, poetry editor at Konundrum Engine Literary Review and publisher of WinteRed Press.

Through the bewildering spaces of the unknown wanders “the memory of flight”; it is this memory which sustains Laressa Dickey’s speaker as she traverses land memorial and actual.\r\n\r\nThe “edge of civilization” in these poems contains bees, dirt, children, prayer, bones, roads, grandmothers. What is known–about the self and about the world–is what Dickey identifies as 'civilized'. These poems celebrate the people who strike forth into the wilderness of the unknown, including the unknown in themselves. Dickey honors this unknown. In her fragmented syntax, we see shards of what might have been, but never grasp it fully.\r\n\r\nWith Dickey‘s poems as our guides, we step out into night sky, out into space, onto the wing of a plane. We step into the mystery that is the space of others’ lives–even those closest others we call family. \r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhat others have said:\r\n\r\nFreighted with silence, these few words bravely make their way across the pages, plumbing the depths as they go. Laressa Dickey writes “first is/ to discover a shape in the dark/ a stone in the palm of your sleep”. She goes on to uncover many shapes, many stones.

There is too much to say about either of them to know where to start. Both are home-made.” \r\n\t–-from “Benrather Schloss”\r\n\r\nNeele Dellschaft’s poems ask questions–-but rarely come to a definitive answer–-about responsibility, identity, and relationship. What does it mean to write poems as a German citizen, as a daughter, as a sister, as an aunt, as a scientist, as a migrant? To whom and to what are we responsible, and how do we carry our responsibilities out? What forms might the repair of the past or provision for the future take?\r\n\r\nIn the three poems this chapbook contains, we are privileged to enter private conversations and intimate spaces between people. In these poems, such spaces are not only physical, but memorial. These poems manifest the desire to record, observe, and acknowledge the poet’s own participation in her history and her future.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhat others have said:\r\n\r\n\"This is a poetry that moves differently. Crossing geographies and generations, Dellschaft's work is at once intimate and remote; her silences are as deft as her words.\"\r\n\r\n––Sarah Jackson, author of MILK and PELT (forthcoming, Bloodaxe, 2012). More: http://www.pighog.co.uk/authors/Sarah-Jackson.html\r\n\r\n\"I really enjoyed these poems. They're spacious, beautiful and with a voice that's chatty and sad.\"\r\n\r\n--Joe Dunthorne, author of WILD ABANDON and SUBMARINE. More: http://joedunthorne.com/\r\n\r\n\"An eighteenth-century Düsseldorf palace abuts modern middle-class\r\nhomes, a window frame embraces a square of sky, and lab rats wait in\r\nbasement cages for the touch of the scientist’s hand in Neele Dellschaft’s I Come Home and I Move Differently. Sutures mark both\r\nbreak and mend in this book of reparations. Snapshots capture the\r\nsmall lives of a family woven into the shared experiences of a continent—how in the horror of war, a grandmother’s face “looks\r\nexceedingly free and happy” after daringly relocating her loved ones\r\nto safety. Hemispheres are sewn together by memory, with vestiges of\r\nGerman language echoing in the author’s adopted home of England, with “the history and also the evil” of Europe in WWII following along to\r\ncontemporary North America: “The simultaneity / of seven billion parts\r\nof life everywhere. / Also animals, also the oceans leaping, the\r\nvacuum around all this.” The layering of shared and varied experience\r\nmuffles as it magnifies, as age reveals the patterns just outside of\r\nconsciousness. We are overwhelmed by the knowledge of suffering, yet\r\nwe begin to heal with the help of context and distance: “In cities,\r\nhouses in which bunk beds / allow a view over a roundabout, / constant observation of the same tides in traffic.” Stasis and kinesis, historyand today, individual consciousness and the collective unconscious come together in this wisely intuitive book. With these poems, Dellschaft taps into the archetypal, physiological wiring that causes a body to “move differently” after watching a flock, a herd, a drove of dancers perform beautifully.\r\n\r\n--James Cihlar, author of UNDOING.
