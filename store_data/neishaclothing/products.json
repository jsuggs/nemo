It is warm and sexy for the winter months, while being an excellent transeasonal piece for cooler climates. This dress is knee-length with a sweetheart neckline and low back.\r\n\r\nThe Rona dress is one of the most flattering dresses that a woman can own. The perfectly fitted cut of the dress and the ruching around the bust and bottom accentuate all the right curves. The high quality knit fabric gives the dress an optimal level of comfort and wearability. It is the perfect balance of intelligent construction, uncompromising femininity and comfort. This is a dress that you will wear and love for years to come. \r\n\r\nThe Rona dress is from the 'Sticks and Stones' range.\r\n\r\nRona was the daughter of the sea god Tangaroa in Maori mythology. She was the Tide Controller. One night she was carrying a bucket with water back home to her children, when the path became dark. The Moon slipped behind the clouds, making it impossible to see anything. As Rona was walking, she hit her foot against a root that was sticking out of the ground. She was so upset that she could not see the root that she made some unkind remarks about the Moon.\r\n\r\nThe Moon heard her remarks and put a curse on the Maori people. The Moon grabbed Rona and her water bucket. Many people today see a woman with a bucket in the Moon. It is said that when Rona upsets her bucket, it rains. This Maori story symbolizes the influence of the Moon on the rain and on the waters of the Earth, and especially on the tides. \r\n\r\nThe Rona dress is available in black,wine, magenta and emerald green\r\n.","options":[{"id":28080005,"name":"10","price":180.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35339652,"name":"12","price":180.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35339655,"name":"14","price":180.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35339658,"name":"8","price":180.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.85,"amount_with_others":6.5,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":16.5,"amount_with_others":11.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87997580/-/2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87997580/-/2.jpg","width":310,"height":456},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87997598/-/1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87997598/-/1.jpg","width":310,"height":456}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4398461,"name":"Dresses","permalink":"dresses","url":"/category/dresses"}]},{"id":8950625,"name":"Purple Waka Skirt","permalink":"purple-waka-skirt","position":2,"price":70.0,"default_price":70.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/purple-waka-skirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-15T04:22:43.000Z","description":"This vibrant floor length skirt comes from the environmentally sustainable \"Old Skin/New Skin\" range.
