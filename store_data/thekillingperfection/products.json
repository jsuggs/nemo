There is meaning behind the color choice, layout, serif font, and other details that may go unnoticed. It was essentially a coming of age, the realization that I needed to get serious about my life, and about my craft. I could longer go on naively living and expect to have everything handed to me. I understand that not everyone will be able to relate, or there will be those that think the shirt is too simple, and I'm okay with that, because the story and the meaning behind it is much deeper.","options":[{"id":47909976,"name":"Small","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47909979,"name":"Medium","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47909982,"name":"Large","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47909985,"name":"X-Large","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127591302/-/1.tdoy.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127591302/-/1.tdoy.gif","width":564,"height":520}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6548877,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]}]
