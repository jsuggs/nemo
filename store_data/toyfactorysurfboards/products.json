This was made for Harry deRoth so perfect for a grom, this would make some young surfers Christmas. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OVERVIEW\r\n\r\nWell the Mad Fresh is basically a board that takes the novelty out of the shorter wider boards, still shorter, still flatter and still plenty of volume along with added rail length and more curve into the pulled in tail, the Mad Fresh is an evolution of the progressive shortboard and something that is as happy in the air as it is getting flung on rail or holding in the pocket. get Mad Fresh on it, lets see what the new skool has…\r\n\r\nTHE CONCEPT\r\n\r\nThe Mad Fresh is basically what you need in a shorter wider board to make it better on rail with more hold in the pocket, enabling not just airs and rotations but tighter radius turns in the pocket to really push the limit of high performance surfing. basically the easier a board is to surf the easier it is to progress, and this is just a follow on from design working on boards like the Jeffrey, the Fly-Ty, the Stoker and the Blue Canvas to some extent.\r\n\r\nIt’s the evolution of having a few years on the wider boards coupled with the great feeling you get from carving lines when its pumping and doing big hacks right in the pocket on your shortboard. I’m so excited about this model as are the team, the footage we have been getting speaks for itself!\r\n\r\nTHE TECH’ STUFF\r\n\r\nThe Mad Fresh features a somewhat stretched out outline of the Fly-Ty, with softer curves and a more performance based tail shape (like the Crow model), this allows a lot of drive with the straight rail, but also plenty of pivot off the back foot due to the slight hip and pulled in tail, as for the rocker it has a curvy high-ish tail rocker for hold right in the pocket and a drawn out flatter rocker through the nose with a touch of flip, this combination allows late take-offs, hard off the bottom turning and a lot of forward momentum.\r\n\r\nThe concaves are very similar to the Blue Canvas model just with a touch deeper single concave through the nose, the idea of the concave is to give you plenty of lift in the water for speed, also with the boxy shortboard rail the Mad Fresh has you sit slightly higher in the water than a shortboard which makes it very easy to throw about in less than perfect surf. The fin set up is that of a standard shortboard to offer maximum drive and torque on carves and hacks and the volume spread is fairly compact just like the new skool wide and short boards you see everyone riding today. this combination of design meets evolution really gives you a tool to push the tweaks and the power in your surfing in a wider range of conditions.\r\n\r\nTHE STATS\r\n\r\nWave Height: 2-6 foot\r\nAbility Level: Intermediate to pro\r\nFin Set Up: Thruster\r\nRails: Boxy\r\nTail Rocker: Medium high\r\nNose Rocker: Low\r\nConcave: Single to double\r\nTail: Squash\r\nSize: Try 1-4 inches shorter and half to 1 inch wider than your standard board","options":[{"id":49736271,"name":"Default","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129080046/-/photo-214.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129080046/-/photo-214.JPG","width":2592,"height":1936},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128734617/-/de_froth.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128734617/-/de_froth.jpg","width":732,"height":2508}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4669687,"name":"Used boards","permalink":"used-boards","url":"/category/used-boards"}]},{"id":15298293,"name":"5'9 x 18 5/16 x 2 1/6 Mad Fresh 4th by Luke Hart - Made for Hazza T","permalink":"5-9-x-18-5-16-x-2-1-6-mad-fresh-4th-by-luke-hart-made-for-hazza-t","position":3,"price":190.0,"default_price":190.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/5-9-x-18-5-16-x-2-1-6-mad-fresh-4th-by-luke-hart-made-for-hazza-t","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-03T14:47:48.000Z","description":"3rd one of Hazza T's.

It was used in his Mexico edit for strange beautiful life.\r\n\r\n\r\nOVERVIEW\r\n\r\nEasy to ride, care free surfing craft that’s fun for everyone, paddles well, super fast down the line and great for any level of surfing depending on who rides it.\r\n\r\nTHE CONCEPT\r\n\r\nThe Stoker, a rework on design from stokesys first ever pro model. A super easy to surf and fun board. The Stoker is a board for total freesurfing expression. Whether you want to practice your airs, throw some rotation in the mix or whack the fins out, this is the ultimate tool for pure fun and stoke. They are addictive little things! Order 4-6 inches shorter than your standard shortboard.\r\n\r\nTHE TECH STUFF\r\n\r\nThe Stoker has elements of Stokesy’s original pro model with new tweaks, enabling a progression to what Stokesy wants to achieve when he gets in the water for a freesurf. He wants to blow up and have some fun. We’ve added more drive to the Stoker with a slightly more parallel rail and pulled the tail shape in slightly to get more hold on a bottom turn, dropped the rail shape down a touch to increase rail hold through bigger turns and lengthened the board an inch whilst raising the nose rocker to enable the board to hold in on tight pockets and waves with a lot of shape. Most importantly this is a ‘do everything’ board. Just get it out there and have some fun. It goes when it’s small due to the deck volume and extra nose width and is also fun in bigger waves with the added length delivering increased hold. The deep single running throughout the board provides lift in the water which helps with initial speed and paddling. We are stoked with what we have come up with in this board and can’t wait to get people on it, carving their own lines and taking their surfing to the next level.\r\n\r\nTHE STATS\r\n\r\nRail – medium high, shortboard like\r\nTail rocker – super high tail kick\r\nNose rocker – low medium\r\nConcave – deep single\r\nTail – Squash\r\nSize – order 4-6 inches shorter, 1/4 to half inches wider and 1/8 thinner than your go to stick. Or email us to talk about it some more.\r\nWave height – you tell us, Stokesy usually takes it in whenever he wants to surf.\r\nAbility level – this is a board for everyone.\r\nFin setup – thruster as standard","options":[{"id":49733394,"name":"Default","price":230.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129079785/-/photo-216.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129079785/-/photo-216.JPG","width":2592,"height":1936}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4669687,"name":"Used boards","permalink":"used-boards","url":"/category/used-boards"}]},{"id":15297372,"name":"5'9 x 17 3/4 x 2 1/2 4th by Luke Hart - Mad Fresh","permalink":"5-9-x-17-3-4-x-2-1-2-4th-by-luke-hart-mad-fresh","position":8,"price":200.0,"default_price":200.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/5-9-x-17-3-4-x-2-1-2-4th-by-luke-hart-mad-fresh","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-03T13:58:38.000Z","description":"Made for Harry Timson this is a custom Mad Fresh.
