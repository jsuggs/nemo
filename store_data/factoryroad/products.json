The release of Sage Francis' 'Personal Journals', the anniversary of Inkymole's show 'If A Girl Writes off the World', along with its two US incarnations in Manhattan and Rhode Island are all celebrated with this limited edition, <b>hand-made</b> book with one side for writing (Thoughts) and one for sketching (Ideas). \r\n\r\nMeasuring 102mm x 146mm - fitting most pockets - each side is 7mm thick and interspersed with removable, perforated mailable postcards showing unseen artwork from the original show, 8 postcards in total. The covers are hand-embossed in gold or silver foil with a close-up section of Mole's 'Runaways' illustration, and come in a range of colours, from silver to pearl white to maroon to iridescent pink.\r\n\r\nSigned by Inkymole, these are released at the same time as two new prints, much-requested but not available at the time of the show, of 'Hopeless' by Inkymole, and 'Runaways', also in the
