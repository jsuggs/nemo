Just a little background about our process and costs; we try to keep all orders under $40.00, if for some reason the custom design was over $40.00 we would advise you first. We love your input! We understand that the first design we show you might not be the look you are going for or it might be perfect! You let us know! \r\n\r\nIf you are interested in a custom set/sets please fill out this information and email it back to help@kddoccessories.com \r\n\r\nThe first thing is what size of plug do you wear?  \r\n\r\nThen what type of look are you hoping to achieve? \r\n\r\nAre there textures you like such as pearls or crystals? \r\n\r\nIs there are certain colors you want included? \r\n\r\nDo you like gold or silver?\r\n\r\nOne of the things I recommend doing is maybe finding a few photos of times you like (Other earrings or plugs, the other jewelry you will be wearing, ext) that way we can have a true feel and understanding of your vision! \r\n\r\nAlso what type of plug back would you like? In most sizes we can offer 316L surgical steel screwback, 316L surgical steel single flare with o-ring, or double flare acrylic. \r\n\r\nThank you for your interest!\r\nOnce again please email this form back to help@kddoccessories.com or use the contact us form!
