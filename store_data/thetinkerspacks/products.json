Lustrous brown and strawberry-orange loops and swirls hold this alluring wood grain captive.  It comes in a faux leather ring box.\r\n\r\nWhat does stabilized mean, you ask?  Japheth says that \"all wood is naturally unstable when cut; it will shrink, crack, twist, and some other quite nasty things. Sometimes just letting the wood dry out on its own can be enough to stabilize it. But when you're dealing with burls, or punky or spalted wood, you want a little more assurance. Stabilizing is a process where vacuum pressure is used to suck acrylic resin into a wood, basically plasticizing the wood so that it can be worked without fear. This acrylic can be dyed to pretty much any color a person likes, producing a plethora of options, and this is why there's a slight color difference between rings.\"\r\n\r\nThese rings are subject to varied wood grain and color.  Unfortunately, we are unable to take requests for specific colors (e.g. lighter or darker).\r\n\r\nPlease be forewarned that submersion in water (via the washing machine, hand-washing dishes, etc.) will weaken the integrity of your ring and may cause it to break.\r\n\r\nDiscover more amazing work by this talented artist on <a href=https://www.facebook.com/TrinketsAndTinkering>his Facebook page</a>.\r\n\r\nAll proceeds go to Worldbuilders.","options":[{"id":40015473,"name":"Size 5","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40015476,"name":"Size 5.5","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40015479,"name":"Size 6","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40015482,"name":"Size 6.5","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40015485,"name":"Size 7","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40015488,"name":"Size 7.5","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40015491,"name":"Size 8","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40015494,"name":"Size 8.5","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40015497,"name":"Size 9","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40015500,"name":"Size 9.5","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40015503,"name":"Size 10","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40015506,"name":"Size 10.5","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40015509,"name":"Size 11","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40015512,"name":"Size 11.5","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40015515,"name":"Size 12","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.25,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":10.75,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.25,"amount_with_others":2.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":11.25,"amount_with_others":2.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122104224/-/Ambr_1.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122104224/-/Ambr_1.JPG","width":3776,"height":2520},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122104248/-/Ambr_4.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122104248/-/Ambr_4.JPG","width":3776,"height":2520},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128055612/-/IMG_2825-002.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128055612/-/IMG_2825-002.png","width":739,"height":490},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128055660/-/IMG_2828-1.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128055660/-/IMG_2828-1.png","width":739,"height":490}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3372575,"name":"Recently Added","permalink":"recently-added","url":"/category/recently-added"},{"id":3372579,"name":"Jewelry","permalink":"jewelry","url":"/category/jewelry"},{"id":1716446,"name":"Random Cool Stuff","permalink":"random-cool-stuff","url":"/category/random-cool-stuff"}]},{"id":14622234,"name":"2014 \"Year of the Poser\" Calendar","permalink":"2014-year-of-the-poser-calendar","position":15,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/2014-year-of-the-poser-calendar","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-04T23:54:54.000Z","description":"Behold the glory of the <i>2014 Year of the Poser Calendar</i>, 12 months of gender-swapped Science Fiction & Fantasy cover poses by Jim. C. Hines.\r\n\r\nSupporting the Aicardi Syndrome Foundation, each calendar is autographed by award-winning authors Jim Hines and Patrick Rothfuss. This (very) unique calendar features cover poses from Hines, as well as appearances from special guest authors Patrick Rothfuss, John Scalzi, Mary Robinette Kowal, and Charlie Stross.  \r\n\r\nWhat inspired this inscrutable project, you may ask?\r\n\r\nIn 2012, Jim wanted to start a discussion about science fiction and fantasy cover art, particularly the ways women were portrayed. To do this, he attempted to contort himself into the poses of various cover art heroines, leading to many discussions about sexism and objectification, the purpose of cover art, and who could do the better Christmas-themed cover pose, Jim Hines or John Scalzi. (Spoiler: it was totally Jim!)\r\n \r\nToward the end of the year, Jim launched another round of poses, this time to raise money for the <a href=http://www.aicardisyndrome.org/site/>Aicardi Syndrome Foundation</a>. He offered rewards for various fundraising goals, including a cover pose calendar if the fundraiser brought in more than $15,000. Jim figured that was an absurdly high goal, and that he’d be safe. He figured wrong... and thus a calendar was born!\r\n\r\nWant to learn more?

Martin, Terry Pratchett, and Patrick Rothfuss.\r\n\r\nIllustrated by Lee Moyer (www.leemoyer.com), each month of the calendar will feature a different author, detailing one of their characters, or offering an homage to their work. \r\n\r\nAll proceeds from the project go to Worldbuilders in support of Heifer International.","options":[{"id":29361257,"name":"Calendar","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19774931,"name":"Numbered Limited Edition: Signed by Artist Lee Moyer","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":19774933,"name":"Calendars sold @ $20 ea.","price":10.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.25,"amount_with_others":3.25,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":16.25,"amount_with_others":4.5},{"amount_alone":15.5,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123101193/-/2013_Calendar_Transparent.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123101193/-/2013_Calendar_Transparent.png","width":739,"height":490},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74546993/-/careypinup.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74546993/-/careypinup.jpg","width":566,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74547009/-/6-gaiman7.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74547009/-/6-gaiman7.jpg","width":544,"height":720},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/78665109/-/Bradbury_Pin_up.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/78665109/-/Bradbury_Pin_up.jpg","width":755,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74547049/-/2013_BackCover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74547049/-/2013_BackCover.jpg","width":755,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3832019,"name":"On Sale!","permalink":"on-sale","url":"/category/on-sale"},{"id":3992955,"name":"Calendars","permalink":"calendars","url":"/category/calendars"}]},{"id":6048539,"name":"Amyr Poster","permalink":"amyr-poster","position":51,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/amyr-poster","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-27T22:57:42.000Z","description":"Drawn by the awesome Nathan Taylor, this black and white 11\" by 14\" poster depicts one of the Amyr in all his formidable power.

Without knowing why, the twins are stolen away to live with Grandma X--a relative they've never, ever met. At Grandma X's house, things are even stranger. Weather vanes point in the opposite direction of the wind. Doors appear and disappear. Cats talk. Jaide and Jack don't know the reason behind all this strangeness. They don't know that they're troubletwisters, and that they must defend the world against a dark, evil force. The time has come for them to discover the truth--and the powers that come with the truth.

I think of it as Calvin and Hobbes meets Coraline, with some Edward Gorey mixed in.\" \r\n\r\nFrom the San Francisco Book Review: \r\n\r\n“In what is by far the funniest and most original book of the year (so far), Rothfuss shows off his ability to think and create outside of the expected. The story is pure comic genius that will be fun and funny for parents and children. The illustrations, not to be outdone, offer subtle little quirks that, after reading the book multiple times, shine through and give it lasting re-read incentive.”\r\n\r\nAvailable are hardcover first editions, with the option to have yours signed and personalized by Pat.
