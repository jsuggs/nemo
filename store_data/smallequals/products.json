We love these as sewing boxes, but anything goes.\r\n\r\nHere it is.\r\n\r\n5 x 7 x 1.5 Vermont-made wooden box. The sliding lid features a reproduction of a turn of the century trade card from Wells Richardson & Co. Burlington Vermont.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the 19th Century, Wells Richardson & Company patented, manufactured and distributed analyne dyes under the name of Diamond Dyes, as well as butter dye, baby food and proprietary medicines like Celery Compound.\r\n\r\nPrint Advertising was a part of their marketing strategy. Before the advent of color ads in newspapers and magazines manufacturers and distributors relied on trade cards and medical pamphlets -featuring their own cures - to sell their products. These they made by the gajillion, and distributed nationwide. They would be distributed for free in retail stores or any public venue where they might drum up  business.  Trade cards were hugely collectible, even in those days, and would often end up in scrapbooks, which were also the rage. The trade cards and pamphlets were printed by chromolithography, and retain their brilliant colors to this day.\r\n\r\nThis dye-cut card advertising their baby formula. Before the Pure Food and Drug act of 1906 anyone could sell anything. There were no ingredient labels, and there is no telling what was really in this product.\r\n\r\nThis would make a cute baby-shower gift. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pinterest.com/smallequals/\"><img src=\"http://passets-cdn.pinterest.com/images/follow-on-pinterest-button.png\" width=\"156\" height=\"26\" alt=\"Follow Me on Pinterest\" /></a>","options":[{"id":14244173,"name":"Default","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/42357227/-/box_lacted_foods_closed.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/42357227/-/box_lacted_foods_closed.jpg","width":1000,"height":720},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/42357235/-/box_lacted_food_open.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/42357235/-/box_lacted_food_open.jpg","width":1000,"height":666}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1608568,"name":"KEEPSAKE BOX","permalink":"keepsake-box","url":"/category/keepsake-box"}]},{"id":4681755,"name":"KEEPSAKE BOX: leave a message","permalink":"keepsake-box-leave-a-message","position":37,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/keepsake-box-leave-a-message","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-10-21T20:43:16.000Z","description":"Keep stuff AND have a way to leave a quick message.

Now 35 years later, I have launched an online annotated archive of the magazine and collateral ephemera. This image was our first flier. It was taken in a fashion photographer's studio and it features me, Liza, owner of Small Equals, my editorial partner Penny, and three of our pals, including the now famous singer Alix Dobkin, whose memoir, My Red Blood, was published recently and is fascinating.\r\n\r\nMany of the archive readers have expressed enthusiasm about having this image on some sort of media, and I decided that a magnet was most appropriate. The archive has some costs associated with it, so the magnet is also a fundraiser. Help support an archive, keep history thriving, and buy something cool. \r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dykeaquarterly.com\"><img src=\"http://seesaw.typepad.com/DAQ2.jpg\" /></a>\r\n","options":[{"id":10150897,"name":"Magnet, DYKE A Quarterly","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60390719/-/dyke_magnet_for_shop.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60390719/-/dyke_magnet_for_shop.jpg","width":500,"height":451},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/28392669/-/dyke_magnet.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/28392669/-/dyke_magnet.jpg","width":788,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/28392629/-/dyke_is_out.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/28392629/-/dyke_is_out.jpg","width":600,"height":828}],"artists":[{"id":78497,"name":"Liza Cowan","permalink":"liza-cowan","url":"/artist/liza-cowan"}],"categories":[]}]
