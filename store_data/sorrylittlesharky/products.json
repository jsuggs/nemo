Reaching 10 feet (3 meters) in length and more than 300 pounds (136 kilograms), Komodo Dragons are the heaviest lizards on Earth. They have long, flat heads with rounded snouts, scaly skin, bowed legs, and huge, muscular tails.\r\n\r\nHowever, they are also adorable, as depicted in my painting, here. This is a cute little outdoors-wildlife-safari-style 8x10'' painting done with Academy acrylics and coated with a clear, flat, UV-resistant matte finish to protect the design/colors.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking, and check out www.sorrylittlesharky.com for more crazy artwork!\r\n\r\n***If you are outside of the United States, please contact me and I'll gladly put together a quote for shipping this piece to your country. ***","options":[{"id":16178803,"name":"Default","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/48876207/-/KomodoDragon_watermarked.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/48876207/-/KomodoDragon_watermarked.png","width":600,"height":465}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":4979197,"name":"\"Shattered Path\" Glass Artwork, Panel Painting, dotted lines, etched, dark, green, swirls, abstract","permalink":"glass-artwork-panel-painting-dotted-lines-etched-dark-green-swirls-abstract","position":2,"price":65.0,"default_price":65.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/glass-artwork-panel-painting-dotted-lines-etched-dark-green-swirls-abstract","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-12-01T07:25:57.000Z","description":"This is a uniquely designed and hand-crafted piece of painted glass artwork called \"Shattered Path\".
