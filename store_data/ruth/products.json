Over the last year the band has lived up to the title and crossed the country multiple times delivering a message through their music. After sharing the stage with the likes of Switchfoot, Relient K, and Emery the band settled in for a few months to record with an acclaimed roster of producers. Production duties were handled in part by Aaron Sprinkle (Hawk Nelson, Kutless, Anberlin) and the album was mixed by Ken Andrews (Mae, Thousand Foot Krutch) and JR McNeely (Jeremy Camp Relient K). On \"Anorak\" sonically Ruth takes everything that ruled about '90s alternative--Nirvana, Radiohead, Third Eye Blind, Counting Crows-- and peppers in the introspective finesse of singer-songwriters like Ryan Adams, and for their own extraordinary blend of impassioned, dynamic pop. \"I have always been a sucker for melody,\" confesses frontman Dustin Ruth. \"I wanted to take all the best parts of my inspiration, combine that with a genuine presentation of my experiences in the lyrics, and write songs that people would remember and be transformed by.\"\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n1.
