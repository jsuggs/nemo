In the 1970s & 1980s it was a favourite stop for those returning to the west coast and for Sunday drivers.  Sundays were very busy.   My mother, Margie baked thousands of apple cakes which were often served with whipped cream and a spoon.  Her cream filled sponge cakes were very popular too.  After church on Sundays, Mum would take delivery of a bootload of immaculate biscuits, cakes & slices made by Dad's cousin, Lynette James.  \r\n\r\nOver the years Dad grew earlier varieties and later ones to lengthen the season of fruit available at the Apple Pip. It was a very busy productive time. Many will remember his fibreglass apple on top of the shop which is still there.
