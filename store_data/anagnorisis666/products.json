A quick search of the word on Google will reveal a myriad of uses, and some distaste by Muslism themselves at what the word has come to mean in the 21st century. \r\n\r\nMake no mistake - you, we, all of us who don't follow their version of god - we are kafirs, infidels, non-believers. And we're proud of that: Anagnorisis has been a band of atheists since day one. \"Kafir\" implies \"a person who hides or covers up,\" meaning a person who \"hides\" the truth.\r\n\r\nDoes a Christian hide their idea of truth, claiming Jesus is the son of a god, from a Muslim? What about a Jew, who straddles the monotheistic line? And Buddhists? Are they apostates and infidels as well? Surely atheists are the worst, right? \r\n\r\nWe reject all of this, and take the word of \"unbeliever\" as a source of pride. We believe in ourselves, in our brothers and sisters, and in where the evidence leads us. There's nothing admirable about believing in a falsehood, be it god (by any name), resurrection, or a fabricated book of fictitious history. Much as the Sigil of the Baphomet (pentagram) inverts the message of Christianity, the word \"kafir\" inverts the shame of non-belief, a stigma found so foul by Islam. We are infidels. We are non-believers.
