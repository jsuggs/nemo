This CD is enclosed in a jewel case containing four panels of CD art. 11 songs of some good ole rock n' roll. \r\n\r\n\"...a bold and aggressive album, which is sure to permeate astute rock fans’ ears and give them something to sink their teeth into.\"\r\n-Eric Allen, The Murfreesboro Pulse\r\n\r\n\"If you mashed up the alternative genres skirting the mainstream during the’70s and ’90s and churned it out with one guitar and drum set in a snarling, sexy, dirty mess, you’d have “Mountain” ... Bare-bones as the album may be, each song is profoundly multi-faceted with tracks that can go from jam-band slow to warped speed over the course of two minutes.\"\r\n-Jessica Pace, Nashville Deli\r\n\r\n1.
