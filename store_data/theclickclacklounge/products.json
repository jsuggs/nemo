This oxygenated hand mixed cream protects every single eyelash with a breathable coating. A soft texture encourages the eyelashes to grow and provides just the right amount of glossiness.\r\n\r\nThe eyelashes are gently lengthened and strengthened without the use of any additional hairs or capillary substances. Most importantly, the special scent adds antibacterial properties to the formula and does not *irritate the eyes. *Contains clove oil, in very rare cases if you have any alergeries to clove oil or clove oil derivatives we strongly suggest testing for reaction before applying near your eyes.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this mascara truly unique is its creamy consistency that adds full length and clear definition to the lashes, keeping them soft and alluring. The result is a gentle, natural daily wear formula that resists water, smudges and tears, but can be easily removed with a gentle cleanser.  In addition, the hollow brush applicator will coat the lashes evenly and provide clump-free results.\r\n \r\nThis special combination dates back to the 1930â€™s and has been re-introduced by BÃ©same. And being a classic, it contains only natural ingredients, has been allergy tested, is paraben-free and is safe for the most sensitive eyes. \r\n\r\nBÃ©same 1930s Mascara is one of the most natural mascaras on the market today, containing only seven ingredients. \r\n\r\nWhy not purchase the entire Besame Cosmetic Range - superb and quality tested by yours truly for The Click-Clack Lounge.\r\n\r\n ","options":[{"id":34923882,"name":"Default","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109177005/-/mascara_billboard.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109177005/-/mascara_billboard.jpg","width":657,"height":398},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109175913/-/1930sMascara.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109175913/-/1930sMascara.png","width":62,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3489683,"name":"Besame Cosmetics","permalink":"besame-cosmetics","url":"/category/besame-cosmetics"}]}]
