However the Scottish also have put claims to Kettlebells as they have been used in Highlands games for centuries. Wherever they came from one this is for sure they will challenge you. \r\n\r\nOver time, in Russian the military understood its potential and started to use it, then Russian strongmen, weightlifters and wrestlers. American athletes eventually discovered it in the recent times. Today it is regarded by fitness experts as the ultimate training tool for all-round fitness and physical development. It was popularised in the west by likes of Pavel Tsatsouline, Steve Maxwell, Steve Cotter and Mike Mahler. \r\n\r\nThe Kettlebell is distinguished from all other resistance training implements by its displaced center of mass. Most resistance training equipment has a central point of balance at equal distance from its extremities (like the barbell or dumbbell). With a Kettlebell, the center of mass is located somewhere in the sphere, some distance from the handle. This imbues the bell with what often feels like a mind of its own.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Classic’ Kettlebell is so-named because it is the original shape of the Russian bell. The classic shape is well suited to the smaller athlete; the sphere is smaller and makes it easier to use, especially for activities involving two bells, like swings. They are also easier to store as they don’t take up as much space as their Pro Grade cousins.\r\n\r\nKettlebell have quickly become a favorite for mixed martial artist,  rugby players and other top athletes who need explosive power and additional brute strength and overall cardiovascular fitness. Kettlebells take no prisoners. \r\n\r\nKettlebells deliver STRENGTH, ENDURANCE and RAPID WEIGHT LOSS without the DISHONOUR of aerobics and dieting.\r\n\r\nNB.
