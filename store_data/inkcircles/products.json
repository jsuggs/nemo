Fortunately, they get smaller towards the bottom.\r\n\r\nWhat does it all mean? Besides being a great design perfect for anyone who likes turtles, the design represents an ancient creative cosmological theory. Without an understanding of planetary gravity, some philosophers theorized that the earth was held up atop the back of a large turtle. When asked what was holding up that turtle, they responded that it was another turtle. And beneath that; another turtle. In fact, it was \"turtles all the way down.\" \r\n\r\nThe turtles are stitched with different shades of DMC, but just as the height of your stack can be easily adjusted, the colors can easily be changed to suit whatever turtly needs you have and whatever specialty fibers might be calling to you.
