Your suspension effectively gains 80mm travel (compared to lowering your car by winding the coil over down). This means that the shock is a more optimum position leaving your ride less crashy- and more how the manufacturer intended!\r\n\r\n2. When you lower a car with a torsion-swing beam, the wheel naturally begins to swing forward and hug the front edge of the arch. Using these drop plates puts the wheel back to where it's supposed to be - the centre of the arch. This means you can actually lower your car more because the wheel catches the arch later - giving you a bit more space.\r\n\r\n3. These space the stub axle out 12mm. Meaning the wheel fills the arch more - eliminating the need for spacers. \r\n\r\nSpecification:\r\n80mm Drop\r\n12mm Spacing\r\n\r\nTo fit: \r\nGolf/Jetta/Vento 75-98\r\nGolf cabrio 79-98\r\nPassat 74-97\r\nPolo 75-00\r\nPolo classic 96-00\r\nScirocco 74-92\r\n\r\nAudi 50 75-78\r\nAudi 80/90/Avant 73-92\r\nAudi Coupe 81-88\r\n\r\n97-03 Arosa\r\n93-99 Cordoba\r\n93-99 Ibiza\r\n92-99 Toledo\r\n\r\nThis product has been tufftrided for protection.\r\n\r\nWe will be adding more photos soon.\r\n\r\nCome with four bolts and washer, and two drop plates.\r\n\r\nThese are for 'show use only'.","options":[{"id":17587367,"name":"Default","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":20.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53529761/-/dropplates1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53529761/-/dropplates1.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2055042,"name":"MK1 Golf","permalink":"mk1-golf","url":"/category/mk1-golf"},{"id":2055044,"name":"MK2 Golf","permalink":"mk2-golf","url":"/category/mk2-golf"},{"id":2055046,"name":"MK3 Golf","permalink":"mk3-golf","url":"/category/mk3-golf"},{"id":2055048,"name":"Corrado","permalink":"corrado","url":"/category/corrado"}]},{"id":4838439,"name":"Track rod flip kit","permalink":"track-rod-flip-kit","position":3,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/track-rod-flip-kit","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-11-13T15:36:57.000Z","description":"Using these parts enables the user to flip their track rods so that they match the angle of the wishbones to reduce bump steer. \r\n\r\nBy machining/drilling a 17mm hole in your hub to remove the taper that the track rod normal fits into - you are able to press this into the hub and mount the track rod on the other side of the hub.
