And it’s about love—what you sacrifice, and what you accept for a chance at real happiness.\r\n\r\nSet in the first year of Barack Obama's presidency, Pure Bronx is a love story about a young couple from the South Bronx. Khalil and Rasheeda are trying to make it out of the ghetto, and taste what middle-class America takes for granted. Born and raised in Patterson Houses, Khalil is a 21-year-old hustler, who is the main provider for his family. Beautiful and sexy, 19-year old Rasheeda is a dancer at a strip club. She lives in Mitchell Houses with her mother and younger brother, attends college, and is also the main provider for family. Rasheeda is struggling to make ends meet. Khalil meets and falls in love with Rasheeda. Things go good for a while, but facing crisis after crisis, Rasheeda breaks down in front of Khalil. He takes her seriously when she jokingly suggests kidnapping her richest client, and one of the wealthiest men on Wall Street, Robert Seidman. Khalil enlists the help of his two trusted friends, and hatches a plan to kidnap Seidman. \r\n\r\nThings go awry when the kidnappers discover that Seidman has his own financial problems. They resort to Plan B and this involves Seidman’s wife, who feels betrayed. Will she bite? Read Pure Bronx and find out why this action packed, drama filled story is more potent than just any coming-of-age tale from the hood.  Packed with more drama than straphangers on the 1,2, 4, 5 and 6 trains at rush hour, Pure Bronx is a page-turner that’ll make you cheer, bringing tears, and laughter. \r\n\r\n<html><head>\r\n  <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\">\r\n  <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Style-Type\" content=\"text/css\">\r\n  <title></title>\r\n  <meta name=\"Generator\" content=\"Cocoa HTML Writer\">\r\n  <meta name=\"CocoaVersion\" content=\"1187.39\">\r\n  <style type=\"text/css\">\r\n    p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px Verdana; color: #808080}\r\n    p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Verdana; color: #808080; min-height: 12.0px}\r\n    p.p3 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Verdana; color: #808080}\r\n    p.p4 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Verdana; color: #0000ee}\r\n    p.p5 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Verdana; color: #808080; min-height: 15.0px}\r\n  </style>\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Read this book on your computer, tablet,</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>smart phone or other mobile devices.</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Available on the</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Pure-Bronx-Mark-Naison/dp/1935883410/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1380295089&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Pure+Bronx\"><b>Kindle</b></a></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Available on the</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/pure-bronx-mark-naison/1114768764?ean=9781935883418&amp;itm=1&amp;usri=pure+bronx\"><b>Nook</b></a></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Available on the</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/\"><b>iBookstore</b></a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</body></html>\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":44391534,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.95,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124964709/-/PureBronx_FrontCvr.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124964709/-/PureBronx_FrontCvr.jpg","width":1558,"height":2457},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124964844/-/3D_PureBronx.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124964844/-/3D_PureBronx.png","width":2136,"height":2792}],"artists":[{"id":236655,"name":"Mark Nasion PhD","permalink":"mark-nasion-phd","url":"/artist/mark-nasion-phd"},{"id":236658,"name":"Melissa Castillo-Garsow","permalink":"melissa-castillo-garsow","url":"/artist/melissa-castillo-garsow"}],"categories":[{"id":2685167,"name":"Augustus Books","permalink":"augustus-books","url":"/category/augustus-books"}]},{"id":13825329,"name":"Naked Confessions","permalink":"naked-confessions","position":2,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/naked-confessions","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-09-27T15:11:18.000Z","description":"While facing her own mortality a woman chooses to explore her sexual fantasies and spins out of control…\r\n\r\nTia,  beautiful and vivacious faces life’s most difficult moments without the love and support of her husband, Jack.

Despite the clash of personalities and styles, all four were key players in a volatile and creative era of hip hop, a time when gangsta rap became popular music.\r\n\r\nBefore he rocketed to fame as Biggie, Christopher Wallace was a young black man growing up in Brooklyn with a loving single mother. An honors student who dropped out of school to sell drugs, Biggie soon discovered that he had a gift for rocking the mike. Coker’s narrative is based on exclusive interviews with Biggie’s family and friends, some of whom have never spoken publicly about Biggie before.\r\n\r\nCompellingly written and brilliantly illustrated, with rare color and black-and-white photographs from VIBE’s archives and Biggie’s family, this is an in-depth look at the life and afterlife of an icon whose music is as powerful and prevalent as ever. A virtuoso of flow as well as a master storyteller, Biggie was arguably the greatest rapper of all time. We’ve heard a lot of speculation about Biggie’s death. Now it’s time to remember his life and celebrate his work.\r\n\r\n  <style type=\"text/css\">\r\n    p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px Verdana}\r\n    p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Verdana; min-height: 12.0px}\r\n    p.p3 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Verdana}\r\n    p.p4 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Verdana; color: #0000ee}\r\n    p.p5 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Verdana; min-height: 15.0px}\r\n  </style>\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Read this book on your computer, tablet,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>smart phone or other mobile devices.</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Available on the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Unbelievable-Afterlife-Notorious-B-I-G-ebook/dp/B0065GBZT8/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362124924&amp;sr=1-1\"><b>Kindle</b></a></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Available on the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/unbelievable-cheo-hodari-coker/1112167491?ean=9781935883609\"><b>Nook</b></a></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Available on the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/unbelievable/id479131196?mt=11\"><b>iBookstore</b></a></p>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n","options":[{"id":30096469,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.95,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94998599/-/BIG_BC_cvr.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94998599/-/BIG_BC_cvr.jpg","width":753,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94998753/-/BIG_3dcover2.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94998753/-/BIG_3dcover2.png","width":903,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":115249,"name":"Cheo Hodari Coker","permalink":"cheo-hodari-coker","url":"/artist/cheo-hodari-coker"}],"categories":[{"id":2685177,"name":"Vibe Books","permalink":"vibe-books","url":"/category/vibe-books"}]},{"id":9619445,"name":"Power of the P ","permalink":"power-of-the-p","position":7,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/power-of-the-p","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-25T00:29:52.000Z","description":"Erotica at its gritty best, Power of the P is the seductive story of an entrepreneur who wields his powerful status in unimaginable — and sometimes unethical — ways.

Street Chic is remarkable”\r\n-Street Literature Review\r\n\r\nStreet Chic is immensely entertaining and shocking… Brilliantly written by Anthony Whyte, author of the Ghetto Girls Series, the most popular series in hip hop lit. A new case comes across the desk of detective Sheryl Street, from the Dade county larceny squad in Miami. Pursuing the investigation she discovers that it threatens to unfold some details of her life she thought was left buried in the Washington Heights area of New York City. Her duties as detective pits her against a family that had emotionally destabilized her. Street ran away from a world she wanted nothing to do with. The murder of a friend brings her back as law and order. Surely as night time follows daylight, Street’s forced into a resolve she cannot walk away from. Loyalty is tested when a deadly choice has to be made. When you read this dark and twisted novel you’ll find out if allegiance to her family wins Street over. A most interesting moral conundrum exists in the dramatic tension that is Street Chic.\r\n\r\n <style type=\"text/css\">\r\n    p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px Verdana}\r\n    p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Verdana; min-height: 12.0px}\r\n    p.p3 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Verdana}\r\n    p.p4 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Verdana; color: #0000ee}\r\n    p.p5 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Verdana; min-height: 15.0px}\r\n  </style>\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Read this book on your computer, tablet,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>smart phone or other mobile devices.</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Available on the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Street-Chic-ebook/dp/B0042RUF84/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362214309&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Street+Chic\"><b>Kindle</b></a></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Available on the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/street-chic-anthony-whyte/1100407006?ean=9781935883111\"><b>Nook</b></a></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Available on the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/street-chic/id392539127?mt=11\"><b>iBookstore</b></a></p>\r\n</body>\r\n","options":[{"id":16297533,"name":"Paperback","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.95,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95043895/-/StreetChic_Cvr.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95043895/-/StreetChic_Cvr.jpg","width":635,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49255653/-/streetchic_sm.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49255653/-/streetchic_sm.png","width":250,"height":366}],"artists":[{"id":95081,"name":"Anthony Whyte","permalink":"anthony-whyte","url":"/artist/anthony-whyte"}],"categories":[{"id":2685167,"name":"Augustus Books","permalink":"augustus-books","url":"/category/augustus-books"},{"id":6307578,"name":"Best Sellers","permalink":"best-sellers","url":"/category/best-sellers"}]},{"id":5016757,"name":"Hard White: On the Streets of New York Only One Color Matters","permalink":"hard-white","position":12,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/hard-white","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-12-06T08:17:40.000Z","description":"The streets are pitch black, but a different shade of darkness has engulfed the north Bronx neighborhood known as Edenwald.

Something evil, something demonic… Something beyond the far reaches of a porn stars mind, bewildering to a well established shrink, leaving an old NYPD detective on the verge of solving a case that has been a dead end for years… This all triggered by Markus Johnson’s desires for a mysterious woman. An infant left at the doorstep of an orphanage, he barely knows who he is. After fleeing his refuge, he was taken in by a couple with a perverse appetite for sexual indiscretions, only to become a star in the porn industry… Markus is seeing a shrink, Dr. Nancy Adler, who is assisting him to unfold a past that contradicts the few things he knows about himself. She’s aided by Gary Zimmerman, a retired detective with a fancy for hypnotism.  Now a private investigator, he gets the case that has been puzzling him for years.

The drama in Booty Call *69 revolves around a promiscuous young woman, Shana, who is so seductive she easily captures any man she glances at. After breaking up with the equally self-indulgent boy-toy, Jakim who is too busy hunting for additional sexual pleasures, Shana finds she’s rapidly falling for his best friend, Tyrone and ignores Jakim’s attempts at reconciliation. A man will do anything when he loves a woman and will try his best to hold on to what he thinks he needs. But does that mean he has to keep going down the road of mistrust? If you love someone set them free and if the love’s meant to be then…  In a hot remix of his Booty Call debut, Erick Gray shows how unconditional love can be and how grimy trusted friends can get in Booty Call *69.\r\n\r\n  <style type=\"text/css\">\r\n    p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px Verdana}\r\n    p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Verdana; min-height: 12.0px}\r\n    p.p3 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Verdana}\r\n    p.p4 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Verdana; color: #0000ee}\r\n    p.p5 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Verdana; min-height: 15.0px}\r\n  </style>\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Read this book on your computer, tablet,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>smart phone or other mobile devices.</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Available on the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Booty-Call-69-ebook/dp/B0042X9QN8/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1362385837&sr=1-1&keywords=Booty+Call+*69\"><b>Kindle</b></a></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Available on the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/booty-call-69-erick-s-gray/1102217028?ean=9781935883098\"><b>Nook</b></a></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Available on the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/booty-call-*69/id392539540?mt=11\"><b>iBookstore</b></a></p>\r\n</body>","options":[{"id":16297887,"name":"Paperback","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.95,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95011167/-/BootyCall69.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95011167/-/BootyCall69.jpg","width":637,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49257277/-/BootyCall_sm.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49257277/-/BootyCall_sm.png","width":250,"height":366}],"artists":[{"id":95089,"name":"Erick S.

Park jams, dance-offs, neighborhood beefs, and graffiti train rides create an exciting new buzz in the neighborhood, until Cash and his best friend Forster begin to merge the exhilarating music scene with hustling on the street. The two young women of the group—both from conventional families with middle class values—are uneasy yet intrigued by the boys' new lives. But Keya has her own worries as a struggling teenage mother, and Dawn is torn between her parents' expectations and her own desire for independence. When Cash becomes a reckless deal maker and abuses his friendship with Forster—upsetting the chemistry of the group—jealousy, competition, and shifting love interests seem inevitable. Finally tragedy strikes, and the characters wait to see whether it signals the end of their friendship.\r\n\r\n  <style type=\"text/css\">\r\n    p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px Verdana}\r\n    p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Verdana; min-height: 12.0px}\r\n    p.p3 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Verdana}\r\n    p.p4 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Verdana; color: #0000ee}\r\n    p.p5 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Verdana; min-height: 15.0px}\r\n  </style>\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Read this book on your computer, tablet,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>smart phone or other mobile devices.</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Available on the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/A-Boogie-Down-Story-ebook/dp/B00ATLAX8E/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362385069&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=A+Boogie+Down+Story\"><b>Kindle</b></a></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Available on the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/boogie-down-story-keisha-seignious/1102216990?ean=9781935883227\"><b>Nook</b></a></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Available on the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/a-boogie-down-story/id586123331?mt=11\"><b>iBookstore</b></a></p>\r\n</body>","options":[{"id":16298041,"name":"Paperback","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.95,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95011639/-/BoogieDownStory.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95011639/-/BoogieDownStory.jpg","width":633,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49257773/-/BoogieDownStory_sm.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49257773/-/BoogieDownStory_sm.png","width":250,"height":366}],"artists":[{"id":95097,"name":"Keisha Seignious","permalink":"keisha-seignious","url":"/artist/keisha-seignious"}],"categories":[{"id":2685167,"name":"Augustus Books","permalink":"augustus-books","url":"/category/augustus-books"}]},{"id":5017423,"name":"It Can Happen In A Minute","permalink":"it-can-happen-in-a-minute","position":27,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/it-can-happen-in-a-minute","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-12-06T09:40:31.000Z","description":"It can happen in a minute is a compelling story of love, deception, secrets, lies and making wrong decisions.

Streetwise, Petie is grinding on the road to infamy.  His throne is toppled and his rule is coming to an end.  He will not be kingpin, but he’s bent on taking his family, his mistress, best friends and fellow hustler through their most traumatic experiences.
