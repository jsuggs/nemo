Ayers found his style by migrating from Jazz's strict discipline to his unmistakable blend of jazz, soul and funk while Kuti created a new musical genre : Afro-Beat by updating African music's sound with American funk (James Brown) influences. Music fans must have frantically anticipated the coming together of the two maestros on this \"Music of Many Colours\" that features the co-produced \"2000, blacks got to be free\" and \"Africa-Centre Of The World\". The music is dashingly brillant : Fela's afro centrist groove completely rejuvenates Ayers' take on American Soul and R&B. You can't help being taken over by the vindicative tone and musical tornado of this LP.

The first half of this set presents the band's hybrid of swinging London grooviness and African jazz, with Fela playing trumpet at least as much as he sings. In 1969, he took the band (renamed Nigeria 70) to Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nThe price of this tee shirt reflects the year the album was released","options":[{"id":9913540,"name":"FELA KUTEE & HIS LOS LOBITOS S","price":19.69,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9915630,"name":"FELA KUTEE & HIS LOS LOBITOS M","price":19.69,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9915631,"name":"FELA KUTEE & HIS LOS LOBITOS L","price":19.69,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27473726/-/lobitos2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27473726/-/lobitos2.jpg","width":768,"height":778}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1682612,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":2838007,"name":"FELA KUTEE 'Zombie'","permalink":"fela-kutee-zombie","position":4,"price":19.77,"default_price":19.77,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fela-kutee-zombie","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-11-03T04:08:08.000Z","description":"In 1977 Fela and the Afrika '70 released the hit album Zombie, a scathing attack on Nigerian soldiers using the zombie metaphor to describe the methods of the Nigerian military.
