Teetering on a precipice of apocalyptic nightmare and candy-coated delight, I AM SONIC RAIN succinctly captures the pathos of a dreamlike state. The band twinkles and thunders unpredictably through moments of sonic brilliance, instrumental violence and serene ecstasy, delivering songs that are emotionally resonant even without words. This dichotomous clash of tone - alternating, constructing and deconstructing both melody and mood with varying levels of hope and despair - results in the heaven and hell of post-rock albums. \"Our music originates from the cobalt blue of metropolitan storms, the grey skies above the plain, the claps of thunder in the night, the stinging tinkle of rain drops, the hush of dense fog. It's a combination of hazy colors and pelting rain that falls violently over people's minds, leading and accompanying them in a sonic journey without breaks\" says pianist Andrea Sara. Bursting with charisma, depth and dynamic complexity, it's cerebral listening...and it cuts deep.
