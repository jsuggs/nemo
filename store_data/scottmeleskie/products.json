Aside from co-owning and operating National Forest Design, he still finds time to work on both commissioned and self-inspired art projects of his own. Influenced by images, fashion and graphics discovered in Time Life Encyclopedias from 1965-1972, thrift stores, and The Moody Blues, his art might be termed contextual objectivism. That is, he views each piece he creates as a tangible object that is part and parcel of a larger context; the object helps define the context and the context helps define the object. Whatever feel or meaning the observer takes away from the piece belongs to the observer. Nothing is shoved down his or her throat. Discovery is the key. Some of his most recent projects include a three board, custom-shaped signature series for Element Skateboards, contributions to the French clothing line Sixpack France, a collaboration with Nike SB, contributions to Arkitip Magazine, a special 3-d piece with Kidrobot, a series of silkscreen prints based on the idea of “connectivity” and most recently, a limited edition print for The Savile. He has exhibited work in Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Berlin, Milan, Barcelona, Tokyo, San Francisco, Chicago, Philadelphia, Montreal, Melbourne and Dallas. </i>","options":[{"id":15687365,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47121985/-/harrinton_print_clean.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47121985/-/harrinton_print_clean.png","width":687,"height":907}],"artists":[{"id":90163,"name":"Steven Harrington","permalink":"steven-harrington","url":"/artist/steven-harrington"}],"categories":[{"id":1898945,"name":"Hang","permalink":"hang","url":"/category/hang"}]}]
