I would assume most of you do exactly what I do; pretend it never happened and don’t even acknowledge the guy.  Now,  I have my reasons for not participating in this gesture of “brotherhood”. Typically when I’m broke down on the side of the road, it’s these asshats that cruise right past me, with their radios on and their feet up like they’re in a lazy boy.  This is the same dude that expects me to wave to him as some sort of sign of brotherhood. Even though he can’t take a minute to stop to see if I’m OK.  Now wait, even though this column is pretty much 99.99% about me, let’s think about the other guy for a second. Do you think he’s hurt that we don’t acknowledge his wave?  Mad even?  What emotions is he going through now that a fellow biker acted as if he didn’t even exist?  Does he immediately put The who, Behind Blue Eyes on his radio and quietly sob into his Paul Sr. mustache?  This could be a terrible thing for this guy, an ego crushing kick to the balls.  But then I think about how I have to push my bike two miles to the nearest gas station because he wouldn’t stop. I instantly feel great about not waving to these chumps. So I would publicly like to say fuck you to every guy on a bike that’s ever passed me when I was broke down on the side of the road.\r\nFTP -

We are a very small organization. Thanks for your patience. \r\n\r\n<em>Classic images of bikers from the 70’s and earlier are a hit among today’s discriminating enthusiasts. And it’s not just a case of looking back through rose colored glasses to motorcycling’s past. Rather it is the natural consequence when popular culture celebrates cartoonish exaggerations, and shuns the genuine.\r\n\r\nDoug Barber’s photos remind us of a time when the bikes, and the people that rode them were the real deal. Thankfully, Doug was there living it; not just as an observer from the outside. This collection of images combined with the words of Sorez the Scribe provides a unique glimpse into our culture’s past. For those that lived, partied and rode during that time it’s a memory book of sorts. For the new generation it represents the path less chosen, inspiration, and a history book of our two- wheeled forefathers.\r\n\r\nLiving the life, it’s good for your soul.</em>\r\n\r\nTodd Ingram\r\nEditorial Director\r\nIron Horse Magazine\r\n\r\nBook will be shipped USPS Media Mail, and usually takes us a few days to ship out.

The most important part of that battle, however, is being able to keep it running. Now this only really applies if you have an old bike that requires routine maintenance. If you have a new Dyna or something it’s really not a major concern. Especially if you have a warranty or some shit like that. So for those of us whose warranty expired over 50 years ago we need to be a little more on our toes. I was in another state, on another coast one time and I watched a hip, big name builder kick his bike for about 10 minutes. Now we’ve all been there and we all know it sucks. It actually really sucks, especially when about 50 people are standing there watching you kick.\r\nBut you gotta have your bike knowledge on point. If I kick one of my bikes more than a certain amount of times I know somethings wrong and automatically start checking shit. That’s because, even though my bikes look like shit, they typically run great. Why do they run great? Because you have to know your bike like the back of your hand. You know what I’m talking about, the starting procedure and shit like that. You may be able to fabricate a motorcycle out of toothpicks and beer cans but can you keep it running properly? Or diagnose and fix a problem on the side of a highway while semis cruise by at 80mph? If not tighten up your game ‘cause if your bike won’t start in front of the bar, you might not get laid. And that’s really what it all boils down to. Keep your bike running right and know its ins and outs or you could miss out that fine piece of tail.\r\nFTP - TW","options":[{"id":36532695,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":7.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/113978958/-/120.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/113978958/-/120.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/113978982/-/121.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/113978982/-/121.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/113979006/-/123.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/113979006/-/123.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/113979018/-/124.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/113979018/-/124.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/113979030/-/125.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/113979030/-/125.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":672781,"name":"Lowside Magazine","permalink":"lowside-magazine","url":"/category/lowside-magazine"},{"id":6510468,"name":"SALE","permalink":"sale","url":"/category/sale"}]},{"id":9365624,"name":"Lowside, Issue 11","permalink":"lowside-issue-11","position":14,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lowside-issue-11","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-07T14:49:34.000Z","description":"So you hold in your hands the new and improved Lowside Magazine. Pretty sweet right? I thought so too. One of the reasons we decided to switch formats was because people always seem to think the mag is free. Like they walk up to our table at events and pick up the mag, then look at us and say thanks as they walk away. So, to me, that always said that our mag seems like a free pamphlet or something.\r\nSo for your reading pleasure we are bumping up our content and mag quality so you have something a little bit more tangible to leave sitting on the back of your toilet. We hope you dig it because we’re putting twice the effort into it and giving you more bikes to drool over.\r\n\r\nThat being said, did you ever notice how awesome the movie Easy Rider is? It’s a super out there movie, but it’s really all about two dudes just riding. There's no club bullshit, no tough guy biker image stuff or anything like that. You actually see them fix stuff that breaks on the bikes. Its about as true to life as it gets. It was always my favorite movie from that era for that reason. I can see myself in their shoes, I can look back on past rides and feel the feelings that movie portrays.\r\nYou really get a positive feeling about a man and his bike, everything else is just a detail or story along the way. As cheesy as it sounds it really shows how free Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper’s characters are, and how the bikes give them that freedom. I mean of course they were running drugs, but that's really a small detail in the story. I guess what I’m trying to say is, Easy Rider rules, do your own thing and don’t get shot in the face by two hillbillies in a truck while you’re riding.\r\n\r\nFTP - TW\r\n\r\n8.5\" x 5.5\" \r\n100 pages\r\nMatte coated cover\r\nGlossy interior pages","options":[{"id":29300537,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":7.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/92844134/-/11cover2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/92844134/-/11cover2.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/92844158/-/11cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/92844158/-/11cover.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/92037278/-/DSC08015.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/92037278/-/DSC08015.JPG","width":1000,"height":664},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/92037302/-/DSC08020.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/92037302/-/DSC08020.JPG","width":1000,"height":664},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/92037392/-/DSC08022.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/92037392/-/DSC08022.JPG","width":1000,"height":664}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":672781,"name":"Lowside Magazine","permalink":"lowside-magazine","url":"/category/lowside-magazine"},{"id":6510468,"name":"SALE","permalink":"sale","url":"/category/sale"}]},{"id":6146649,"name":"Lowside Icon points cover + patch","permalink":"lowside-icon-points-cover-patch","position":15,"price":45.0,"default_price":45.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lowside-icon-points-cover-patch","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-05-09T18:53:46.000Z","description":"1/4\" thick etched Aluminum, for a perfect fit on your Harley. \r\n\r\nPackage includes LS Points cover, Lowside magazine patch & stainless screws (8-32 x 3/4\"). \r\n\r\nEtched interior logo and Polished outside.","options":[{"id":19605565,"name":"Vertical Holes","price":45.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19605567,"name":"Horizontal Holes","price":45.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.75,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.75,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60350559/-/pointsFU2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60350559/-/pointsFU2.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60350535/-/pointsFU.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60350535/-/pointsFU.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60350519/-/points4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60350519/-/points4.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60350655/-/points3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60350655/-/points3.jpg","width":612,"height":612}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3206937,"name":"Parts","permalink":"parts","url":"/category/parts"}]},{"id":9448436,"name":"LOWSIDE by VANSON","permalink":"lowside-by-vanson","position":21,"price":600.0,"default_price":600.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lowside-by-vanson","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-12T16:07:57.000Z","description":"The Lowside jacket, by Vanson Leathers...\r\n\r\nNeed I say more?\r\n\r\nCustom made.

Lots of shitty things have happened, and alot of stuff has been brought into focus. Lately it seems like we really are taking our lives into our hands every time we get on a bike. With Debs accident, Luka’s passing and numerous others that have been injured while doing what they love, it just kind of makes you think. Why are we doing this? Why do we get on these two wheeled machines and make ourselves so vulnerable to bodily harm? I’m sure you can agree with me when I say, theres nothing like getting on your bike and just hitting the road. No matter how shitty things are and how much life is kicking you in the teeth, you can always get on your bike and watch those problems fade into the distance. There really is something therapeutic about every aspect of motorcycles, to me. Whether it be busting my ass in my shed trying to make parts work or going on a two hundred mile ride. They both have the same effect on my state of mind. This could be why I hold motorcycles so close to me, they’re my prozac. There is nothing in a pill or bottle that can make me feel the way motorcycles do. Now I’m not trying to get all hippy on you and shit, but maybe you feel the same way I do. Chances are if you’re reading this you do. I guess what I’m getting at is pretty generic. This motorcycle shit is special, and it seems like people are trying to take it from us every day. Whether it be the teen texting on the highway, the old blue hair in the Cutlass or our own ignorance. Stay vigilant, stay alert. We cant afford to loose or have anymore good people injured doing what we all hold so dear.

I am not nearly as vain as this magazine makes me seem. It’s unfortunate that you had to see my ugly mug so much in the past few issues. It just happens that I was in alot of the pictures our photographers took.  And they happened to be really good pictures on top of it. So don’t think I’m in love with myself or anything, just saying.\r\n\r\nThe other day I was installing a starter on a shovel.  I cant say I’ve fucked with many starters considering most of my bikes are kick only.  So this is kind of foreign territory to me.  Somewhere along the line I broke the flange on the shifter collar.  I was right in the middle of putting the primary together, so this was kind of a big deal.  Now I’d have to order one and wait for it to come in and delay the build even longer.   After sitting around kinda pissed for a while I came up with an idea.  I was gonna grind out the part that broke and weld in a new piece.  Well I did it and it worked, actually looked really good at that.  What’s the moral of this story Tim??? I don’t even really know if there is one, but when you get kicked in the balls by some shit don’t give up cause you might surprise yourself.  The best part about fixing this piece is its hidden inside the primary, I’m the only one who knows about it and I’m totally cool with that.  There’s your moral, do shit for yourself, not because it looks cool or cause it will get you recognized.  Unless it will get you laid, then do the hell out of it just for that!\r\nF.T.P.\r\n\r\nTW\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":19254839,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.7,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.15,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71552883/-/9.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71552883/-/9.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59404881/-/LS_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59404881/-/LS_2.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59404897/-/ls_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59404897/-/ls_3.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59404905/-/LS_6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59404905/-/LS_6.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59404913/-/LS_7.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59404913/-/LS_7.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":672781,"name":"Lowside Magazine","permalink":"lowside-magazine","url":"/category/lowside-magazine"}]},{"id":5410215,"name":"Lowside, Issue 8","permalink":"lowside-issue-8","position":24,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lowside-issue-8","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-06T19:37:21.000Z","description":"EDITORS NOTE:\r\nYou ever wonder what kind of bike Morrissey would ride? I’m sitting here in my office writing articles, when that Morrissey song “Angel, Angel, down we go together” came on. So I couldn’t help but wonder if Moz was into bikes, what would it be? So naturally I Googled “Morrissey Motorcycle”. Sure enough there is a picture of him with a BSA in the background. I suppose I can see him riding a BSA and crooning something about “the more you ignore me”, but that’s really not what I pictured right off the bat. However I certainly don’t see him on any kind of chopper, or Harley for that matter. He would probably be one of those BMW guys, they always seem a little off anyway, and I mean he’s Morrissey so... But if Morrissey would ride a fruity bike, what would Glenn Danzig ride? Glenn would totally ride an evil black Harley, in my thoughts. Unfortunately he would probably ride some horrible wide tire abortion that looks like a skeleton or something. You’re probably wondering what the point of all this is? Should I continue to ramble or just get to the point? OK, fine! My point is, the bike you build/ride is an extension of yourself. You should be proud of your ideas and work because it represents you. I made this tiny master cylinder bracket on a bike I built, I mean it was tiny and insignificant, but I made it and it fit and functioned perfectly. The pride and sense of achievement for that bracket was way more rewarding then just grabbing a stock mount off the shelf. So what I’m saying is, in the words of Morrissey, “Such a little thing makes such a big difference” or was it “You’re the one for me, fatty”? I forget, oh well.\r\n\r\nFTP","options":[{"id":17468145,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.7,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.15,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53936905/-/issue8_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53936905/-/issue8_1.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53937081/-/issue8_5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53937081/-/issue8_5.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53937089/-/issue8_4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53937089/-/issue8_4.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53937097/-/issue8_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53937097/-/issue8_3.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53937105/-/issue8_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53937105/-/issue8_2.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":672781,"name":"Lowside Magazine","permalink":"lowside-magazine","url":"/category/lowside-magazine"}]},{"id":5095357,"name":"Lowside, Issue 7","permalink":"lowside-issue-7","position":25,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lowside-issue-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-12-16T19:52:42.000Z","description":"Ships January 2nd 2012\r\n\r\nPrinted and ready to cut and fold & ship.\r\n\r\nEditors Note:\r\nYou ever hear that song \"Salt Shaker\" by the Yin Yang Twins?  Its a pretty old song, from like the early two thousands or something.  Anyway, in the song, Lil John says something about skeeting so much they call him Billy Ocean.  Now I'm familiar with what skeet is but what the hell does it have to do with Billy Ocean, the Caribbean Queen guy.  Was that like his thing? Or is it purely based on the fact that his last name is Ocean.  Ya know, Ocean, Large body of water/liquid.  Thats really my best guess, but if you can shed any light on this email me your opinion to Tim@lowsidesyn.com.  So recently I built this bike for a dude and man it runs and looks awesome.  One of those bikes that you really wish you had for a daily rider.  But then comes the worst part, letting go.  You ever have that problem?  Its like one of your children after you've put so much time and effort into getting the bike finished.  Then before you know it, the bike is sold and gone out of your life.  I guess its kind of cool to know that something you built is moving on though.  Maybe somewhere along the line, years later, someone will be like \"oh yeah so and so built that bike years ago.  it used to look like this...\"  Or maybe someone will compare you to Billy Ocean in a hot track from the early two  thousands.\r\nFTP\r\nTim","options":[{"id":16535437,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.7,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.15,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50030819/-/issue7.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50030819/-/issue7.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/51438111/-/DSC03138.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/51438111/-/DSC03138.jpg","width":1000,"height":665},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/51438119/-/DSC03147.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/51438119/-/DSC03147.jpg","width":1000,"height":665},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/51438127/-/DSC03148.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/51438127/-/DSC03148.jpg","width":1000,"height":665},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/51438167/-/DSC03150.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/51438167/-/DSC03150.jpg","width":1000,"height":665}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":672781,"name":"Lowside Magazine","permalink":"lowside-magazine","url":"/category/lowside-magazine"}]},{"id":4468101,"name":"Lowside, Issue 6","permalink":"lowside-issue-6","position":26,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lowside-issue-6","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-09-19T19:04:08.000Z","description":"Editors Note\r\nSo one time I was riding on the north bound 95 heading to ride to skate in Philly. I had no idea where I was going, so I was following my gf in a car who had the directions. I was cruising along when I heard some bikes coming up from the rear. When I looked I realized it was a huge pack of 16’s. They all started to give me the thumbs up and head nods. I was pretty stoked, as most people would be when someone of similar interests nods approvingly. Just when my head started to get big I looked forward and rear ended my gf. How embarrassing. This is just proof that whenever your head gets big, something puts you in check to bring you back. I’ve been lucky to meet a lot of people since this magazine started, and the common theme I’m seeing is the lack of ego’s. It really says a lot about some ones character when they can be a internationally recognizable entity and still be a down to earth, genuine person. I recently took a trip to L.A. And met some people who truly fit this description, and really made me feel at home. This is a true testament to the connection between people like “us”. Pretty much all of us started in the same place; a bike, some ideas and a desire to do something different. Nobody is trying to be cool by building a bike, I mean sure it’s inherently cool but you get what I’m saying. I’ve said it in past articles, that its just the desire to be on two wheels that drives us. There’s no concern about social status or being a celebrity of some sort, its all about the ride. This is kind of relative to the punk attitude, I’m sure many of you are familiar with. You can be drinking with a dude one minute and the next minute he’s playing guitar in the band you’re watching. So basically what I’m saying is remember where you started, keep your ego in check and just be cool, it goes a long way.\r\nF.T.P.\r\n\r\nTW\r\n","options":[{"id":14644521,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.7,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.15,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46278325/-/6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46278325/-/6.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/45724835/-/400.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/45724835/-/400.jpg","width":1000,"height":665},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/45724851/-/ladies.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/45724851/-/ladies.jpg","width":1000,"height":665},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/45724867/-/motel.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/45724867/-/motel.jpg","width":1000,"height":665},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/45724883/-/rts.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/45724883/-/rts.jpg","width":1000,"height":665}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":672781,"name":"Lowside Magazine","permalink":"lowside-magazine","url":"/category/lowside-magazine"}]},{"id":4467783,"name":"Lowside, Issue 5","permalink":"lowside-issue-no-5","position":27,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lowside-issue-no-5","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-09-19T18:15:41.000Z","description":"Editors Note\r\nHi, my name is Tim, I ride motorcycles. Does that make me a biker? Who cares if it does? Seems like nowadays a lot of people are overly concerned with the “lifestyle” as it be. Well once again what the fuck is the “lifestyle”? I mean, I ride pretty much daily, I work on bikes at least 4 days a week and I spend just about all my money on motorcycles. So am I a biker? Who gives a fuck, the point is I like to get out and ride. Whether it’s to work, the grocery store or an organized “run” It’s just what I do. I could care less about looking like a biker, or hanging out where bikers hang. It’s never been about that for me, I just want to have fun and live life. I guess the point of my rant this issue is, fuck the details man we are all here for the same reason. I don’t need to copy a page out of a 70’s easy rider or model my attire after a club member to feel secure about what I do. I build my bikes and I ride my bikes, and that’s where it ends.

How awesome is riding? Like really, riding anything is the shit. I will ride anything, anytime I don’t care what it is. Anything with two wheels is fun to me; sport bikes, dirt bikes, mopeds whatever. If anyone asks me if I’d like to ride their bike I’m like “fuck yeah!”. I imagine most people who are into riding are the same way. It doesn’t really matter what it is as long as you’re riding. Don’t get me wrong my heart is in Harley’s and such but its just fun to experience new bikes. Sometimes you have no other option. For instance, I had to sell my triumph a long time ago and ended up with a cheap cb550. Yes I’ll admit it, I rode a Honda but at least I was riding. Plus I sold it for a hundo less than I bought it for, and all I did was beat the shit out of it for a year. I guess the point I’m trying to make by telling you this is; if you love to ride, just fucking do it! Who cares what it is? We can’t all ride barn fresh knuckles, but we can make due with what we have.

We are a very small organization. Thanks for your patience. \r\n\r\nfrom the editor:\r\nEverything is so accessible these days, with the internet and mass media combined there is no hunt involved.  If you want to know everything there is to know about Richard Hell, you can just Wikipedia it and you’re an expert.  This is pretty much true for just about anything, you can read it then know it in a few clicks of your mouse.  But there are a few things that still remain inaccessible.  For example;  of course you can go on YouTube and watch a guy set the points on his iron head.  But can you truly understand how to set your points if you haven’t done it on the side of 95 in the dark with a pocket knife and a business card?  No, not at all, the understanding is completely different.  This is where we set ourselves apart from the masses.  We can’t just pick a bike or a car from the showroom floor and be content with it.  We are tinkerers, artists, craftsman and maniacs.  Having something everyone else has never suited us and it never will.  Why would anyone sit in an 11x17 shed in 10 degree weather just to make a rusty old bike run?  Because pushing a button on a new geezer glide doesn’t give any feeling of achievement.  For anyone who has ever kick started a bike you will understand this feeling.  There is so much to be said about bringing a machine to life by the downward kicking motion of one’s leg.  LowSide magazine has one goal in mind;  relating this feeling to others who can empathize with our sore knees, hurting backs from laying on cold floors and busted knuckles.  We chose a separate path and low side magazine is simply here to document that path with photographs and articles taken and written by people like you and me.\r\n\r\nTim, the Editor\r\n\r\n\r\nShipped USPS First-Class Mail or First-Class Mail International. \r\nUsually ships within 4-5 days of order.","options":[{"id":4013561,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.7,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.15,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46277517/-/1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46277517/-/1.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46275649/-/issue1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46275649/-/issue1.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46275629/-/DSC01656.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46275629/-/DSC01656.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46275637/-/DSC01658.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46275637/-/DSC01658.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41271317/-/Issue_1_5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41271317/-/Issue_1_5.jpg","width":559,"height":559}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":672781,"name":"Lowside Magazine","permalink":"lowside-magazine","url":"/category/lowside-magazine"}]},{"id":1484881,"name":"\"Living the Life\" lito.
