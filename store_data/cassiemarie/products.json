One side has ridges (as shown in the pictures) and the other side is less textural and features large ridges of purl stitch. It is bulky but not too bulky, and I designed it this way so that it could easily fit underneath a coat. It also looks great worn inside over a sweater. You have the option of making this cowl in two lengths. All of the photos show the cowl in the longer length. Lastly, I chose a machine washable acrylic/wool blend yarn that is very affordable for this project.\r\n\r\nSkills Required:\r\n--Knitting in the round.\r\n--Knit and Purl Stitches.\r\n--Cast on and cast off.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT:\r\nThe pattern will come as a PDF file and it will be sent to the e-mail provided to me with your papal payment.   Please make sure your computer can read this type of file. Pattern purchase will not be refunded because of an incompatible file type. Thanks!\r\n--Cassiemarie\r\n","options":[{"id":1216676,"name":"Default","price":3.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2200112/-/cowl4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2200112/-/cowl4.jpg","width":1000,"height":442}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
