It is an AMAZING texture, created to mimic natural blown out hair that has been curled with a curling wand! This texture gives you the lush and thick sassiness of big hair with uniform curls that can be combed out to wild fierceness! This texture is very lightweight, soft and bouncy, with medium lustre. </P>\r\n * We recommend the following: two bundles for a full sew in, 18+ lengths may require 3 bundles depending on desired fullness. If at all preventable, do not cut the weft and make sure to seal your wefts to prevent EXCESSIVE SHEDDING!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span size=\"5\" style=\"font-size: x-large; color: #ff00ff;\"> Maintenance & Care:</span></p>\r\nAll Kinky Curly Type Hair needs maintenance and care.

The lace front wigs have the lace in the forehead of the wig. This will still provide a completely natural look but with the front lace you cannot put it back in a high pony tail. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span size=\"5\" style=\"font-size: x-large; color: #ff00ff;\"> Color </span></p>\r\nOur Virgin hair can be colored or dyed if desired.

This is a great option if you are going to have the hair going back giving a completely natural hairline worn back, down or in a ponytail. The lace front wigs have the lace in the forehead of the wig. This will still provide a completely natural look but with the front lace you cannot put it back in a high pony tail. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span size=\"5\" style=\"font-size: x-large; color: #ff00ff;\"> Straightening</span></p> \r\nWe do NOT advise straightening King Me hair.

This is a great option if you are going to have the hair going back giving a completely natural hairline worn back, down or in a ponytail. The lace front wigs have the lace in the forehead of the wig. This will still provide a completely natural look but with the front lace you cannot put it back in a high pony tail. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span size=\"5\" style=\"font-size: x-large; color: #ff00ff;\"> Straightening</span></p> \r\nWe do NOT advise straightening King Me hair.

This hair comes in its natural color which ranges from Medium Brown to Natural Black. This hair has low lustre with a medium coarse texture. Our wigs are constructed from premium hand selected hair, harvested from a single donor with its cuticles left intact and no chemical alteration. This unit comes UNSTYLED as shown on the mannequin. Each strand of hair is healthy from root to tip. \r\n</p>\r\n<p><span size=\"5\" style=\"font-size: x-large; color: #ff00ff;\"> Difference between a Full lace Wig & Lace Front Wig. </span></p> \r\nA full lace front wig is capable of being parted anywhere on the scalp. This is a great option if you are going to have the hair going back giving a completely natural hairline worn back, down or in a ponytail. The lace front wigs have the lace in the forehead of the wig. This will still provide a completely natural look but with the front lace you cannot put it back in a high pony tail. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span size=\"5\" style=\"font-size: x-large; color: #ff00ff;\"> Straightening</span></p> \r\nKing Me Koarse can be straightened, rolled and twisted for your styling desires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span size=\"5\" style=\"font-size: x-large; color: #ff00ff;\"> Color </span></p>\r\nOur Virgin hair can be colored or dyed if desired.
