Each board is pressed individually in a cold press. This ensures greater accuracy for a more perfect concave. The concave is deep and it provides a strong responsive pop. Seeing as it is made from the best Canadian Maple it can also withstand tremendous abuse. Lots of pop and hard as a rock, I have decided to name this gem, “The Pop Rock.” Available in 7.75\", 8” and 8.5” widths.\r\n\r\n+Handmade in the U.S.A\r\n+Deck Only\r\n+Subtle Screen Print","options":[{"id":45230574,"name":"Instagram Special","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":10590671,"name":"8\" Width","price":34.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30009693/-/poprock_store.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30009693/-/poprock_store.jpg","width":648,"height":792}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":427221,"name":"Longboards","permalink":"longboards","url":"/category/longboards"}]},{"id":3259381,"name":"The Street Sweeper","permalink":"the-soul-surfer","position":2,"price":58.0,"default_price":58.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-soul-surfer","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-02-09T08:43:04.000Z","description":"Modeled after the skateboards of the 60’s and early 70’s, the Street Sweeper is a unique board that is sure to turn heads. This isn't some crappy little piece of plastic. It's a powerful cruiser that pivots sharp and fast around turns and is great for the park, street, or campus. Busting out clean and classic slides or freeriding is certainly within the realm of possibility for the Street Sweeper. Each board is handcrafted from 7 plys of Canadian Maple and is pressed with a medium concave, kick tail, and very subtle nose. Even the board’s rails pay tribute to the yesteryears of skateboarding with flat walls instead of the more modern rounded edges. These flat rails hold up and retain their shape longer than rounded edges and are stronger when exposed to abusive elements like curbs. Just buy it, it's my favorite board.\r\n\r\n+Silk-screened Graphic.\r\n+7 Plys of Canadian Maple.\r\n+Classic craftsmanship.\r\n+Old School & New School Truck Patterns\r\n+32\" L x 8.5\" W\r\n\r\nHardware:\r\n+65mm Orangatang Fat Free wheels 80a\r\n+Gullwing Mission Trucks or Standard 150 mm Longboard Trucks\r\n+Abec 9 Bearings/Spacers\r\n+Jessup grip tape.\r\n+1/4\" Risers\r\n","options":[{"id":45230538,"name":"Instagram Special","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":11088677,"name":"Deck Only","price":58.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":33406384,"name":"Complete (Gullwing trucks)","price":170.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":33406387,"name":"Complete (Standard trucks)","price":160.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31633413/-/soulsurfer_store2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31633413/-/soulsurfer_store2.jpg","width":612,"height":792}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":427221,"name":"Longboards","permalink":"longboards","url":"/category/longboards"}]},{"id":10806300,"name":"The DH Hiro ","permalink":"handplane","position":3,"price":68.0,"default_price":68.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/handplane","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-27T15:11:01.000Z","description":"The DH Hiro is a CNC'd board built for stability and speed.
