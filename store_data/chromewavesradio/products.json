The Keepsies who hail from Brooklyn and are close relations to both Fergus and Geronimo and Parquet Courts, channel that same kind of energy in their three song EP. “I just wanna be dumb and have some fun.” Indeed!\r\n<b>-Left of the Finest Kiss</b>\r\n\r\nIt’s some of the best straight-up pop/rock I’ve heard in a loooong time, inspired by classic 60′s and 70′s sounds and nailing it wholeheartedly.  The title track will totally get you going, and you’ll swoon by the end of the closer “Saturday”.\r\n<b>-Jonathan Schenke (Sound Engineer)</b>\r\n\r\nThe Keepsies are a trio from Brooklyn, NY. Combining elements of 60’s surf-rock, 50’s doo wop, and the best qualities of the more modern catchy and upbeat indie-pop. However, The Keepsies are not just a band stuck in the past. They definitely prove themselves to be a band capable of capturing your heart with “Get Back” ‘s short, but memorable appeal. The thing I love about The Keepsies, and their debut EP, is that they manage to stray from cliche’s, while still keeping it simple. \r\n<b>-Sweet Nothings</b>","options":[{"id":24306033,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75604476/-/The_Keepsies.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75604476/-/The_Keepsies.jpg","width":350,"height":350}],"artists":[{"id":148095,"name":"The Keepsies","permalink":"the-keepsies","url":"/artist/the-keepsies"}],"categories":[{"id":3501285,"name":"LPs","permalink":"lps","url":"/category/lps"}]},{"id":6800291,"name":"Andy Human - FREEZE LP (Vinyl $12 / CD $5)","permalink":"andy-human-freeze","position":3,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/andy-human-freeze","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-26T21:18:45.000Z","description":"<p align=\"justify\">CWR Records presents its debut release from Andy Human, last of the unbelievers...he returns with a collection of glamfully punk songs called FREEZE.

Carpe Diem\r\n\r\n<b>Press:</b>\r\nI feel like my description might be wrong, but disco balls and gutter punks is all Andy Human makes me think of.\r\n<b>-The Daily Choice</b>\r\n\r\n'All of the anarchy, uncertainty, and breakup aftertaste is stuck in-between jangling, up-beat, high energy punk, with a shimmering glam gloss that’s almost euphoric at times. It’s punk in the pop- ish style of The Ramones, sounding like a throwback to a time Human seems to better understand, with more substance between the sugared hooks.' \r\n<b>-Impose Magazine</b>\r\n\r\n'Its full of jagged riffs, synth splatter and even the occasional 60's organ whorl all anchored by Jordan's vocal swagger cut through a hi-fi junk food filter. Its a child of the 80's album in the best regards digesting Devo and Gary Numan through a faded VHS glam punk hangover and knocking the results crisply out of stacked speakers. Chewed vinyl punk in cheap plastic sunglasses, hi-tops and a litter of band pins - in other words a pretty fun couple of sides.'\r\n<b>-Raven Sings The Blues</b> \r\n\r\nFormerly of the Cuts and Time Flys, he makes records under the Lenz moniker and Andy Human these days. The Lenz EP that came out Tic Tac Totally earlier this year is pretty vital and his second Andy Human album just released on Chromewaves Radio records I am going to go ahead and classify as vital as well.  This is Andy Human album number two. Last year’s Red Plastic album on Burger was only a primer. That album sounded like homemade synth laden demos. I think Jordan was kind of feeling his way around and formulating his Andy Human persona. That persona has now reached maturity, or at least punky adolescence.\r\n<b>-The Finest Kiss</b>\r\n\r\nAndy Human is a spastic mix of Jonathan Richman, the golden age of sequined glam, with just a hint of rough around the edges early 80s punk for good measure. At times, Human doesn’t shy from an almost disco feel, the fractured light of a crystalline ball spinning overhead, not that far off. Yet, Human always injects each track with a blast of gritty guitar, or a background of squealing guitar, dragging the songs from the dance floor and in to the darkened, piss-smelling corridor behind the venue. Human pulls off a good trick here, making seemingly happy-go-lucky music that just barely covers a grimy core or something darker, something with a little more grit.\r\n<b>-BandxCity</b>","options":[{"id":25298367,"name":"Vinyl","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21585971,"name":"CD","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":16.75,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":2.0},{"amount_alone":16.75,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66758421/-/FreezeLP-template.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66758421/-/FreezeLP-template.jpg","width":988,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":132667,"name":"Andy Human","permalink":"andy-human","url":"/artist/andy-human"}],"categories":[{"id":3287969,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":3501285,"name":"LPs","permalink":"lps","url":"/category/lps"}]},{"id":8004252,"name":"CHROMEWAVES RADIO Stickers","permalink":"chromewaves-radio-stickers","position":4,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/chromewaves-radio-stickers","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-15T01:22:57.000Z","description":"A stack of 5 CHROMEWAVES RADIO stickers for you to put wherever you want.
