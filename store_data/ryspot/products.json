While the concrete is thin, it is reinforced with glass fibres for added strength.  \r\n\r\nThe chair has been designed with two different base options.  The chair works well as a dining chair or a task chair depending on the configuration of the base.\r\n\r\nThe standard option is with a welded rebar base (as seen with the pink chair) and bare concrete (as seen with the wooden base chair).\r\n\r\nFor the wood base option, please note that the rebar cross braces are hand forged and are individually crafted.  There may be variation in the finish of the rebar.  The wood legs are sealed with tung oil.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to have the chair epoxy coated (top only), contact me first.  I have a wide variety of colours available, but your specific colour may not be available at the time of ordering and may have additional lead time.  The epoxy used is a mildly chemical resistant coating that is designed to withstand aggressive cleaning.  Epoxy coating is suggested for chairs used in high traffic areas.\r\n\r\nPlease allow 2-3 week lead time.","options":[{"id":44919324,"name":"Rebar Base (as seen on the pink chair)","price":750.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44919327,"name":"Wood Base with Rebar Braces","price":900.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":44919330,"name":"Epoxy Coated Seat (Contact Me First)","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":95.0,"amount_with_others":95.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125326281/-/IMG_0850.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125326281/-/IMG_0850.jpg","width":3448,"height":2299},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125326290/-/IMG_0827.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125326290/-/IMG_0827.jpg","width":3591,"height":5386},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125326299/-/IMG_0819.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125326299/-/IMG_0819.jpg","width":5616,"height":3744}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2633381,"name":"Furniture","permalink":"furniture","url":"/category/furniture"},{"id":2633383,"name":"Concrete","permalink":"concrete","url":"/category/concrete"},{"id":2633387,"name":"Design","permalink":"design","url":"/category/design"},{"id":6355689,"name":"Chair","permalink":"chair","url":"/category/chair"}]},{"id":4914611,"name":"Concrete Magnets","permalink":"concrete-magnets","position":2,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/concrete-magnets","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-23T11:14:58.000Z","description":"Give your fridge a more industrial feel.

In Alberta, we often see concrete as an industrial product, used to support the oil industry in many instances. I wanted to take this unlikely material and turn it into a desired object while considering local production and readily available materials. The J5 Table transcends the material by avoiding the flat surfaces and overly robust dimensions that are so commonly associated with concrete. The table also has warmth that one would not usually expect to be associated with concrete. Magnets hold the wooden legs onto the metal rods that poke out the bottom of the concrete. This allows for easy assembly and disassembly by the consumer for use, moving, or end of life cycle recycling. The concrete can also be dyed and the legs could be made from a variety of woods to suit consumers or designer’s needs.\r\n\r\nThe price is for the table with plate glass and sealed hemlock legs.  Sturdy and strong, it should last through most bumps and knocks.  However, tempered glass will be much stronger and is recommended for households with children or pets.  The legs can be stained a variety of colours to match your decor.  Please contact me with your colour choice.\r\n\r\nDue to the handcrafted nature of this piece, please expect a 4-6 week delivery time.","options":[{"id":15903499,"name":"J5 Table","price":450.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15903501,"name":"Tempered Glass","price":525.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":15903503,"name":"Table Legs Stained","price":480.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":80.0,"amount_with_others":75.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47906609/-/avenue-8219.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47906609/-/avenue-8219.jpg","width":912,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53476105/-/avenue-8272.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53476105/-/avenue-8272.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53476129/-/avenue-8264.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53476129/-/avenue-8264.jpg","width":829,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2633381,"name":"Furniture","permalink":"furniture","url":"/category/furniture"},{"id":2633383,"name":"Concrete","permalink":"concrete","url":"/category/concrete"},{"id":2633385,"name":"Table","permalink":"table","url":"/category/table"},{"id":2633387,"name":"Design","permalink":"design","url":"/category/design"}]}]
