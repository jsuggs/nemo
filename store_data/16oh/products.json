Not afraid to take a walk on the demented side these 5 songs still remain white-knuckle gripped to pounding guitar lines in a centrifuge of frantic hc punk sensibilities. Fans of hc punk ranging from Cold Sweat to early Flipper will find an immediate bond with this release from 16oh records. Elements of this s/t effort verge toward straight up pounding hc punk only to turn upon itself in a possessed ferocity as if constantly at war with itself. Any listener duped into feeling this is another straightforward hc release is soon jolted by frenetic unease and palpable agitation that make any moments of ease not only unattainable but unimaginable. Impossible to pigeon-hole but immensely satisfying this is a debut that compels you to re-set the needle as soon as it ends.\" - Richard Boe\r\n\r\nStream the entire record here:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://acidproblem.bandcamp.com/album/acid-problem\">Acid Problem on bandcamp</a>","options":[{"id":21893899,"name":"Blue Vinyl","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":9.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112132530/-/a2684085861_10.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112132530/-/a2684085861_10.jpg","width":892,"height":892}],"artists":[{"id":134431,"name":"Acid Problem","permalink":"acid-problem","url":"/artist/acid-problem"}],"categories":[{"id":2167938,"name":"12\"s","permalink":"12-s","url":"/category/12-s"},{"id":3602505,"name":"16oh Releases","permalink":"16oh-releases","url":"/category/16oh-releases"}]},{"id":4216581,"name":"Neighborhood Threat 7\"","permalink":"neighborhood-threat-7","position":6,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/neighborhood-threat-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-08-07T09:59:32.000Z","description":"Back in stock, SICK SHIT BRO.","options":[{"id":13905171,"name":"Black Vinyl","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112133658/-/R-1818277-1245388225.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112133658/-/R-1818277-1245388225.jpeg","width":250,"height":250}],"artists":[{"id":136281,"name":"Neighborhood Threat","permalink":"neighborhood-threat","url":"/artist/neighborhood-threat"}],"categories":[{"id":2167934,"name":"7\"s","permalink":"7-s","url":"/category/7-s"},{"id":3602505,"name":"16oh Releases","permalink":"16oh-releases","url":"/category/16oh-releases"}]},{"id":3907152,"name":"Slices \"S/T\" 7\"","permalink":"slices-s-t-7","position":7,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/slices-s-t-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-06-12T02:50:34.000Z","description":"One of my favorite modern hardcore records, Slices captured something really special on this record.

Larry's guitar work has only gotten more intense with the addition of occasional frantic punk rock solos throughout the album. Lyrically, the songs lash out at everything from punk scene politics and institutions to co-workers and the city they are from while always remaining firmly in the negative.

Delivering the speed with more precision and adding scathing female vocals as the dominant vocals that trade off with the LP's harsh male vocals, but this outing is set in an all around grimier and darker tone. This is partly from the recording, which, at times, seems at odds in trying to contain the fury. Where the LP could be described as 'metal influenced hardcore,' the metallic influences here are more incorporated into the totality of the guitar-riff blasting and squeal out as intricate bridges and curt solos. Similar to The Awakening, Memento Mori, or other bands that connect the various points between metal, the From Ashes Rise/Tragedy crust sound, and Japanese hardcore.

If punk started as youth culture, this is the sound of youths misspent in skinhead violence and skateboarding, Hawkwind-ish hallucinogens and of summers and winters in vans sleeping on amps. Carving out a niche in the wilderness to keep the fire alive into their mid 30s, this is mania focused by age and experience, never diminished.
