In Texas, this kind of rabble-rousing doesn’t sit well with the status quo, but since the biggest dilemma her students face is whether to eat beef or veggie burgers, she’s been lucky so far. Flying under the radar with her alternative curriculum, Suzie teaches her students about non-violent protests, peaceful rebellion and freedom fighters who employed these methods. But all of that is about to come to an end, thanks to Governor Nick Harry.\r\n\r\nLike the rest of her fellow teachers at Rebel Yell High School, Suzie gets the memo that they’ve all been unceremoniously laid off the week before classes are set to resume for the fall. The Governor has declared war on teachers with his recent round of budget cuts to Texas public schools, effectively cutting their jobs from the register and leaving students in the lurch. With her political ideals on her sleeve, Suzie strikes back at the Governor with everything she’s got. But this time, it’s personal.\r\n\r\nJoining a rebel band of ninjas in their quest to fight the power, Suzie quickly discovers she’s in over her head. Not only does Governor Harry have a secret weapon, but he’s also employed a ship full of pirates to protect him as he launches a campaign for the Presidency! Suzie and the ninjas have to act fast to prevent another Texan from taking the White House, but in the ultimate battle of good versus evil, it’s every ninja for himself.\r\n\r\nCan one woman beat the system, or will Suzie be consigned to the dustbin of state history along with Cesar Chavez and her fellow freedom fighters?","options":[{"id":46819287,"name":"MOBI (for Kindle)","price":2.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46819290,"name":"EPUB (for all other e-readers)","price":2.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.08,"amount_with_others":0.1}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126603831/-/NINJAS-cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126603831/-/NINJAS-cover.jpg","width":1875,"height":2500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6530625,"name":"Ebooks","permalink":"ebooks","url":"/category/ebooks"}]}]
