After the drawing is finished, I brush on a varnish over the drawing which protects it. This process also enhances the drawing.\r\n\r\nI am doing this for a great price, $175. I like to keep my art affordable and accesible to  many people. All you need to do is provide me with a decent head shot of your pet, preferably in natural day light and with a digital camera. This makes for good detail needed to reference for a great pet portrait. Please e-mail me at ktwillsey@gmail.com for inquiry.  \r\n\r\nCheck out my pet portrait portfolio at http://kevinwillsey.blogspot.com/p/bad-cat-portraits.html.\r\n\r\nThanks!","options":[{"id":21736357,"name":"Default","price":175.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67259845/-/rockythealleycatBC.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67259845/-/rockythealleycatBC.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2966229,"name":"Original art","permalink":"original-art","url":"/category/original-art"}]},{"id":5606199,"name":"The Octopus","permalink":"the-octopus","position":2,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-octopus","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-03-03T18:17:11.000Z","description":"\"The Octopus\"  is a  high quality digital pigment print (giclee) on Canson photographique 310 gsm 100% cotton rag paper. \r\n\r\nThe size is 13\" x 14\".","options":[{"id":18040227,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94023803/-/IMG_0877.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94023803/-/IMG_0877.JPG","width":950,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2964127,"name":"Art prints","permalink":"art-prints","url":"/category/art-prints"}]},{"id":6415959,"name":"monkey whistle","permalink":"monkey-whistle","position":3,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/monkey-whistle","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-11T02:07:37.000Z","description":"black pencil and acrylic on paper\r\n17\" x 14\"","options":[{"id":20433833,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/92887370/-/IMG_0867.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/92887370/-/IMG_0867.JPG","width":1000,"height":793}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2966229,"name":"Original art","permalink":"original-art","url":"/category/original-art"}]},{"id":9452096,"name":"Punk rock ","permalink":"punk-rock","position":4,"price":125.0,"default_price":125.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/punk-rock","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-12T19:55:22.000Z","description":"A one of a kind hand drawn and painted skateboard.\r\nBlack pencil and acrylic on paper that is applied on a skateboard.\r\nSize is 8 1/4\" x 32\".\r\n\r\nFor more skateboards by me go to http://kevinwillsey.blogspot.com/p/skateboards.html","options":[{"id":29562653,"name":"Default","price":125.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/92883686/-/IMG_0856.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/92883686/-/IMG_0856.JPG","width":1000,"height":374}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2966289,"name":"Original skateboards","permalink":"original-skateboards","url":"/category/original-skateboards"}]},{"id":5612603,"name":"Octopus skateboard #3","permalink":"octopus-skateboard-3","position":5,"price":125.0,"default_price":125.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/octopus-skateboard-3","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-03-04T19:04:14.000Z","description":"One of a kind hand drawn and painted skateboard.
