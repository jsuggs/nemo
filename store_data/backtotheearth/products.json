This measures about 20\" in length, and is finished off with a matching, hand formed twisted metal clasp. If needed, I can add a few links to make this a bit longer for you.","options":[{"id":1159426,"name":"Default","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2060957/-/losttme_edited-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2060957/-/losttme_edited-1.jpg","width":845,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
