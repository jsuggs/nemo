One of the ways people expressed love was by giving jewelry set with gemstones whose initials spelled a word, like “DEAREST” or “REGARD”.\r\n\r\nFirst, I wove a circle from strands of sterling silver wire. Why did I choose a circle? Circles signify eternity.\r\n\r\nThen I formed roses and leaves, by hand, from sterling silver and 14k goldfill wire, arranging them into a draping garland. The rose garland is bound to the circle with my trademark beaded ribbon.  The ribbon not only winds around the rose garland several times, it actually wraps around the chain!\r\n\r\nThe larger roses, and the leaves, are embellished with gemstone beads whose initials spell “DEAREST”. They are: Diamond (Black), Emerald, Amethyst, Ruby, Emerald, Sapphire, and Tourmaline.\r\nThe pendant portion of “Dearest” hangs suspended from a double chain of sterling silver.\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the photos, the hook clasps are also sculpted and woven by hand of sterling silver wire and 14k goldfill beads.\r\n\r\nLike all my art jewelry, \"Dearest\" was made without solder, without castings, without glue, without torch.\r\n\r\nDimensions: \r\nPendant portion of necklace measures 2 3/4” long by 1 1/4” wide.\r\nNecklace is 20” long.\r\n\r\nNot intended for children under age 12.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that your necklace requires a signature upon delivery, so be sure to have it shipped to a location where you or your representative will physically be.","options":[{"id":50946603,"name":"Default","price":700.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129645132/-/dearestnecklace5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129645132/-/dearestnecklace5.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129645141/-/dearestnecklace3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129645141/-/dearestnecklace3.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129645150/-/dearestnecklace2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129645150/-/dearestnecklace2.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129645162/-/dearestnecklacedetail.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129645162/-/dearestnecklacedetail.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129645168/-/dearestnecklace1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129645168/-/dearestnecklace1.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2790767,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]},{"id":13647600,"name":"Regard Love-Knot-Style Pendant In Sterling Silver and Gemstones #4731","permalink":"regard-love-knot-style-pendant-in-sterling-silver-and-gemstones-4731","position":3,"price":200.0,"default_price":200.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/regard-love-knot-style-pendant-in-sterling-silver-and-gemstones-4731","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-18T19:19:09.000Z","description":"The original “REGARD” pendant, in sculpted sterling silver, and the six gemstones spelling “REGARD”.\r\n\r\n\"REGARD\" is part of my series titled \"Dearest: Interpretations Of Victorian Sentimental Jewelry\".\r\n\r\nI took strands of sterling silver wire and sculpted them into a love-knot shape, weaving in the six classic gems whose first initials spell “REGARD”:\r\n\r\nRuby\r\nEmerald\r\nGarnet\r\nAmethyst\r\nRuby\r\nDiamond (Black)\r\n\r\nThen I contrasted the fine-gauge weaving with graceful sculpture.

Well, this is Blue Mist Agate - it has no banding, just a translucent, periwinkle blue.\r\n\r\nThis particular stone was set into a gold ring setting for many years until I re-purposed it into this show-stopping bracelet.\r\n\r\nI hand-sculpted the sterling silver wire into this baroque-style setting - no solder, no castings, no glue, no heat.  Just sculpture, \"stitched\" together with fine gauge sterling silver wire, and embellished with sterling silver beads and tiny cultured pearls.\r\n\r\nThe bracelet chain is of sterling silver wire also.  The rings are hand-wound by me, then woven together chainmaille-style.\r\n\r\nFinally, the connector and hook clasp are both hand-sculpted by me, embellished with beads.  Please see the photos to see how Samantha Claire clasps on the side.\r\n\r\nSamantha Claire in Blue Mist Agate measures approximately 7 inches around, and is just a shade under an inch wide at the widest point.\r\n\r\nNot intended for children under age 12.\r\n\r\nYour jewelry ships cushioned in a red leatherette box that you'll be proud to present as a gift.
