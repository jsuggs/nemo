The system incorporates an amazingly precise three-dimensional motion capture technology, immediate report capability, and millimeter-specific digitizing tool to provide the most accurate dynamic fitting solution in the industry.\r\n\r\nBicycle fitting is best measured during dynamic pedaling action. Static measurements tell the fitter very little about how the rider's body reacts and interacts in biomechanical motion. The Retul system reads the body in motion, in three dimensions. An observer watching a cyclist while pedaling cannot measure lateral, vertical and horizontal movement. The Retül system eliminates the guesswork and assumptive nature of fitting, providing the fitter with the most accurate data set available in bike fitting.  The result is that the rider will have a true fit to his or her bike, maximizing efficiency and performance while avoiding discomfort or injury.  \r\n\r\nWhat happens during a Retul bike fit? \r\n\r\nAn initial physical assessment of the rider, and address the rider's concerns about performance, pain, or any other issues the rider hopes to alleviate during the bike fit. Once this is completed, the Retül process begins. \r\n\r\nLED markers are strategically placed on eight anatomical points of the rider: the wrist, elbow, shoulder, hip, knee, ankle, heel, and toe.   \r\n\r\nAs the rider pedals, Retul's sensor bar gathers real-time, three-dimensional data of the rider's pedal strokes and movements. The fitter collects data for both sides of the rider. \r\n\r\nThe rider's data is compiled into a reader-friendly report for analysis by the fitter. The fitter can then assess the rider's position and make necessary adjustments.  \r\n\r\nThe Zin, Retul's handheld digitizer, allows the fitter to digitally measure the rider's bike at 13 to 15 points, depending on the bike. The Zin can measure fixed points, contours, and curves, and then provides a complete digital map of the bike.  \r\n\r\nThe fit information is saved and stored on the fitter's computer. The data includes the rider's personal profile, specific data and measurements from the fit, bike measurements, and the rider's final fit position. The fitter will be able to access and print these records for comparison and distribution, and track historical fit data for the client.\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":9528857,"name":"Road Bike","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9529469,"name":"MTB","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9529470,"name":"TT Bike","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9529471,"name":"Track Bike","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26130015/-/retul-certified-logo2.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26130015/-/retul-certified-logo2.gif","width":148,"height":170}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1617202,"name":"Retul Dynamic 3D motion capture fit","permalink":"retul-dynamic-3d-motion-capture-fit","url":"/category/retul-dynamic-3d-motion-capture-fit"}]},{"id":2708485,"name":"Standard Bike Fitting Service ","permalink":"bike-fitting-service","position":3,"price":45.0,"default_price":45.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bike-fitting-service","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-08-19T18:06:49.000Z","description":"This bike fit option uses traditional static bike fit measurements while the rider is seated on the bike plus angle measurements.
