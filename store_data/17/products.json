number, removed even from airplane seats. scenario is ferentino, with its acropolys and megalithic walls, dated 8th century before christ. seven runs, in diseased medieval roads, backturns, riots in the middle of the night, a special secret run, a 5km-long run. adrenaline enough to scream during the entrie downhill. and that 17″skillz skull, laughing happily, from the techno truck transporting the selected 12 runners. all is clandestine. date: unknown. briefing: what briefing? faster skater wins the last classified’ board, plus participants’ money. best decorated skateboard remains immune. such a lean consolation: in the most hardcore downhill of the world, the problem is not to arrive 2nd and lose. the main issue, in ferentino, 392 mt above sea level, is reach the finish
