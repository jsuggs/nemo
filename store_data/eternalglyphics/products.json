A lotus flower fully bloomed and open represents full enlightenment and self-awareness.  The second meaning is purification, resembled by the purifying of the spirit, which is born into murkiness.  The third meaning refers to faithfulness. Those who are working to rise above the muddy waters will need to be faithful followers.

Every organ, gland and body system is connected to a chakra and each chakra is connected to a color vibrational frequency. \r\n\r\nColor & Size Options:\r\n- Red Oak Stain - Approx. 13\" x 13\" x 3/4\"\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n- Finished with a clear polyurethane gloss.\r\n- A Sturdy saw-tooth or D-Ring hanger has been nailed/screwed to the back for easy hanging.\r\n- Colors may vary from what’s shown in photo due to lighting and digital processing.\r\n- Shipping and handling costs vary depending on quantity and location.","options":[{"id":48139848,"name":"Default","price":270.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127633686/-/Chakra_Set_Red_Oak_Stain_LGMD.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127633686/-/Chakra_Set_Red_Oak_Stain_LGMD.jpg","width":688,"height":581},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127591479/-/Chakra_Set_Red_Oak_Stain.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127591479/-/Chakra_Set_Red_Oak_Stain.jpg","width":138,"height":809},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127591503/-/P1010796.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127591503/-/P1010796.jpg","width":480,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127591518/-/P1010828.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127591518/-/P1010828.jpg","width":480,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127591512/-/P1010808.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127591512/-/P1010808.jpg","width":480,"height":640}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6666378,"name":"Chakras","permalink":"chakras","url":"/category/chakras"},{"id":6388419,"name":"Home Decor","permalink":"home-decor","url":"/category/home-decor"},{"id":6388362,"name":"Meditation","permalink":"meditation","url":"/category/meditation"}]},{"id":13525329,"name":"Namaste","permalink":"namaste","position":26,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/namaste","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-12T18:39:27.000Z","description":"Namaste is derived from Sanskrit and is a combination of two words, \"Namaḥ\" and \"te\".

More recently, numerous New Age authors have interpreted it as a yonic symbol and claimed that this, a reference to the female genitals, is a traditional interpretation.  One author claims that the total solar eclipse inspires images of the vesica piscis. The ancient Egyptians practiced sacred geometry based on the shape. Architects and artists copied the solar eclipse/vesica piscis and its mathematics in their sacred buildings and artwork to reflect their religious beliefs.
