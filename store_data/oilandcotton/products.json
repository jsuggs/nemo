A pretty leather strap is added so that the basket can hang from a door knob or hook.","options":[{"id":46485168,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126357210/-/524501_404647669584357_677660539_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126357210/-/524501_404647669584357_677660539_n.jpg","width":960,"height":960},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126357231/-/562007_404647742917683_1288787592_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126357231/-/562007_404647742917683_1288787592_n.jpg","width":960,"height":959},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126357246/-/IMG_3878.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126357246/-/IMG_3878.JPG","width":400,"height":400},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126357255/-/IMG_4641.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126357255/-/IMG_4641.JPG","width":400,"height":400},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126357264/-/IMG_4647.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126357264/-/IMG_4647.JPG","width":400,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1612074,"name":"Workshops","permalink":"workshops","url":"/category/workshops"}]},{"id":12561627,"name":"Jan 17 How Not To Be Intimidated by Poetry Part 4: Form, Informality and Shapeliness","permalink":"how-not-to-be-intimated-by-poetry-part-4-form-informality-and-shapeliness","position":13,"price":40.0,"default_price":40.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/how-not-to-be-intimated-by-poetry-part-4-form-informality-and-shapeliness","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-24T20:16:14.000Z","description":"Friday, January 17, 6:30-9pm\r\nInstructor: Joe Milazzo\r\n\r\nHow Not To Be Intimidated By Poetry (and Perhaps Write Some of Your Own) \r\nPart 4: Form, Informality and Shapeliness\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this beginner-level workshop, we will work together to demystify the various ways in which poets -- and poems -- create an aesthetic experience via careful, imaginative manipulations of language. We will read aloud individual poems by a diverse array of poets and discuss the various elements of poetic expression and how those elements make meaning. We will concentrate especially on the sensual or perceptible rather than cerebral qualities of each poem. \r\n\r\nPart 1:\r\nWe will examine the poem's arrangement or \"body\" on the page.  \r\n\r\nPart 2:\r\nWe will listen for the manner in which the poem sounds itself out, making both noise and music\r\n\r\nPart 3:\r\nWe will reverse engineer those words and phrases that serve as devices for activating images, emotions and ideas within the poem. In \r\n\r\nPart 4: \r\nWe will learn about the poem as a special class of saying, one that offers the reader entry into traditions of communication as well as expression. \r\n\r\nDuring each session, we will apply what we have gleaned from our collective reading to a series of short creative writing exercises designed to encourage further appreciation of poetic language as an artistic medium.\r\n\r\nAbout the instructor: Joe Milazzo is a writer, editor, publisher, educator and designer. He holds an MFA in Writing from the California Institute of the Arts. He has published published poetry, fiction and essays in a wide variety of publications, including The Dallas Morning News, Drunken Boat, The Collagist, Antennae and Black Clock.

This can be done onto watercolor, canvas, or many other surfaces. It is loads of fun, very hands on, and always produces surprising and interesting results.\r\n\r\nAll materials included- film, paper, and a camera to borrow in class.

Bruce, owner of the amazing Webb Gallery in Waxahachie, began collecting and researching Memory jugs 25 years ago, finding the curious crazy textures and tactile qualities alluring.\r\n\r\nMemory Jugs were made in many cultures, but in Victorian times, when amplified mourning traditions took root, they became a folk art phenomenon. Memory jugs were often found in Victorian parlors along side hair weavings in shadow boxes. In African American cemeteries in the Southern United States, examples have been found on graves. Some jugs had a hole made in the jug to render it useless and to \"release the spirit from haunting the jug\" which was then covered with various small articles of a loved one. A memory jug empties Grandpas trinket drawer and elevates the myriad of objects to art for the fireplace mantel. They are objects of sentimentality with the power to evoke memories.\r\n\r\nIn the workshop students will be provided \"borrowed memories\" and will work on a Mason jar. Bruce will provide each student with a mason jar, plaster putty, paint and trinkets and pottery shards for their memory jar. Students are encouraged to bring their own jug or other item they want to cover as well as any memorable items for their jar.\r\n\r\nwww.webbartgallery.com","options":[{"id":47597979,"name":"Default","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127517169/-/Memory_Jug_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127517169/-/Memory_Jug_1.jpg","width":403,"height":403},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127517202/-/Memory_Jug_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127517202/-/Memory_Jug_3.jpg","width":403,"height":403},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127517190/-/Memory_Jug_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127517190/-/Memory_Jug_2.jpg","width":403,"height":403}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1612074,"name":"Workshops","permalink":"workshops","url":"/category/workshops"}]},{"id":10690788,"name":"Fall Age 4-6 Weekly Art Class","permalink":"fall-age-4-6-weekly-art-class","position":28,"price":60.0,"default_price":60.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fall-age-4-6-weekly-art-class","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-22T01:44:44.000Z","description":"Join us for a weekly class this fall.\r\nFall session is now til December 22*.\r\n*no classes held November 26-30.\r\nSTART ANYTIME - Tuition is prorated weekly to reflect the semester length.\r\nInstructors: Shannon Driscoll, June Covington, &  Jessica Sinks\r\n\r\nChoose your day & time in the drop down menu.

Bruce, owner of the amazing Webb Gallery in Waxahachie, began collecting and researching Memory jugs 25 years ago, finding the curious crazy textures and tactile qualities alluring.\r\n\r\nMemory Jugs were made in many cultures, but in Victorian times, when amplified mourning traditions took root, they became a folk art phenomenon. Memory jugs were often found in Victorian parlors along side hair weavings in shadow boxes. In African American cemeteries in the Southern United States, examples have been found on graves. Some jugs had a hole made in the jug to render it useless and to \"release the spirit from haunting the jug\" which was then covered with various small articles of a loved one. A memory jug empties Grandpas trinket drawer and elevates the myriad of objects to art for the fireplace mantel. They are objects of sentimentality with the power to evoke memories.\r\n\r\nIn the workshop students will be provided \"borrowed memories\" and will work on a Mason jar. Bruce will provide each student with a mason jar, plaster putty, paint and trinkets and pottery shards for their memory jar. Students are encouraged to bring their own jug or other item they want to cover as well as any memorable items for their jar.\r\n\r\nwww.webbartgallery.com\r\n","options":[{"id":48716898,"name":"Default","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127988346/-/Memory_Jug_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127988346/-/Memory_Jug_3.jpg","width":403,"height":403},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127988319/-/Memory_Jug_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127988319/-/Memory_Jug_1.jpg","width":403,"height":403},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127988331/-/Memory_Jug_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127988331/-/Memory_Jug_2.jpg","width":403,"height":403}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1612074,"name":"Workshops","permalink":"workshops","url":"/category/workshops"}]},{"id":15007593,"name":"June 21 Small New England Tote (lunch pail)","permalink":"june-21-smalll-new-england-tote-lunch-pail","position":47,"price":65.0,"default_price":65.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/june-21-smalll-new-england-tote-lunch-pail","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-21T18:44:20.000Z","description":"Master weaver Jan Schmidt will take you through the \"ins and outs\" of weaving your very own basket from start to finish.

Needle felting is a popular fiber art that creates felt without the use of water. Special needles that are used in industrial felting machines are used by the artist as a sculpting tool. Notches along the shaft of the needle grab the top layer of fibers and tangle them with the inner layers of fibers as the needle enters the wool. Since these notches face down towards the tip of the needle, they do not pull the fibers out as the needle exits the wool. Once tangled and compressed using the needle, the felt can be strong and used for creating jewelry or sculpture. Using a single needle or a small group of needles (2-5) in a hand-held tool, fine details can be achieved using this technique. Students will leave class with a complete needle felting kit to continue experimenting and and felting at home.\r\n\r\nMaterials included:\r\n-Sponge\r\n-Set of 3 needles\r\n-Wool Roving","options":[{"id":39764334,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124855983/-/Picture_4.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124855983/-/Picture_4.png","width":266,"height":266}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1612074,"name":"Workshops","permalink":"workshops","url":"/category/workshops"}]},{"id":12320475,"name":"Coming soon...Shibori with Lizzy Wetzel","permalink":"aug-4-shibori-with-lizzy-wetzel","position":66,"price":65.0,"default_price":65.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/aug-4-shibori-with-lizzy-wetzel","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-12T01:02:37.000Z","description":"Some Sunday, 11am-2pm\r\nInstructor: Lizzy Wetzel\r\n\r\nShibori is a Japanese term for several methods of dyeing cloth with a pattern by binding, stitching, folding, twisting, compressing it, or capping.

Do you often feel that, as soon as an idea is expressed in words, it loses much of its power and significance? Are you looking for ways to sharpen and more completely organize your thoughts on a subject that really matters to you? If so, you might consider writing a manifesto. In this intensive workshop, we will examine the manifesto as a literary genre, with special emphasis on art manifestos. We will look at some model texts and discuss how these manifestos present their arguments and approach the question of audience. We will also address our attention to a series of exercises designed to facilitate the composition of our own manifestos, with further discussion of specific applications to be made from this experience. (e.g., That artist's statement really giving you trouble? What if your first draft took the form of a manifesto?) Finally, we will stage a public—on the street-corner, complete with megaphone—reading of the manifestos that we have written.\r\n\r\n*BYOB and food. Make an evening out of it, bring a friend and a classroom picnic.\r\n\r\nAbout the instructor: Joe Milazzo is the author of The Terraces (Das Arquibancadas) (Little Red Leaves Textile Series, 2012), and has also published poetry, fiction and essays in a wide variety of publications, including The Dallas Morning News, The Collagist, H_NGM_N, Vinyl Poetry, and Black Clock.

We will discuss essential techniques like creating variegated washes and full-bodied strokes, the hallmarks of watercolor, to simply define complex shapes and objects from reality.  You will learn to use one large brush exclusively for a range of strokes both large and small, and how to mix color with the knowledge of pigment types and complex color theory.  \r\n\r\nWe will cover methods for achieving structure in your paintings by combining pencil and ink with the fluid energy of watercolor.  Still lifes composed with ordinary and unusual objects will stimulate our artwork, while fascinating history about pigments and their use today will complement our studio time.\r\n\r\nA supply list will be given at the first class. Absolute beginners kits ($100) as well as supplemental supplies will be available at a student discount in our shop. The recommended supply list is composed of a careful selection of brushes and pigment rich, artist-quality paints instead of student-grade supplies.\r\n\r\nPayment plans are available based on financial need.\r\n\r\nThis class is limited to 8 students, please register in advance.\r\n\r\nInstructor: Kyle Hobratschk\r\nwww.kylehobratschk.com","options":[{"id":14183509,"name":"Default","price":160.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/42145775/-/WC.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/42145775/-/WC.jpg","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/42144559/-/wc.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/42144559/-/wc.jpg","width":276,"height":276},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/42193445/-/-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/42193445/-/-2.jpg","width":571,"height":571},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/42193527/-/radicchio-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/42193527/-/radicchio-2.jpg","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/42193487/-/-3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/42193487/-/-3.jpg","width":536,"height":536}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1612074,"name":"Workshops","permalink":"workshops","url":"/category/workshops"}]}]
