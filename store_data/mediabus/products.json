Although the images were taken very far apart from each other in time, they seem to form a seamless dream-like narrative. Glance is about looking into both the past and the future at the same time, and ending up somewhere in between. Printed on large, unbound tabloid sheets--the zine can be taken apart to form a series of posters with the images carefully reconfigured by the artist.\" (written by Jesscia Wiiliams)\r\n\r\nArtist's Zine by Jessica Williams (USA)\r\nEdition of 200, 16 pp, Offset Printing (Color)\r\nPublished Sep.24, 2009\r\nDesign Assistant Oh Kyungseok\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.paperheart.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.paperheart.org</a> ","options":[{"id":2501461,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/5729601/-/Glance_resized_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/5729601/-/Glance_resized_cover.jpg","width":400,"height":589}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":228691,"name":"Zines","permalink":"zines","url":"/category/zines"}]},{"id":645681,"name":"D.I.Y.
