Both sculptural elements of this artwork were made using profesional materials and techniques.\r\n\r\nThe Kraken is made of a stone like material (I do not use pollymer clay),\r\nthat is firmly attached to the glassware. After the sculpting, it is hand-painted \r\nand gloss finished.\r\n\r\nThe Shell is some of the mosy buttery lushious glass I have worked on \r\nand the sentious shape is the perfect home for a baby Kraken.\r\n\r\nThis tropical sculpture makes an interesting conversation piece,\r\nplace it to catch the light from a nearby window and bring some \r\nof the seas wonder into your home.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout:\r\nOceans Song, Dreams of Tonga, Kraken: \r\n\r\nThis Tonganise Kraken is a member of the Silky Kraken species, \r\nand a very young one to be sure.\r\nThe Silkys are unique among Kraken kind for several reasons.... \r\nOf course they are as venomous as the Basaltys, but they are \r\nexceptionally mean tempered and sneaky, they are borne escape artists \r\nand have been known to hord objects they are fond of. \r\nThis one has found a treasure he would not be parted from.\r\n\r\nThe Tonga Kraken was captured on Eua Island, here was washed up into the shallows, \r\nwhere the lack of pressure makes even the mightiest of Krakens lethargic.\r\n\r\nAlthough it as yet unconfirmed, it is believed that the Silky Krakens thrive an area near the middle of the Pacific Ocean, \r\nAt the crushing depths of up to 33,000 feet, one of the deepest parts of the sea floor known as the Tonga Trench. \r\nUpwellings from deep have been known to disloge some juvinal Kraken from there abyssal nursery and deposite them onto these secluded beaches.\r\n\r\n\r\nSize: 4 inches tall by 10 1/2 inches wide. \r\nWeight: 1 lb 15 oz. \r\n\r\nKraken Color: White \r\nThe Eyes: are Aquamarine Crystal.\r\n\r\nGlass Color: Clear and swirled Aquamarine. The color will not come off. It is the color of the glass not a coating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKraken Lore: \r\n\r\nIn a time when the gods still walked the earth a child was born to Tethys and Poseidon. \r\nThis was the Kraken - guardian of all the world's oceans and terror to all who traveled upon them.\r\n\r\nThe Kraken was once mated to his half-sister after Zeus' anger had changed her \r\ninto a monster in the form of a whirlpool with a gaping maw of teeth. \r\nHer name was Kharybdis, a beautiful naiad and daughter of Gæa and Poseidon.\r\n\r\nKharybdis would be forever carrying the Kraken`s offspring within her. \r\nShe releases her brood at the height of each full moon. \r\nCasting them forth onto all the world's oceans and giving rise to the legends and lore among early mariners.\r\n\r\nThese mysterious hatch lings inhabit the deep oceanic trenches and perpetually turbulent waters of the world. \r\nThankfully, they are born without the ability to breed and take centuries to mature into smaller versions of their father. \r\nOn the longest of years, Mother Kharbydis has daughters (who take after her).\r\n\r\nThe legends tell us that they are fearsome and appear with little warning out of the deep, \r\nvoraciously devouring the most seaworthy vessels with ease. Occasionally, leaving a rare survivor to tell the tale. \r\nby Stevie Pagano.\r\n\r\n© copyright Stevie Pagano / Elstwhen 2013\r\nElstwhen, 2013.\r\nPhotographs and Lore by Stevie Pagano.\r\n\r\nAbout Elstwhen: http://www.etsy.com/shop/Elstwhen/about?ref=announce\r\n\r\nElstwhen on Facebook for pre views and updates.\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Elstwhen/188873717811093\r\n\r\nElstwhen on Tumbler http://elstwhen.tumblr.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShipping: \r\nI take great care in packing my glassware to ensure safe transit.\r\nIf you intend to order more than one glassware, \r\nplease contact me and I will see if your order can be packaged together to save on shipping\r\n\r\nDomestic Shipping: \r\nInsurance and Delivery Confirmation included, USPS Priority Mail.\r\n\r\nInternational Shipping:\r\nInsurance and Customs Number is available with International Mail from USPS.\r\nIf your shipping destination is not listed, please contact me with your postal zip code and I will add it for you.
