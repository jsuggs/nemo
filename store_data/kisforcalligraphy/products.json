Neurotic about details, I carefully cut out the name of the bird and adhered this to the bird image then re-cut & trimmed the bird itself. Using an 'older than me' Singer sewing machine, I zig-zag stitched a piece of deckle-edged jet-black fine art paper to the front of the card. Next the little collaged bird is centered and permanently stuck to the card. (I ♥ STICKERS) Using a pointed nib pen and black waterproof Sumi ink, I hand lettered the name of the bird and added my signature calligraphic flourishes. Each card is one-of-a-kind and will probably never be made again (unless of course I happen to come across the same encyclopedia set)!\r\n\r\nthank you!","options":[{"id":9322996,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25418272/-/oil_spill_cleanup_0023.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25418272/-/oil_spill_cleanup_0023.JPG","width":1000,"height":970}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3288677,"name":"calligraphy cards","permalink":"calligraphy-cards","url":"/category/calligraphy-cards"}]},{"id":2652641,"name":"Special Tweet Birds (three cards: Spoonbill, Lapwings, Shoveler)","permalink":"special-tweet-birds-three-cards-oil-spill-item","position":2,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/special-tweet-birds-three-cards-oil-spill-item","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-07-12T08:24:29.000Z","description":"{SWEET TWEET CARD DETAILS}\r\n♥ 3 cards; 3 envelopes\r\n♥ Shore birds: Spoonbill, Lapwings, Shoveler\r\n♥ teal, turquoise and mint green stitching\r\n♥ blank inside\r\n♥ Italian paper milled by C.M.

And more importantly, a style inspired by the work of the eighteenth century master penman himself, George Bickham.\r\n*look for more lettering styles in the drop down options below. Links to the my lettering styles provided below too!\r\n\r\n{the turnaround time}\r\nI will need approx. 14 days (starting after I receive the envelopes and guest list and after the samples are approved) to complete an envelope addressing project.\r\n\r\n{the initial process}\r\nOnce I receive the envelopes, I will work with you to create sample envelopes. We will work together to confirm the color of ink, address layout and your choice of zip-code flourish (my signature mark, not required but highly advised)\r\n\r\n{the important people}\r\nGuest lists may be emailed to me in the following formats: word doc, excel, pdf. (Guest lists do not have to be 100% complete; I prefer you email me the addresses you have first and in the mean time you can work on the incomplete addresses and email those to me soon thereafter)\r\n\r\n{the EXTREMELY IMPORTANT thing to do when ordering your invitations}\r\nIf possible, PLEASE order 20% extra envelopes. This is really really really important! It saves a lot of time and money in the end.

This fee covers all the preparation time which is often overlooked including custom ink mixing, providing samples, pencil lines for centering if working with darker envelopes, erasing the pencil lines, spraying the envelopes with protective spray if required and so much more.\r\n\r\n{THIS IS THE DEPOSIT}\r\nBy purchasing, you are paying for a non-refundable deposit which will be deducted from your final custom invoice. You are also reserving your spot in my calligraphy schedule which is exciting and fun for both you and me!\r\n\r\n{upon purchasing, you will receive}\r\nAfter you purchase this deposit, I will email you 2 pdf files with important information including where to send your envelopes, tips for formatting and submitting your guest address list, a simple tips and reminder sheet for wedding invitations and more!\r\n\r\nCongratulations to the Bride and Groom!\r\n\r\nLettering Styles (choose from the drop down options and add the option you want to your cart)\r\nBend it like Bickham http://www.flickr.com/photos/kisforcalligraphy/2278377866/\r\nBrickle Paw http://www.flickr.com/photos/kisforcalligraphy/2072645539/\r\nNG characters http://www.flickr.com/photos/kisforcalligraphy/2073435586/\r\nAvalon Par 9 http://www.flickr.com/photos/kisforcalligraphy/2072643131/\r\nCT Fine Hand http://www.flickr.com/photos/kisforcalligraphy/2073436128/\r\nTaracotta http://www.flickr.com/photos/kisforcalligraphy/2073433842/\r\niamink pentalic http://www.flickr.com/photos/kisforcalligraphy/2072640547/\r\nRevolution No. 9 http://www.flickr.com/photos/kisforcalligraphy/2073433610/","options":[{"id":7098841,"name":"Bend it like Bickham","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7098971,"name":"Brickle Paw","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7098981,"name":"NG characters","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7098991,"name":"Avalon Par 9","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7099001,"name":"CT Fine Hand","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7285731,"name":"Taracotta","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7285751,"name":"iamink pentalic","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7285781,"name":"Revolution No. 9","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/18676721/-/toga_USA_envel_0017.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/18676721/-/toga_USA_envel_0017.JPG","width":1000,"height":986}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1198901,"name":"custom calligraphy","permalink":"custom-calligraphy","url":"/category/custom-calligraphy"}]},{"id":1950611,"name":"Dainty Mushroom Gift Tags","permalink":"dainty-mushroom-gift-tags","position":5,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dainty-mushroom-gift-tags","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-03-14T06:46:20.000Z","description":"♥ Set of 10 hand stamped gift tags\r\n♥ Image is of a dainty field of mushrooms stamped in a earthy pine cone brown color fade-resistant pigment ink\r\n♥ bottom edges have been rounded for a softer look\r\n♥ Each manila tag measures approx. 2 3/8\" x 3 1/2\"\r\n♥ strung with cute and lovely pink, mocha and cream yarn to attach to whatever your heart desires!\r\n♥ packaged as a set in a resealable cellophane bag\r\n\r\nCheck out www.KisforCalligraphy.etsy.com for more paper goodies!","options":[{"id":7098571,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.4,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.4}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/18675761/-/gifttags_fungi_0002.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/18675761/-/gifttags_fungi_0002.JPG","width":1000,"height":992}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1193571,"name":"gift tags","permalink":"gift-tags","url":"/category/gift-tags"}]}]
