Cue an angel voiced grotesque, a mystery solving teen gang, a schoolboy DJ haunted by robots, Nazi-punk-zombies and more. \r\n\r\nHitsville UK is a stained love-letter to the weirder corners of pop music. The best, though possibly the only, musical-pop-art-soap-opera in comic book form. \r\n\r\nEach page is a rush of playful artwork, shifting styles fast and loose to match each genre of music, with the jokes coming quick and sharp. Full of sly digs and references to musical genres past and present Hitsville appeals to music obsessives as much as comic fans. \r\n\r\n<i>“A bloody great accumulation of inspired madness, musical insanity and general chaos… a pure, unadulterated hit of a comic”</i>\r\n-<b>Richard Bruton - Forbidden Planet International</b>\r\n\r\n<i>“A perfect three minute chemical-infused rush of a comic”</i>\r\n–<b> Comic Heroes magazine</b>\r\n\r\n36 pages, full colour. \r\nSecond Printing - July 2013\r\nISSN 2052-8639","options":[{"id":39032013,"name":"Default","price":0.69,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121662840/-/hitsville-digital-cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121662840/-/hitsville-digital-cover.jpg","width":450,"height":689},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121662519/-/HitsvilleUk1-digital-17.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121662519/-/HitsvilleUk1-digital-17.jpg","width":600,"height":919},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121662531/-/HitsvilleUk1-digital-29.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121662531/-/HitsvilleUk1-digital-29.jpg","width":600,"height":919}],"artists":[{"id":220362,"name":"Dan Cox","permalink":"dan-cox","url":"/artist/dan-cox"},{"id":220359,"name":"John Riordan","permalink":"john-riordan","url":"/artist/john-riordan"}],"categories":[{"id":3127937,"name":"Digital Comics","permalink":"digital-comics","url":"/category/digital-comics"}]},{"id":12528528,"name":"Hitsville Prints","permalink":"hitsville-prints","position":16,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/hitsville-prints","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-23T09:51:05.000Z","description":"Print specs:\r\n210 x 297 mm\r\nDigital print on Somerset Enhanced Archival paper\r\nSigned by the artist","options":[{"id":39821304,"name":"The Carrie Nation's Revenge","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39821307,"name":"Gwillum","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39821862,"name":"Men Behind Guitars","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39821865,"name":"The Dreadnoughts","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39821868,"name":"Haunted By Robots","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39821871,"name":"Jack Spatz","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121744812/-/CNR.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121744812/-/CNR.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121744815/-/bc03x3.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121744815/-/bc03x3.png","width":600,"height":896},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121744896/-/bc02x3.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121744896/-/bc02x3.png","width":600,"height":896}],"artists":[{"id":220359,"name":"John Riordan","permalink":"john-riordan","url":"/artist/john-riordan"}],"categories":[{"id":5829183,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":11715123,"name":"Winter's Knight: Day One","permalink":"winter-s-knight-day-one","position":17,"price":5.99,"default_price":5.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/winter-s-knight-day-one","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-11T10:44:26.000Z","description":"Winter’s Knight is a wordless tale of an old Knight on a mysterious personal quest through an icy wilderness encountering nightmarish battles with the dark things in the forest and much, much worse.
