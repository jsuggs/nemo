Drawing inspiration from all corners of the punk spectrum, <b>No Sir, I Won’t</b> is able to create a wholly unique and refreshing sound not often heard in today’s punk scene. Comprised of 6 songs, and clocking in at over 20 minutes in length, <i>The Door</i> is a dynamic album that mixes the anger of Conflict with the melody of early Chumbawamba.

Drawing on the insular spirit of Arthur Russell’s bedroom productions and the haunted folk poetry of acts like Will Oldham, Mount Eerie or Neil Young’s darkest hours, Thomas melds subtle acoustic structures with waves of buzzing guitar tones and ghostly vocals. The album collects 17 astral pop gems that rival the greatest of his previous offerings and we’re left with a work that truly sets him apart from his indie folk/pop colleagues.

Mixing Crucifix, Deathreat, and driving Japanese hardcore, Brain Killer have made their most powerful and mature EP yet. Really it just sounds like a hardcore Discharge, but what else would you want? The best song writing; distilling riffs into simpleness with no filler.
