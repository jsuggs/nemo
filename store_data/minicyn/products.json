It's much stronger in french then it is in English as the 'coup' is translated literally as 'blow' or 'shock', and 'coeur' is simply one's heart.\r\n\r\nRead about it's journey in my Blog: minicyn.blogspot.fr\r\n\r\nThis little 3D heart/love brooch is hand fabricated from 2 droplet shape, made from SOLID square silver wire. One drop is soldered vertically against the other which lies flat against one's fabric. When it's viewed on one angle it looks first like a droplet but take another look...it's heart.\r\n\r\nThe size of the brooch is small to recreate the special and preciousness of our love. Please check the size; 1.7cm deep measured at it's longest and 1.5cm wide(as a whole at it's wides).\r\n\r\nThe pin at the back is made this way so it attaches securely, unlike pins where it does on occasion falls off by itself. These were handmade by minicyn.\r\n\r\nThank you for your visit!

You'll receive one just as similar as this sample pictured.\r\n\r\nI've always loved Rose cut diamonds but now they're back in fashion hence these stones are readily more available, so here we are! In fact, various forms of rose cut have been around since the mid 16th cent. usually for diamonds. A basic rose cut has a flat base like this one with great clarity (no pavilion) and a crown composed of triangular facets in symmetrical arrangement, which rise to form a point like this.\r\n\r\nThe diamond feature pendant is also accompanied by 2 dainty charms; one with 3 fronds – 2 which are made of solid 14kt gold/rose gold and one other of solid silver. And lastly a silver disc charm hand-stamped using a french vintage steel stamp from my antique tool collection.\r\n\r\nThe feature pendant itself has a shiny finish with some tiny specks of texture reminiscent of the wear and tear of nature's ups and down's – also reflecting light at the same time giving you the impression of sparkles. Another unique feature is near the clasp – a hand-twisted wand which makes clasping blindly much easier, see montage pic for details..\r\n\r\nMeasurements:\r\n• width of pendant with white diamond is roughly 5.5mm, diamond itself is about 2.3mm\r\n• leaf charm is roughly 0.5cm\r\n• length of solid silver chain 16.5inch long.","options":[{"id":35984835,"name":"default","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":105,"name":"France, Metropolitan","code":"FX"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112403322/-/il_fullxfull.421555765_pxt3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112403322/-/il_fullxfull.421555765_pxt3.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112403310/-/il_fullxfull.421552184_rib6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112403310/-/il_fullxfull.421552184_rib6.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112403346/-/il_fullxfull.421555827_fptb.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112403346/-/il_fullxfull.421555827_fptb.jpg","width":930,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":203601,"name":"Classics","permalink":"classics","url":"/artist/classics"}],"categories":[{"id":321507,"name":"necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]},{"id":11232399,"name":"Mystical orient leaf earrings with drops of 14kt gold","permalink":"mystical-orient-leaf-earrings-with-drops-of-14kt-gold","position":14,"price":52.0,"default_price":52.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mystical-orient-leaf-earrings-with-drops-of-14kt-gold","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-18T14:25:55.000Z","description":"Simple, classic everyday wear.
