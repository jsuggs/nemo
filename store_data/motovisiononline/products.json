Introducing the <span class=\"caps\">EVS RC</span>-EVOLUTION race collar system. Providing the ultimate in neck protection, the RC-EVOLUTION has been designed from its inception with the assistance of top orthopedic professionals to reduce neck compression and extension related injuries (the cause of serious spinal chord damage). The RC- <span class=\"caps\">EVOLUTION</span> has a customizable ergonomic fit that works with the rider to ensure comfort and maximum impact protection. Reducing overall weight and bulk, the vented design allows air to move freely through it, helping to keep you cool.\n\n\tWhy does the <span class=\"caps\">EVS RC</span>-EVO do this better than other braces out there? The <span class=\"caps\">EVS RC</span>-EVO offers more effective load transfer to the shoulders, and deals with filling the space between helmet and shoulders more effectively than other devices. It avoids putting unnecessary pressures on the upper body in otherwise benign crashes. Other plusses are the better simplicity of use, the way-easier adjustability, the lower weight, lower bulk (oh, yeah!), and: it works with <span class=\"caps\">OUR</span> roost guards, but also with anybody else’s. And did we mention that it looks like a piece of high-tech art, moto jewelry, eye-candy. Stay in one piece, but in comfort and in style.
