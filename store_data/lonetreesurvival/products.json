The designers at Aquamira have come up with the ultimate pump free filter system. We told our designers that there was something missing when it came to portable filtration devices. We wanted a small, compact, easy to use, filter that would compete with the “big boys.” No pumps or tangly hoses to mess with, we just wanted the cleanest, easiest, most compact system in the world. With this in mind our designers considered multiple uses, the prevention of cross contamination, size, weight, ease of use, extended filter life, universal connectivity, as well as “hands free” gravity flow capability in the development of the Frontier Pro filter system. The result is a new concept in ultra-light, compact portable filtration that fits in the palm of your hand. Which is why we say “Dump the Pump!”\r\nConnect to almost anything, using the universal connectivity system. The Frontier Pro filter will connect directly to any water bottle with a 28mm opening such as a Platypus® or standard spring water bottle. Using the tube connection feature you can connect to the drink tube of your hydration system, or drink from any open container or water source. Since you drink directly from the unit there is no chance of confusing inlet and outlet tubes resulting in possible cross contamination.

Mykel first used his expertise to help create his critically acclaimed \"Hawke Hellion\" for TOPS knives. It was this positive experience that prompted Mykel to begin thinking of new designs for differing applications. The Harrier, though very large, is still considered a pocket knife design. It's a folder that carries with it one very unique feature: flip-out finger guards. These guards, though reminiscent of safety mechanisms used on swords for centuries, are an all-original take on an age-old invention. These guards are strategically placed near the pivot point of the knife and are able to be rotated upward and outward a full 90 degrees so that they may act as a safety stop for the user's potentially fatigued hands. This design is patented by Mykel himself...so don't expect to see this innovation anywhere else.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n• AUS-8 Stainless Steel Blade \r\n• Thumbstud\r\n• Flipout® finger guard\r\n• G-10 Handle Scales\t\r\n• Lanyard Hole\r\n• 5 1/4” Blade\r\n• 6 1/4” Closed","options":[{"id":37995507,"name":"Default","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/118282086/-/harrier_hawke.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/118282086/-/harrier_hawke.jpg","width":400,"height":400},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/118281006/-/hh_endview_lg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/118281006/-/hh_endview_lg.jpg","width":800,"height":275},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/118281054/-/hh_sideview_lg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/118281054/-/hh_sideview_lg.jpg","width":800,"height":316},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/118281066/-/hh_spineview_lg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/118281066/-/hh_spineview_lg.jpg","width":800,"height":180}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5627208,"name":"Knives","permalink":"knives","url":"/category/knives"}]}]
