I won’t sell a graph without first testing it.\r\n\r\nMore graphs are being added all the time, so be sure to check back!\r\n\r\nYou have permission to sell finished items made from my patterns! If you sell online, please link back to my shop:\r\nOriginal Design by Liz from Playin’ Hooky Designs & Kimberly from Oikos Handmade\r\n\r\nPattern is written in standard US crochet terms.
