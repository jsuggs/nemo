of the late 80s and into the 90s. The band released two albums on the Words Of Warning label, and various single releases throughout that period. “GRAVEYARD OF DREAMS” is a compilation of those singles, originally released by Boss Tuneage back in 2003, the CD has been unavailable commercially for almost a decade. After many requests for a repressing over the past few years, it is now finally made available again with re-done artwork as part of the Boss Tuneage Retro series, and ties in with reissues of the two TERMINUS albums planned for early 2014.\r\n</div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nCD<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n\r\n1.Star Born Thing     \r\n2.Purge     \r\n3.Kill

shake their pasts. Well, The Dead On embrace their previous musical lives and set out to shake the rafters instead. Formed from Chicago stalwart greats Woolworthy and The Reputation, The Dead On embody modern rock n roll with big, dirty guitar hooks, snotty slash and burn riffs and ultra catchy melodies. They are on a mission to make great Rock N Roll and to make Rock N Roll great again. The debut album by The Dead On will knock you out and then hold your hand and make it all better. Guitar riffs catchy enough to work their way into your pleasure spot; all done with heart-pounding energy – like an 80s post punk band crossed with the Stones/Thin Lizzy and then transported to the present, THE DEAD ON are on target with this debut!\r\n\r\n</div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nCD<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n\r\n1.

STOCK NOW! STRICTLY LIMITED TO 300 COPIES!**\r\n\r\nABOUT:\r\n\r\n“Subconscious Release” was the solitary album by DESECRATOR, and was originally released in January 1991. Since that time it has become somewhat of an old school death metal gem – the original vinyl album commands a high second hand price and is highly sought after, as it was only originally pressed in a small limited amount. This is a shining example of early UK Death Metal, with a style similar to somewhere between early DEATH, AUTOPSY and PARADISE LOST. Now more than two decades on, “Subconscious Release” is made available again as part of the series of classic late 80s/early 90s metal reissues by Mosh Tuneage, \r\nFolloowing on from last years CD reissue,  this is a must own for all fans of the death genre - a limited eidion dark blue vinyl LP with printed insert and heavyweight sleeve, limited to just 300 copies, released in conjunction with At War With False Noise\r\n\r\nFORMAT: Ltd Edition Coloured Vinyl LP\r\n\r\nTRACKLIST:\r\n\r\nA1.

LP/CD, BUT \"TORONTO\" IS EXCLUSIVELY ON VINYL ON THIS 7\" RELEASE!\r\n \r\nHDQ need little introduction to anyone who knows anything about UK punk rock. The hugely successful band from Sunderland were one of the leading lights of the late 80s hardcore punk scene and one of the first to openly be influenced by the melodic sounds of the mid 80s American hardcore punk bands. After numerous tours and the release of three critically acclaimed albums, two Peel Sessions, plus seven inch and twelve inch singles, 75% of the band went on with Frankie Stubbs to form LEATHERFACE and have even more success over the years. Now, David Golledge (Vocals), Dickie Hammond (Guitar) and Andrew Laing (Drums) from the classic “You Suck” era of the band, have reunited with Mick Jones (guitar) and Dean Liddle (bass) to record the first new HDQ material in 23 years – and “Hand Me Downs” does not disappoint, and acts as a great taster for the new HDQ album due on Boss Tuneage later this year.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\nA1.

underground punk scene. Taking influence from the likes of LEATHERFACE, BROCCOLI, MEGA CITY 4 and DRIVE the band soon developed their trademarked sound - referred lovingly to as “Oimo” - and released a 7”, mini CD and album on Boss Tuneage between 1999-2003 plus a couple of split 7” on other labels inc Snuffy Smile and Waterslide in Japan - as well as embarking on many gigs and tours , including Japan, North America and two excursions around Europe with STRIKE ANYWHERE and HOT WATER MUSIC. \r\nTen years on from their demise, “South London Vs The World” is a comprehensive discography of everything BLOCKO recorded – Disc 1 being the South London disc and featuring all the recordings made at RMS Studios in their South London homeland, whereas Disc 2 features unearthed alternative mixes of the “Edmondson Avenue” album tracks recorded over in the USA with Matt Smith (STRIKE ANYWHERE) which have previously never been released in this form, plus various live recordings from Belfast. Featuring unseen photos, and liner notes from both the band and Sean Forbes (Rough Trade), this is a fitting document to this great band.\r\nMailorder Copies bought direct from Boss Tuneage only come With A Bonus DVDR of Live Footage from the Camden Underworld!\r\n</div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<B>Mailorder Bonus: <br></B>\r\nBuy this  Double CD from Boss Tuneage and also receive an exclusive bonus Live DVD-R for free \r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nDouble CD with bonus DVD<br>\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n\r\nDisc 1:\r\n1.

come from?\". For me personally, SLAVES is one of those bands. Two young guys from the Garden of England who have created a monster debut release in \"SUGAR COATED BITTER TRUTH\" - unique but formally grounded in punk, SLAVES explode with energy over the entire course of this classic debut. Originally released by the band themselves, the initial pressing sold out via word of mouth and gigs in next to no time - now Boss Tuneage is more than happy to tie up with the band to re-release \"SUGAR COATED BITTER TRUTH\" with brand new packaging and artwork at a super cheap price. </div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nCD </P>\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P><br>\r\n1.

Luigi Selleri(ex-SUBURBAN NOISE) started as a solo project, then Lele Morosini(ex-EVERSOR, MILES APART) and Luca Bartolucci (ex-MILES APART) joined in. Now they are a three  piece band sounding similar to later-era MILES APART with a touch more emo flavour poured on it.JUNE AND THE WELL remind of 90's emo/indie rock like JIMMY EAT WORLD, SENSE FIELD, TEXAS IS THE REASON, and SUNNY DAY REAL ESTATE.

They have released records on Toxic Pop Records, Traffic St. Records, and Art of the Underground Records. Now they are on Waterslide records. This is their third album and the best album so far! Bands like Jawbreaker and Superchunk still hold down the foundation for the sound here, but this threesome has really come into their own with their songwriting, both musically and lyrically.

Little did we know though we were looking in the wrong country! CHESTNUT ROAD (named after the BROCCOLI song) are from France but wear their inspiration from all those UK bands firmly on their chest, and taking influence from the likes of HUSKER DU and Taang Era LEMONHEADS as well, have managed to do where so many fail in this genre – actually make a record that is class, and that is uniquely CHESTNUT ROAD – some bands just have that knack of taking the “same old thing” and making it better, and CHESTNUT ROAD’s debut shows they are definitely one of those bands!\r\n\r\nLimited Edition Cololured Vinyl (300 Copies) with insert and heavyweight sleeve\r\n\r\n\r\nTRACKLIST\r\nSide A\r\n1.

The SAB play trash-pop inspired by seventies punk, the skinny tie bands of the eighties and nineties garage rock. From the ashes of Million Dollar Marxists (Gearhead Records) and Sedatives (P.Trash Records), the group was born out of necessity - a whack load of orphan songs with no band to call home.

classic bands, and was originally released in 1986 on X-Mist Records. SPERMBIRDS to many ARE  German hardcore punk, punk as fuck: fast, furious, powerful, inventive with lyrics by ex-GI Lee Hollis, full of cynicism/spite on one hand and love of life on the other. their side contains three tracks, incl. \"My God Rides a Skateboard\" in a different version, plus the rare \"Shit rolls down hill\" and \"She's got VD\". \r\n\r\nDie Walter Elf: Was the alter ego of SPERMBIRDS, being influenced by melodic US punk rock in the vein of Descendents and early 80s British bands like Undertones, Chelsea and Stiff Little Fingers. They deliver two tracks: \"Kaiserslautern\", a homage to their hometown Kaiserslautern, and \"15 Bier\", which deals with unrequited love and, as a consequence, drinking too much alcohol. \r\n\r\nThe Vinyl comes with lyric sheet and liner notes by Lee and Beppo.\r\n\r\nSTRICTLY LIMITED AMOUNTS AVAILABLE - FIRST COME , FIRST SERVED!!!**\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\nA1.

acclaimed “Sparkle In The Mud”. This time, the 22 previously unreleased tracks concentrate on the period from 1983-1986, between TV SMITH’s EXPLORERS breaking up and the release of the “Channel 5” album through to the formation of TV SMITH’S CHEAP. All 22 tracks have never been commercially released before, and in effect compile what would have been two “missing” albums. TV SMITH has seen a spike of interest in him and his back catalogue since the transmission of the hour long TV documentary “We Who Wait” as part of BBC4’s “Punk Britannia” season back in June, and this has brought his solo work after the ADVERTS to a host of new fans adding to his existing passionate fanbase. “Lucky Us” has been titled as a fitting tribute to Tim Cross, TV’s long time collaborator who sadly died in July this year after a battle with lung cancer whilst this album was being compiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n</div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nCD <br>\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n<br>\r\n1.

kick ass mini album as well as a handful of other tracks that remained unreleased – until now, two decades later! A lost gem, the band split up in 1992 . Hugely influenced at the time by the likes of HDQ, SNUFF and their hometown contemporaries the INSTIGATORS, the entire studio recorded output by the band has been compiled onto CD for the first time as part of the acclaimed Boss Tuneage Retro Series. Apart from the LP, “Waves Of” also originally appeared on the “Floor 81” comp LP – all other tracks were never officially released beyond demo tapes. Digitally remastered and with liner notes from the band, these archive recordings are a must for all fans of UK melodic hardcore punk.\r\n</div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nCD<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n\r\n<b>ALL SAID AND DONE LP (1990)</b><br>\r\n1.

release in 1990 (the GOOBER PATROL / VEHICLE DEREK split 7”) – over 280 releases have followed in the past two decades, and this 4CD boxset celebrates and documents the history of Boss Tuneage - and has been the biggest project we have ever undertaken!<br>\r\n CD1 is entitled \"the originals” and contains an overview of some of the standout tracks from our standout releases past and present, CD2 is entitled “the reissues” and features tracks taken from the Boss Tuneage Retro Series imprint, CD3 is subtitled “the covers” and features Boss Tuneage bands performing cover versions of other bands from the label (the vast majority have been specially recorded for this release) whilst CD4 contains rare, unreleased and out of print recordings from the archives – many of which have never been on CD before.<br>\r\nIn total, <b>120 tracks, including 27 previously unreleased</b> with a further <b>50 tracks either out of print or never been on CD before</b>. Coupled with a thick booklet containing extensive liner notes including a full and detailed discography and lots of memorabilia and previously unseen photos, this 4CD set is strictly limited to 1000 copies worldwide and will not be repressed, so represents a stunning document of the first twenty years of our label.<br>\r\n </div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\n 4 x CD SET</P>\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n\r\n<b>CD1 – THE ORIGINALS:</b><br> \r\n1.

DAN were one of the leading lights of the UK anarcho/DIY punk scene of the late 80s. “Thology” is a stunning 64 track double CD which includes everything the band ever recorded, all on CD for the first time! The bands initial releases were on the seminal 1980s UK punk label Meantime, run by bassist Ian Armstrong. “Thology” contains the debut “can you Dig It” 7”, the three studio albums (“Where Have All The Children Gone”, “An Attitude Hits” and “Mother With Child And Bunny”), their solitary session for the John Peel Show, and final live album “Kicking Ass At TJ’s”. The 20 page booklet contains all lyrics, gigography, liner notes from the band and Sean Forbes (Rough Trade Shop), plus unseen photos and memorabilia from the bands personal collection. Band members would later go on to bands such as SOFA HEAD, LEATHERFACE and WAT TYLER amongst many others! A must have release for anyone with an interest in late 80s UK punk.\r\n</div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nDouble CD<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n\r\nCD 1:\r\n1.

Since that time it has become somewhat of an old school death metal gem – the original vinyl album commands a high second hand price and is highly sought after, as it was only originally pressed in a small limited amount. \r\nThis is a shining example of early UK Death Metal, with a style similar to somewhere between early DEATH, AUTOPSY and PARADISE LOST. Now more than two decades on, “Subconscious Release” is made available again as part of the series of classic late 80s/early 90s metal reissues by Mosh Tuneage, and for the very first time on CD! Released in conjunction with the band and original label RKT, and featuring a four song demo courtesy of the band themselves as bonus tracks, plus of course the original stunning Dan Seagrave cover artwork, this is a must own for all fans of the death genre.  \r\n\r\n\r\n</div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nCD<br>\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n\r\n<b>SUBCONCIOUS RELEASE:</b><br>\r\n1.

align=\"justify\">BACK IN STOCK! EXIT CONDITION were one of the finest and first of the UK melodic hardcore bands from the UK. This 23 track CD retrospective , compiled by the band themselves, includes tracks from  their very first legendary” Impact Time” demo, through to tracks from their final split 7” single on Japanese Snuffy Smile label in 1994. All tracks have been remastered and appear on CD for the first time, including tracks from their 1991 BBC Peel Session, which have never been released before. From the fast melodic thrash of their early years (which lead to a debut single on the legendary US Pusmort label), to the more Leatherface / Husker melodic driving punk of their legendary solitary album “Days Of Wild Skies” released originally on Meantime, they were one the finest bands of their era and this album serves as a fitting testament to a band whose influence is still prevalent today.  </div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nCD </P>\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n1.

all they have promised up until now. This is their masterpiece – melodic punk (showing a nod to singer / guitarist David Lee Burdon’s old band LEATHERFACE) gets hit side on by a healthy dose of classic rock and even a touch of soul through David’s emotional raw vocals. The song writing is complemented by the addition of a brass section and piano into the mix which adds another dimension to FORMER CELL MATES’ rocking tunes, making them stand out from the rest of the pack and taking things to the next level amongst their peers. “Presented As A Work Of Fiction” is not only a collection of the finest songs FORMER CELL MATES have written to date, but is also the album you always knew they had in them! The packaging also complements the songs, with the CD version in a digipack with full colour booklet, and the vinyl version on strictly limited edition coloured vinyl in a heavyweight sleeve.<br> This is a co-release with Poison City Records of Australia - in Australia and New Zealand please order directly from Poison City.</b></div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nDigipack CD with full colour booklet<br><br>\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n1.

All 24 tracks have been digitally remastered and features 11 songs previously unavailable on CD before. Compiled with liner notes from the band and many unseen photos.

align=\"justify\">With an epic and infamous disregard for popular trends and nice haircuts, the three quasi-virtuosos that are Australian legends THE HARD ONS are back with their first new studio album in three years – and with an album that truly represents the Hard-Ons at their most realised: melodic; brutal;  and funny.  “ALFALFA MALES ONCE SUMMER IS DONE CONFORM OR DIE” is at once a face-peeling thrash-metal album, slash-and-burn punk album and a brilliantly catchy power-pop album. But you would expect that from a band that for a quarter of a century laughed at the mainstream and deliberately shunned it; a band that gloriously does what it instinctively feels; paradoxically, a band that carefully and organically crafts its musical output with the utmost respect that it deserves.\r\n<p>\r\nIn this era of downloading, social-networking and over-the-top consumerism, the world needs, as outrageous as this sounds, the new album from three shirtless middle-aged men who still play like they are the only band on the planet.. <br> BOSS TUNEAGE EXCLUSIVE: Free 6 song  download code with every order from us, featuring 5 unreleased demo versions of tracks on the album plus totally exclusive unreleased Studio track \"Will You Fuck Off About What Tomorrow Will Bring\"! </div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nCD (with FREE 6 song bonus download code, inc exclusive studio track!!)</P>\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n1.

align=\"justify\">HDQ were one of the leading lights of the UKHC scene in the late 80s and early 90s, and one of the first bands alongside the likes of SNUFF to embrace the more melodic US hardcore approach of bands like DAG NASTY. Now their back catalogue gets an exhaustive and extensive re-issue as part of THE BOSS TUNEAGE RETRO SERIES. Still hugely influential today, 75% of the Sunderland based band went on to become members of UK punk legends LEATHERFACE. HDQ’s second – and arguably best - album “Sinking” from 1989 has not been widely available for well over 15 years, and never commercially released on CD before in the UK. Here it has been re-mastered, with full and detailed liner notes from bassist Rob Bewick and features 12 previously unreleased tracks on any format, including the bands first session for the John Peel Show. </div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nCD<br>or Download from iTunes<a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=296656601\"> <img src=\"http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/images/iTunes.gif\" alt=\"iTunes US\" border=\"0\"> </a><br>\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n1.

align=\"justify\">HDQ were one of the leading lights of the UKHC scene in the late 80s and early 90s, and one of the first bands alongside the likes of SNUFF to embrace the more melodic US hardcore approach of bands like DAG NASTY. Now their back catalogue gets an exhaustive and extensive re-issue as part of THE BOSS TUNEAGE RETRO SERIES. Still hugely influential today, 75% of the Sunderland based band went on to become members of UK punk legends LEATHERFACE. HDQ’s third and final album “Soulfinder” from 1990 has not been widely available for well over 15 years, and never commercially released on CD before in the UK. Here it has been re-mastered, with full and detailed liner notes from bassist Rob Bewick, and features 19 previously unreleased tracks on any format, including the bands second session for the John Peel Show as well as the original recording of the “Sinking” album with original drummer Lainey that was shelved when he left the band, plus a live recording of the song “In My Thoughts”, the only track the band never got round to recording in a studio. </div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nCD<br>or Download from iTunes<a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=301435333\"> <img src=\"http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/images/iTunes.gif\" alt=\"iTunes US\" border=\"0\"> </a><br>\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n1.

align=\"justify\">Heresy is one of the most influential UK Hardcore Punk bands ever to exist. From 1985-1989 the band were one of the leading lights of the rapidly expanding UK scene. Heresy’s back catalogue has been totally re-mastered by Kalv Piper and Steve “Baz” Ballam from the band and “1985-87” is the first of a trilogy of discographies that Boss Tuneage has released (along with Face Up To It and 20 Reasons to End It All). This traces the early formative years of the band, from their previously unreleased 7 song demo tape from 1985 to the debut 6 track “Never Healed” flexi-disc 7”EP and contains the virtually-impossible-to –find 4 song “Thanks” 7” EP. In addition 2 previously unreleased tracks complete the 19 track CD. With extensive sleeve notes from Kalv, a huge 16-page full colour booklet insert contains dozens of never seen before photos, tour posters and lyrics.

From 1985-1989 the band were one of the leading lights of the rapidly expanding UK scene. Heresy’s back catalogue has been totally re-mastered by Kalv Piper and Steve “Baz” Ballam from the band and “1985-87” is the first of a trilogy of discographies that Boss Tuneage has released (along with Face Up To It and 20 Reasons to End It All). This traces the early formative years of the band, from their previously unreleased 7 song demo tape from 1985 to the debut 6 track “Never Healed” flexi-disc 7”EP and contains the virtually-impossible-to –find 4 song “Thanks” 7” EP. In addition 2 previously unreleased tracks complete the 19 track album. With extensive sleeve notes from Kalv, the repackeged vinyl version (available again for the first time in three years) features tons of never seen before photos, tour posters and lyrics. An absolute must for any fan of Heresy or UK hardcore.</div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nLimited Edition 12\" Coloured Vinyl LP;<br>\r\n500 copies on Dark Green Vinyl <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n1.

From 1985-1989 the band were one of the leading lights of the rapidly expanding UK scene. Heresy’s back catalogue has been totally re-mastered by Kalv Piper and Steve “Baz” Ballam from the band and “20 Reasons to End it All” is the final installment of a trilogy of discographies that Boss Tuneage has released (along with 1985-1987 and Face Up To It).  It traces the final year of the band’s history  and compiles the “Whose Generation” 7”, the “13 Rocking Anthems” LP (featuring their second and third sessions for the legendary John Peel Show) as well as the ultra rare “Live At Leeds” 7” tracks taken from the bands final ever show. In essence, this release is an absolute must for any fan of HERESY or UK Hardcore to complete their collection.</div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nLimited Edition Coloured Vinyl 12”LP, solid white vinyl, 500 copies<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n1.

Filmed totally DIY punk style on a single camcorder by their tour manager, “1987” follows the band on a tour of Belgium and Holland, featuring ultra rare live appearances and 17 full out blasting live songs to frenzied crowds! In addition to this, there are also some classic never seen before “behind the scenes” footage of the band and roadies which shows the bands humorous side too! There is also some remarkable archive footage of the band in the recording studio, recording the legendary “Thanks” 7” single! A must for those who there at the time, or any fan of this legendary UKHC Band, caught at the top of their game!<br>\r\n<br>Please note: This DVD has been digitally restored as best as possible from the original 20 year old video cassette tape, but this is a true DIY punk lo-fi recording, and not a multi-camera angle swish MTV affair!! </div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nDVD – PAL and NTSC VERSIONS AVAILABLE</P>\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n1.

align=\"justify\">The unexpected and tragic death of Darren “Wiz” Brown on 6th Dec 2006 was a shock to many people. He was a greatly respected and extraordinary musician and writer who touched the lives of many through his work with MEGA CITY FOUR, DOUGHBOYS, SERPICO and most recently IPANEMA.We had been releasing records by Wiz’s bands over the previous six years and had built up not only a great working relationship but also a great friendship with IPANEMA. The question was – how best to honour Wiz? The only answer could be through his music. The result is a magnificent 17 track CD, containing these 9 unreleased recordings plus the out of print “Baseball Bat/Skull” 7” from 2003 and the “Me Me Me” mini album from 2005. Everything that IPANEMA recorded.All monies raised by the sale of this CD are being donated by Boss Tuneage directly to the Forward 4 Wiz Trust. Creativity matters. Inspiration matters.

align=\"justify\">The Magnificent is Jimmy Islip (vocals / guitar), Matt Colmer (vocals / guitar), Charlie Batten (drums) & Carl Glover (bass). They have been playing music together since their pre-teens (including That Fucking Tank, Buzzkill and Eighty Six) until finally settling as the Magnificent in late 2006. Their music has been compared to popular U.S punk stuff like Rancid, Gaslight Anthem, Green Day and The Hold Steady to name a few but their sound is definitely English and owes more to the Clash than anything else. ‘Pay The Crimes’ is their first full-length album and showcases their honest lyrics and straight-up song writing. The album features contributions from Paul Rafferty of HOT CLUB DE PARIS and Rob Taylor from Wakefield band PYLON. </div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nCD<br>or Download from iTunes<a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=311372867\"> <img src=\"http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/images/iTunes.gif\" alt=\"iTunes US\" border=\"0\"> </a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n\r\n1.

Their solitary 7” EP released in 1987 “Inspiration” is widely regarded as a UK Hardcore classic, and was the first release on the First Strike label (who later released JAILCELL RECIPES and DRIVE). When vocalist Loyd left, DEFAULT ceased to be in 1989, and the remaining members recruited bassist Stuart West and changed their name to MONKS OF SCIENCE, under which they recorded and released an album “I’m A Doctor Not An Escalator” for In Your Face Records in 1990. This 28 track compilation reissue compiles all the studio recordings of both DEFAULT and MONKS OF SCIENCE, and is digitally re-mastered – all tracks have never been available on CD, with a further 12 previously unavailable commercially – including the MONKS OF SCIENCE final studio recordings from 1992, and the DEFAULT “Faith Or Fraud” demo from 1987. Featuring liner notes from the band as well as many unseen photos and memorabilia, including a full gig listing for both bands, this is a must have collection for fans of UK Hardcore. The band can currently be found playing in PSYCHO BOMBS, with the exception of bassist Stuart West, who currently plays bass in THE DAMNED.\r\n</div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nCD<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n<b> <big>MONKS OF SCIENCE :</big><br>\r\nI'M A DOCTOR NOT AN ESCALATOR LP (1990) <br></b></big>\r\n1.

unique bands within the ever developing DIY anarcho-punk scene, by taking inspiration from a wider spectrum of influences, from US hardcore bands and mainstream rock within their more melodic sound. “SOMEDAY” is the second part of our POLITICAL ASYLUM reissues, coreleased again with Passing Bells in Finland, and compiles their seven song mini album from 1987 with a full live show recorded in Austria in 1987 - with all tracks previously unreleased on CD before. the large booklet also contains liner notes from Ramsey Kanaan, all lyrics and many unseen photos.<br>

Over the past two years the band have quickly established themselves as one of the finest live punk bands in the country, fronted by ex VISIONS OF CHANGE and DEPRAVED vocalist Ian Murphy. After hundreds of gigs, supporting the likes of NOFX, STUPIDS, AGENT ORANGE, SNUFF and many more, “Burning Bridges” has been over a year in the making, as the band fine tuned their sound, and hammers down 14 hardcore punk belters that take their influence from the early 80s US hardcore scene – yet whilst those influences are very clear in SECTION 13’s sound, this isn’t a rehash – SECTION 13 take that energy and up it a gear, bringing something unique to the table - creating a must-own release for all fans of original, hard hitting hardcore punk.\r\n</div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nCD<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n\r\n1.

align=\"justify\">BACK TO SQUARE ONE AGAIN: 89-91 is the latest instalment of the highly acclaimed Boss Tuneage Retro Series, featuring the recordings of Brighton’s SLEEP. Although only in existence for two years, SLEEP made quite an impact on the UK melodic punk scene in a short time. Through the Suffocate 7 inch and Cat And Mouse LP both released on Meantime Records, and a string of shows up and down the country (including supporting QUICKSAND on their UK tour) SLEEP dealt in melodic hardcore akin to the likes of HDQ, SNUFF and INSTIGATORS. This CD contains their vinyl releases complete with extra bonus, rare demo and live tracks and many unseen photos, plus liner notes from the band themselves. This is the first time SLEEP’s recordings have been available on CD.  </div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nCD<br>or Download from iTunes<a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=332244670\"> <img src=\"http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/images/iTunes.gif\" alt=\"iTunes US\" border=\"0\"> </a><br>\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n\r\n1.

align=\"justify\">SOFAHEAD were formed from the ashes of legendary anarcho punks DAN, when guitarist Wal and bassist Ian teamed up with Lainey (LEATHERFACE, HDQ, RUGRAT) on drums, and Claire on vocals. Mainstays of the UK punk scene of the late 80s and early 90s, bassist Ian also ran legendary UK punk label Meantime records. Now, for the first time, are their first two albums “Pre Marital Yodelling” and “What A Predicament” together on one CD, completely remastered. The booklet features sleevenotes by Ian from the band and all lyrics. Another wonderful document to that halcyon era of underground melodic UK punk!</div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nCD<br>or Download from iTunes<a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=284535085\"> <img src=\"http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/images/iTunes.gif\" alt=\"iTunes US\" border=\"0\"> </a><br>\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n1.

align=\"justify\">For the first time ever, German’s legendary hardcore band, The Spermbirds are filmed doing what they do best – playing live. This double DVD features a live 80-minute film (professionally recorded) of the “Boys are Back in K-Town” show recorded in December 2005 in Kaiserslautern where the band celebrated their 20-year anniversary together with over 1200 fans. Disc two of the DVD also contains \"Me and My People”, a two hour documentary (produced by the band) that tells the Spermbirds story in their own words about the bands conception, the splits, the reconciliations, the records and a host of strange experiences over their 20 year history. This is coupled with exclusive behind the scenes footage of their tours in South Africa and Europe.

align=\"justify\">TV Smith rose to prominence in the first wave of British punk rock as singer and songwriter for The Adverts who, after frequent early appearances at the seminal Roxy club in London in 1977, gained cult success with the Stiff single \"One Chord Wonders\". This turned to notoriety when their next single, \"Gary Gilmore's Eyes\" thrust them into the upper reaches of the UK Charts. The album that followed \"Crossing The Red Sea With The Adverts\" charted on its first week of release and is generally considered to be one of the few genuine classics of the era. Recorded in April 2007 in front of an enthusiastic sellout crowd at the legendary 100 Club, TV Smith and The Bored Teenagers turned the clock back 30 years and performed that defining classic album in sequence and in full. The vinyl-effect CD also contains 5 encores from the evening, including the legendary \"Gary Gilmore's Eyes\".  </div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nRed or Black Vinyl Effect CD<br>or Download from iTunes<<a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=283933991\"> <img src=\"http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/images/iTunes.gif\" alt=\"iTunes US\" border=\"0\"> </a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n1.

LIVE AT THE NVA is the first released live recording of TV SMITH’s legendary one man live shows, and what’s more, this double CD is available for the price of a single! The word legend is sometimes over used, but with TV SMITH it isn’t hyperbole – since making his mark with THE ADVERTS back in 1977, TV SMITH is one of the original punk powerhouses who has stayed true to his beliefs and continued to write and record to this day, alongside a 150+ date touring schedule each year. Recorded in Germany (with TV’s in-between song banter showing he is fluent in German!) LIVE AT THE NVA features over 100 minutes of TV SMITH playing his illustrious back catalogue, from ADVERTS classics through to tracks from last year’s highly acclaimed In The Arms Of My Enemy album </div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nDigipack Double CD<br>or Download from iTunes<a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=326849528\"> <img src=\"http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/images/iTunes.gif\" alt=\"iTunes US\" border=\"0\"> </a><br>\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n1.

\r\n\r\n<P><div align=\"justify\">The best things sometimes come to those who wait and this is the one that fans of TV SMITH have been waiting for. Following the demise of THE ADVERTS, TV SMITH continued to demo and write songs alongside his work as TV SMITH AND THE GREAT EXPLORERS, as well as solo album “CHANNEL 5”, which up until now have been unheard. Now, as part of the acclaimed Boss Tuneage Retro Series, “SPARKLE IN THE MUD” compiles 21 of these previously unreleased demo recordings, with a staggering 16 songs appearing for the very first time. To all intents and purposes, these recordings represent the “lost” TV SMITH albums from the early 80’s.

With lacerating lyrics and melodies that refuse to leave the head, these twelve brand new songs cast a scorching light on the current state of the world. Recorded in Germany and the UK with a hand-picked and tight-knit network of friends – Vom Ritchie (Die Toten Hosen), BB Quattro (Suzy & Los Quattro, Bored Teenagers), Tim Cross (Adverts) – and mixed in a studio in the snow-bound wilds of deepest Finland with maverick engineer Jarkko Heiniö (Tiger Bombs, King Of All The Animals), “Coming In To Land” marks a new career highpoint for TV Smith.

align=\"justify\">Norfolk’s VANILLA POD are one of the most consistent touring bands in the UK pop-punk underground and are back with their fifth album and first new recordings in five years. We think it’s easily their best offering to date which showcases many a fine song you may already recognise from their live set. Sharing members with bands such as TOY DOLLS, BILLY NO MATES and GOOBER PATROL, the POD have even enlisted Olga from the TOY DOLLS to lay down some guitar on this album. POETS ON PAYDAY features nine brand new tracks complemented by two previously unreleased bonus tracks from the sessions for their two previous albums (Surrounded By Idiots and Third Time Lucky) capturing VANILLA POD at their melodic best. </div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nCD<br>or Download from iTunes<a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=333968346\"> <img src=\"http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/images/iTunes.gif\" alt=\"iTunes US\" border=\"0\"> </a><br>\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n1.

limited edition CD reissues by lesser known but no less great UK Hardcore punk bands from the late 80s and early 90s! WANTON THOUGHT hailed from North Wales and played cracking melodic hardcore punk akin to early SNUFF, HDQ and INSTIGATORS - although they split up before recording their album for Full Circle in 1991, they left us with one kickass 7\"EP (the third release on Boss Tuneage) and one track on the \"Floor 81\" comp LP.\r\n\r\nThis 10 track, 40 minute CD features not only these tracks, but also their second demo from 1989 (of which a version of \"Normal School Day\" featured on Meantime Records \"Spleurk 2\" comp LP at the time) plus - their finest recorded tune - \"In The Glue\" - which had criminally remained unreleased until now!\r\n\r\nA cracking little CD which just shows what a cracking band WANTON THOUGHT were - and this is a must for any fans of late 80s/early 90s UK scene stuff!\r\n\r\nDigitally remastered and features liner notes from Drummer Craig Williams.\r\n\r\n</div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\nLimited Edition CD<br>\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\n\r\n1.

After their 20 year old demo “Shouting For A Better Tomorrow” was released on 7” in late 2005, the bands notoriety spread throughout the hardcore scene, the band have subsequently reformed and re-recorded some of their old material with brand new songs – as displayed on the 21 tracks of their side of the album, entitled (YOUTH OF TODAY fans turn away now!) “WE’RE NOT IN THIS TO BREAK DOWN THE WALLS ALONE”... inspirational band or just a bunch of thirty-somethings messing around with too much time on their hands? You decide! In addition to the 31 tracks on the LP, there is also a bonus CD included featuring an extra 28 tracks – that’s an eye watering 59 tracks in total – bonus tracks include the original X ONE WAY X demo and the YOS “Shouting For A Better Tomorrow” 7” plus additional unreleased recordings. </div align=\"justify\"><P>\r\n\r\n<P><B>FORMAT:</b>\r\n12” Vinyl LP with bonus 59 track CD plus FREE YOS 7\" <br>Shouting For A Better Tomorrow<br>or Download from iTunes<a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=292566847\"> <img src=\"http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/images/iTunes.gif\" alt=\"iTunes US\" border=\"0\"> </a><br>\r\n\r\n<P><b>TRACKLIST:</B></P>\r\nXONEWAYX – START WHENEVER: 1.

Waterslide records - CD and booklet in oversized Japanese poly cd wallet\r\n\r\nSummer's is still on! Who says there's no good three chord pop punk in UK anymore? Hailing from landlocked Derby, hardly the most likely place to find a surf pop punk band, THE ATOMS sound like good old  90's style pop punk in the vein of the MUTANT POP label bands - lots of wah-wah harmonies, Buddy Holly-ish doo wop, and 50's good oldies on 78RPM are on this. This physical copy – exclusively released worldwide by Japanese label Waterslide - has 5 extra new tracks including British punk rock legend, THE BOYS \"First Time\".

Storytailor, a craftsman who tangles stories like clothes, spinning words, sowing storylines and who is able to change stories with every needle or add lines with every thread. That Storytailor is the basis of a new Bambix album. An album containing 12 very different new songs. Ranging from heavy, melancholic, cheerful, powerful tunes to a personal acoustic one . Recorded by Nico van Montfort (Heidevolk, Earth Crisis, Antillectual) who completely understood Bambix’ vision, giving the songs the intensity they need. After 20 years in the game, Bambix are still going and are still as bratty as ever, sneering as they tackle their favourite subjects in which they stand up for the underdog, the only lonely at the bar, the ones that have their hearts dripping on the floor, outcasts, a better world where  ties are made to be broken, the individual keeps on shouting and refuses to be a lame couch potato. This time front woman Wick Bambix deals with very personal matters like the death of her father and the birth of son Silas. Cover was designed by Larkin, a surreal NY artist, whose two paintings are showing a hare and a fox, Victorian style, in quilted suits. Storytailored suits. Enemies they are, with their own stories but yet of the same family, it seems.\r\n\r\n1. Curfew‘s Gone \r\n2. Headstrong \r\n3. Hell and Back \r\n4. Johan \r\n5. Corners of the World \r\n6.

After a demo in 1988, they have released \"Calculated Mind Rape\" 7\"EP in 1989, then in 1990 the output on Peaceville the band is mostly known for, \"Acknowledge the Confusion Master\" LP (also released as a split CD with AXEGRINDER), in the same year they released live 7\"EP (\"Until the Again\") and the \"Peel Sessions\" 12\". After the \"Matrix\" CD in 1992 (on Metalcore), their last output was the 3-song demo \"Ego Death Grind\" in 1996. This CD compiles an unreleased radio session from 1991 plus the complete \"Ego Death Grind\" demo 1996. Now you have a chance to complete your POD discography with some of their best stuff ever.\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\n1. Raze Against Time\r\n2. Onward Ever Backward\r\n3.

from Discogs..\r\n\r\nAnother quality reissue on Agipunk. Ipswich/UK Anihilated formed in 1980 as Prospex and deeply involved in the anarcho-punk scene. They soon started to add metal to their music, the first in UK playing this kind of crossover along with Onslaught, Sacrilege and Concrete Sox. This 12\" EP has been originally released in 1986 and for the first time is re-released on vinyl. A true gem that you need to own next to \"Behind the realms of madness and \"Power from hell\". Original cover artwork drawn back in the days by Mid/Deviated Instinct.

website - \r\n\r\nDUDE JAMS\r\ncurrently reside in Austin Texas, influenced upon a steady diet of BONG RIPS, RANCID, TECATE, and TACO BELL, DUDE JAMS have been putting the X in PUNX since the mid '00s. DUDE JAMS have done a few splits with the likes of DUMBSPRINGER, TOO MANY DAVES and JONESIN' but to name a few, DUDE JAMS have extensively toured the U.S.A a whole bunch through 2007-2010. DUDE JAMS recently took a break from the touring scene to concentrate on the the couch for the start of new seasons of Jersey Shore and Ghost Hunters. DUDE JAMS released their critically acclaimed hit PUNK album 'How To Abuse Everything' on A.D.D Records last year. In 2012 DUDE JAMS toured the Mid-West. DUDE JAMS is the best band name in history.\r\n\r\nPURE GRAFT\r\nThe history of Pure Graft started a long time ago in Newcastle, England when the young friends Simon Hubbard, Danny Lester, Ben Ralston, Mark Thompson and Chris McManus (born Michael Ryan Pritchard) formed their first band Sweet Children. In 2005 they changed their name to PURE GRAFT and PURE GRAFT released their first DEMO which brought the band 3 fans, 2 gigs and eventually a record deal. They got signed to an independent label Specialist Subject Records which released their first split 10\" with EINENCALVINKLEINSBALLS, KAVES, and BIG SHITTY PLAN.\r\n\r\nSoon after the release another change came – Mark Thompson quit the band and was replaced by David Hillier (born Frank Edwin Wright III) who became Pure Graft’s permanent easy loving guitarist. Pure Graft were becoming more and more popular due to the arrival of sexy dave and soon after the release of their second split 7 e.p with BEASTS their success was so obvious that the band began getting offers from COOL record labels. Eventually, Pure Graft decided to sign a verbal agreement with NOT SHY OF THE DIY RECORDS.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 2010 Pure Graft released their 7\" split with LITTLE LEAGUE on SSR which was a huge success. It eventually sold over 100 copies worldwide.\r\n\r\nIn Sept 2012 PURE GRAFT released their split 7\" with DUDE JAMS on NOT SHY OF THE DIY RECORDS. The success and popularity of the band brought not only joy and at least 50 new fans. PURE GRAFT are once again playing the Fest in Florida this year headlining the main stage on the opening night such is their popularity.\r\n\r\nIn 2013 PURE GRAFT are all set to work upon their debut album The Geordie
