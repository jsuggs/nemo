While there are medications available to help treat symptoms of Lupus, (fatigue, joint and muscle pain, skin, heart and lung problems and hair loss are just a few) there is still no cure for the disease. \r\n\r\nThe color purple is reserved for diseases that are considered 'invisible' or rather, you wouldn't know someone has it just by looking at them. Purple has been deemed the official color of Lupus\r\n\r\nThe universal symbol for Lupus is the butterfly.  The butterfly describes the shape of the rash that some people living with lupus get. It is also the symbol of beauty, rebirth, transformation, new beginnings, freedom and growth. \r\n\r\nThe spoon symbolizes Christine Miserandino's <a href=\"http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory-written-by-christine-miserandino/\" target=\"_blank\">'spoon theory' which describes what living with lupus is like. </a> \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nOdds are, there is someone in your life living with Lupus.
