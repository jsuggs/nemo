I am a peach fan no matter what it is in.  This smells VERY light, but the soap is actually one of my best for some reason.  The lather is ridiculous, and leaves your skin super soft...I may have accidentally  dumped some extra shea butter in this one.  I also have the lotion for this, and let me tell you....this is the one I have been using the past week before I go to bed, and my bed smell so GOOD lol.  LOVE that!  One of my faves.
