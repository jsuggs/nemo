Our new baby settles so much easier of an evening in comparision to our first and I'm convinced that our Rub-a-Dub-Bub routine is to thank.  We like to add a few drops to her bath and then finish with a tummy rub. The bonus is that our very enthusiastic big sister now likes a massage before she goes to bed, so everyone is sleeping better all round - Mum and Dad included!</em>&quot;\r\nK.M.,  Leura</p>\r\n<p>&quot;<em>The bubble bath and baby oil are fantastic.
