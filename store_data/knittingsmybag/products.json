The cool blue tones of the fabric and polka dot monochromatic lining are reminiscent of a gently falling snow.  \r\n\r\nThe bag measures approximately 9-1/2” tall and 8” wide and is large enough to hold smaller knitting and crochet projects such as socks, a scarf or baby items. It is made of cotton fabric and is fully lined, has a drawstring closure with wooden beads and a 14” handle. There is plenty of room for at least 2 balls of yarn, needles and patterns.  There is a ribbon on one side suitable for a carabiner (sold separately) so that you can hang your bag from your purse, luggage or belt buckle.  The fabric is machine washable but spot cleaning is always recommended.  \r\n\r\nThe yarn that accompanies this set coordinates with the fabric in the bag and comes with a snowflake charm.  The yarn that is photographed in this listing will be the yarn you receive.  Just as no two snowflakes are alike, each skein of yarn is somewhat different.  This yarn was dyed by independent dyer, Heather, from Highland Handmades.  Here is here description:\r\n\r\n“No Two Flakes is a kettle dyed colorway that is as unique as the snowflakes that inspired it. A combination of the kettle dyeing process and the specific dyes used means that your skein is different from any other skein dyed - even one from the same pot! The result is a watercolor-esque skein of yarn that ranges from snowflake white to winter blue, interspersed with dainty flakes of dark blue throughout. The yarn was reskeined to better demonstrate how it will look when knit. The flecking is due to the nature of the dye.\r\n\r\nSugar Maple Sock Yarn  One skein of Sugar Maple Sock Yarn is more than enough for a pair of socks or a small shawlette. It is machine washable and dryable, but you may want to wash by hand and line dry in order to extend the life of your knit object.  Yardage: 425 yards  Composition: 75% SW Wool, 25% Nylon  Weight: 100 grams, fingering weight.  Gauge: 7-8 sts/inch on US 1-3 needles  All fibers from Highland Handmades are dyed with professional dyes and heat set, then rinsed in plain water.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the bag and yarn, you will receive the following with this B.A.M. offering:\r\n\r\nA set of 6 square stitch markers which are great for fingering yarn projects in various colors of blue;\r\n\r\nA super cute sheepy keyring handmade by Karen of https://www.etsy.com/shop/KaratStix (there are 4 different designed and they are chosen at random); and\r\n\r\nA Candy Cane sweet treat.\r\n\r\nTHIS SET SHIPS FREE IN THE UNITED STATES.

The cool blue tones of the fabric and polka dot monochromatic lining are reminiscent of a gently falling snow.  \r\n\r\nThe bag measures approximately 9-1/2” tall and 8” wide and is large enough to hold smaller knitting and crochet projects such as socks, a scarf or baby items. It is made of cotton fabric and is fully lined, has a drawstring closure with wooden beads and a 14” handle. There is plenty of room for at least 2 balls of yarn, needles and patterns.

A combination of the kettle dyeing process and the specific dyes used means that your skein is different from any other skein dyed - even one from the same pot!
