The end result is a journey through madness with the occasional foothold on sanity; creating a highly entertaining if off-kilter musical experience. Trey Green isn't afraid to just be who he is on CD and let you judge him on the merits. The end result is glorious insanity, the kind you run into every single day in the real world, but with a touch of humor and panache. A joyous romp through Green's Id without safety nets.
