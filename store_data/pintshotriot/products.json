The song is the tale of how someone falls from glory, respect and normality into the depths of addiction. In the gritty video, lead singer Rocket plays out this scenario to a shocking end. PSR played at CMJ in New York last October and have just been invited back to the states to play at SXSW in March 2012. They played a series of storming gigs there at SXSW 2011. In the UK, PSR sold out the 1,000 capacity S7VEN club in Coventry and in London played for THIS FEELING at The Queen Of Hoxton which is their favourite club down south! The album ‘Spell It Out’ also includes a live DVD featuring one of the bands sell-out hometown shows at Coventry’s 1,000 capacity venue the Kasbah club. Of the album, Classic Rock Magazine, said: “This debut is a belter”. Support for the band has come from BBC Introducing, NME TV, Soccer AM and a host of specialist DJ’s who’ve played their music on the radio, at football grounds and in clubs. Pint Shot Riot have supported Band of Skulls, Glasvegas, We Are Scientists, Pete Doherty, The Twang, Cage The Elephant, Athlete and The Enemy. Their music has also been heard around the globe on various computer games, most recently ‘FIFA 12’ which featured the last single ‘Twisted Soul’ but they are also on ‘Need for Speed Hot Pursuit’, ‘Army Of Two’, ‘Need For Speed Nitro’, ‘FIFA 10’, ‘Fight Night Round 4’ and ‘The Sims 3’. www.pintshotriot.co.uk www.facebook.com/pintshotriot\r\nwww.youtube.com/pintshotriot\r\n ","options":[{"id":18543983,"name":"Default","price":2.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/56746005/-/PSR_STF_LITBC012.packs_178D.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/56746005/-/PSR_STF_LITBC012.packs_178D.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":211922,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":4571685,"name":"'TWISTED SOUL' CD MAXI","permalink":"twisted-soul","position":2,"price":2.0,"default_price":2.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/twisted-soul","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-10-05T16:22:07.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":14965807,"name":"Default","price":2.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/44769967/-/TWISTED_SOUL_26TH_SEPTEMBER_2011.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/44769967/-/TWISTED_SOUL_26TH_SEPTEMBER_2011.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":211922,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":3566478,"name":"SPELL IT OUT - ALBUM CD & LIVE DVD SIGNED!!","permalink":"spell-it-out","position":3,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/spell-it-out","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-04-08T20:46:14.000Z","description":"SLIP CASED 12 TRACK DEBUT ALBUM PLUS A FULL LIVE SET DVD AND A 24 PAGE BOOKLET, SIGNED BY THE BAND:)","options":[{"id":11948242,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/34655538/-/CD_pkshot.M.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/34655538/-/CD_pkshot.M.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":211922,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":2830260,"name":"'NOTHING FROM YOU' CD MAXI","permalink":"nothing-from-you","position":4,"price":2.0,"default_price":2.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nothing-from-you","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-10-30T02:20:14.000Z","description":"Released in May 2010 this is our first song to have a remix done.
