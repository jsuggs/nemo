He is truly unique!\r\n\r\nBlueberry will come to you carefully packed with a Certificate of Authenticity and a copy of the Sproutling Care Guide.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Sproutlings?\r\n\r\nSproutlings are anthropomorphic seed-like creatures with a woolly seed pod that they wear as clothing. Their pointed fingers and toes act like roots, drawing nutrition from soil. They can eat food to supplement their diets which allows them to be highly mobile and survive in many different environments. They are largely vegetarian, but will also eat insects. They have bright, reflective eyes that allow them to see well in the dark. In the wild, Sproutlings dig burrows to live in with their long arms and claw-like hands.\r\n\r\nUrban development has pushed a lot of Sproutlings out of their native forest homes, but many have adapted to living in gardens where the soil is packed with nutrients. Not only is having a Sproutling in your garden considered good luck, they keep pests under control and care for the plants. It is customary to leave out sweets or milk for Sproutlings as an offering in exchange for a healthy and beautiful garden.\r\n\r\nSproutlings can understand human speech, but cannot speak it. They can vocalize in small peeps and whistles, but often prefer to listen with their large ears. While Sproutlings all look generally the same, you can tell males from females pretty easily. Males have pointed ears that tend to stick up or out and females have rounded ears that tend to hang down.\r\n\r\nSpoutlings make excellent companions and do well indoors if they are well tended to. Just be sure to supply them with a healthy diet of fruits, veggies, and whole grains and allow them to play in your garden from time to time. They are communal creatures, so getting your Sproutling a friend is highly recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\n• Notice •\r\nSproutlings can stand and/or sit on their own with a bit of careful balancing. They are top heavy so I do not recommend leaving them standing or sitting unsupervised without the support of a doll stand.\r\n\r\nPlease keep your Sproutling away from moisture.

To make this happen, Nonesuch Garden is looking for a few brave buccaneers to pre-order some of these salty friends in order to buy supplies and time to work out the new patterns.\r\n\r\nThe new octopuses and squids will closely resemble the ones pictured in shape and design. They will be made of solid colored merino wool felt and arrive beautifully packaged in an official Nonesuch Garden box with a Certificate of Authenticity. I'm expecting to price the final dolls at or around $65. Get one now for the introductory price of $50. There are a limited number of pre-order slots for both designs, so suction one up while you can!\r\n\r\nPlease choose between a cutie octopus or squid friend!
