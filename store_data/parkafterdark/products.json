After working on a number of songs together, they found vocalist Sal Morale and bassist Chris Cappello. Now a complete band, their goal was to write songs that people could relate to. Songs that people could dance to. Songs that a group of friends sitting around a neighborhood park at night would want to sing and chant as they throw back a few beers. These songs that they were striving for are the \"Silent People\" EP.\r\n\r\nThe lead track, \"Silent People\", starts like the beginning of a house party. You open the front door and it immediately hits you... the environment has changed. \"Silent People\" starts with a sweeping lead riff, then Tudda, the foundation of the band, starts on the low toms. The party is building. Halfway through the first verse, with Morale's silky tone, the party is in full swing. The guitar and bass are strumming away and then the catchiest chorus of the entire EP strikes. And if that's not enough, wait until you hear the guitar/drum solo. \r\n\r\nThe follow-up to \"Silent People\" is the second track, \"The Dance\". A silly Ramones-esque song about a boy who goes to a school dance only to find his ex-girlfriend with another guy. The song, which might normally be better suited on the B-Side of a single, is anything but. The energy and personality that's exuded from Morale and Hersh's vocals allow this song to be jump right out of the speakers. And you'll be unable to prevent your feet from tapping away when hearing the chorus which is reminiscent of the Arctic Monkeys or the Cribs. \r\n\r\n\"Up to No Good\", the only song sang entirely by Hersh on the EP, changes the pace and broadens the band's sound. Dark, yet intriguing, \"Up to No Good\" tells the story of a girl who is a great girlfriend when she is with her boyfriend, but as soon as he leaves, her sneakiness shows its face. Hersh's scratchy vocals and heartfelt lyrics, and the contrast between the smooth guitars and sharp percussion, create a sound like no other on the EP.\r\n\r\n\"High!\" hits quick, and asks questions later. The chorus of this catchy track \"Make me high, cuz I can't be going down...\" introduces dissonance and a reggae sound to the EP. With its unconventional structure and precise percussion, this song appears to be designed to not make sense, yet in some strange way it feels fun, light and safe.\r\n\r\nThe final track of the EP is \"Out of Control\" and that's exactly what occurs in this song. The band is apparently unafraid to go out with a bang. The song starts off like the calm before the storm. Tudda methodically plays a simple beat. Cappello comes in with a bassline which introduces a Chili Peppers feel to the song, however the song will be anything but. Morale's velvety lyrics begin to flow as we enter a world of ecstasy-induced partyers at a rave. As the chorus hits, the track becomes very heavy, but similar to the rest of the EP, it remains honest and catchy. Toward the middle the song takes off, with distortion, guitar solos, and pure and utter chaos. And right when you think the song cannot get any louder, any more out of control, just like the end of every party, the guitars calm. The drums slow. The vocals ease. And as Morale states \"we're back in control\". \r\n\r\nThe EP is a solid listen from beginning to end. From Morale's vocals, to Hersh's lyrics, to the solid foundation created by Tudda and Cappello, to the guitar solos, and the pure raw energy of the sound, you will be thoroughly impressed with this band. \"Silent People\" is the epitome of Park After Dark. They are very unassuming, quiet guys, but give them a chance, and they are sure to surprise you.","options":[{"id":44704380,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125198793/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125198793/-/image.jpg","width":720,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6338493,"name":"Albums","permalink":"albums","url":"/category/albums"}]},{"id":13916061,"name":"Grey t-shirt ","permalink":"grey-t-shirt","position":3,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/grey-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-02T01:34:32.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":44704302,"name":"Medium ","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44704305,"name":"Large","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44754738,"name":"Extra Large","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125198946/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125198946/-/image.jpg","width":716,"height":722}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6338502,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":13916046,"name":"Black t-shirt","permalink":"black-t-shirt","position":4,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/black-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-02T01:33:35.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":44704272,"name":"Medium","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44754756,"name":"Large","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125198724/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125198724/-/image.jpg","width":722,"height":723}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6338502,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":13916019,"name":"Light blue t-shirt ","permalink":"light-blue-t-shirt","position":5,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/light-blue-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-02T01:32:38.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":44704203,"name":"Small","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44754774,"name":"Medium","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125198622/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125198622/-/image.jpg","width":726,"height":726}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6338502,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]}]
