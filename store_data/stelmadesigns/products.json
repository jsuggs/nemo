They are made with hundreds of beautiful black Ocean Pearl, or abalone Mother of Pearl buttons.\r\nThese are never used, vintage old stock buttons that date to the early to mid 1900's. These\r\nlovely shell buttons are really not truly black at all but a deep grey and radiate beautiful rich colors of pink, blue, gold and purple\r\nand all colors in between, different depending on angle, light and what you are wearing.\r\nThe iridescence of these buttons is truly incredible,\r\nso beautiful and nearly impossible to photograph, but I did my best.\r\n\r\nYou may wear this set as is or in singles if you prefer depending on the look you want. Dramatic or more conservative.\r\n\r\nThe measurements below are of the complete loop for each as it encircles your neck. My photo shows how it will hang approximately on a body.\r\n\r\nShortest to longest necklace:\r\n\r\n* 27 inches ( 68.58 cm )\r\n\r\n* 31 inches ( 78.74 cm )\r\n\r\n* 37 inches ( 93.98 cm )\r\n\r\nThe width of the buttons is approximately 1/2 inch ( 1 cm ) and the buttons vary\r\nslightly from this measurement due to non uniformity of these old buttons.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour button necklace will come to you carefully wrapped and packaged in a handmade fabric pouch closed\r\nwith a vintage or antique button.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLovely as a Mermaiden she be......\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHandmade by Julia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n© Copyright 2008, Julia Creighton, All Rights Reserved\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you from StelmaDesigns!","options":[{"id":36113802,"name":"Default","price":98.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":18.5,"amount_with_others":18.5,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":18.5,"amount_with_others":18.5,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":18.5,"amount_with_others":18.5,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":18.5,"amount_with_others":18.5,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":18.5,"amount_with_others":18.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":9.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.5,"amount_with_others":18.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112798710/-/Library_-_0328.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112798710/-/Library_-_0328.jpg","width":499,"height":408}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":11461557,"name":"Black Snap Necklace","permalink":"black-snap-necklace","position":2,"price":52.0,"default_price":52.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/black-snap-necklace","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-30T02:11:02.000Z","description":"Black Snap Necklace, Industrial Necklace of Enameled Metal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the second necklace in my newest collection and a completely original design using hundreds of black enameled brass snap fasteners.

If a modern Cinderella were to wear a necklace to go with her clear glass slippers, it would be this one.\r\n\r\nThis button necklace is fashioned of hundreds of varied sized, vintage, clear, carved, plastic buttons. Each button is a tiny treasure, cut in intricate designs that look like cut glass, ornate and some simple. The contrast between the chunky larger buttons and small ones give interest and a sculptural quality that I love. Even the color varies from pure silvery clear to a slightly aged, pale, straw yellow in some of the buttons. This is a very long dramatic statement piece that you can wear doubled or long like my flapper length designs.
