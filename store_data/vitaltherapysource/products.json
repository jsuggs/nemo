Glutathione increases microcirculation in the tissues quickly, to enhance skin tone and elasticity as well as hydration. Carnosine acts on dark areas of the skin. It is applied at night in place of the peptide lotion, which is still used during the day. Only one application is needed, as the nutrients have a long half-life.
