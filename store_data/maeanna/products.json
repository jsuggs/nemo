A collection of vintage/ novelty and plain triangles (a mix of high quality 100% cotton and polycotton fabrics) make up the nice big triangles which are available to be personalised with your child's name on each letter. Each triangle has a contrasting colour on the back so the bunting is reversible if wanted (without the lettering however). You may choose as many triangles as you would like . A minimum of six is suggested for the bunting to hang properly. We also advise that to 'frame' the initials, another unlettered triangle can be added on either end, refer to photos. This piece will remain a classic! \r\n\r\nFirst 6 triangles will be charged at £3 each, regardless of whether they are plain or lettered. Any additional lettering will be charged at £2 per triangle. Ie if you want bunting with 9 triangles, the first 6 will be £18, the 3 thereafter will be £6, therefore a total of £24. Complete with an exclusive soft woven Mae-anna label. \r\n\r\nThe bunting will come gift wrapped in beautiful tissue paper, organza ribbon, and with the special Mae-anna touch inside with tiny iridescent crystals.\r\n\r\nThe Important Bits \r\nBunting triangles- 100% cotton and polycotton- 35% cotton, 65% polyester pieces \r\nString- poly cotton\r\nIn some instances bunting may come with other embellishments such as small bows and buttons on a few of the triangles. \r\n\r\nWe recommend that you wash this item by hand to preserve it's longevity, although this has been washed in the machine at 40'c and suffered no side effects. Please note that it is natural for appliqued items to gently fray over time, this is not a fault and adds a pretty effect.Not recommended to tumble dry. \r\n\r\nThe other important bits- Safety is particularly important when it comes to children's clothing/accessories. This item should be well secured at either end when hung in a child's room and preferably out of reach of busy fingers, please remember that bunting is after all a long string and could pose a strangling hazard. The bias string has been double stitched with the triangle seams folded in-between for extra sturdiness throughout the whole bunting.","options":[{"id":45990738,"name":"6 triangles","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":42112761,"name":"7 triangles","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":42112764,"name":"8 triangles","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":42112767,"name":"9 triangles","price":24.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":42112770,"name":"10 triangles","price":26.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":42112773,"name":"11 triangles","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":42112776,"name":"12 triangles","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123887760/-/bunting_too_big.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123887760/-/bunting_too_big.jpg","width":1393,"height":1417},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123887781/-/bunting_close_too_big.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123887781/-/bunting_close_too_big.jpg","width":1417,"height":939},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121997463/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121997463/-/image.jpg","width":2592,"height":1936}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5933727,"name":"Special bits for nursery&home","permalink":"special-bits-for-nursery-home","url":"/category/special-bits-for-nursery-home"}]},{"id":13177242,"name":"Swan Tutu","permalink":"swan-tutu","position":3,"price":27.0,"default_price":27.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/swan-tutu","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-26T12:11:06.000Z","description":"Mae-anna's favourite design to date.
