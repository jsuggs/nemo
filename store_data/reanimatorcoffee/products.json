Method:</b> Ferment and Wash\r\n\r\n<b>Tasting Notes:</b> Up front, this Nic has a complex, sweet aroma with delicate floral notes and hints of honey and almonds. In the cup, the sweetness from the aroma carries through into a clean, bright coffee that is maple syrup sweet. The coffee finishes with a clean, tart brightness with light hints of bittersweet cocoa.\r\n\r\n<b>About The Bean:</b> This bean was hand harvested at the Prodecoop in the Nueva Segovia region of Nicaragua. Prodecoop is actually a cooperative organization which is comprised of many small farms throughout the region. Each producer naturally fermented the coffee cherries to remove the fruit, washed the beans with water and sun dried them. The ferment and wash method produces a clean flavor profile that removes outlying flavors and highlights the best taste that the bean has to offer.","options":[{"id":13761092,"name":"Local Delivery","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13761104,"name":"Shipped Outside Philadelphia","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47833685/-/photo.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47833685/-/photo.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2090408,"name":"Coffee!","permalink":"coffee","url":"/category/coffee"}]}]
