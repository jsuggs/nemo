Our very first dual-lens shades, Frogskins offer all the clarity and protection of High Definition Optics®, along with the comfort of lightweight and stress-resistant O Matter™ frame material. With hues named for areas and features in the Rocky Mountains, the five available designs have a matte finish and Oakley logos from yesteryear to honor the origins of style and originality.\r\n\r\nLens colors were carefully chosen to complement the fresh frame hues. The Aspen Green frame comes with Emerald Iridium® lenses that help you maintain color recognition by balancing light on sunny days. In the Pike’s Gold and Mesa Orange frames, Fire Iridium lenses enhance visual contrast and improve depth perception, and the lens color is tuned for bright sun. The same benefits apply to the Blue Iridium lenses in the Artesian Blue frame, and the lens color works best in bright light. For the Basin Red frame, we chose Pink Iridium to give you better contrast in weak sunlight.\r\n\r\nFrogskins aren’t just for leading today’s look with smooth retro style. They carry premium optics, courtesy of Plutonite® lens material that maintains superior clarity while filtering out all ultraviolet light – not just UVA and UVB. And with Oakley HDO® lenses featured in every frame, you’ll have sharp and accurate vision with optical performance and impact resistance rated at ANSI Z87.1, the high mark of today’s standards.\r\n\r\nEach sunglass comes with a Microclear™ masterpiece — a storage bag with custom Oakley art.

Together they went back to vintage styles like the original Oakley FROGSKINS® then set out to distill their own vision of American cool. HOLBROOK is a timeless classic that echoes the screen heroes from the 1940s, 50s and 60s, the icons who inspired youth with their own brand of defiance. Who was the legend? He was sometimes a loner and sometimes a leader, an everyman who lived by a code, stood up for what was right and did what needed to be done. You wouldn’t call him a man’s man because that macho crap meant nothing to him. What you saw was what you got, including dust from the open road and a look that said he might be gone tomorrow because nothing could hold him.\r\n\r\nThe name “HOLBROOK” came from a similar inspiration. HOLBROOK is a small town found along historic Route 66 in Arizona that sits on the outskirts of the painted desert and the petrified forest. It’s a classic western badland that epitomizes a spirit of exploration and adventure found in those traveling along Highway 66 in the 50’s and 60’s.\r\n\r\nMetal bolts and icons highlight the stress-resistant O MATTER® frame, a comfortably lightweight design with pure PLUTONITE® lenses that filter out every ray of UV. Optical precision and impact resistance meet ANSI Z87.1 standards to give you superior clarity and protection. Multiple lens/frame combinations are available. Choose one with Oakley HDPolarized lenses for filtering that cuts more than 99% of reflected glare. The versions that come with IRIDIUM® lens coating reduce even more glare while balancing light transmission.

Our very first dual-lens shades, Frogskins offer all the clarity and protection of High Definition Optics®, along with the comfort of lightweight and stress-resistant O Matter™ frame material. With hues named for areas and features in the Rocky Mountains, the five available designs have a matte finish and Oakley logos from yesteryear to honor the origins of style and originality.\r\n\r\nLens colors were carefully chosen to complement the fresh frame hues. The Aspen Green frame comes with Emerald Iridium® lenses that help you maintain color recognition by balancing light on sunny days. In the Pike’s Gold and Mesa Orange frames, Fire Iridium lenses enhance visual contrast and improve depth perception, and the lens color is tuned for bright sun. The same benefits apply to the Blue Iridium lenses in the Artesian Blue frame, and the lens color works best in bright light. For the Basin Red frame, we chose Pink Iridium to give you better contrast in weak sunlight.\r\n\r\nFrogskins aren’t just for leading today’s look with smooth retro style. They carry premium optics, courtesy of Plutonite® lens material that maintains superior clarity while filtering out all ultraviolet light – not just UVA and UVB. And with Oakley HDO® lenses featured in every frame, you’ll have sharp and accurate vision with optical performance and impact resistance rated at ANSI Z87.1, the high mark of today’s standards.\r\n\r\nEach sunglass comes with a Microclear™ masterpiece — a storage bag with custom Oakley art. A special textile ensures it’s gentle on lenses, so it’s handy for keeping the optics clean.\r\n\r\nFrame:\r\n\r\nDurability and all-day comfort of lightweight, stress-resistant O Matter™ frame material\r\nClassic logo highlight on each earstem\r\n\r\nLenses:\r\n\r\nHigh Definition Optics for clarity, visual fidelity and impact resistance that meets all ANSI Z87.1 standards\r\nXYZ Optics® to extend clarity to the edge of a wide peripheral view\r\nUV protection of Plutonite® lens material that filters out 100% of UVA / UVB / UVC & harmful blue light up to 400nm\r\nIridium coated lenses that reduce glare and balance light transmission\r\n","options":[{"id":32624365,"name":"Default","price":85.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102581548/-/blue_Iridium.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102581548/-/blue_Iridium.jpg","width":750,"height":350}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5016691,"name":"Sunglasses","permalink":"sunglasses","url":"/category/sunglasses"}]},{"id":14657673,"name":"Volcom Hernan II Jacket - Green","permalink":"volcom-hernan-ii-jacket-green","position":62,"price":89.0,"default_price":89.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/volcom-hernan-ii-jacket-green","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-06T11:53:47.000Z","description":"Features:\r\nMens hooded jacket\r\nAdjustable hood with drawstrings and leather stoppers\r\nZip up fastening\r\nSingle zipped chest pocket\r\nTwo hand pockets\r\nRibbed cuffs and hem\r\nDiagonal seam placement at back\r\nInterior chest pocket\r\nWoven logo patch on the right side\r\nMaterial: 100% polyester\r\n","options":[{"id":47476785,"name":"Small","price":89.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.99,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127096806/-/Volcom_Green.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127096806/-/Volcom_Green.jpg","width":1200,"height":1200},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127096809/-/volcomHernan2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127096809/-/volcomHernan2.jpg","width":1200,"height":1200},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127096815/-/volcomHernan3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127096815/-/volcomHernan3.jpg","width":1200,"height":1200}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
