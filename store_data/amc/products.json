He has allowed \"Candy Ass\" to retain a timeless electronic sound by using both modern and older equipment, layering and interweaving his soundscapes over beds of percussion and drum loops to make some of his most beautiful songs. He also includes three acoustic based tracks including \"Sleeping Beauty\" which has become a current staple of his recent live solo shows. The instrumental tracks of the new album are taken from an original film soundtrack Eitzel has been commissioned to score (title tba) at the beginning of this year.","options":[{"id":619408,"name":"Default","price":3.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":44,"name":"Uruguay","code":"UY"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":181,"name":"Peru","code":"PE"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":180,"name":"Paraguay","code":"PY"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":13,"name":"Ecuador","code":"EC"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":2,"name":"Argentina","code":"AR"}},{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":7.5,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":8,"name":"Chile","code":"CL"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":62,"name":"Belize","code":"BZ"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":97,"name":"El Salvador","code":"SV"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":118,"name":"Guatemala","code":"GT"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":84,"name":"Colombia","code":"CO"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":124,"name":"Honduras","code":"HN"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":45,"name":"Venezuela","code":"VE"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":169,"name":"Nicaragua","code":"NI"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":213,"name":"Suriname","code":"SR"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":10,"name":"Costa Rica","code":"CR"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":178,"name":"Panama","code":"PA"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":106,"name":"French Guiana","code":"GF"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":66,"name":"Bolivia","code":"BO"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/740280/-/candyass.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/740280/-/candyass.jpg","width":300,"height":274}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":129995,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":174701,"name":"AMC: Mercury Band Demos CD","permalink":"amc-mercury-band-demos-cd","position":3,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/amc-mercury-band-demos-cd","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-10-29T08:21:07.000Z","description":"The Mercury Band Demos from 1992\r\n\r\n1.
