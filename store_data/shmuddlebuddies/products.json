First, they go to the Hollywood Farmerâ€™s Market and pick out the ripest, most delicious fruit they can find. Then they go back to Grandma's house, where they make some lemonade and bake the fruit into mini pies. Finally, they pack everything up, and take it to Griffith Park for a picnic! After their picnic, they walk next to Fern Dell, where it is nice and cool. They look at all the trees, birds, and critters. It's the perfect day. \r\n\r\nPetunia Bunny is 17\" tall, and is made of organic cotton. Her dress and bloomers are made of organic, hand-dyed merino wool. Her ears are lined with vintage cotton fabric. She has plastic safety eyes, and is stuffed with recycled fiberfill. Petunia has two small plastic buttons, which makes her unsuitable for children under 3. Without the buttons, she is suitable for children of all ages.

Any Shmuddle Buddy can be customized with organic wool stuffing. \r\n\r\nOur wool comes from happy sheep raised on small American farms. The farmers shear the fleece and send it to a 100-year-old cooperative near Mt. Shasta, California and Ashland, Oregon. The folks at the mill process it using mild, biodegradable detergent, and then send it to us. Thatâ€™s it. No chemicals. No factories. \r\n\r\nOur wool is naturally dust-mite repellant and hypoallergenic. Itâ€™s GOTS-certified by the Oregon Tilth.
