This boxed set contains one 4-ounce jar of each of the following gems:\r\n\r\nPacific Berry - A rare berry exclusive to the Republic of Jam, this jam is typically sold out more quickly than we can produce it. As fate would have it, a forgotten batch of flash-frozen berries from this summer recently turned up in the farmer's freezer, enabling us to offer it to you one last time until next summer's crop.\r\n\r\nQuince Maple - An ancient fruit, the quince is more commonly associated with exotic locales like Turkey, Morocco or Persia -- but they also grow here in Oregon. The fruit, which requires hours of cooking to make into jam, has a strong floral scent and a delicate flavor.\r\n\r\nRed Currant Chutney - We've combined these little jewels of fruit with mustard seed and cider vinegar to make a tangy, savory chutney perfect to serve alongside your Christmas ham or a pork tenderloin.\r\n\r\nHuckleberry - Because huckleberries are nearly impossible to cultivate, they must be painstakingly wild-picked and are typically blended with other more commonplace fruits to make jams. Not so in the Republic: ours is all huckleberry, all the time. We've never been able to offer a huckleberry jam before, and we don't know when or if we'll be able to do it again -- so it's exclusively available only in this boxed set.\r\n\r\nIf you are shipping to multiple addresses, complete a separate order for each address.\r\n\r\nTo include a note with your gift, click on the \"Note to seller\" link during checkout.","options":[{"id":50757339,"name":"Default","price":29.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129500553/-/wild_blackberry.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129500553/-/wild_blackberry.jpg","width":234,"height":215}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3509979,"name":"Currant","permalink":"currant","url":"/category/currant"},{"id":2350689,"name":"Pacific Berry","permalink":"pacific-berry","url":"/category/pacific-berry"},{"id":2621005,"name":"Misc Cool Stuff","permalink":"misc-cool-stuff","url":"/category/misc-cool-stuff"}]},{"id":14721123,"name":"Shake: A New Perspective on Cocktails (recipe book)","permalink":"shake-a-new-perspective-on-cocktails-recipe-book","position":3,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/shake-a-new-perspective-on-cocktails-recipe-book","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-09T00:06:48.000Z","description":"Shake is a unique cocktail book that expresses a seasonal and straightforward approach to drinks and entertaining, and reminds us that mixing cocktails should be simple, social, and, above all, fun.

It has a rich, creamy, molasses-like flavor which enhances baked goods. The large grains remain crunchy through cooking, which makes demerara sugar a great choice of sprinkled topping on scones and similar dishes which might otherwise have a uniform texture.\r\n\r\nPure Demerara sugar is aged with bourbon- and coffee liqueur-soaked vanilla beans to make this treat. We use these exceptional beans in all of our vanilla jams.\r\n\r\nComes in an adorable, reuseable jar.\r\n\r\nTry it: Over scones, sprinkled on cookies, French toast or fresh berries\r\n","options":[{"id":49582797,"name":"Default","price":5.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129320478/-/fotor_(3).jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129320478/-/fotor_(3).jpg","width":1632,"height":1631}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2621005,"name":"Misc Cool Stuff","permalink":"misc-cool-stuff","url":"/category/misc-cool-stuff"},{"id":6893253,"name":"RoJ Confections","permalink":"roj-confections","url":"/category/roj-confections"}]},{"id":2989405,"name":"Gift Box/Mailer","permalink":"gift-box-mailer","position":87,"price":2.0,"default_price":2.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/gift-box-mailer","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-12-07T09:11:22.000Z","description":"A sturdy black gift box with the Republic of Jam logo.
