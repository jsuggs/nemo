And I think to let some one know your love is very important case for the couple. Actually I heard from one of my female friends.\r\n\r\nShe was proposed. But of course not in this ancient and formal western way, in china, a proposal is not that clearly shown to people's mind. Mostly couples just pay more attention to their wedding ceremony which is regarded as the most important ceremonies of a person.\r\n\r\nBut I think this moment is such a sweet thing for them, and it's a very serious thing which deserves a good show.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I made two works about proposal. This is one of them I would like to show you first :)\r\n\r\nThis work took about 12 hours app in total. I found some info about western proposal online and in my mind this way is a very good way. do you think so?\r\n\r\nThis work is about 22cm in square.
