Many think of her as the Buddhist Madonna and Saviouress of the East. Her names are as numerous as those of Mother Mary and her title and office as a Goddess denotes her level of attainment as a Cosmic Being.\r\nTo the people of Japan she is known as Kannon and in China her name is Guanyin. You may have heard of her as Miao Shan, a legendary Chinese Princess known for her great compassion or by her popular Tibetan and Mongolian name of Tara.\r\nKuan Yin is a bodhisattva, a being of wisdom destined to become a Buddha. She has taken the vow of a bodhisattva to save all beings from suffering by forgoing the final state of Buddhahood. Scholar Robert Thurman explains these celestial saviors saying:\r\nBodhisattvas are truly messianic figures, spiritual heroes and heroines willing to sacrifice themselves for others life after life. At the same time, they are keen to develop the wisdom that understands reality and the art to be effective in saving beings. 2\r\nKuan Yin is called the Goddess of Mercy because she embodies the flame of mercy and compassion. We can pray to her not only for comfort, healing, guidance and succor but also for mercy, compassion, and forgiveness. She shows us through the flame of forgiveness how to free ourselves from all hardness of heart and teaches us to have compassion for all. She comes as the Mother to dispel all maya (illusion).\r\nThe age of Aquarius is dawning. Mystics and sages say this is the age for the awakening of our understanding of God as Mother. It is the age for the raising of the Mother flame. Kuan Yin teaches us the safest way to accomplish this is through prayer and devotion to God.\r\nThere are many legends surrounding this celestial bodhisattva. One particularly beautiful one illustrates how Kuan Yin, more appropriately known as Kuan-shih-yin, came to be known as such. Her name means \"one who regards, looks on, or hears the sounds of the world.\" The legend says Kuan Yin paused on the threshold of heaven as she was about to enter when she heard the anguished cries of the world. Out of compassion for the suffering of others, she turned and vowed to remain and help those in need for however long this may take. The bodhisattva vow is a sacred and holy vow and not one to be taken lightly. Kuan Yin is a nurturing Mother and the love and compassion she has for all is truly great.\r\nThe following mantra is associated with her:\r\nMantra:\r\nOM MANI PADME HUM\r\nEnglish translation:\r\nOM!

Titanium molecules are bonded to the quartz by the natural elector-static charge of the crystal. Titanium is one of the strongest and most beautiful of all metals. As you can see the colors of this stone are just beautiful. With most crystals the vibrations do the healing. However, the healing properties are a little different with this crystal. Even though it shares the same properties as the Clear Quartz, it is the colors of this crystal that actually grant it enhanced healing powers.\r\n\r\nThe vibrational energy, along with the color of this crystal has the ability to heal the human energy field. Together they merge with the aura to release any energy blocks and patch up holes in the aura with the appropriate color. It enhances ones physical vitality and brings more energy into the auric field.

The meaning of the Thunderbird as a Native American symbol varies according to the tribe (geographic location). This page discusses the Thunderbird symbol as viewed by the sacred eye of the beholder: The prime people of North America who held a vision of glory and power concerning this Spirit Bird.\r\nAlmost universally, the Thunderbird as a Native American symbol conveys concepts such as:\r\n\r\n    Power\r\n    Provision\r\n    Expansiveness\r\n    Transformation\r\n    Divine Dominion\r\n    Indomitable Spirit\r\n    Unquestioned Authority\r\n    Messages from the Otherworlds\r\n\r\nThere are several variations in Native traditions about the Thunderbird.\r\nSome tribes view the Thunderbird as an omen of war. When quaking peals of thunder rattle the heavens, it's a sign the spirits are warring in the skies. This was also a foretelling of victory for tribal wars fought on the ground - particularly when ritual ceremonies and dances were reverently adhered to.\r\nWhen the cry of the Thunderbird was heard (in the form of thunder in the skies) war huts were constructed to begin ceremonial processions. These huts were always made with the wood of the cedar tree, sacred to the Thunderbird. War dances by the Iroquois and Shawnee must be performed to exact precision in order to appease the rousted Thunderbird and insure victory in battle.\r\nTobacco (also sacred to the Thunderbird) would be smoked in intricate ceremonial order. The effects of the smoke would lift Native souls to the heavens where braves would encounter the Thunderbird in spirit-journeying; further bolstering the warrior's heart and insuring triumph against foe.\r\nOther, more peace-keeping tribes viewed the Thunderbird as supreme Nature Spirit and a solar animal. It's eyes were said to be made from the sun, and upon waking in the morning, the Thunderbird issued the dawning day. Alternatively when Thunderbird retired at night, its sleepily closing eyes marked the solar dusk.\r\nAnother Native tale indicates lightning jetting out of the eyes of the Thunderbird when angered (during storms), and deafening cracks of thunder were produced when it flapped its mighty wings.\r\nAs a Native American symbol of creation, the Thunderbird marks the separation between the heavens and the earth. Moreover, in Northwestern tribes the Thunderbird is known as the Skyamsen, and is the dominating force of all natural activity.\r\nIn this perspective, the Thunderbird is the Creator, Destroyer and Controller of Nature and must be honored and appeased at all cost. This is where we see a connection to rain as the Thunderbird is the bringer of life-giving waters (so agriculture may thrive and provide to the tribe). Countless ceremonies are conducted in honor of the great rain-bringer as a way to insure continued food supply.\r\nThe Eagle is often a Native American symbol that represents the Thunderbird. I've heard stories of various Native clans of the Great Lakes regions using Eagle feathers in headdresses and ritual dances as a personification of the great Thunderbird. In this way shapeshifting/animism/shamanic journeying is facilitated.\r\nMy same source told me stories of the Thunderbird (in the form of the Eagle) wages constant battle with a massive water Serpent. This horned Serpent is said to be quite nefarious and bodes ill-will against humankind.\r\nThe Thunderbird dives into the waters, seeking out the serpent to vanquish it from the Great Lakes in order to protect humans. The battles between the Eagle (Thunderbird) and the Serpent results in raging waters and brewing storms.\r\nPerhaps the most breath-taking specimen of the Thunderbird symbol is atop traditional Totem Poles of the Pacific Northwest Coast (Alaska, Oregon & Washington in the USA and the NW coast of Canada known as the British Columbian province). The more familiar native Nations of this region include: Tlingit and Haida.\r\nIn the sacred circles of wisdom among these NW coastal tribes, the Thunderbird perches regally atom Totem Poles to denote ultimate status - an ascended emblem of power and supreme chief among the Native pantheon of natural spirit energies.\r\nInterestingly, Totem Poles are traditionally made from the cedar tree, and the cedar is sacred to the Thunderbird.\r\nLegend states the Thunderbird dwells in regal solitude in mystic cedar forests, where no man may enter. There, the Thunderbird rules the activity of the skies. It's also said the Thunderbird smokes tobacco from cedar pipes - and this is where we get the link between the Thunderbird and tobacco.\r\nThe Haida created elaborate masks in the image of the Thunderbird. During ritual, these masks are worn and the beaks would open to reveal the human face of the wearer. This is a symbolic statement that underscores the of the Haida belief in the human soul taking on the Thunderbird form.\r\nSome Haida stories tell that great hunters and honored elders of the tribe would be visited by the Thunderbird upon his deathbed, and the great bird would fly his soul to the great mystic cedar forests where he would be stay as a guest of honor (and get to smoke good tobacco for the rest of his days in the spirit world). \r\nInfo from :- http://www.whats-your-sign.com/thunderbird-native-american-symbol.html\r\n","options":[{"id":33341851,"name":"White Bone - white
