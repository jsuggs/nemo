Mark Hosford playfully alludes to the Surrealists’ idea that psychological truths can be revealed through drawing. In his Rorschach drawings, he takes for his starting point light gray ink jet blots, which were invented to help psychologists lead their patients to reveal repressed meanings through free association. Hosford transforms these symmetrical organic forms by inlaying penciled-in images of his own eccentric devising; monstrous creatures and hybrid beings reminiscent of the dark animation of the Brothers Quay and Jan Švankmajer. Hosford’s vibrant and meticulous screenprints focus on investigations of the human condition, utilizing a stylistic amalgamation of his childhood affinity for comics, animation, punk, metal, tattoo, horror, sci-fi, street art, and counter culture.
