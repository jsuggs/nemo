Archival, four-color, location photography along with ingredient information make the Big Easy easy to tackle in home kitchens. Cooks will salivate over the 200 recipes that honor and celebrate everything New Orleans. Bite by bite John Besh brings us New Orleans cooking like we've never tasted before. It's the perfect blend of contemporary French techniques with indigenous Southern Louisiana products and know-how. His amazing new offering is exclusively brought to fans and foodies everywhere by Andrews McMeel.

Author Lanie Goodman has gathered a collection of 14 amazing properties which sum up all that is French and romantic, from the city streets of Paris to Megeve in the French Alps, from the windswept coast of Normandy, to the heart of Provence and the sunbaked shores of the Riviera. There are classic country houses which have been in the same family for generations, tiny boltholes, city apartments, quirky seaside homes, and more. Each home has its own individual character, reflecting the people who live there and their passions. The book is divided into four chapters: Chateaux which covers castles, chateaux, grand country houses, and town houses; Bastides which features old manors and farmhouses; Maisons Bohemes which includes bohemian artist's, writer's, and seaside homes; and Paysannes and Pavilions, which focuses on small and simple, thrifty and humble town houses and country houses.

Collections for London’s Liberty department store made their name, with designs like Bauhaus (1972) deemed a significant turning point, paving the way for a vibrant new aesthetic. Their work at this point included prints, furnishing and dress textiles, and famously Liberty’s noted scarves, and many of their designs were widely licenced and became ubiquitous.\r\n\r\nBy the late 1970s, they had added wallpaper designs to their repertoire, and in 1979 established themselves as an independent partnership (their work for Liberty had been marketed uncredited). Their client list includes names like Yves St Laurent, habitat, and Marks & Spencer, and the quality of their work has been recognized by the V&A Museum in London (where 33 of their designs are held in the permanent collection). A long-term US association with Martex saw their patterns grace widely distributed designer bedding—which even made an appearance in Seinfeld. A successful attempt to develop their brand saw them broaden this client base, and sales in the US are now worth millions of dollars annually.\r\n\r\nAll of their patterns have been preserved. Staggering in its scale (over 25,000 patterns to date) the Collier- Campbell Archive is the permanent record of this astonishingly fruitful collaboration.\r\nIt is from here that the imagery of THE COLLIER –CAMPBELL ARCHIVE will be drawn. Hundreds of designs—some obscure, many instantly recognizable—will form an essential reference for designers, fashionistas and students alike. There will be exclusive commentary from Collier and Campbell themselves, and the voices of key collaborators and experts in the field will cement their deserved reputation as one of the key creative partnerships in modern design.\r\n\r\nHardcover: 320 pages\r\nProduct Dimensions: 1.6 x 12 x 11.8 inches","options":[{"id":42092394,"name":"Default","price":120.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":48.0,"amount_with_others":45.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123332871/-/CollierCampbell-Archive-book-cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123332871/-/CollierCampbell-Archive-book-cover.jpg","width":604,"height":605}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2043656,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":13181139,"name":"Interiors","permalink":"interiors","position":77,"price":49.95,"default_price":49.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/interiors","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-26T17:13:50.000Z","description":"Inspiring interiors from well-known figures in the design world.","options":[{"id":42092259,"name":"Default","price":49.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":48.0,"amount_with_others":45.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123332712/-/interiors.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123332712/-/interiors.jpg","width":260,"height":344}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2043656,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":13181079,"name":"Junk Style","permalink":"junk-style","position":78,"price":21.95,"default_price":21.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/junk-style","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-26T17:09:13.000Z","description":"Junk style is a modern and unique decorating style that is eclectic but selective. Pieces of furniture and accessories sourced from markets and second-hand shops are chosen for their intrinsic beauty, whether this derives from the quality of workmanship, quirky styling, or the colors and textures created by the patina of age. The overall look is neither too contrived nor too precious: things can be mismatched, patched or frayed to create a 'shabby chic' effect that combines elegance and individuality. Melanie has a keen eye for junk style and is constantly on the lookout for second-hand objects that can be given new life; her book offers both inspiration and advice on how to achieve it.\r\n\r\nPaperback: 143 pages\r\nProduct Dimensions: 9.6 x 7.1 x 0.7 inches","options":[{"id":42092061,"name":"Default","price":21.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":48.0,"amount_with_others":45.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123332550/-/junkstyle.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123332550/-/junkstyle.jpg","width":410,"height":410}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2043656,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":13181043,"name":"Elizabeth Peyton: Here She Comes Now","permalink":"elizabeth-peyton-here-she-comes-now","position":79,"price":49.95,"default_price":49.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/elizabeth-peyton-here-she-comes-now","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-26T17:06:03.000Z","description":"Elizabeth Peyton rose to fame in the early 1990s as a painter energetically renewing portraiture's relationship to popular culture. Consciously locating her work in the tradition of nineteenth-century painters of society and celebrity such as Manet, Peyton uses a loose, sensuous figuration to portray the young, the famous and the glamorous of our times. Alongside portraits of royalty and artist friends, she has become particularly famed for her portraits of musicians. This publication groups together her portraits of rock musicians such as David Bowie, Kurt Cobain, Jarvis Cocker, Pete Doherty, Noel and Liam Gallagher, John Lydon and Keith Richards, and opera singers such as Jessye Norman, Jonas Kaufmann and Ludwig Schnorr von Carolsfeld--depicted not in traditional poses, but in performance. Based on snapshots or archival photographs, these portraits express Peyton's intensive examination of the vulnerability of live artistic creation. The source photographs are presented here en face with the final works, surveying oil paintings and works on paper from the last 20 years.\r\n\r\nHardcover: 112 pages\r\nProduct Dimensions: 11.7 x 9.2 x 0.6 inches","options":[{"id":42091977,"name":"Default","price":49.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":48.0,"amount_with_others":45.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123332430/-/peyton.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123332430/-/peyton.jpg","width":260,"height":328}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2043656,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":12959811,"name":"Art Deco Complete","permalink":"art-deco-complete","position":80,"price":125.0,"default_price":125.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/art-deco-complete","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-14T15:20:23.000Z","description":"Art Deco Complete is the last word in Art Deco, the most glamorous decorative arts style, and the one that shaped popular ideas of modern luxury.
