This spinning fibre is both Organic and Fair Trade, it comes from Peru. Organic cotton is gorgeous to spin with, just make sure you have your wheel set up to spin at a fairly fast pace, and use a long-draw method (I use assisted long-draw). I have been spinning almost exclusively with organic cotton for the past few years, except for the occasional dip into bamboo, soysilk, ingeo, linen etc., and I love it more and more. This may be too challenging to a new spinner, in which case you may want to try some of the other fibres available here. but don't worry, cotton is not as hard to spin as you might think, just take your time, and enjoy.\r\n\r\nAfter spinning cotton, you can boil it in plain, untreated water to set the twist. With naturally pigmented cottons like this one, the colour will slightly deepen the longer you boil it. (5 minutes to 2 hours). The colour also gently 'cures' over time and sets in to an even deeper, richer tone.","options":[{"id":44966085,"name":"50g","price":48.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.49,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":7.9,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125354991/-/IMG_4189.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125354991/-/IMG_4189.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125354970/-/IMG_4187.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125354970/-/IMG_4187.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125354982/-/IMG_4188.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125354982/-/IMG_4188.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3885015,"name":"Spinning Fibre","permalink":"spinning-fibre","url":"/category/spinning-fibre"},{"id":3887202,"name":"Spinning Fibre - Organic Fair Trade Cotton","permalink":"spinning-fibre-organic-fair-trade-cotton","url":"/category/spinning-fibre-organic-fair-trade-cotton"},{"id":6236268,"name":"Pakucho","permalink":"pakucho","url":"/category/pakucho"},{"id":6236280,"name":"Pakucho - Spinning Fibre","permalink":"pakucho-spinning-fibre","url":"/category/pakucho-spinning-fibre"}]},{"id":13787016,"name":"Jumbo Stitch Markers - Feather","permalink":"jumbo-stitch-markers-feather","position":23,"price":14.0,"default_price":14.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/jumbo-stitch-markers-feather","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-25T19:13:14.000Z","description":"I made these stitch markers using Fair Trade recycled glass beads. \r\nThe set includes one feather marker to use in projects that require a centre or end of round marker.

Indigo is the only natural dye that makes blue. If you are unfamiliar with indigo, you probably wear it on a regular basis, since it is used to dye blue jeans. However, nowadays denim is typically dyed using a synthetic form of indigo. This yarn was dyed using natural indigo. The colour varies gently through the skein so your project will have a nice hand-dyed look to it. The process of dyeing naturally takes time, indigo dyeing is a unique and interesting process. First a reduction is carefully made (a concentrate), and the yarn is prepared by scouring, and then a number of steps have to be made before the yarn is introduced to the dyebath including adjustment of the ph. The neat part is, that when the yarn is in the dye, it is a clear yellowish colour, and only after it is removed and exposed to air does it turn blue! Repeated dipping allows for deeper shades.\r\n\r\nThis yarn is EKO Certified Organic by Control Union/SKAL & Certified FairTrade, it comes from Peru Naturtex, and it is hand dyed in small batches at the Vegan Yarn studio in New Westminster, BC, Canada.","options":[{"id":41514258,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.49,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":7.9,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122891487/-/IMG_3877.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122891487/-/IMG_3877.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122891484/-/IMG_3876.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122891484/-/IMG_3876.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122891481/-/IMG_3875.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122891481/-/IMG_3875.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122891493/-/IMG_3878.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122891493/-/IMG_3878.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3885012,"name":"Yarn","permalink":"yarn","url":"/category/yarn"},{"id":4831975,"name":"Yarn - Arcturus Worsted","permalink":"yarn-arcturus-worsted","url":"/category/yarn-arcturus-worsted"}]},{"id":12949455,"name":"Thrift Shop","permalink":"thrift-shop","position":51,"price":27.0,"default_price":27.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/thrift-shop","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-14T00:39:13.000Z","description":"Alnilam Series\r\n\r\n51% Organically Grown Cotton \r\n49% Bamboo \r\nWorsted \r\n201 m/220 yds \r\n100 g/3.5 oz \r\n20 sts per 10cm/4” on 4.5-5.5mm or US 7-9\r\n\r\nHand painted using low-impact dyes.\r\n\r\nInspired the song Thrift Shop, by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis.

The process of naturally dyeing yarn takes more time and effort, but its worth it, knowing that no harmful chemicals were used in the process.\r\n\r\nThis yarn is EKO Certified Organic by Control Union/SKAL & Certified FairTrade, it comes from Peru Naturtex, and it is hand dyed in small batches at the Vegan Yarn studio in New Westminster, BC, Canada.","options":[{"id":38154630,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.49,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":7.9,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/118764438/-/IMG_3745.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/118764438/-/IMG_3745.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/118764390/-/IMG_3743_2.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/118764390/-/IMG_3743_2.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/118764414/-/IMG_3744.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/118764414/-/IMG_3744.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/118764474/-/IMG_3746.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/118764474/-/IMG_3746.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/118764510/-/IMG_3748_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/118764510/-/IMG_3748_2.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3885012,"name":"Yarn","permalink":"yarn","url":"/category/yarn"},{"id":3886917,"name":"Yarn - Capella Sport","permalink":"yarn-capella-sport","url":"/category/yarn-capella-sport"}]},{"id":11850585,"name":"Deep Blue - Sirius","permalink":"deep-blue-sirius","position":64,"price":45.5,"default_price":45.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/deep-blue-sirius","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-18T00:44:14.000Z","description":"Sirius Series\r\n\r\n100% Organically Grown Cotton \r\nBulky \r\n293 m/320 yds \r\n225 g/8 oz \r\n16 sts per 10cm/4” on 5-5.5mm or 8-9 US\r\n\r\nHand painted using low-impact dyes\r\n\r\nThis yarn is EKO Certified Organic by Control Union/SKAL & Certified FairTrade, it comes from Peru Naturtex, and it is hand dyed in small batches at the Vegan Yarn studio in New Westminster, BC, Canada.","options":[{"id":37469973,"name":"Default","price":45.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.49,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":7.9,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116706570/-/IMG_3732.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116706570/-/IMG_3732.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116706534/-/IMG_3731.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116706534/-/IMG_3731.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116706582/-/IMG_3733.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116706582/-/IMG_3733.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116706618/-/IMG_3734.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116706618/-/IMG_3734.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116706642/-/IMG_3736_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116706642/-/IMG_3736_2.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3885012,"name":"Yarn","permalink":"yarn","url":"/category/yarn"},{"id":4143018,"name":"Yarn - Sirius Bulky","permalink":"yarn-sirius-bulky","url":"/category/yarn-sirius-bulky"}]},{"id":11792562,"name":"Sock DPN Maki - Needle Case - Green & Gold","permalink":"sock-dpn-maki-needle-case-green-gold","position":65,"price":31.0,"default_price":31.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sock-dpn-maki-needle-case-green-gold","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-14T18:51:51.000Z","description":"Handmade (sewn by Heidi)\r\n\r\nOrganic cotton hand-printed with natural, plant-based dyes.\r\n\r\nDPN maki has eight pockets for your sock needles, it measures 8\" x 13\" fully open.

Indigo is the only natural dye that makes blue. If you are unfamiliar with indigo, you probably wear it on a regular basis, since it is used to dye blue jeans. However, nowadays denim is typically dyed using a synthetic form of indigo. This yarn was dyed using natural indigo. The colour varies gently through the skein so your project will have a nice hand-dyed look to it. The process of dyeing naturally takes time, indigo dyeing is a unique and interesting process. First a reduction is carefully made (a concentrate), and the yarn is prepared by scouring, and then a number of steps have to be made before the yarn is introduced to the dyebath including adjustment of the ph. The neat part is, that when the yarn is in the dye, it is a clear yellowish colour, and only after it is removed and exposed to air does it turn blue! Repeated dipping allows for deeper shades.\r\n\r\nThis yarn is EKO Certified Organic by Control Union/SKAL & Certified FairTrade, it comes from Peru Naturtex, and it is hand dyed in small batches at the Vegan Yarn studio in New Westminster, BC, Canada.","options":[{"id":31866982,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.49,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":7.8,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100050145/-/IMG_3406.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100050145/-/IMG_3406.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100050223/-/IMG_3407.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100050223/-/IMG_3407.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100050319/-/IMG_3409.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100050319/-/IMG_3409.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100050415/-/IMG_3410.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100050415/-/IMG_3410.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100050499/-/IMG_3411_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100050499/-/IMG_3411_2.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3885012,"name":"Yarn","permalink":"yarn","url":"/category/yarn"},{"id":3886917,"name":"Yarn - Capella Sport","permalink":"yarn-capella-sport","url":"/category/yarn-capella-sport"}]},{"id":10156240,"name":"Calcifer","permalink":"calcifer","position":94,"price":24.5,"default_price":24.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/calcifer","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-26T02:46:49.000Z","description":"Pleiades Series\r\n\r\nBamboo 55%, Cotton 24%, Elastic 21% \r\nFingering/Sock Weight \r\n345 m/377 yds \r\n100 g/3.5 oz\r\n\r\nHand painted using low-impact dyes.","options":[{"id":31778917,"name":"Default","price":24.5,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.49,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":7.8,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99781807/-/IMG_3401.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99781807/-/IMG_3401.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99781711/-/IMG_3400.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99781711/-/IMG_3400.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99781939/-/IMG_3402_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99781939/-/IMG_3402_2.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99782071/-/IMG_3405.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99782071/-/IMG_3405.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3885012,"name":"Yarn","permalink":"yarn","url":"/category/yarn"},{"id":3888237,"name":"Yarn - Pleiades Sock","permalink":"yarn-pleiades-sock","url":"/category/yarn-pleiades-sock"}]},{"id":9954685,"name":"Osage - Arcturus","permalink":"osage-arcturus","position":95,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/osage-arcturus","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-03-15T22:12:59.000Z","description":"Arcturus Series\r\n\r\n100% Organically Grown Cotton\r\nWorsted Weight\r\n80m/88yds\r\n50g / 1.76 oz\r\nWorsted Weight\r\n\r\nHand dyed using plant based pigments and natural mordants.\r\n\r\nI dyed this yarn using osage wood chips. \r\nThe colour varies gently through the skein so your project will have a nice hand-dyed look to it.

The process of naturally dyeing yarn takes more time and effort, but its worth it, knowing that no harmful chemicals were used in the process.\r\n\r\nThis yarn is EKO Certified Organic by Control Union/SKAL & Certified FairTrade, it comes from Peru Naturtex, and it is hand dyed in small batches at the Vegan Yarn studio in New Westminster, BC, Canada.","options":[{"id":31129855,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.49,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":7.8,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100052959/-/IMG_3418_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100052959/-/IMG_3418_2.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100052851/-/IMG_3417.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100052851/-/IMG_3417.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100053031/-/IMG_3418.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100053031/-/IMG_3418.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100053067/-/IMG_3419_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100053067/-/IMG_3419_2.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100053103/-/IMG_3420.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100053103/-/IMG_3420.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3885012,"name":"Yarn","permalink":"yarn","url":"/category/yarn"},{"id":3886917,"name":"Yarn - Capella Sport","permalink":"yarn-capella-sport","url":"/category/yarn-capella-sport"}]},{"id":9797347,"name":"Shake it Out","permalink":"shake-it-out","position":98,"price":27.0,"default_price":27.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/shake-it-out","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-08T05:23:05.000Z","description":"Alnilam Series\r\n\r\n51% Organically Grown Cotton \r\n49% Bamboo \r\nWorsted \r\n201 m/220 yds \r\n100 g/3.5 oz \r\n20 sts per 10cm/4” on 4.5-5.5mm or US 7-9\r\n\r\nHand painted using low-impact dyes.\r\n\r\nInspired by the song Shake it Out by Florence and the Machine.","options":[{"id":30654589,"name":"Default","price":27.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.49,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":7.8,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96253732/-/IMG_3191_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96253732/-/IMG_3191_1.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96253684/-/IMG_3190_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96253684/-/IMG_3190_1.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96253960/-/IMG_3187.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96253960/-/IMG_3187.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96254002/-/IMG_3189.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96254002/-/IMG_3189.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3885012,"name":"Yarn","permalink":"yarn","url":"/category/yarn"},{"id":4143024,"name":"Yarn - Alnilam Worsted","permalink":"yarn-alnilam-worsted","url":"/category/yarn-alnilam-worsted"}]},{"id":9797254,"name":"Bit By Bit","permalink":"bit-by-bit","position":99,"price":27.0,"default_price":27.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bit-by-bit","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-08T05:19:22.000Z","description":"Alnilam Series\r\n\r\n51% Organically Grown Cotton \r\n49% Bamboo \r\nWorsted \r\n201 m/220 yds \r\n100 g/3.5 oz \r\n20 sts per 10cm/4” on 4.5-5.5mm or US 7-9\r\n\r\nHand painted using low-impact dyes.\r\n\r\nInspired by the tune Bit by Bit from the band Mother Mother.
