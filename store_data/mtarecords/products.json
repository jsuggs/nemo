Techy in approach but retaining a melodic edge thanks to a subtly pitched male vocal, 'Closer' is ammunition for DJs across the House spectrum. \r\n\r\nAn artist at the forefront House Music's new wave, who already counts Maya Jane Coles, Pete Tong, B.Traits, Annie Mac, Mistajam and Waze & Odyssey as fans, Josh Butler's rise is set to continue.","options":[{"id":48516561,"name":"Default","price":6.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.6,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":8.5},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127913658/-/Josh_Butler_-_Closer_ARTWORK_1400x1400.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127913658/-/Josh_Butler_-_Closer_ARTWORK_1400x1400.jpg","width":1400,"height":1400}],"artists":[{"id":251163,"name":"Josh Butler","permalink":"josh-butler","url":"/artist/josh-butler"}],"categories":[{"id":6702186,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]}]
