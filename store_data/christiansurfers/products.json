With his best friend Casey at his side, they have two goals:  surf and party!  But Luke's Mom and especially Dad have other ideas:  pick a college and grow up!  When Luke learns that a spot is opening up on the local surf team, he sees his big chance to prove to his parents that he can make it as a surfer and avoid being shipped off to school.\r\n\r\nOnly two things stand in Luke's way:  new surfer in town Matt who has his own eyes set on the surf team opening, and his Dad, who insists he give up his surfing dreams and get an education.  When a devastating tragedy strikes, Luke is forced to take a hard look at his life and with the help of beautiful \"church girl\" Emily and his Youth Pastor, he learns that there's much more to life than riding waves.","options":[{"id":12724002,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37110076/-/195729_119860841388556_6514500_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37110076/-/195729_119860841388556_6514500_n.jpg","width":180,"height":373},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37110028/-/CB_HOME_2011_rev.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37110028/-/CB_HOME_2011_rev.jpg","width":1000,"height":732}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":109462,"name":"Media","permalink":"media","url":"/category/media"}]},{"id":102207,"name":"CS Banner","permalink":"cs-banner","position":58,"price":150.0,"default_price":150.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cs-banner","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-05-09T22:51:39.000Z","description":"A great black and red banner to hang anywhere to promote a CS chapter event!
