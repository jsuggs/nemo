There's a show of formality mixed with spontaneity on this first production effort that establishes itself as the beginning of a rich career. \r\n\r\nJoyce Negrón\r\n\r\n2da Edición 2011 solo 500 copias","options":[{"id":14609329,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43655881/-/mima-reissue-cover_crop_small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43655881/-/mima-reissue-cover_crop_small.jpg","width":999,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":82301,"name":"MIMA","permalink":"mima","url":"/artist/mima"}],"categories":[{"id":2441313,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":4458991,"name":"“EL POZO” de MIMA CD (© 2011)// Spik Records//PV","permalink":"el-pozo-de-mima-2011-spik-records","position":2,"price":16.0,"default_price":16.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/el-pozo-de-mima-2011-spik-records","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-09-17T23:49:03.000Z","description":"Offering forth eleven cuts of new material, El Pozo is the long-awaited second album from the Puerto Rican indie staple who has spent a good part of the last five years experimenting with sounds and textures that made her live performances into happenings.
