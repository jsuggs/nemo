An old farmer used to walk past it every morning. One day, he resolved to do something to help. Being poor, all he could do was sweep the floor and light some incense as an offering to the iron statue of Kuan Yin, the Bodhisattva of Compassion. This he did, devoutly, for many years. One night, Kuan Yin came to him in a dream. She told him of a cave behind the temple that had hidden treasure. The next day the farmer went to the cave, but all he found was the single shoot of a tea plant. He planted it in his field and tended it faithfully. In time it grew into a healthy bush that produced the finest, most exquisite tea. He gave away cuttings to his neighbours and before long the village became so prosperous that the temple was beautifully restored. \r\n\r\nThe happy ending for us is this tea with a silky smooth texture and light, refreshing taste.","options":[{"id":33878820,"name":"50 g","price":4.8,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/104803048/-/tikwanyin.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/104803048/-/tikwanyin.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/105058341/-/tikwanyin_filter.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/105058341/-/tikwanyin_filter.jpg","width":829,"height":829},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/105058365/-/tikwanyin_cup.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/105058365/-/tikwanyin_cup.jpg","width":829,"height":829}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4853614,"name":"Oolong","permalink":"oolong","url":"/category/oolong"}]},{"id":10290967,"name":"Meng Ding Huang Ya","permalink":"meng-ding-huang-ya","position":17,"price":7.3,"default_price":7.3,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/meng-ding-huang-ya","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-01T23:37:43.000Z","description":"A rare yellow tea from the misty slopes of Mount Meng.
