We lived, ate and breathed the punk ethic, D.I.Y. culture. We toured with the likes of Conflict and played gigs all over England. The 12-inch Sanctuary was our only solid release apart from various songs on compilation albums.

Featuring ex members of Warwound and Varukers, Sacrilege took the UK hardcore sounds of the day (Discharge, Varukers, Icons of Filth, Antisect) and mixed in a combination of powerful thrash and metal. The resulting mix was a high energy metal/hardcore hybrid which quickly stood apart from many of the other bands mixing punk and metal at the time. Sacrilege had the killer combination of epic metal songwriting with Tam's scorching female vocals and the power, passion and intensity of hardcore punk. This double LP compiles all four of the bands demos. The early demos lean much more towards hardcore punk, while the later demos show the metal influence coming in stronger. While a lot of bands who mixed punk with metal didn't have the songwriting ability or talent to write memorable metal songs, Sacrilege were equally adept at playing fierce thrash and heavy, driving metal.  This double LP was released with full co operation of the band, remastered for vinyl, with a fold out poster sleeve featuring original artwork from the 80's and photos and flyers rarely, or never before published.\r\n\r\nCrass Records style fold out poster sleeve.

In their brief 8 month existence in 1985 they crafted a sound that is unlike anything else that I have ever heard. The 22 song demo reissued on this LP would seem to meld equal parts of the expected 80s Midwestern American Hardcore but sets it against the non-stop guitar frenzy of contemporary Japanese bands, or are they Robert Fripp solos played at breakneck speed? It’s hard to tell and is far stranger than that. With vocals in the vein of Naked Raygun’s earlier records and the non-stop solos of Randy Uchida this is a sound that stands apart from other recordings of the era. You really need to hear it to start to understand it. Comprised of two brothers John and Joe Bendik who would switch between guitar and drums, front man Bill Morris, who cut an intimidating figure on stage and bassist Alan Peters who went on to be in Agnostic Front and helped found Absolution this is a band that came and went fast, but left an amazing recording behind. Limited to 1,000 copies this remastered LP includes a fanzine style insert with lots of photos and flyers and folds out into a 35X22 inch poster. Includes a download card which gives a full version of the album as well as their complete set from their show opening for Agnostic Front in 1985.

The two lead off tracks show that Misery will always be progressing and growing, The Beginning featuring female vocals and acoustic guitar amidst the massive crushing heaviness, where Armageddon shows that no one has perfected apocalyptic crust/ stenchcore like Misery has. The middle of this release finds them reaching back to the first demo, re-recordings of the bleak New Year’s and the classic Midnight. The latter features the return of Al Long who left Misery to join Nausea shortly after the demo. The final two songs pay homage to their roots in the van by covering Sacrilege’s Lifeline and Chrome’s epic 3rd From the Sun, once again featuring Al Long, both adding their own ingredients that began to shape Misery in 1988.

Deep Wound were one of a handful of great punk bands from the outer regions of Massachusetts who have been largely overlooked by HC history in favor of the \"Boston Crew\" bands who put out records on XClaim! or Modern Method. The four-piece recorded their one and only single with Lou Giordano and Frank Michaels (Proletariat) and released it on the Radiobeat label in 1982. Their one compilation appearance (on the otherwise excellent Bands that Could be God LP of Massachusetts punk) isn't quite as good as the raging insanity of this single. The record is snotty teenage punk rock but played at lightning speed with totally manic singing. The band also recorded some rough demo tapes in J's basement, which eventually found their way onto CD and vinyl on various bootlegs. Drummer J Mascis and guitarist Lou Barlow went on to further greatness by forming the seminal indie rock band Dinosaur Jr. (and Lou later started Sebadoh), and bassist Scott Helland played in the Outpatients until their breakup in 1995.

Their material here is possibly their most brutal and harsh recordings yet, in the style that they are known and loved for. Absolute shit-fi unlistenable garbage Extreme Noise Terror/Sore Throat worship mixed with lo-fi minimalist acid/house techno. This recording contains some new songs (including a slow mosh jammer that I think if the first slow song they’ve ever written?), some old songs re-recorded (like usual), and all songs that make us grin from ear to ear and feel like life is still worth living.\r\n\r\nLotus Fucker produces their most claustrophobic, paranoid, and anxious material yet in their standard “noise hardcore” style, fueled by sleep deprivation, lack of sunlight, and poor dietary decisions.

However, returning as CHAOSCHANNEL, they have moved beyond the boundaries and limitations of that terminology to create a uniquely new style of 'noise and dance'. And there's nothing we love more at SPHC than bands with their own unique sense of identity beyond genre exercising and copying.\r\n\r\nChaos Channel - How You’d Never Been So High? (But Then You’d Never Needed To Be?) CD from 2010 is possibly the best noisy punk record of our times, a really fresh and exciting take on a style they already mastered years ago. And this 7\" single continues with these ideas. A meticulous recording of super catchy riffs fit into a bizarre and chaotic sense of songwriting and arrangements, with No. 6's instantly recognizable vocals belting out lyrics that border between absurd nonsense and high-art genius.

Agnostic Front’s ‘United Blood’, Antidote’s ‘Thou Shall Not Kill’, Cause For Alarm’s self-titled release and The Abused’s ‘Loud and Clear’ all defined the sound and aesthetic of New York Hardcore for years to come with their sonic brutality and fervent lyrics. Since then, all of these records have been re-issued barring the latterly mentioned ‘Loud and Clear’. That is, until now.\r\n\r\nRadio Raheem proudly presents the first fully authorized re-issue of the ‘Loud and Clear’ ep. Pressed in the LP format, this 21-track collection is rounded out by the band's 1982 demo and never before heard live material. Also included is a 24-page, full color booklet containing photos, lyrics and the band's infamous show flyers drawn by their vocalist Kevin Crowley, as well as a sticker sheet replicating original Abused sticker designs.\r\n\r\nFinally, the most arcane and collectible piece of the early 80’s NYHC puzzle is available for both the tight pursed nerd and curious onlooker alike!\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":46681476,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126509556/-/abused.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126509556/-/abused.jpg","width":606,"height":603},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126786027/-/abusedlp2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126786027/-/abusedlp2.jpg","width":600,"height":450},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126786039/-/abusedlp3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126786039/-/abusedlp3.jpg","width":600,"height":450}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2427109,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]},{"id":14329965,"name":"PUBLIC EXECUTION - 'Discography' LP","permalink":"public-execution-discography-lp","position":65,"price":18.5,"default_price":18.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/public-execution-discography-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-22T03:32:20.000Z","description":"Public Execution﻿. One of the earliest examples of hardcore punk happening in the northern police state of QLD, Australia. A fresh breed of youth coming through the Brisbane punk scene, at a time when the old '77 crowd had become as stale and jaded as the fart-rock scene before them, Public Execution formed as a 3 piece to kick these punk rock dinosaurs fair in the arse, amping up the speed and aggression, and letting them know it. Rod McLeod (Just Urbain, Bodysnatchers, The Kicks etc), one of few enthusiastic older crowd, took a liking to them after Public Execution﻿ talked shit about the fans of his band, and helped them to be heard by way of a split tape(with The Kicks) in 1982, and soon after producing their 2 track 1982 7\" release. It didn't take long for them to add a 4th member to really free the then singer/bass player from his instrument duties and unleash his real anger on a small-but probably suspecting-crowd, recording a demo tape in 1983 which makes up the first 4, and most aggressive tracks on this LP. \r\n9 songs in total, showing the progress of a young, hardcore, punk band who imploded before their time.\r\n\r\nTheir Discography LP comes housed in a beautiful and extra heavy paste on board sleeve﻿ and includes an 8 page booklet with rare pictures, lyrics, posters, paper clippings from back in the day as well as the band's story as recalled by Rod Mcleaod and Terry Devery.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":46351821,"name":"Default","price":18.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126261558/-/PE.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126261558/-/PE.jpg","width":600,"height":585}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2427109,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]},{"id":14324286,"name":"Ruleta Rusa - Aqui No Es cassette (+ 2 bonus songs)","permalink":"ruleta-rusa-aqui-no-es-cassette-2-bonus-songs","position":66,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ruleta-rusa-aqui-no-es-cassette-2-bonus-songs","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-21T22:29:07.000Z","description":"\"Debut [album] from this San Francisco punk band that first caught my ear on their split 7\" with Mexico's Los Monjo.

On top of playing with a veritable who’s who of 80s American Punk, helping revolutionize the musical landscape of Pittsburgh and later, out of the embers of their demise, forming the most renowned export of 80s Pittsburgh Hardcore – Half Life – Real Enemy was also the catalyst for the creation of Mind Cure Records and released the Real Enemy “Life With the Enemy” cassette as it’s maiden release. After a long gestation period “Life With the Enemy” and Mind Cure Records have re-entered the world with a full length LP of Real Enemy. I am honored to have worked on this release and look forward to bringing more Pittsburgh Punk, Hardcore and more back into print on vinyl.

To me, both bands bring back the best musical aspects of the 90s. I am not talking about skinny kids, free of animal products and full of self-hate spending full gigs on their knees, in front of a crowd of kids with their arms crossed, and with backpacks. I am talking about punk bands that played fast, angry and rough hardcore punk in front of a raging, soap-free crowd. The split EP was the format of choice for that kind of band and time. But there are few splits that have two bands that are equally good. This one has. So the \"Dishonorable Bastard\" EP is the first split on HeartFirst in 20 years. DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE (from Oslo) have already released two 7\" EPs and a 12\" called \"Nightmare Visions E.P.\", one of the best records of 2012 (released on VEX in the US and self-released by the band in Norway).

Arne (bass)\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of the first significant wave of Punk Bands from the UK touring Germany, four friends from Hamburg didn't just wanted to stand aside and watch.\r\n\r\nAlready having made their first attempts in bands like  COPSLAYER (Raimund + Berthold); GUTTERSNIPES (Reder + Witte);  BORSTAL BOYS (Lui); SCREAMER (Witte) and NO ONE (Arne), they formed  NAPALM to live what they believed was the only way to be: PUNK! \r\nAfter only a couple of shows they've been asked to record a single with label Moderne Musik. \r\nIt sounded just like the band's first live shows, maybe even worse, but nobody really cared.  The band went on to do some nerve wrecking gigging with Hamburg based friends THE BUTTOCKS.  After brothers Raimund and Berthold left the band Arne and Witte stepped in and made a  difference, being already quite experienced musicians and songwriters.\r\n\r\nThe following years saw the band play some more or less chaotic tours in Germany and Europe, together with the likes of INSANE, GBH and ENGLISH DOGS. \r\nIn 1982 they finally got together with Robert Nitz from Konnekschen lable to record their  second 45 called It's a Warning.\r\nLive at the Graffityi was recorded in 1983 by some unknown Punk, most probably using a cheap tape recorder.\r\n NAPALM may not have made an impact in Punk, but Punk has for sure made an impact on them ... \r\n\r\nAll members went on to play in bands, too many to mention, up to today 30 years later.  2011/2012 has seen NAPALM reunite to play a couple of shows in Hamburg and UK.\r\n\r\nThis record has been released to make the stuff available on regular priced Vinyl again, as the original recordings are offered on the Internet for undecent prices.\r\n\r\nThanks to:  Raimund, Berthold, Frank, Robert Nitz (RIP), Tom Meyer, Raino \r\n\r\nRed is limited to 100","options":[{"id":28926014,"name":"Black vinyl","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":31544026,"name":"Red vinyl","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":2.0},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90823502/-/napalm_1.PNG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90823502/-/napalm_1.PNG","width":720,"height":715},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90823589/-/napalm_2.PNG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90823589/-/napalm_2.PNG","width":416,"height":622}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2427109,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]},{"id":9216257,"name":"Abduktion/Versklaven- Split- 7\"","permalink":"abduktion-versklaven-split-7","position":175,"price":5.5,"default_price":5.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/abduktion-versklaven-split-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-30T06:54:09.000Z","description":"Abduktion and Versklaven hail from Houston, Texas.

All the noisier elements of the demo tape are gone, instead the band opted for a clean, clear sound to grasp the full power of their sound. Chainsaw guitars, unhinged, out-of-control drumming, an incredibly fuzzy bass, and self-loathing vocals. The New Wave of USHC is here.

They were: Polio Ferrari (keyboards), Wally Sound (guitar), Tora Brooks (bass), Walter McKee (guitar) and Caker Calloway (drums). Their music was a hybrid of the then emerging punk sound as well as 1960’s surf, garage and psychedelic music.  The band was a keystone of the Santa Cruz punk scene and organized many important early punk & new wave shows in their hometown.  After establishing a local following, they released a single and a few songs on compilations. The original line up lasted until 1979, when Walter left the band and they changed their name to “The Realtors.”\r\n\r\nA search of the band’s archive has yielded two unreleased gems from their original recording session in March 1978: “Talk Talk,” a cover of the classic Music Machine song and “Classroom” a JJ 180 original featuring the band’s trademark dueling guitar solos and confrontational attitude. \r\n\r\nUNRELEASED RECORDINGS FROM SANTA CRUZ CALIFORNIA’S ORIGINAL PUNK BAND.\r\nAvailable in 7″ white, black or random vinyl.\r\nIncludes glossy photo / bio insert.\r\n\r\n45 r.p.m. / 7″ vinyl\r\n\r\nI have three on white vinyl.","options":[{"id":27163650,"name":"Default","price":6.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":11.75,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/85160421/-/JJ-with-inserts.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/85160421/-/JJ-with-inserts.jpg","width":504,"height":504}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2427123,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"}]},{"id":8643585,"name":"BORED YOUTH- NOVEMBER 1981 EP ","permalink":"bored-youth-november-1981-ep","position":192,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bored-youth-november-1981-ep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-21T04:45:48.000Z","description":"Bored Youth’s scorching first recording from November 1981.

Pushead pressed 25 test pressings of this Lp but never put it into production, making it one of the rarest hardcore records of the 1980s. This is re pressed as a 45 rpm 12\", gatefold sleeve and sweet 80's style layout (no half assed pixelated cover art here) Neuroots demos were re issues by Coaltion a few years ago as well. \r\n\r\n\r\ncolored vinyl sold-out!","options":[{"id":22000975,"name":"Default","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.75,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68114987/-/Neuroot.PNG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68114987/-/Neuroot.PNG","width":188,"height":149}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2427111,"name":"12\" 45","permalink":"12-45","url":"/category/12-45"}]},{"id":6938119,"name":"ILEGAL — Callejon Sin Salida EP ","permalink":"ilegal-callejon-sin-salida-ep-callejon-sin-salida-ep","position":226,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ilegal-callejon-sin-salida-ep-callejon-sin-salida-ep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-11T08:15:38.000Z","description":"Callejon Sin Salida    \r\nMetamorfosis    \r\nInutil    \r\n\r\nComes with translated lyric insert.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":21992679,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":11.75,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68085755/-/legal1.PNG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68085755/-/legal1.PNG","width":178,"height":178}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":6938089,"name":"RAKOSI — 2nd EP","permalink":"rakosi-2nd-ep","position":227,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rakosi-2nd-ep","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-08-11T08:11:40.000Z","description":"Tracks:\r\n\r\nOlaszliszka   \r\nKaparósok    \r\nPolitikusok    \r\nHogy Jutottunk Idáig?

The Dicks reissue that everyone has been waiting for!\r\n\r\nLet's go back in time to Austin Texas, 1980 - Before SXSW, there was a bar called Raul's that was the center of the Austin scene... actually, that was pretty much the whole scene and the Dicks were born from it. The Dicks made a big splash with their first single Hate The Police and then recorded Kill From The Heart just before moving to San Francisco. In the magical 2 years of the Dicks infancy in Texas, they made a dynamic impact on many people with a stellar live show mixing punk and politics. The original line-up for the Dicks was singer Gary Floyd, guitarist Glen Taylor, bassist Buxf Parrot, and drummer Pat Deason. They imploded in 1983.\r\n\r\nWhat we have here is a very necessary CD and LP reissue of their 1st LP (CD and digital download include the bonus tracks of their debut 7\") The LP and 7\" comprise the complete studio output of the original lineup. If you aren't familiar with Kill From The Heart, then you need to be aware of this bona- fide classic of Reagan-era punk - a record that inspired many of the artists that inspired you. the songs \"Hate The Police\" \"Kill From The Heart\" and \"Wheelchair Epidemic\" have been covered by Mudhoney, The Spits, & Jesus Lizard respectively.

It also brought together two of the strongest scenes of the Eastern Bloc - Polish and Yugoslavian. All of the recordings were done in Borut Cine Studio, in Ljubljana, during Abaddon's tour of Yugoslavia. Invited by Peter Barbaric, they also played a couple of shows with bands like Pankrti or U.B.R. The \"Wet za wet\" LP was then released by New Wave Records from France. Because of this, and also thanks to worldwide tape-traders and the band's appearances on comp. tapes like \"Noise Behind the Iron Dustbin\" or \"Cultural Compost Pit\", as well as a bootleg split-tape with Rejestracja, they were quite well-known beyond their home country. In Poland, their regular performances at the Jarocin Festival and appearances on legendary compilations like \"Fala\" and \"Jak punk to punk\" established the band as one of the classics of the genre.\r\nIn the 90s, two bootleg 7\"s of Abaddon were released and in 2001, Pop Noise Records released the CD version of \"Wet za wet.\"\r\nThe LP contains 8 fast, direct, and tight Hardcore Punk ragers and a great roots/dub song called \"Ljubljana night.\" Coming from their Polish/Eastern European perspective, the album's lyrics and artwork expressed a protest against any form of authoritarian power - from the brutality of fascism during WWII and the 1981 revolts\r\nin Poland, to more current world problems of the time, like Apartheid in South Africa and the global arms race. In the context of Poland's political climate in the 80s, their lyrics and music were seriously impressive.\r\nMastering for the reissue was done from the original sources by Jarek Smok at Studio As One (Warsaw). The LP features a gatefold cover, an additional booklet with an exclusive interview with Tomasz Dorn, drummer of Abaddon and plenty of rare photos (including the work of Michał Wasążnik - one of the best documenters of 80s punk in Poland). All of the lyrics and the interview come with English translations.

A planned 12\" follow-up was never released, as the band split up soon after, with members going on to early hardcore outfit Young Lions and legendary surf-punk band Shadowy Men On A Shadowy Planet, leaving behind only this very collectible single.

It was fantastic to see them tour the US together and hopefully they'll do Japan together too.\r\n\r\nSete Star Sept is literally the best grind band I've ever seen live. For being just bass and drums, their recordings here sound massive, dense, claustrophobic. Wild arrangements hint at chaos yet they're too musically tight to just be randomized. This is how grindcore should sound to me: the destruction of music/art/everything. True professionals.\r\n\r\nPenis Geyser's side was culled from tape recordings of this recent US tour.

Before MTV, before the Internet and cell phones, Spokane seemed a long way from anywhere. A small group of bored teenagers banded together to make art and music and live a lifestyle that tested the social and moral boundaries of conservative America.\r\n\r\nFrom the late 70s through the 1980s, Spokane had a diverse array of bands in sound and style. Like many small scenes, often times wildly different acts would appear on the same bill. Especially in the early days, shows were not a regular event and with so few bands some bands lasted only one show.\r\n\r\nMost of these bands were formed in Spokane and existed only then and there. Some towards the bottom of the page were formed by Spokanites who moved away. Some of these tracks were recorded in professional studios, but most were recorded on a humble 4-track tape recorder (or worse!) in a living room. All are passionate, unique, and show the range of what came out of “the world’s largest hick town” in the 1980’s.\r\n\r\n \r\n1. I Need Electricity (Sweet Madness)  \r\n2.

Harsh vocals backed by crushing distortion give way to atmospheric, reverb laden interludes, which personify the bands complex, almost schizophrenic songwriting. Contempt for humanity and it’s deconstruction of the natural world gives life to a tragic landscape that plays out as the main theme of this powerful and inventive record.

ALLIN and the JABBERS, G.B.H., and even Boston pop icons the NEIGHBORHOODS.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe ABORTION SQUAD were part of the few hardcore punk from the New Hampshire scene, among bands like the MURDERERS, the MIGHTY CO'S and AGROPHOBIC ARRAY... they are incontestably the most primitive and brutal band from this scene, playing intense and spontaneous hardcore with a real \"fuck you\" punk attitude.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHere's a review of one of their gig, written the 30th of June 1983 (I think it was on SUBURBAN PUNK zine) :\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"In fact, a punk band, \"Abortion Squad\" made one of the strongest impression with short, frantic songs of hate and anger.

Amazing material that has been languishing for far too long. Liner notes include a detailed history of the band as well as fliers.\r\n\r\nKing City is the tiny California town that spawned this band- much to its chagrin I’m sure. These songs get a lot out of a little, each revolving around a single riff, and shouted vocals that are often out of rhythm with the music, along with some sort of lead, be it a hooky wandering bassline, keyboards, or police siren guitar solo akin to the end of Social Distortion’s “Mass Hysteria”. This recording reminds me a lot of that of the Urban Waste 7″, and the overall vibe absolutely reeks of being a punk in small town America in the early 80′s, confined by conformity and narrow minds, and wanting nothing more than to get out. Also included is a brief history of the band, and an amusing anecdote about them playing “No Hicks” on their high school’s lawn.

Although not a \"ramshackle d-beat band with no bass\" band, Amenaça still takes 1980s punk influences (BAP, L'Odi Social, and Subterranean Kids) and combines them with a grainy, raw recording to create an adrenalin charged HC sound. I think you can hear many early Italian hardcore influences as well, and the vocals remind me of Raw Power at times. This 12\" is actually the band's demo pressed to vinyl, but i don't think that fact hinders the quality at all. This is a three label split release coordinated by Inti of the excellent Discos Enfermos label.
