These shorts are perfect, comfortable, and classy. The pockets are so adorable, and they're just great shorts for the summer. However, now that it's summer, and I'm a lazy person, I have gained a few pounds, and they don't really fit anymore. These have been worn and washed many times, not gonna lie. These shorts have been used well, but when they start to ride up at the crotch and feel tight on my butt, I think it's time to get rid of them. They are a size 00, and American Eagle's stuff does run a bit big, so it's not as scary as it sounds. When you wash these and put them in the dryer (not recommended), they hem does roll up a bit. I've learned not to really care, but some people might not like that, so just wash them and leave them to hang dry! I did pay 40$ for these shorts, so half off seems alright to me.","options":[{"id":21420247,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66178861/-/yasoya.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66178861/-/yasoya.jpg","width":417,"height":294}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":6740483,"name":"Beaver Canoe Sweater (XS)","permalink":"beaver-canoe-sweater-xs","position":2,"price":40.0,"default_price":40.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/beaver-canoe-sweater-xs","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-19T12:44:32.000Z","description":"This is a Beaver Canoe sweater from Roots Canada, I got it in April at the Roots outlet in Niagara Falls, however I bought the wrong size. I was unable to return it because we left the next day and went home (3 hour drive). It's black, displays the BBeaver Canoe logo in white, and is a size XS (extra small). Long sleeve, crewneck, can be worn with sleeves rolled up for an updated look. I paid 68$ plus tax for it, so 40$ is actually a really good deal. It has been worn once and washed twice, but looks brand new. The picture is iPod quality because I'm trying to sell this and get something decent to take pictures with!","options":[{"id":21419821,"name":"Default","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66176917/-/photo.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66176917/-/photo.JPG","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
