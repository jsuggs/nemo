Fazenda Aurea is in a region called Serra do Salitre, a high plain in Cerrado Miniero, Minas Gerais state. At 1200 meters, the Serra do Salitre has better altitude than most of Cerrado proper, which averages 800-900 meters for coffee production.\r\n\r\nIt is a Mundo Novo varietal. The coffee is all dried on raised African beds to promote even drying and the results speak for themselves. A coffee which is very dynamic for a Brazilian, this coffee leads off with a touch of unexpected acidity and quickly flows into a refined, but still distinctly natural processed body. A berry sweeteness runs into a pleasant cocoa aftertaste. This coffee is really well suited to espresso in any percentage from Single through to Blends. We have just landed some more of this fresh crop coffee.\r\n","options":[{"id":29909405,"name":"Default","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/93960343/-/IMG_8934.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/93960343/-/IMG_8934.JPG","width":1000,"height":561}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1546064,"name":"Coffee","permalink":"coffee","url":"/category/coffee"}]},{"id":2863361,"name":"3 Month Subscription- Roasters Cup Coffees","permalink":"3-month-subscription","position":11,"price":170.0,"default_price":170.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/3-month-subscription","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-11-11T23:37:25.000Z","description":"Let us take all of the hassle out of your weekly coffee fix.
