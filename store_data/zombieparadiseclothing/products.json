Bite T-shirt\r\nScreen Printed on\r\nGildan\r\n\r\nColors\r\nBlackxGoldxFusciax\r\nAquaMarine\r\n\r\n*Hidden Message*\r\n-This shirt can be viewed in two ways, it can be viewed as a shark jumping out of the ocean, or out of the smoke around it\r\n-One really awesome concept to this design is that we tried to show a cool mechanism that sharks have which is a built in cancer shield, so it is much harder for sharks to actually obtain free-radical cells within its body (a little science for ya)\r\n-The idea behind the shirt was to show the party that is alive in all of us, and about half way through an awesome night, we are sure one way or another you can relate to this image.\r\n-The shark can also be viewed as an illusion itself as well, seemlessly blending into the shirt simply by the fact that the shark has no two connective lines within its whole body, it can be viewed as a random grouping of clouds that just so happened to be blown together to form this abstract image\r\n-The Back\r\n-Our favorite and exclusive image has a few cool hidden messages to it\r\n-The ZP are supposed to look like a Z wearing a baseball Cap\r\n-The Z stands for our lazy, yet stylish Crew\r\n-The P stands for our outgoingness and aggressiveness as well as our ability to stay fresh\r\n-Now comes the awesome part, when you flip the ZP to the side it should say Nb which stands for our hometown Newburgh, where our lives of Zombie Paradise came to be\r\n-The Plus sign Stands for all the trouble we have gone through, and is a symbol to remind us Zombie Paradise is going from a Negative to A Positive","options":[{"id":29478269,"name":"small","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29481866,"name":"medium","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29481869,"name":"large","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29481872,"name":"x-large","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/92621462/-/shark_tee.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/92621462/-/shark_tee.png","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4603028,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":9424631,"name":"Zombie
