They began work on a documentary: <b><i>Love In Bright Landscapes</i></b>. \r\n\r\nTo raise initial funds for the project they staged a live concert at Melbourne’s Corner Hotel featuring The Blackeyed Susans (with guest Triffids Graham Lee & Rob McComb), Charles Jenkins, Mick Thomas and Shackleton, and Diving Bell all performing from McComb’s incredible songbook. Spoken word performer Sean Whelan also read McComb’s poetry with collaborators The Mime Set. The gig was an overwhelming success, closing with one of McComb’s last major compositions, 'The Good Life Never Ends', performed by The Blackeyed Susans, available for the first time on this album. Plus, it was the first (and possibly last) time The Blackeyed Susans performed their namesake song, 'Blackeyed Susan'. \r\n\r\nDeep In A Dream is the recording of that incredible gig - a live tribute to the late David McComb. Sales from the CD will help fund the documentary <b><i>Love in Bright Landscapes</i></b>.\r\n\r\n<b>Tracklisting:</b>\r\n   1. The Blackeyed Susans - Ocean of You\r\n   2.
