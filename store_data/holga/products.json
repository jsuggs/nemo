Yes, it is really three cameras in one!\r\n\r\nThe Recesky DIY 3D Stereo Camera can take not only stereo images using 35mm film that can be viewed in 3D using stereo glasses, but also has a normal pinhole mode for regular sized pictures, as well as a panoramic mode for wide pictures that is twice the width of regular pictures!\r\n\r\nLike the Recesky DIY TLR camera, the Stereo Pinhole Camera kit comes with all the necessary parts in a neatly packaged box along with a 3D stereo viewer that lets you see your pictures in 3D. Assembling the camera allows you to understand how a pinhole camera works with a simple but smart bulb mode shutter. What impressed us even more is that there are 3 pinhole lenses - allowing you to switch between stereo, panoramic and standard shooting modes at anytime you wish, <strong>within the same roll of film!</strong>\r\n\r\nRecesky DIY Stereo Pinhole Camera Features:\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"list-colored\">\r\n<li>3x Pinhole Lenses used in 3 different ways for 3 shooting modes!</li>\r\n<li>Bulb mode shutter, including hold function</li>\r\n<li>Multiple Exposures</li>\r\n<li>Takes <strong>35mm film</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nPackage includes:\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"list-colored\">\r\n<li class=\"red\"><strong>Recesky DIY Stereo Pinhole Camera Kit</strong>\r\n<li class=\"orange\">Recesky Stereo Viewer\r\n<li class=\"red\">Instruction manual in <strong>Chinese</strong>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<strong>Important note:</strong> The manufacturer has not yet made English instructions for this camera!

We absolutely love the idea of a camera that  not only takes great photos, but is also one that you get to build yourself! \r\n\r\nThe Recesky DIY TLR camera comes with all the necessary parts in a neatly packaged box along with English instructions. Going through the process of assembling the camera is not only a joy in itself, but allows you to ultimately understand the exact function that every part ultimately plays in order to capture a photo - it truly is an amazing experience!\r\n\r\nThe TLR stands for Twin Lens Reflex. There are two lenses - one for capturing the photo onto film, and the other that acts as as a viewfinder for framing the photo. The main advantage of this is that you can compose your shots from waist height! \r\n\r\nThe Recesky is sometimes called the Gakkenflex clone, fake Gakkenflex or even Fakkenflex. The kits are almost entirely similar (even the instruction manuals!), however there are two notable differences: 1. The Recesky is slightly wider and 2. The Recesky allows you to focus. \r\n\r\nThe first point is not so important, as it's not really that wide in the first place (the base measures about 6.3cm), however the second point does place the Recesky at an advantage in that you no longer have to guess how far to focus the lens.\r\n\r\nRecesky Features:\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"list-colored\">\r\n<li>Aperture: f/11</li>\r\n<li>Shutter speec: 1 / 125 second</li>\r\n<li>Multiple Exposures</li>\r\n<li>Focus adjustment range: 50cm to infinity</li>\r\n<li>Takes 35mm film</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nPackage includes:\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"list-colored\">\r\n<li class=\"red\"><strong>Recesky DIY Twin Lens Reflex Camera Kit</strong>\r\n<li class=\"orange\">Instruction manual in English and Chinese\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nNote: A standard small sized philips (cross shaped) screw driver is required to screw in the screws is not provided","options":[{"id":9895435,"name":"Default","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/28930223/-/recesky_tlr_04.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/28930223/-/recesky_tlr_04.JPG","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/28686897/-/recesky_tlr_05.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/28686897/-/recesky_tlr_05.JPG","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/28929247/-/recesky_tlr_03.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/28929247/-/recesky_tlr_03.JPG","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1679919,"name":"Recesky","permalink":"recesky","url":"/category/recesky"},{"id":1686696,"name":"DIY","permalink":"diy","url":"/category/diy"}]},{"id":2776167,"name":"Holga 120 N","permalink":"holga-120-n","position":3,"price":45.0,"default_price":45.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/holga-120-n","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-09-30T04:36:02.000Z","description":"This is where the magic begins!

<strong style=\"smaller\">Superheadz Usagi Colorful</strong> is a remake of the cult classic Vivitar Ultra Wide and Slim camera, that created a huge following for it's ability to create photos similar to that of the world-famous Lomo LC-A!\r\n\r\nIt's an ideal camera to take with you for days out in the sun. Weighing in at only 75g with dimensions of 98 x 60mm (W x H), it's ultra light weight construction and dimensions is ideal to have it slipped in your jeans pockets to carry with you for any occasion!\r\n\r\nYou will love the photos that are produced with the wide angle lens of this camera! The wide angle lens (22mm) that comes with this highly portable camera packs a lot of punch with the surprisingly vivid vignetted photos it can produce. \r\n\r\nThese cameras take normal 35mm black and white or color film.\r\n\r\nFeatures we LOVE about this camera:\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"list-colored\">\r\n<li class=\"red\">Size and Weight - It makes it an ideal camera to take with you for all outdoor occasions\r\n<li class=\"orange\">22mm Wide angle lens - shoot dynamic, wide pictures with this wide angle lens\r\n<li class=\"yellow\">Shutter speed: 1/125\r\n<li class=\"green\">Aperture F11\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"gallery\" style=\"height: 185px;\">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> <a title=\"Photo shot using the Superheadz Ultra Wide camera&lt;br/&gt;Copyrights to &lt;a

<strong>Superheadz Blackbird Fly TLR</strong> is like the gran-daddy of TLR's as far as toy camera TLR's are concerned. The Blackbird Fly is sometimes known simply as <strong class=\"smaller\">BBF</strong>.\r\n\r\nCompared to the other toy camera TLR's on the market right now, we have to admit, this one is pricey. But there's a lot of reasons for this. \r\n\r\nFirst off, the construction is solid. When you hold it in your hands, you'll understand that it's not your like your average plastic toy camera. It's many degrees ahead in this respect in comparison to cameras like the Recesky or Gakkenflex, but the difference comes with the price.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, we'll let the features of the camera speak for itself:\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"list-colored\">\r\n<li>Two apertures - f/7 and f/11\r\n<li>Three formats on 35mm film! Probably the most exciting thing about this camera, you can shoot normal 35mm, square format, and large square format (<em>YES that means onto 35mm sprockets!</em>)\r\n<li>1/125 Shutter speed or Bulb mode\r\n<li>Tripod mount\r\n<li>Flash hotshoe\r\n<li>Multiple exposures\r\n<li>33mmm Wide Angle lens\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nIf you haven't experienced shooting a TLR before, then this is certainly one of them to consider.

The Lightscoop creates a more natural looking photo as the light from the flash is bounced up onto the ceiling, recreating a more light source that is more distributed.\r\n\r\nDon’t let your convenient little pop-up flash ruin your photos with evil red eye, ugly shadows, hot spots, bleached out faces, underexposed colors, and blurry movement that exist only in your photographs, not in the real world.\r\n\r\nThe Lightscoop creates soft, natural light and lets you capture the scene the way you see it.\r\n\r\nThis model is compatible with the following cameras:\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Canon - 35mm dSLR cameras that have a pop-up flash. On some Canon models, it's necessary to slightly back the Lightscoop out of the hot shoe in order for the flash to fire. \r\n<li>Fuji - FinePix Pro Series \r\n<li>Nikon - 35mm dSLR cameras that have a pop-up flash.\r\n<li>Olympus-  E420, E520, E3, E620\r\n<li>Panasonic Lumix - DMC-G2K \r\n<li>Pentax - K-7, KX, K10D, K100D, K20D, K200D\r\n<li>Sigma - SD14 Series\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nTwo versions of the Lightscoop are available:\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"disc\">\r\n<li><strong>Standard</strong> - the standard model of the Lightscoop, no added colouring to the flash light\r\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.lofico.com.au/images/galleries/product/lightscoop/lightscoop-warming.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Warming</a></strong> - a tinted version of the Lightscoop that gives a warming effect when
