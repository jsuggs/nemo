Your cozy wool sweater still holds a little bit of campfire smoke and tangled leaves. Warm leather boots settle at the hearth for a night of rest, old bricks display the ceramic decor and still pine cones, and the unsmoked pipe tobacco adorns the mantle - a little offered to the fire for good measure. In the mudroom hangs a favorite handmade bridle and a newly crafted quiver. \r\n\r\nA classic drydown of Bourbon Vanilla laced with a hint of musk, birch, and juniper kindling bring the wearer back to center, held in a reassuring Autumn embrace.\r\n\r\nHEARTH to me is the smell of home. The smell of all that centers around the tending of a wood stove.\r\n\r\nThe notes combine into one beautiful wreath of perfume casting a protective spell upon the wearer. No one note is overly pronounced, this perfume is subtly complex, steady and loyal, and will adapt and shift with your moods, body temperature, and pheromones.\r\n\r\n{1/8 oz amber vial.
