Days in Donegal are spent rambling in the hills, walking along beaches and exploring the rock pools and fishing spots. Nights are spent indoors by a peat fire, in a local pub or at home, in an area famed for the freshness of its seafood. And all the while, the wild Atlantic bashes relentlessly onto its rugged coastline.\r\n\r\nThese photographs were taken by Stephen Edwards, a Donegal native; and Steve Messer, a regular visitor to the county. The postcards display the beauty of the incredible beauty of both the coastline and the landscape, and properly evoke that 'Wish you were here' glow.\r\n\r\n4.13\" x 5.82\"\r\nColour\r\n350gsm gloss lam\r\n4 pcs.","options":[{"id":28745240,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":4.5,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":5.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90203822/-/bigcartel.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90203822/-/bigcartel.png","width":640,"height":640}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4508654,"name":"Postcards","permalink":"postcards","url":"/category/postcards"}]},{"id":8825762,"name":"EVERYTHING SUCKS zine","permalink":"everything-sucks-zine","position":2,"price":6.5,"default_price":6.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/everything-sucks-zine","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-07T12:09:55.000Z","description":"<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/57589405\" target=\"new\">CLICK FOR VIDEO</a>\r\n\r\nLike a walk from the suburbs to the centre of the city, Stephanie Mill's debut photo-zine grows and changes on each stage of the journey. On the outskirts life is quiet, free time spent hanging with buds, drinking brews and DIY tattoos. But as the youths grab their backpacks and head inland, the scene soon changes: walls dripping with fresh graffiti, skate spots galore and a gutsy nightlife. The action ascends, evenings explode and we're met with a crescendo between moments and breaths. The final conclusion: everything sucks. Or does it?\r\n\r\nStephanie Mill is a 21-year-old photographer from the suburbs of Toronto. Moving to the centre of town to pursue an BFA in Photography at OCAD, she has been widely published for her open and honest style. <i>Everything Sucks</i> is her first solo publication.\r\n\r\nA5\r\nColour\r\nSaddle-stitched\r\n48 pp.\r\n\r\nFirst edition of thirty copies","options":[{"id":27707321,"name":"Default","price":6.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/88383662/-/Square_for_bigcartel__1_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/88383662/-/Square_for_bigcartel__1_.jpg","width":640,"height":640}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3566069,"name":"Zines","permalink":"zines","url":"/category/zines"}]},{"id":7066399,"name":"LONDON zine","permalink":"london-zine","position":3,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/london-zine","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-26T17:03:52.000Z","description":"<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/48237421\" target=\"new\">CLICK FOR VIDEO</a>\r\n\r\nLondon is the capital city of England and the United Kingdom. It attracts 14 million international visitors a year – as many people as it is home to – and is one of the most renowned cities in the world.
