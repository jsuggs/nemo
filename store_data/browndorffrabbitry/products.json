Her sire, 100% German REW, Kodiak, had hidden color genetics that when paired with Browndorff's Pudding, a blue-eyed Chocolate, made a litter of 6 colored kits! Loreal has proven to carry on this rainbow palette in her breedings, and is a great mother to date, successfully rearing 6-8 per litter. Browndorff Rabbitry will be keeping her daughter, a Chin copy, in our barn for 2014 breedings, so we are able to re-home Loreal.\r\n\r\nBorn: 5/8/12\r\nSire: Windsor Farms \"Kodiak\", 100% German, REW. \r\nDam: Browndorff Rabbitry's \"Pudding\", 50% German, Blue-Eyed Choice. \r\n\r\nFor info on raising German Angoras, visit the IAGARB.com site and read articles written by US German Angora co-op raisers.

German Angoras must be sheared every 90 days, and produce up to 1 lb of fiber per shearing. \r\n\r\nI host classes on the art of German Angora Rabbit raising and wool use quarterly at Puffy Mondaes Sustainable Arts in Nampa, Idaho, and can help with any questions you may have.
