When used in place of distilled water, milk is a lovely addition to cold process soap. Many folks consider milk soaps to be milder, more conditioning, and have a creamier lather.\r\n\r\nBut using milk in cold process soap takes a bit more care. Although they are mostly water, milks also contain proteins, sugars and fats. These components bring beneficial qualities to soap, but they can also make soapmaking a little trickier.\r\n\r\nFear not! \"Cold Process Milk Soap\" will take the mystery out of making beautiful milk soaps. \r\n\r\nThis 9-page PDF eClass includes:\r\n\r\n• a thorough description of which milks and milk products are good additions to soap, including fresh milk, canned milk and powdered milk\r\n\r\n• complete recipes for three batches of soap made with goat milk, coconut milk & soy milk (just like the soaps made in class-see below)\r\n\r\n• step-by-step instructions with photos\r\n\r\n• a list of resources for ingredients and supplies\r\n\r\nWhen all is said and done, you'll have the knowledge and confidence you need to make your own creamy milk soaps.\r\n\r\nThis is the digital PDF version of the handout for the class given by Ruth Esteves at The Nova Studio in Point Richmond, CA. \r\n\r\nWhile the handout by itself can never take the place of sitting in on a live class, it is definitely written to stand alone. And it will give you all the information you need to learn the topic thoroughly.
