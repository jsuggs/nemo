Using your child's emailed drawing as my guide, I will recreate an original, fun and unique piece of art on a 9x12 canvas panel! A canvas panel is simply a flat, hard, un-stretched canvas.\r\n\r\nWhat a great way to preserve the original art and have some new wall art for their room all at the same time!\r\n\r\nTake a look at my photos, which show the child's picture, followed by my painting. These were done using my own ideas, but if you have a vision of a certain theme, I can do that instead!\r\n\r\nI will always maintain the child's art as true to the original as possible.

If you need your painting fast, please contact me first to see what the time frame would be.\r\n\r\nYour Re-Imagination will be created on a 9x12 canvas panel board. The nice thing about the panels are that there several ways to display them. Here are some of the ways you can hang a flat canvas panel:\r\n\r\n1) My favorite way to hang a flat piece of art is to get some nice coordinating ribbon, cut it to the size I want, and then glue both sides of the ribbon to the back corners of the painting. Then, you simply hang it on a nail! You can also tie a bow in the top of the ribbon to make it even more decorative. This makes a nice wall hanging.\r\n\r\n2) You can also get a piece of wood that is larger then the painting, drill hole on the back so you can hang it on a nail (kind of like a plaque) paint it and affix the painting on the wood. This method gives the painting a nice border.\r\n\r\n3) Buy mirror hangers. They are clear plastic pieces that let you hang a flat mirror.\r\n\r\n4) Attach picture hardware to the back with a glue gun.\r\n\r\n5) another creative thing to do is get some cute plate stands and place the paintings on them on a mantel or even hang them on the wall that way.\r\n\r\n****Hanging hardware NOT included.
