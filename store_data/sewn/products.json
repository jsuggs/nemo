Please contact me if you are interested in kids sewing classes and I can point you in the right direction (there are a few in the Shire).\r\n\r\nIt will be a lovely class with all materials and instructions included in the cost - just come along,  learn some new skills and meet some new friends in a relaxing, picturesque environment.\r\n\r\nLimited to 6 people. If this class is full and payment has been received, you will go on the waiting list for the next class or receive a refund.\r\n\r\nFriday\r\n15 November 2013\r\nAddress provided on receipt of payment.\r\n11am - 1pm\r\ncost: $40 includes fabric and instructions\r\n\r\n*please note you need to bring your own sewing machine on the day.\r\nPayment is transferable if you are unable to attend due to illness.\r\n\r\nThe not so fine print:\r\n\r\nStudio address will be provided after payment is received.\r\nBy accepting a place at the studio craft retreat you agree that we are not responsible for any theft or injury that may occur at our premises or in our classes.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of stairs (27) to get to the studio.
