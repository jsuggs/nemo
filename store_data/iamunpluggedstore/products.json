Would you live them up, or would you spend them with your family? With those last five minutes would you go and say good bye to your friends and loved ones, or would you spend those last 5 minutes getting things right with God? What is so ironic about this is that many of us will never know when our last five minutes will begin counting down. Every day people are dying, not sure about their eternity. The ultimate reality is that we all one day will die. If Jesus Christ tarries for two hundred more years, everyone, including you, reading this book will one day die. I know this is harsh, but it is true. After we die, we will all have to face a holy God to take an account of what we have done in the body. A lot of people are not ready to go from time into eternity. Many people are not ready to stand before a holy God. Are you ready? The heart is at question. God is not going to judge us by the results of our actions, but rather the content of our hearts. Whatâ€™s in your heart? What are your intentions with people; what are the motives behind your actions? Do you lust? Are you full of pride? Many of us rarely self examine our hearts, but it will be our hearts that will be called into question on judgment day. Eternity is too long to live life loosely.
