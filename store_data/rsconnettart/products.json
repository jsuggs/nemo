It's almost impossible to tell this Giclee Print from an original painting. The colors are vivid, and the detail is crisp and sharp. If you've purchased framing yourself, you know that my price for this frame is half or less than what you would pay retail in a framers shop. A frame of this size and quality could easily cost you $400 - $600.00 all by itself . This frame will NOT incur any additional shipping or handling cost. </p>\r\n<font color=\"#990000\"><strong><a href=\"http://rsconnettart.bigcartel.com/products?search=PLANKTONAUT&amp;search-submit=\">This Painting is also available as an OPEN EDITION &amp; an UNFRAMED MOUNTED PRINT here in this store</a></strong><a href=\"http://rsconnettart.bigcartel.com/products?search=PLANKTONAUT&amp;search-submit=\">. <strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a></font><a href=\"http://rsconnettart.bigcartel.com/products?search=PLANKTONAUT&amp;search-submit=\"> to see ALL available print options for this painting. </font></a>\r\n<p><strong>Please note: </strong>These are hand made and can take 3 to 6 weeks for delivery, unless I have one on hand.

To receive the GICLEE ready for hanging on your wall in beautifully matched frame is to avoid the hassle, decision making, time and energy it takes to do that job yourself.   This is the same perfectly matched frame I choose for the original painting. It was carefully chosen to compliment the painting. It's almost impossible to tell this Giclee Print from an original painting. The colors are vivid, and the detail is crisp and sharp. If you've purchased framing yourself, you know that my price for this frame is half or less than what you would pay retail in a framers shop. A frame of this size and quality could easily cost you $400 - $600.00 all by itself . This frame will NOT incur any additional shipping or handling cost. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Please note: </strong>These are hand made and can take 3 to 6 weeks for delivery, unless I have one on hand. Each is hand stretched, painted, varnished and must go through a drying process for each step. Then, it is taken out to a different location for the framing process. Occasionally, I have these in stock. If time is essential, contact me to see if I have one I can send without the building and drying times. <a href=\"mailto:rsconnett@gmail.com\">rsconnett@gmail.com</a> or call: 323-227-4099 </p>\r\n<p><strong>See more R.S.
