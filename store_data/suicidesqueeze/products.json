Eating Out is the crunchy, distorted, pop-oriented project of Nü Sensae drummer Daniel Pitout. The big distorted guitar riffs and heartfelt melodies of Pitout’s brainchild are a notable departure from Nü Sensae’s roaring assault. But Eating Out also has the proud distinction of being a Vancouver supergroup of sorts. While Pitout assumes the songwriting duties and the accompanying positions of guitarist and vocalist, fellow Sensae Brody McKnight rounds out the guitar department, White Lung vocalist Mish Way lends her bass skills, and Peace’s Geoff Dembicki fills in on drums. While vestiges of Nü Sensae’s brash tonalities, White Lung’s melodic treatment of hardcore, and Peace’s bold anglophile pop can all be heard in Eating Out, Pitout’s songs owe more to girl-grunge groups of the early nineties than to any of his co-conspirators’ primary projects. The three songs on their 7” for Suicide Squeeze Records originally appeared on a limited run of 150 cassettes released by Burger Records back in 2012. “Burn”, “Come Around”, and “That’s My Man” are given a new life on vinyl, showcasing Pitout’s penchant for the triumphant loud-quiet-loud structures and electric catharsis of groups like Hole and L7. The 7” is limited to 500 copies (100 on opaque pink/lavender/yellow-mixed vinyl, 400 on black) and comes with a download code. The songs are also available digitally worldwide on December 3, 2013.\r\n\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://suicidesqueeze.bandcamp.com/album/burn\">- Stream Release // Purchase MP3s</a>\r\n","options":[{"id":48651840,"name":"black vinyl","price":4.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.75,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.99,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":11.99,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127948548/-/EatingOut_900.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127948548/-/EatingOut_900.jpg","width":900,"height":900}],"artists":[{"id":251667,"name":"Eating Out","permalink":"eating-out","url":"/artist/eating-out"}],"categories":[{"id":1757401,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"}]},{"id":11562573,"name":"La Luz, \"Brainwash\" 7\" ","permalink":"la-luz-brainwash-7-pre-order","position":2,"price":5.99,"default_price":5.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/la-luz-brainwash-7-pre-order","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-04T03:02:08.000Z","description":"100% OF PROFITS GENERATED FROM BRAINWASH SALES WILL BE DONATED TO BAND’S RECOVERY --->\r\n\r\nSeattle quartet La Luz immediately brings to mind the girl groups of the ‘50s and ‘60s. The immaculate four-part harmonies, the luscious layers of reverb, the occasional choreographed dance move, even the band’s penchant for oldies-style artwork—it all conjures images of beehived ladies singing sweetly on grainy black-and-white television. But give the new “Brainwash b/w T.V. Dream” single a spin and try to pin down a specific reference point from the past. You can’t. The dexterous but economic keyboard lines of Alice Sandahl and the stripped-down groove laid down by the rhythm section of Abbey Blackwell and Marian Li Pino don’t fit in with wall-of-sound icons like The Crystals or The Ronettes. The nimble surf rock twang of guitarist Shana Cleveland is at odds with classic Motown groups like The Marvelettes or The Supremes. Yes, the doo-wop nostalgia is certainly there, but the manufactured glamour and studio sheen is absent. The ladies of La Luz are true Pacific Northwesterners--swathed in warm wool sweaters, laying into their instruments as their hair messily spills over their faces, making records in trailer parks on the outskirts of the city, and battling the gloomy weather by channeling the summer on the two golden nuggets of their latest EP.

There couldn’t be a better title than Surf N Turf for a split 7” between Portland, Oregon’s Guantanamo Baywatch and Nashville, Tennessee’s Natural Child. While Guantanamo Baywatch bask in the coastal traditions of surf rock, Natural Child deliver the backwoods boogie of the landlocked Southern interior. To be fair, there’s much more to GB than vibrato-soaked Mosrite guitars. The recent Suicide Squeeze signees offset their Dick Dale-styled twang with the trashy hybrid of garage punk and surf rock spewed out by The Mummies. Sure, “Raunch Stomp” is in step with the Ventures’ tremolo-picking tradition, but a song like “Love This Time” explains why the band spent time on the boisterous Dirtnap Records roster. Neither is Natural Child to be mistaken for mere good ol’ boy sons of Skynyrd. Though they’ve certainly got a knack for a country-fried ballad (as evidenced on “Don’t Wake The Baby”) or a sweetly stoned fuzzed-out lead on guitar, the trio are better suited for sharing a beer-soaked bar stage with fellow Nashevillians JEFF the Brotherhood and Heavy Cream than headlining the mainstage at the state fair. Surf N Turf is available as a limited edition 7” (125 copies on opaque red vinyl, 125 on a green and lavender mix, and 500 on black) with a download coupon.

The Coathangers are a relentless force. Not content to rest on their laurels with 2011’s sweaty summer classic Larceny & Old Lace, Atlanta’s roadwarrior daughters delivered a new split 7” every six months courtesy of Suicide Squeeze Records. Previous installments have paired their no-fucks-given badassery with Puerto Rican partiers Davila 666, Canadian bass-riff maestros Nu Sensae, and Nashville vintage-rockers Heavy Cream. The Coathangers’ final chapter in the series has them sharing a slab of vinyl with recent Suicide Squeeze signees Audacity. Hailing from Orange County, Audacity perfectly embody Southern California’s polarizing elements of sunshine and urban density. While not exactly “Good Vibrations” or  “Welcome To The Jungle”, Audacity’s split-exclusive “Earthbot” shows both undeniable pop savvy and savage fretboard awareness. For their side, The Coathangers pay homage to driver’s-little-helper with “Adderall”. Showcasing the grittier side of their sound while still maintaining all of their token swagger, “Adderall” is a fitting cap on the split 7” series that carried through two years of relentless touring across North America and Europe.

While YAMANTAKA // SONIC TITAN has always provided an outlet for the core duo’s celebration of their Asian heritage, the inclusion of auxiliary musicians and artists into the fold has reinforced one of the most crucial defining dualities of the group: the merging of diasporic and indigenous perspectives. This meeting of East and West is perhaps most visible in UZU’s lead single “One”. As the first YAMANTAKA // SONIC TITAN song to extend the songwriting credits beyond the core duo, “One” incorporates the indigenous upbringings of the extended group by leading off with a traditional Iroquois song. The introductory chant is a social song calling all people together, and is performed by people of the Mohawk tribe. From there, the band kicks into a driving guitar line and a vocal hook as sweet as any J-pop hit. Metal riffing, free-jazz cacophony, and meditative Eastern percussion patterns accentuate the song. In the hands of lesser visionaries, this kind of cross-pollination would sound like a schizophrenic genre mash-up. But YAMANTAKA // SONIC TITAN’s appropriations never sound forced. Rather, it sounds like a celebration of the cultural collision of Alaska and Ruby’s upbringing. The hybridization is evident throughout UZU—you can hear it in the operatic piano-and-vocal opener  “Atlanta” segueing into the dynamic prog of “Whalesong”, the Eastern melodies seamlessly melding into the synth arpeggio and guitar dirge of “Windflower”, the musical storytelling tradition of “Seasickness Pt. 1” juxtaposing with the Heart-like classic rock gallop of “Seasickness Pt. 2”, and the closing choir passage of “Saturn’s Return” descending into Merzbow-esque white noise. It is safe to say there is no other band like YAMANTAKA // SONIC TITAN on the planet. In a world that is increasingly homogenized, a record like UZU is all the more important for demonstrating how disparate cultural perspectives can merge into something entirely new while retaining their individual sovereign character.\r\n\r\nThe first pressing of this LP is limited to 500 copies on grey marble vinyl and comes with a free download code. \r\n\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://suicidesqueeze.bandcamp.com/album/uzu\">- Stream Release // Purchase MP3s</a>","options":[{"id":43283340,"name":"LP - grey marble vinyl","price":13.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43283343,"name":"CD","price":10.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.75,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.99,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":11.99,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124158444/-/YTST-UZU900.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124158444/-/YTST-UZU900.jpg","width":900,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124217232/-/photo.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124217232/-/photo.JPG","width":2340,"height":2340}],"artists":[{"id":212889,"name":"YAMANTAKA // SONIC TITAN","permalink":"yamantaka-sonic-titan","url":"/artist/yamantaka-sonic-titan"}],"categories":[{"id":1748787,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":1776705,"name":"LPs","permalink":"lps","url":"/category/lps"}]},{"id":13506159,"name":"Audacity, \"Butter Knife\" LP/CD/CS","permalink":"audacity-butter-knife-lp-cd-pre-order","position":6,"price":13.99,"default_price":13.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/audacity-butter-knife-lp-cd-pre-order","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-11T21:46:56.000Z","description":"Audacity’s latest full-length Butter Knife is still, at its core, a garage rock record. Album opener “Couldn’t Hold A Candle” is a perfect introduction to Audacity’s battle plan—a balanced blend of pop sensibility and ribald power. “Hole In The Sky” showcases the band’s gift for the on-the-dime changes, sophisticated melodies, and clever instrumental interplay. “Red Wine” demonstrates a Robert Pollard-like knack for turning an unexpected chord combination into a remarkably punchy chorus. And album closer “Autumn” harkens back to the balladry of power pop kings Big Star.

You’d expect big thumping booty-bass and lascivious lyrics. You’d expect a fan-base of popped collars and bared midriffs. While the quartet does wield the power to pack in throngs of sweaty young people looking to dance, their sound bears little resemblance to the incessant thud of your standard club-banger. Instead, these four college-aged kids bust out a blend of surf guitar twang with garage-crafted power pop--think The Ventures meets The Marked Men. The band has already amassed a solid following in California and along the route to SXSW with just a self-titled cassette/LP to their name. Meat Market now offers up two new songs via Suicide Squeeze. “Too Tired” perfectly encapsulates their sound: a marriage of propulsive Stratocaster riffs with a big catchy chorus. B-side “The Return of Prince Donathunn” is an even stronger nod to the wave-riding instrumental groups of the ‘60s, with the steady 4/4 beat and dueling guitar leads belying the bands outspoken apathy towards surfing. The two-song EP is available worldwide both digitally and as a limited edition 7” (SOLD OUT - 100 on coke-bottle clear, 400 on black) with a download coupon.\r\n\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://suicidesqueeze.bandcamp.com/album/too-tired\">- Stream Release // Purchase MP3s</a>","options":[{"id":41240103,"name":"black vinyl","price":4.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.75,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.99,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":11.99,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122694666/-/MeatMarket900.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122694666/-/MeatMarket900.jpg","width":900,"height":900}],"artists":[{"id":224928,"name":"Meat Market","permalink":"meat-market","url":"/artist/meat-market"}],"categories":[{"id":1757401,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"}]},{"id":12015399,"name":"Antwon, \"Dying in the Pussy\" 7\" ","permalink":"antwon-dying-in-the-pussy-7-pre-order","position":11,"price":4.99,"default_price":4.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/antwon-dying-in-the-pussy-7-pre-order","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-26T00:13:44.000Z","description":"Limited to 750 copies! Hip-hop has always been a cultural mash-up. Starting with the mixed-genre sources of its turntable roots and evidenced in its appropriation into other music forms, hip-hop thrives under the absorption and re-contextualizing of the world around it. San Jose artist Antwon is a continuation of hip-hop’s legacy of amalgams. Rather than building songs out of drumbreaks from old funk and disco records, Antwon is more likely to rap over shoegaze and post-rock samples. He commiserates and collaborates with black metal bands and chillwave pioneers. His performances garner crowds more akin to Gilman Street punk shows than rap concerts—an appropriate development considering his outspoken appreciation for Bay Area powerviolence bands. In keeping with his unlikely bedfellows, Antwon’s latest EP comes courtesy of indie stalwart Suicide Squeeze. Mixed by Lars Stalfors, producer and engineer behind multiple Mars Volta and Omar Rodriguez-Lopez albums, “Dying In The Pussy” marries an MC’s traditional sexual bravado with a signature style of smoked-out fatalism over ominous interweaving synth lines. In contrast to the A-side’s sinister swagger, “Life Is What You Make It” is Antwon’s summer jam. A stylistic continuation of last year’s collaboration with Pictureplane, this b-side gem is a perfect blend of chilled-out West Coast hip-hop set against the backdrop of glitchy, warbling electropop. \r\n\r\nThe two-song EP is available worldwide both digitally and as a limited edition 7” (SOLD OUT - 250 copies on white and black marble, 500 on black) with a download coupon.\r\n\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://suicidesqueeze.bandcamp.com/album/dying-in-the-pussy\">- Stream Release // Purchase MP3s</a>","options":[{"id":38024181,"name":"black ","price":4.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.75,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.99,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":11.99,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/118373202/-/Antwon900.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/118373202/-/Antwon900.jpg","width":900,"height":900}],"artists":[{"id":213291,"name":"Antwon","permalink":"antwon","url":"/artist/antwon"}],"categories":[{"id":1757401,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"}]},{"id":12334749,"name":"Suicide Squeeze Koozies","permalink":"suicide-squeeze-koozies","position":12,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/suicide-squeeze-koozies","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-12T20:48:54.000Z","description":"Just in time for summer.

It is organized, driving chaos, determined to break everything loose and free everybody from their imaginary prisons and phony leaders. In just under eight minutes, Destruction Unit's sonic repetition, feedback experimentation and pummeling drums make for two songs that go off like a machine gun in the trenches of your psyche, all without a note feeling out of place. They will drive you crazy out of your head and into your body. Both tracks are loud, noisy and organic, no flashy solos or technical pandering. In fact, don't expect to find music at all.

George W. Bush. Cormac McCarthy novels. Chainsaw massacres. Texas has a reputation for being a grim place. Sure, there’s the rock n’ roll haven of Austin, the metropolitan hubs of Dallas and Houston, and the weird art commune of Marfa. But by and large, it’s a land of dry counties and conservatism. Which makes the demented psych garage of Lubbock’s Numerators all the more compelling. Western Texas is perhaps the most inhospitable region of the state for a young band of misfits to combine a love of David Lynch’s twisted take on the ‘50s with a requisite dash of Lone Star homage to 13th Floor Elevators, yet somehow the Numerators managed to thrive under such stark conditions.

White Woods is the alias for Julia Kugel, better known for her work as the guitarist and vocalist for Atlanta’s riotous garage rockers The Coathangers. Under her solo moniker, Kugel delivered a heartfelt blend of golden-oldies and subdued Americana with her debut single on Suicide Squeeze last year. Now Kugel is back with another two-song White Woods offering, exploring the same kind of sultry vintage sounds that made her first 7” sell out so quickly. The A-side, “Big Talking,\" takes The Coathangers’ attitude, unplugs it from the amps, and delivers its admonishment with a graceful AM radio vibe. On the flipside, “Corner Town” conjures the sex and strut of David Lynch’s pop-culture nods to ‘50s.

There’s a common-held notion that great rock music only comes out of big cities, as if the grime and struggle of life in urban spaces is the essential fuel for truly passionate rock n roll. But this was a belief when cities were emptying out and the suburbs were growing. Now we’re witnessing the repopulation of major metropolitan areas. Suburbs are becoming the new wasteland. Perhaps that’s the reason why the Orange County suburb of Fullerton was finally able to birth a band like Audacity. Nurtured by local garage rock havens like record store/label Burger Records, the young brash power pop of Audacity kick out jams that are both aptly sunny and gritty—a perfect blend of SoCal’s good weather and endless concrete. With two LPs under the young four-piece’s belt, they’ve set aside two songs for a 7” on Suicide Squeeze before they unleash another full-length later this year. For the uninitiated, “Finders Keepers” b/w “Onomatopoeia” is the perfect introduction to Audacity’s potent combination of pop melodies and roughly hewn energy.

Atlanta’s reigning garage rock daughters The Coathangers return with the third installment in their series of split 7”s on Suicide Squeeze. This time they’ve teamed up with labelmates Nü Sensae. Both new listeners and longtime fans of The Coathangers will be whipped into a frenzy with “Derek’s Song”, a party-banger perfectly encapsulating the quartet’s capacity for sharp hooks and jagged instrumentation. Nü Sensae contribute “Throw” to their side of the split. Rounding out their sound with the recent addition of guitarist Brody McKnight, Nü Sensae’s newest song is a ferocious and harrowing leap forward.

Proving just how unpredictable they can be, they abandoned their status as a duo — a favourite angle of both the media and fans — and recruited Vancouver noise rock great Brody McKnight as a full-time member. Previously working with the now-legendary group Mutators, McKnight has added another dimension of heaviness to the band’s already mind-melting sludge attack.\r\n\r\nThey’ve also embraced diversity in other ways, allowing more loud-quiet dynamics into their songwriting. From the creeping dirge of “Tea Swamp Park” to the vast expanse of “Say What You Are,” the quiet sections offer brief moments of uneasy solace between the full out attack of songs like “100 Shades,” “Tyjna” and “Eat Your Mind.” Elsewhere, subtle but defined melodies surface amidst the fuzz of tracks like “Burnt Masks” and “Dust.” Don’t be mistaken, though: Sundowning is designed to bludgeon with the raw aggression that can only come from the best elements of noise, punk and grunge.\r\n\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://suicidesqueeze.bandcamp.com/album/sundowning\">- Stream Release // Purchase MP3s</a>","options":[{"id":20912969,"name":"LP","price":13.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":20912971,"name":"CD","price":11.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.99,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.99,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.99,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64625691/-/NuSensae_cover_3x3_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64625691/-/NuSensae_cover_3x3_.jpg","width":900,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/115958334/-/photo.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/115958334/-/photo.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":128837,"name":"Nü Sensae","permalink":"nu-sensae","url":"/artist/nu-sensae"}],"categories":[{"id":1748787,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":1776705,"name":"LPs","permalink":"lps","url":"/category/lps"}]},{"id":7962387,"name":"The Aislers Set T-Shirt","permalink":"the-aislers-set-t-shirt","position":20,"price":12.99,"default_price":12.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-aislers-set-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-13T00:44:11.000Z","description":"Women's t-shirts printed on American Apparel 'Classic Girl' 100% Cotton\r\n\r\nMen's t-shirts printed on Jerzees 100% Cotton","options":[{"id":25145688,"name":"Women&#x27;s Small (black)","price":12.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25145691,"name":"Women&#x27;s Small (red)","price":12.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25145694,"name":"Women&#x27;s Medium (black)","price":12.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25145697,"name":"Women&#x27;s Medium (red)","price":12.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25145700,"name":"Women&#x27;s Medium (pink)","price":12.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25145703,"name":"Women&#x27;s Large (black)","price":12.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25145706,"name":"Women&#x27;s Large (red)","price":12.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25145709,"name":"Women&#x27;s Large (pink)","price":12.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25145712,"name":"Men&#x27;s Small (black)","price":12.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25145715,"name":"Men&#x27;s Small (red)","price":12.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25145721,"name":"Men&#x27;s Large (black)","price":12.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25145718,"name":"Men&#x27;s Large (red)","price":12.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.75,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.99,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":11.99,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/78252549/-/photo.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/78252549/-/photo.JPG","width":1000,"height":747}],"artists":[{"id":48919,"name":"The Aislers Set","permalink":"the-aislers-set","url":"/artist/the-aislers-set"}],"categories":[{"id":1748793,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":7287037,"name":"Peace, \"The World Is Too Much With Us\" LP ","permalink":"peace-the-world-is-too-much-with-us-lp-pre-order","position":21,"price":11.99,"default_price":11.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/peace-the-world-is-too-much-with-us-lp-pre-order","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-18T23:48:40.000Z","description":"LP pressing (1): white vinyl, MP3 download coupon, limited to 500 copies + black vinyl, MP3 download coupon, limited to 500 copies.  \r\n\r\nPeace recorded its sophomore LP in Pamela Anderson’s hometown, a fogged-in hamlet named Ladysmith on the east coast of Vancouver Island.

Atlanta, Georgia’s favorite raucous daughters, The Coathangers, return with the second installment in their series of four split 7”s on Suicide Squeeze Records. This time, The Coathangers’ effortless amalgam of garage rock righteousness, riot grrrl bad-ass-ness, and post-punk jaggedness is paired up with the propulsive proto-punk of their former tourmates in Nashville’s Heavy Cream. Fans of The Coathangers are already accustomed to the beer-soaked, dance-inducing jams whipped up by bassist Meredith, guitarist Julia, keyboardist Candice, and drummer Steph, but on “Merry Go Round” the quartet swap instruments and knock out their most solid and catchy number to date. With The Coathangers raising the bar with their newest song, Infinity Cat Recordings artists Heavy Cream countered by contributing “Toasted” to their side of the split. With it’s big and bold drumbeat, driving guitar chords, sing-along chorus, and blown out production, “Toasted” not only sounds like a fitting addition to JEFF the Brotherhood’s record label, it sounds like the long lost rock n’ roll gem that first incited Joan Jett and Johnny Ramone to pick up guitars back in the ‘70s. With the first of The Coathangers’ split singles on Suicide Squeeze now out of print (the highly coveted pairing with Puerto Rican party rockers Davilla 666), it’s not hard to imagine the 750 copies of this 7” (SOLD OUT - 250 opaque red, 500) selling out fast.

Somewhere in pre-dawn Cleveland, Gabe Fulvimar hunkers down in his bedroom with his laptop, a guitar, a drum machine, and a Fender Rhodes and records songs under the name Gap Dream. Before you groan over another “bedroom pop” artist, spend two seconds absorbing Fulvimar’s mystical, stoned-to-the-bone one-man garage rock. If Lou Reed and Jason Pierce had MacBooks back when they were starting out, it wouldn’t be hard to imagine them kicking out a jam like “A Little Past Midnight”. It’s almost tempting to claim Gap Dream’s ability to make such warm, wacked out, psychedelic grooves in such technologically-cold hermit-like conditions as Fulvimar’s crowning achievement. But the process behind the music doesn’t mean shit when you hear Fulvimar’s smooth harmonies, warbling tremolo guitar, and reverberating haze sewn together into a tune as beguiling as “Generator”. May we suggest you dig into these songs in the same manner they were crafted? In your bedroom, late at night, under the influence of your favorite intoxicating substance.

Irresistible hooks and choruses butt up against Nobunny’s flirtations with nudity and violence. Listening to his latest single on Suicide Squeeze, “La La La La Love You” b/w “Drei Blondinen”, it’s crucial to envision the lanky frontman clad in his underwear and nappy bunny mask, baiting the audience while pogoing across the stage in time to his ruthlessly upbeat songs.

Wax Idol’s new 7”, Schadenfreude b/w The Last Drop, is the music you listen to at night. Draw the blinds, turn off the lights and close your eyes. Stare at the black on the back of your eyelids. Echoing around your subconscious like being discharged from a 51/50 in the middle of the night in the middle of the city, alone and right before you find friends or drugs. The sound of a dizzy adaptation to a clinical, sadistic midnight world. Born from the punk rock meets pop revelry sensibilities of front woman Hether Fortune, Wax Idols has blasted their brand of cheeky, in your face “insert buzzword sub-genre here” from the Bay to your brain since forming 2 years ago. Their previous 7” “All Too Human” (Hozac) and the full length LP “No Future” (Hozac) were a showcase of Fortune’s uninhibited, snarling musical prowess and cultivated, take no prisoners execution. These new songs are evidence of Wax Idols’ carefully calculated evolution of sound, although maybe a carefully calculated, utterly submersive descent into sound might be a more accurate way of describing it. Hether Fortune, on vocals and guitar, was accompanied by her fellow bandmates Jennifer Mundy on backing vocals and guitar, Amy Rosenoff on bass and Keven Tecon on drums. With the aptly named A-side track “Schadenfreude,” Wax Idols invoke a perfectly executed frenzy of drums, distorted vocals, and compulsive guitar. It’s a song that sinks through the cracks with sinister hooks, a shifty eyed concoction of pitching and reeling reverb. The eponymous “The Last Drop” similarly swims with eerie layers of guitar over bass over drums, drenched in black eyeliner and sneering. The 7” was engineered and co-produced by Monte Vallier with Hether Fortune, and will be available via Suicide Squeeze Records on May 8th with a limited pressing of green vinyl. Snatch it up while you still have a chance because this record begs no comparison to predecessor punks. It stands on its own, with a kick and a punch in the face.

Guitarist/vocalist Julia Kugel established her chops with Atlanta’s The Coathangers, winning audiences over with her deceptively clever hooks and propulsive upbeat energy. But as the band put more notches on their touring and recording belt, it became clear that there was more to their repertoire than jagged guitar lines and infectious charm. Asserting her abilities as a thoughtful and nuanced songwriter, Kugel offers up her debut solo offering under the name White Woods. The project provides the kind of soulful introspective pop The Coathangers hinted at with songs like “Go Away”, but delivered in a context without the juxtaposition of the band’s barnburner garage rock numbers. The songs showcase Kugel’s beguiling forays into forlorn Americana and smoky, subdued blues.

Hot on the heels of their critically acclaimed 2011 album Larceny & Old Lace, the rowdy Southern garage rockers The Coathangers plan to release four limited edition split 7”s in 2012, further propelling their reputation for rambunctious rabble-rousing and a relentless work ethic. The first of the splits finds The Coathangers whipping out one of their bawdy bombasts alongside lo-fi party septet Davilla 666. The Puerto Rican group raised more than a few eyebrows recently, receiving accolades from heavyweight press outlets like Pitchfork and the LA Times, and more importantly, winning the approval of contemporary garage icons like The Black Lips and Jay Reatard. Both bands bring scratchy guitars, hip-shakin’ beats, and sing-along choruses into the fray, resulting in an essential platter of primal rock n’ roll.

Sisters of the moon, Jennifer and Jessica Clavin make up the Los Angeles band, Bleached. The songwriting-duo return with the follow-up to their Carter 7-inch, holding the rare soul of rock and roll for all to witness. The two new songs “Searching Through The Past” & “Electric Chair,” burn clear with energy and sly beauty. They embody the mutinous spirit of The Misfits or early Stones, married to the style of Stevie Nicks. Nothing wasted, and nothing else wanted.  The a-side, especially, plays like something you’ve never heard before – impossibly catchy – it walks off with a sly smile, straight out of the aftermath of some social whirl.

In any relationship, what's not said often lingers: the relative silence of atoms and electrons bonding, or the long distance stare of the lonely. Texan four-piece, This Will Destroy You, understands what lasts, binding their sound to distant starlight as it slips thru the night sky.  \"Black Dunes\" is the second single chosen from the band's stellar album, Tunnel Blanket. Two versions of the song appear here for the first time. One edited by the band themselves, and the other a b-side remix by Holy Other that, like the best of his work, blurs the sourced sound, creating a new language from the previous original. It's an offering - limited to an edition of 500, on Suicide Squeeze Records - and an attempt, the kind that only the best of us make, to communicate with the universe.

Yeah, it's an easy leap to guess this would be a proper summer release. But, if you're already familiar with Alex Zhang Hungtai's music, you know it's got a special connection to the end of that season, and the beginning of autumn. And if not, this EP will offer a perfect introduction. The lead track is a live version of \"Lone Runner,\" is simple perfection: Handclaps lead off a vocal style locked in with both Nick Cave and Elvis, yet totally his own. A song that may drag you by the hand to a place you've never been.

They mine the classic sounds of paranoia, malaise and misanthropy (Joy Division, The Velvet Underground, The Fall and early 90s alt-rock), and fill it all with so much exuberance and joy of playing that each song becomes a triumph over anxiety and ennui. Visits finds each of the band’s five members stepping outside of themselves, but not in an snake-poison-ingesting, flopping-on-the-floor sense. It’s something else, something full of wonder. It’s witnessing a dear friend suddenly unveil an incredible hidden talent, as if that talent is levitation or some shit. These songs burst and evolve like water capsule toys. Warm beds of wobbly and fat-bodied krautpop prove to be overwhelming, atmospheric art-rock tours de force. You are left pie-eyed and windblown by the whole glorious affair. It’s the B-side of Neu! as pep rally music.

But this time around we’re hearing a band that’s honed their trade and incorporated more stylistic variations. It’s also the band’s first experience in a proper studio; the album was recorded with Ed Rawls at The Living Room in Atlanta, Georgia. The result is a record that feels like The Coathangers we’ve always known and loved, but sounds like a band taking their trade more seriously. Where their past recordings were a mash-up of garage rock’s rough and loose instrumentation and no-wave’s abrasive tonalities, Larceny & Old Lace showcases a broader song-writing range. “Go Away” taps into a ‘60s girl-group sound. “Call to Nothing” employs the paint-peeling guitars, dance beats, and slightly ominous melodies of the early post-punk pioneers. “Well Alright” is reminiscent of Rolling Stones’ bawdy R&B strut. “Tabbacco Road” is perhaps the biggest leap for the band, completely eschewing their rabble-rousing strategy in favor of penning a pensive and somber ballad. With this broadened artistic horizon, refinement of technique, and Ed Rawls’ production allowing every instrument to shine without detracting from the band’s natural grit, The Coathangers’ latest offering is easily their best record to date.\r\n\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://suicidesqueeze.bandcamp.com/album/larceny-old-lace\">- Stream Release // Purchase MP3s</a>","options":[{"id":17691929,"name":"LP","price":13.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":24618219,"name":"CD","price":11.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":49232481,"name":"Cassette","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.99,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.99,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.99,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/40061895/-/larceny_med.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/40061895/-/larceny_med.jpg","width":450,"height":450},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76596516/-/Snapshot_2012-11-02_10-27-34.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76596516/-/Snapshot_2012-11-02_10-27-34.jpg","width":452,"height":496}],"artists":[{"id":49353,"name":"The Coathangers","permalink":"the-coathangers","url":"/artist/the-coathangers"}],"categories":[{"id":1748787,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":1776705,"name":"LPs","permalink":"lps","url":"/category/lps"},{"id":1998154,"name":"Cassettes","permalink":"cassettes","url":"/category/cassettes"}]},{"id":3475076,"name":"This Will Destroy You, \"Tunnel Blanket\" 2xLP / CD ","permalink":"this-will-destroy-you-tunnel-blanket-2xlp-pre-order","position":35,"price":21.99,"default_price":21.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/this-will-destroy-you-tunnel-blanket-2xlp-pre-order","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-03-24T02:42:18.000Z","description":"LP pressing (4) - 2xLP (black), gatefold jacket, MP3 download coupon, limited to 500 copies \r\n\r\nTunnel Blanket delivers the epic-in-scope soundscapes that followers\r\nof its makers’ previous recordings are accustomed to, but presents\r\nthem in new lights – where once the sun shone down bright upon\r\nimmediate tropes and traits, now their work is better suited to\r\ndistant starlight, casting changeable shadows across vistas of\r\ninspired, ambitious amplification.

These days Michael Nau is making music very differently than he did in Page France. The original paranoia that haunted him has dropped off. \"This feels like a new leaf to me. I've learned to let the music happen, rather than trying to invent something,\" says Nau, \"I'm still sifting through some imaginary thesis, but it makes more sense now.\" The result of his personal revelation is Paranoid Cocoon: the debut full-length for Suicide Squeeze. It's an album full of quite, wooden psychedelia that reflects the duo's casual pursuit of comfort and freedom under the mountains of Cumberland, Maryland, where creeks zigzag in the lonesome dark of the forest, and a red moon hangs overhead. These are songs of leaving, of dreams both good and bad, sung from surroundings they've known their whole lives. In \"By the Morning Light,\" Nau and McGraw's voices draw each other out of a contemplative melancholy and into a state of amazed gratification; the music here shimmers, always - the snare-drum cracks against the tug of guitar - reaching the sublime crush of Yo La Tengo's \"And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside Out.\" It's simple understated perfection: they sound timeless from singing together forever. \r\n\r\nIncludes a coupon for a free digital download of the LP in MP3 format.\r\n\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://suicidesqueeze.bandcamp.com/album/paranoid-cocoon\">- Stream Release // Purchase MP3s</a>","options":[{"id":17692143,"name":"CD","price":10.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.99,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.99,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.99,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29607957/-/cottonjones_paranoid.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29607957/-/cottonjones_paranoid.jpg","width":265,"height":265}],"artists":[{"id":49357,"name":"Cotton Jones","permalink":"cotton-jones","url":"/artist/cotton-jones"}],"categories":[{"id":1748787,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":3052945,"name":"Cotton Jones, \"Tall Hours in the Glowstream\" LP / CD","permalink":"cotton-jones-tall-hours-in-the-glowstream-lp","position":52,"price":10.99,"default_price":10.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cotton-jones-tall-hours-in-the-glowstream-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-12-21T11:36:01.000Z","description":"Cotton Jones, as always, in the arms of Michael Nau and Whitney McGraw. \"Tall Hours in the Glowstream,\" is the title of their new album.

Their most recent full-length (and featured remix victim) Menos El Oso was heavy on samples and their live set finds guitarist Dave Knudson playing his peddles more frequently than his guitar.\r\n\r\nSo when Minneapolis based rapper P.O.S. turns Drilling into a skronked up backdrop over which vocalist Jake Snider can plaintively lament, it's not really a shock...or is it? When Battles' Tyondai Braxton brings Erin Tate's clipped drums front and center to the mix it's akin to watching ice melt. As Minus the Bear transform, Interpretaciones del Oso achieves that rare remix goal of presenting an already esteemed record in an entirely new light.
