It's impossible to insert this belorussian duo expression into generally accepted stereotype of exemplary life. This album deserves its name completely, it is saturated by pure energy from the first till last minute. If you have strong imagination about what that - AMBASSADOR21, if you know what you are waiting for - get it.\r\nAre they more diverse? Yes. More deep? Yes. More electronic? Yes.\r\nDoes they changed? No. They are strong and sexy.\r\nDense and noisy electro hardcore wall of sound which can be ferocious and merciless. But their anger always with a smile - from ambivalent ironic lyrics in Russian and English to forceful pounding industrial kicks, brutal synth layers and explosive broken beats seasoned by psychopathic glitches. And duel of earfucking vocals which make their music absolutely unique.\r\nThat's AMBASSADOR21 as you have learned to like them - but harder, louder, younger. Ultra fucking destroy.\r\nIncl. remixes by S.I.N.A., IMMINENT, SYNAPSCAPE.\r\n \r\n01. In Love\r\n02. Now I Complete & You Will Suck\r\n03. Megeneration\r\n04. Fat In Fire\r\n05.

With 3 full length albums under their belt and multiple concerts across Europe, the duo now presents their new studio album. On \"Homicide\", SUICIDE INSIDE reveals more power than ever before, triggers extreme emotions and expands its endless lust for life. The album showcases a sort of uncensored vision of love as mechanism of life and death. Love as a provocation. Love as a way to disrupt personal dogmas and get out of societal control. Musically, SUICIDE INSIDE stands for an eclectic blend of aggressive electronic music and furious industrial rock, with heavy breakbeats, rhythmic noise and Natasha's razor-sharp provocative female vocals. An exploding cocktail of acid-house styled synths, distorted bass-lines, dramatic sound fx, loud powerful vox. Hard, oppressive and chaotic, SUICIDE INSIDE's new album \"Homicide\" will blow you away with its uncompromising sonic force and revolting provocative feminity. \"Do not forget your razor, baby!\".\r\n\r\n01.

With this intensive sounding album AMBASSADOR21 blows up your sound system totally - there is no time for a funeral arrangement. Musically based on massive industrial sound with obvious punk influences, 'Weight Of Death' brings more heavy breaks, flailing noisy straight beats, ferocious screams of Natasha in russian and english language and smashed shop windows into AMBASSADOR21' essence. When you rape us we will seek vengeance. Psychodelic guitar riffs by CTRLer and painful 'a la GODFLESH'-bass guitars by Mark Kammerbauer make it possible to say - you are dealing with the best AMBASSADOR21' album ever. CONVERTER collaborated with AMBASSADOR21 in 'New Doctrine About Trinity II', which has been released on-line as single in august 2k5 and blasted dancefloors all over the world; in collaboration with MOTHBOY - 'Winter Trip 2' - AMBASSADOR21 create a big surprise for their fans, with a nice slow breakbeat-trip; ROGER ROTOR collaborated with AMBASSADOR21 in 'Delete The Elite', which was produced with backing-vocals by PROYECTO MIRAGE, SYNAPSCAPE, RASPUTEEN, ASCHE and CTRLer; and sure, the album has some kind of hot hits, as punk/industrial hymns like 'Batman vs. Elvis' and 'My Little Freedom', or the dancefloor massacre track 'Smith-And-Wesson'. Let's say, 'Weight Of Death' is full of noise, beats, speed, anger, stones and fire.\r\nP.S. The bullet changes the power fast.\r\n\r\n01. New Doctrine About Trinity II (feat. CONVERTER)\r\n02.

Each track is full on overdriven rage and all the better for it. Belarussia's answer to Atari Teenage Riot, but way more aggressive. Alexey and Natasha just don't know how to be subtle. Stealing riffs and beats to claim as their own, A21 even mange to reshape and repackage Ministry into an even angrier and self destructive monster.

We pass from rhytmic noise (P.A.L, MIMETIC, ASCHE) and dancefloor oriented pieces (:WUMPSCUT:, SUICIDE INSIDE, AH CAMA-SOTZ, S.K.E.T., MONOLITH) to experimental ambience (THIS MORN OMINA, CONTAGIOUS ORGASM) and hard breakbeats (BAK XIII, ISZOLOSCOPE, HYPNOSKULL, TARMVRED).\r\nAMBASSADOR21 never care about any limits or “genre’ borders” ever. We can find it even more on this album due to many other contributors who did a great work, not just having re-made, but added some their very own points of view into AMBASSADOR21 songs. And in the end we have as result a new incredible release – intense, hard and nice.\r\nIt's DRUNKEN, it's CRAZY, it's WITH A GUN! This is AMBASSADOR21.\r\n\r\n01.
