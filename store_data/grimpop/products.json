Once dry, liquid latex remains light and flexible. \r\n\r\nClear liquid latex remains the most versatile product used by special effects artists. It can be used to create scars, wrinkling and blistering effects as well as blending prosthetic seams. This liquid latex is of amazing quality, and is perfect for creating latex appliances (see below for ordering 1 gallon size.)\r\n\r\nFor example: to create a realistic blister, apply a thin round-ish layer of clear liquid latex, allow to dry until clear, then pinch and pull the center out. Roll the edges out to create the look of dead skin, or apply blood gel for an oozing blister effect. \r\n\r\nIf applying liquid latex to skin with hair, we highly recommend applying a thin layer of aloe vera gel first. To remove liquid latex, simply pick up a corner and peel off.\r\n\r\nWarning: Please do a small skin test first as latex allergy is a rare but real condition!\r\n\r\nAvailable in 2 oz. and 8 oz. Please contact us for 1 gallon size.","options":[{"id":44193540,"name":"2 oz.
