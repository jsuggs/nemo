The three equilateral triangles sit in this form naturally and have been further reinforced with hidden joints. Rigorous design process was undertaken in order to resolve what was at first, a purely conceptual form. The final product retains the original poetic expression and is executed with attention to detail and structure. Every joint is identical, hence making production extremely swift.\r\n\r\n*limited time free delivery Australia wide","options":[{"id":45182607,"name":"tasmanian oak","price":660.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48178803,"name":"black wood 800mm lmd edt","price":780.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127624584/-/liam_mugavin_1_Tangle.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127624584/-/liam_mugavin_1_Tangle.jpg","width":2280,"height":2280},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126584739/-/6_tangle_top.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126584739/-/6_tangle_top.JPG","width":4592,"height":3056},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127618491/-/liam_mugavin_2_Tangle.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127618491/-/liam_mugavin_2_Tangle.JPG","width":4592,"height":3056}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6372543,"name":"furniture","permalink":"furniture","url":"/category/furniture"},{"id":6671334,"name":"product","permalink":"product","url":"/category/product"}]},{"id":14866470,"name":"tangle sphere light","permalink":"tangle-sphere-light","position":2,"price":390.0,"default_price":390.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tangle-sphere-light","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-15T12:15:36.000Z","description":"Tasmanian Oak 275mm\r\n\r\nTangle Sphere Light endeavors to maximize lighting impact by encapsulating the bulb within the tangle cage.
