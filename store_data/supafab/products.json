COME ON.\r\n\r\nSo I've created a grey cabled cotton houseplant sweater, with cuff, fitted perfectly over a cream ceramic pot. The pot and sweater are designed to hold a 3.5\" plastic potted plant -- the inner plastic pot and plant (which you provide) will not leak through the outer ceramic pot and sweater (which I provide) (you're welcome).\r\n\r\nI think we get the point here. Cute AND functional, that's what we're talking about.","options":[{"id":1569811,"name":"grey cables","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3154382/-/houseplant_sweater.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3154382/-/houseplant_sweater.jpg","width":640,"height":480}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":308691,"name":"home","permalink":"home","url":"/category/home"}]}]
