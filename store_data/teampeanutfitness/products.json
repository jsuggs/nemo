I just am so grateful you share these tips and help those of us just starting out! Thank you!\" - Traci Slane \r\n\r\nAre you looking to manage or drop some weight to feel great and look your best? I have made a sample \"carb-cyling\" plan that shows you how I eat all year long, especially when I am prepping for a competition to drop 1 lb a week.\r\n\r\nThey say \"abs are made in the kitchen\" and it's true. My body has only seen these changes because of carb-cycling. This plan is set up for a very managable healthy lifestyle and you WILL shed bodyfat. Carb-cycling keeps your body guessing which will set your metabolism on fire. You WANT to feel hungry all of the time and the kicker is you should EAT ALL OF THE TIME!\r\n\r\nMy meal plan will show you samples of fun meals that I eat all of the time (I'm also gluten, dairy and soy free) Here is a sample meal:\r\n\r\nProtein: Turkey Burger (no bread)\r\nVeggie: Add salsa or tomato to burger/ side of green beans or snap peas or spinach salad\r\nCarb: Salty: Corn Tortilla Chips OR Sweet: dark chocolate (serving size should be around 20-\r\n25 carbs)\r\nFat: Add peanut butter to dk choc. OR avocado to turkey burger\r\n\r\nAfter your purchase I will email you a document within 24-48 hours to have as your own resource. The 6 page plan has a week plan with 5 meals laid out for each day. I also include a shopping list  that includes what you need for the sampled meals. Once you have this plan you can always send me an email with questions and I will gladly help you along the way.\r\n\r\nStick to this easy \"real life\" plan that is NOT extreme and will allow you to treat yourself. You will lean out and build lean muscle if you're lifting regularly too! Who wouldn't love that!?\r\n\r\nBethany Nelson (aka Peanut)\r\nFigure Universe PRO & Fitness Competitor","options":[{"id":24579774,"name":"Default","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/79601961/-/before_and_after_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/79601961/-/before_and_after_2.jpg","width":1000,"height":982},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/79601721/-/img011.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/79601721/-/img011.jpg","width":781,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95105095/-/Before_Trio_Collage.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95105095/-/Before_Trio_Collage.jpg","width":1000,"height":651}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3818349,"name":"Competition","permalink":"competition","url":"/category/competition"}]}]
