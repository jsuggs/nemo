She also released the multi media project Nu Nog Even Niet in 2012 on Jezus Factory with the lyrics of Lotte Dodion and the paintings of Inge Bos.  After all this, it was time for her first real solo record. Playing in various formations had made her conscious of the patterns that we all, as humans, share in. So, she sought out kindred spirits with whom she might record an album filled with freedom and intensity, and who were conscious of the patterns we so often fall back on.\r\n\r\nNils Frahm was the first of these to cross her path. The inventive German pianist and producer is an intense and adventurous performer and was a perfect match for this project.  Acda also experienced a direct bond with Peter Broderick, a multi-instrumentalist known from his solo work (on labels such as Bella Union and Erased Tapes) and from his work with, among others, Efterklang.  Cellist extraordinaire Gyda Valtysdottir from Icelandic group Múm had previously worked with Chantal as a member of the Sleepingdog live band. And lastly, Shahzad Ismaily stumbled into this picture by chance, but when Acda and he found themselves in the same room they formed an instant rapport.\r\n\r\nThe circle completed, Acda had found the 4 worlds that would enable her to record the album in full freedom. Power revealed through vulnerability.  Nils Frahm, who plays throughout the record, also took on the role of producer.  What began as a journey ended as this wonderful record - one wherein the five musicians were able to find their place and, together, and with great warmth, tell their nine-song story. ‘Let your hands be my guide’.\r\n\r\nRELEASE DATE:\r\nNOVEMBER 11th 2013\r\n\r\nFORMATS: \r\n LP / CD \r\n\r\nTRACKLISTING:\r\n1.

Not because I am an idiot.” – Ian Button 2013\r\n\r\nCambridge Nutflake will be the second release on the Gare Du Nord label co-op formed by Robert Rotifer, Ian Button and Ralegh Long in 2013.\r\n\r\nPapernut Cambridge is Ian’s project: a vinyl album and accompanying EP of songs recorded by him and a whole range of friends, guests and bandmates, and based on an imaginary band he dreamed about one night in the early 1990s.\r\n\r\n‘It’s not a Gorillaz or Ziggy Stardust idea – we’re not pretending to be Papernut Cambridge. I don’t even remember what their music was like in the dream – just the names of these two bands on a gig poster: Papernut Cambridge and Elvis Breakdown….we’re kind of named after them and sing about them, that’s all.’\r\n\r\nIan Button left Leeds University to work at Pinnacle Records in 1981. He narrowly missed becoming the drummer in The Sisters of Mercy, was a founder member and guitarist in Thrashing Doves for most of the 80s, and later spent 13 years as Death In Vegas’ guitar player at the same time as doing media music projects, collaborations and sessions (Dot Allison etc) and releasing a series of his own underground material through the 1990s and 2000s as The Anthony Anderson Project.\r\n\r\nSince 2004 he’s been teaching degree level music production and has become a drummer/producer/engineer with a list of current projects, collaborations and credits that include Rotifer, Go Kart Mozart, Deep Cut, David Cronenberg’s Wife, Paul Hawkins, Mary Epworth, Lucy’s Diary, Sgt Buzfuz, Pete Astor, Darren Hayman, Extradition Order and a host of others, many of whom have guested on the Cambridge Nutflake tracks.\r\n\r\nThe Papernut Cambridge project deliberately raises a couple of questions about the traditional/current process of being an artist and releasing a record.\r\n\r\n“If you’re going to produce a ‘valued’ artefact like a vinyl release, I think it’s important to retain the integrity of it, and not de-value it or relegate it to just some kind of unplayable ornament. The idea of Cambridge Nutflake is that there will be no companion digital version of it – any sampler tracks, compilation tracks, promos or downloads will be different mixes and versions of the songs: mono mixes, edits, versions with drumming on/off, mixes processed through different effects…..you might hear parts that aren’t on the record and vice versa. The idea is that everything points back to the vinyl as the definitive version, but there will be extras and alternate material too for those that want it.”\r\n\r\nThe album’s final track – Papernut Pledge – is Button’s viewpoint on crowd funding:\r\n\r\n“It’s not so much a tirade against it – it just me saying it makes me feel uncomfortable and I wouldn’t do it….hmm…I feel like doing some gardening…anyone want to buy me a new lawnmower?...cheers, I’ll send you a picture of the grass when I’ve cut it…..sort of thing.”\r\n\r\nPapernut Cambridge have played live (in real life) only once, performing a set of Velvet Underground covers at a party in 2012.","options":[{"id":46733721,"name":"Default","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126543492/-/papernut_cambridge.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126543492/-/papernut_cambridge.jpg","width":350,"height":350},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126543501/-/papernut_nut.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126543501/-/papernut_nut.jpg","width":1200,"height":850},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126543528/-/papernut_nut_nut.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126543528/-/papernut_nut_nut.jpg","width":1200,"height":780},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126543543/-/papernut.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126543543/-/papernut.jpg","width":1200,"height":843},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126969765/-/button_alien.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126969765/-/button_alien.jpg","width":480,"height":480}],"artists":[{"id":46856,"name":"The Beat Maras","permalink":"the-beat-maras","url":"/artist/the-beat-maras"},{"id":46882,"name":"Paul Hawkins & Thee Awkward Silences","permalink":"paul-hawkins-thee-awkward-silences","url":"/artist/paul-hawkins-thee-awkward-silences"},{"id":243855,"name":"Papernut Cambridge","permalink":"papernut-cambridge","url":"/artist/papernut-cambridge"}],"categories":[{"id":1672103,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"},{"id":1672590,"name":"Other Distribution","permalink":"other-distribution","url":"/category/other-distribution"}]},{"id":14439570,"name":"Mauro Pawlowski - Possessed Factory ‎– Giant On A Bicycle 7\"","permalink":"mauro-pawlowski-possessed-factory-giant-on-a-bicycle-7","position":15,"price":6.5,"default_price":6.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mauro-pawlowski-possessed-factory-giant-on-a-bicycle-7","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-10-27T15:25:19.000Z","description":"Artwork by Jeff Cuypers, complete with stickers, every single unique\r\n\r\nA\t\t Giant On A Bicycle\t\t\r\nB1\t\t Big Top Pt 2\t\t\r\nB2\t\t It Never Came","options":[{"id":46732941,"name":"Default","price":6.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126542880/-/possess.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126542880/-/possess.jpg","width":150,"height":150}],"artists":[{"id":86719,"name":"Mauro Pawlowski","permalink":"mauro-pawlowski","url":"/artist/mauro-pawlowski"}],"categories":[{"id":1672103,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"},{"id":1672590,"name":"Other Distribution","permalink":"other-distribution","url":"/category/other-distribution"},{"id":1672663,"name":"Singles","permalink":"singles","url":"/category/singles"},{"id":1929822,"name":"Mauro Pawlowski","permalink":"mauro-pawlowski","url":"/category/mauro-pawlowski"}]},{"id":14324766,"name":"Belgian Vaults Vol 3 - Tracks From The Psych Archives - 180G Vinyl W/CD","permalink":"belgian-vaults-vol-3-tracks-from-the-psych-archives-180g-vinyl-w-cd","position":16,"price":16.0,"default_price":16.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/belgian-vaults-vol-3-tracks-from-the-psych-archives-180g-vinyl-w-cd","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-10-21T22:45:48.000Z","description":"Third volume in the series 'BELGIAN VAULTS'.

The perfect gift for that special someone?\r\n\r\nIf you purchase this hard back book then you can chose from either 'We Are Not Other People' or 'Apologies To The Enlightenment' \r\n\r\nPaul Hawkins - Bad Santas: and Other Creepy Christmas Characters-\r\n\r\nSimon & Schuster UK |  272 pages | ISBN 9781471129865\r\n\r\nA gleefully dark and well-researched exploration of the history and customs of European Yuletide folklore. How did St Nicholas save children from cannibalism? Who were the Yule Lads and why would they steal your sausages? Why was the Alpine Father Christmas accompanied by a demonic figure called the Krampus who bundled children into sacks and dragged them off to Hell? And why do Spanish nativity scenes often feature a defecating peasant?\r\nOver the course of the 20th Century, a universal image developed around the world of Santa Claus as a kindly Christmas visitor but, prior to that, each country, town and community would have Christmas visitors of their own - sometimes human, sometimes animal, sometimes something else entirely - with their own curious set of mythology and customs. The Finns were visited by a pagan goat named Joulupukki that was said to eat anyone who misbehaved. In Iceland, it was said that any child who did not receive an item of new clothing for Christmas would be caught and consumed by the monstrous Christmas Cat!\r\nBad Santas celebrates some of the most imaginative, terrifying and outright curious Christmas figures from across Europe - looking closely at its legacy of disquieting fairy stories. With beautiful black and white line drawings in each chapter, this unusual, entertaining and gleefully dark exploration of seasonal folklore will make an ideal Christmas gift and the perfect book for reading around the fireside. \r\n","options":[{"id":46325340,"name":"With 'We Are Not Other People'","price":7.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46325343,"name":"With 'Apologies To The Enlightenment'","price":7.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126242133/-/bad_santas.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126242133/-/bad_santas.jpg","width":326,"height":500}],"artists":[{"id":46882,"name":"Paul Hawkins & Thee Awkward Silences","permalink":"paul-hawkins-thee-awkward-silences","url":"/artist/paul-hawkins-thee-awkward-silences"}],"categories":[{"id":1672590,"name":"Other Distribution","permalink":"other-distribution","url":"/category/other-distribution"},{"id":6480549,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":14293374,"name":"Sukilove - Good Is In Your Bones CD","permalink":"sukilove-good-is-in-your-bones-cd","position":20,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sukilove-good-is-in-your-bones-cd","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-10-20T13:14:13.000Z","description":"1.

At the age of fifteen Eelen falls in love with the music of lo-fi songsmith Will Oldham, known then under his alter ego Palace Music. Soon after he stumbles upon his father’s old Morris guitar and starts to pick his way through the days, determined to become a singer songwriter. Years later, after finally saving up for a drum set, he remains true to his do it yourself attitude and teaches himself the ropes of putting down some rhythm. He starts playing the drums with bands as Strumpets (who recently released their second record to critical acclaim in the likes of Record Collector and Shindig!) and Angels Die Hard. However, guided and inspired by his childhood heroes, Palace music and Smog, and later on by Howe Gelb, Matt Ward and Jeff Tweedy, Eelen has taken his sweet time to brood on the music he wants to make. And now, at the ripe age of thirty-two, under the guise of “Wilderwolves,” he recorded his S/T debut album. Aided by producer and musician Geert Van Bever and with a little help from a few musical friends, Eelen has recorded most of the instruments himself; filling his songs with the authentic and emotionally raw sound he likes so much. His tracks are melancholic, honest and sober, but quite often carry a vicious, unexpected punch.\r\nMastered by Uwe Teichert dEUS/Placebo/Public Enemy\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":44689023,"name":"Default","price":7.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125187186/-/wilderwolves.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125187186/-/wilderwolves.jpg","width":350,"height":350},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126970965/-/wilderwolves_boxes.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126970965/-/wilderwolves_boxes.jpg","width":642,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126970971/-/1383890_253145004833073_1480046834_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126970971/-/1383890_253145004833073_1480046834_n.jpg","width":480,"height":679},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126970980/-/1381983_1400235650208158_1194423350_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126970980/-/1381983_1400235650208158_1194423350_n.jpg","width":720,"height":266}],"artists":[{"id":46878,"name":"Strumpets","permalink":"strumpets","url":"/artist/strumpets"}],"categories":[{"id":1672090,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":13755369,"name":"Fritzi und Heidel - S/T CD (Jereon I Love Sarah/Gruppo Di Pawlowski)","permalink":"fritzi-und-heidel-s-t-cd-jereon-i-love-sarah-gruppo-di-pawlowski","position":23,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fritzi-und-heidel-s-t-cd-jereon-i-love-sarah-gruppo-di-pawlowski","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-09-24T11:03:26.000Z","description":"Contemporary classic music including composition from Elko Blijweert and Tim Van Der Poel; very interesting sleevenotes also\r\n\r\nreleased 10 September 2013 \r\n(c) 2013 Animal Lovers Only (ALO016) \r\n\r\nFritzi und Heidel sind Toon Callier (guitar etc.) from SWARM und Jeroen Stevens (percussion etc.)  Jereon plays drums for I Love Sarah/iH8 Camera/Gruppo Di Pawlowski/Black Cassette etc...\r\n\r\nProduced by Tom Pintens of Flowers For Breakfast/Zita Swoon fame\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\ncatchaiku A - Larry Polansky (2013) 04:24\r\ninfo\r\ndownload\r\n2.\r\nLogic Rock - Matthew Shlomowitz (2013) 08:12\r\n3.\r\nMundus Canis: I.

While the sextet delves headfirst into abstract free improvisation that abandons all conventional takes on musical notions such as melody, harmony and rhythm at one point, you witness them raging like a well-oiled outfit with years of experience the next. The front section of Andrew d’Angelo (alto saxophone, bass clarinet) and Nate Wooley (trumpet) covers the entire stylistic range from muscular solos to extended techniques, and is often joined by guitarist Marc Ducret, who makes his instrument sing mysteriously, places poignant accents or rages with an equal eagerness. Initially the unpredictable improv may sound like an abstract sound poem, but this switches quickly to first dazzling freak-outs in the New York avant-garde tradition or even throbbing fusion with a nod to Miles Davis’ electric era, before ultimately arriving at muscular jazzrock in the vein of The Lounge Lizards and Belgium’s X-Legged Sally, with ultra-tight themes, subtly introduced electronics and turbulent dynamics. And what to think of the unstoppable groove of the Dunn/Verbruggen rhythm section and the musical action painting of Jozef Dumoulin on Fender Rhodes? What could have either been a failed jump into the deep end or a haphazard performance with the handbrakes on, here leads to a powerful achievement, executed with discipline and the will to incorporate the outer edges of improvised music....'","options":[{"id":41683821,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123019092/-/photo_(28).JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123019092/-/photo_(28).JPG","width":640,"height":480}],"artists":[{"id":226758,"name":"The Bureau of Atomic Tourism","permalink":"the-bureau-of-atomic-tourism","url":"/artist/the-bureau-of-atomic-tourism"}],"categories":[{"id":1672103,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"},{"id":1672590,"name":"Other Distribution","permalink":"other-distribution","url":"/category/other-distribution"}]},{"id":13059456,"name":"CONDOR GRUPPE - Volume 1 - 7\"","permalink":"condor-gruppe-volume-1-7","position":26,"price":6.5,"default_price":6.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/condor-gruppe-volume-1-7","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-08-19T23:48:57.000Z","description":"First in a series of 3... very last few copies left, when they are gone, they are gone...\r\n\r\nA.

This second album was recorded in Antwerp but encountered some severe difficulties when Miguel took the record back to his native Argentina and his home studio was burgled. During this burglary the masters were also stolen so the record had to be worked on all over again. Then a power cut during the mastering process meant that all the CD’s had to be remastered and repressed due to jumps in the original pressing. We believe this record may be cursed! \r\n\r\nThe music styles fluctuate between psychedelic pop, dream pop, baroque pop, art rock, electric cabaret, surf rock and romantic rock. The lyrics contain a large sum of automatic poetry, strongly influenced by the early dada movement and the surrealist. Real experiences and anecdotes mingle with metaphors, leaving a free interpretation to the listener. \r\n\r\n“Strumpets are a wonderfully weird group who move effortlessly between different genres without sounding unnatural or too eager to please”. – Leonard’s Lair\r\n“Should appeal to fans of Beach Boys-esque sunshine melodies and Belgian surrealism alike”. – The Dreaded Press ","options":[{"id":39855027,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121776189/-/strumpets.rubies_ruffCOVER.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121776189/-/strumpets.rubies_ruffCOVER.jpg","width":1475,"height":1467}],"artists":[{"id":46878,"name":"Strumpets","permalink":"strumpets","url":"/artist/strumpets"},{"id":46886,"name":"ih8 Camera","permalink":"ih8-camera","url":"/artist/ih8-camera"},{"id":47040,"name":"Cassini Division","permalink":"cassini-division","url":"/artist/cassini-division"}],"categories":[{"id":1672090,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":12138471,"name":"Isbells - Stoalin' CD or Vinyl version","permalink":"isbells-stoalin-cd-or-vinyl-version","position":31,"price":8.5,"default_price":8.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/isbells-stoalin-cd-or-vinyl-version","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-07-02T13:12:32.000Z","description":"This band include our very own Chantal Acda of True Bypass, Nu Nog Even Niet and Sleepingdog.

Looking for and finding inspiration in the sixties and seventies, they both stepped way out of their usual comfort zones. But with great success. \r\nAlthough not all music by Broken Glass Heroes was incorporated in Off Their Rockers, some of the tracks did make it in, fortunately, amongst which the lovely “Delphonic” used over the closing title and already bombed “Record of the Week” by RocknRail (“a lovely piece of short, simple, sweet, downtempo-esque, lazy guitar driven music paradise”), quite rightfully so.\r\nEnergised by the vibe and the results of their collaboration and eager for “more”, Tim and Pascal decided to kick things up a notch and to turn the tunes and jingles into full-blown, sexy, atmosperic, feelgood songs that sound strangely familiar - calling to mind sweltering hot summers in the mid sixties and the smell of vinyl - but yet refreshingly contemporary with wayward rock ’n roll and soft psychedelia always lurking around the corner. The result can be heard on “Grandchildren Of The Revolution”, a full album holding no less than 14 songs that make up an undeniably fresh and rollicking whole. \r\n“At first it felt like a stylistic exercise”, explains Deweze. “And for the first five or six songs we took a very stoic approach to things – we’d even planned to bring in guest vocalists – but as we moved along it became increasingly difficult to hide our personalities and our love for the genre. That’s why we feel like these songs didn’t become pastiches: although there was no need to reinvent the wheel, we certainly tweaked the sound by letting our own personalities shine through.”\r\n","options":[{"id":36618600,"name":"CD","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":36618603,"name":"Double Vinyl With Gatefold Sleeve and CD","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114246354/-/photo__14_.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114246354/-/photo__14_.JPG","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114245994/-/download__1_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114245994/-/download__1_.jpg","width":259,"height":194},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114246042/-/download.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114246042/-/download.jpg","width":225,"height":225},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114246090/-/images__1_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114246090/-/images__1_.jpg","width":276,"height":183},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114246834/-/images.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114246834/-/images.jpg","width":287,"height":176}],"artists":[{"id":46855,"name":"Sukilove","permalink":"sukilove","url":"/artist/sukilove"},{"id":86717,"name":"Mitsoobishy Jacson","permalink":"mitsoobishy-jacson","url":"/artist/mitsoobishy-jacson"},{"id":86721,"name":"Evil Superstars","permalink":"evil-superstars","url":"/artist/evil-superstars"},{"id":207900,"name":"Broken Glass Heroes","permalink":"broken-glass-heroes","url":"/artist/broken-glass-heroes"}],"categories":[{"id":1672090,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":1672103,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"},{"id":1672590,"name":"Other Distribution","permalink":"other-distribution","url":"/category/other-distribution"}]},{"id":10783644,"name":"Copy of 98: A Tribute To Dead Man Ray's Berchem CD","permalink":"copy-of-98-a-tribute-to-dead-man-ray-s-berchem-cd","position":44,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/copy-of-98-a-tribute-to-dead-man-ray-s-berchem-cd","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-04-26T09:11:32.000Z","description":"Contains Jezus friendly bands, Benny Zen, Birds That Change Colour, Simplesongs, Sukilove, Blackie & The Oohoos and Buffoon...\r\n\r\n15 years ago in 1998, Dead Man Ray released their legendary debut album Berchem. 15 years later,  Copy of 98 brings together 14 Belgian bands for a unique tribute record.\r\n\r\nBerchem is the unlikely result of a fortuitous meeting of minds between ex-dEUS guitarist Rudy Trouvé and graphic designer Daan Stuyven.

BUFFOON is the musical life project of Belgian music lover Peter\r\nVleugels, aka Pi. On CHROMOSCOPE Pi shares his raw music openly with the world, after a period of activity with\r\nBUFFOON as a rockband (they released the album Familiar Sounds in 2010). The new album is completely different\r\nfrom previous BUFFOON releases; it’s a compilation of the best home-recordings, spanning a period of 20 years.\r\nPi lets us in to his bedroom and delivers his music without the filter of band members and producers. Everything\r\nis recorded and mixed at home by Pi, mostly in some sort of twisted collaboration with his compagnions Niels\r\nHendrix (FENCE) and Dave Schroyen (Evil Superstars, Millionaire, Creature With The Atom Brain & Sha-La-Lees,\r\nto name just a few…).\r\nThe short songs sometimes sound recalcitrant and headstrong like a wild foal named Ween, while a minute later,\r\nthe hurt and tormented soul of crazy diamond Syd Barrett passes by… Musically, there are references to the future,\r\nas well as to the past. Some of the songs were even written and recorded on tape deck and dictaphone in the early\r\nnineties. But underneath the multiple layers of wacky effects and insane sounds, there is always a real song that\r\ngets stuck in your head like some alien earworm. Much like a psychedelic drug, the music takes the listener on\r\na surprising, yet pleasant trip. It’s like a space voyage that cannot be interrupted once started. CHROMOSCOPE\r\ntakes off in a whirl of synthesized beats, reaches a point where kids are playing outside. It then turns around\r\nabruptly, and brings the passengers back home, leaving them in a puddle of bass & drum madness.\r\nThere really is no better way to deliver this experience then a 12” vinyl record, on which the songs are interlaced\r\nwith each other, like shackles on a chain. There’s no official release on CD-format, but there is an audio-CD included\r\nwith the vinyl, and of course side A and side B are available as separate tracks on iTunes as well. All this\r\nis a deliberate decision of the artist, to create some kind of audio-stream-of-consciousness that guarantees an\r\noptimal listening experience.\r\nHave a nice trip!","options":[{"id":30398906,"name":"Default","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95437457/-/ALBUM_FRONT.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95437457/-/ALBUM_FRONT.jpg","width":982,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95437493/-/ALBUM_BACK.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95437493/-/ALBUM_BACK.JPG","width":973,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":47487,"name":"Buffoon","permalink":"buffoon","url":"/artist/buffoon"}],"categories":[{"id":1672090,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":1672103,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":9103097,"name":"Tape Cuts Tape -

The words are based on Chantal’s personal life after the two became close friends and as such provides an interesting and strange way to approach making a record.\r\n\r\nMost of the songs were recorded with Koen Renders (Spencer The Rover), then at home overdubs were added by Chantal and Craig with added contributions from Eric Thielemans, (Tape Cuts Tape, EARR), Gianni Marzo (Isbells, Marble Sounds), Gerd Van Mulders (Marble Sounds, Headphone) & Renee Sys (Renee). The album was mixed by Christophe Vandewoude (Isbells) and mastered by Uwe Teichert (dEUS, Public Enemy, Placebo).\r\n\r\nChantal Acda is a member of the band Isbells. Also she has been performing as Sleepingdog since 2006 alongside Adam Wiltzie (Stars of the Lid/The Dead Texan) and has released 3 full length albums as Sleepingdog. After releasing the last Sleepingdog album (2011, Gizeh/Zeal/Konkurrent), they were invited by Low to act as their main support on a selection of UK and EU dates. Previous to Sleepingdog, Chantal recorded under her own name to release 'Dreamly Yell' in 1999 before moving from her native Netherlands to Belgium. In 2003 her band Chacda released 'La Sortie' and in 2005 ‘Tonar’. They toured the UK that same year with Lambchop. Chantal has also shared stages with the likes of Calexico, Iron & Wine, Okkervil River, Daniel Johnston and Nils Frahm.\r\n\r\nCraig Ward moved from Scotland to Antwerp after an invitation from Stef Kamil Carlens (dEUS, Zita Swoon) to holiday there. It was a long holiday. Craig joined Kiss My Jazz and found himself in the hub of a fervent music scene to the extent that Rudy Trouvé suggested him as his replacement in dEUS ('In A Bar Under The Sea' and 'The Ideal Crash' era albums and tours). After leaving dEUS in 2004 Craig formed the acclaimed band The Love Substitutes with Mauro Pawlowski and Rudy Trouve, releasing two albums, ‘Meet The Love Substitutes While The House Is On Fire’ (2005) and ‘More Songs About Hangovers and Sailors’ (2007). In 2008 the trio released a split solo album as Pawlowski, Trouvé and Ward. Craig also fronts the noise jazz band A Clean Kitchen Is A Happy Kitchen who released their self titled vinyl in 2011 and a split EP earlier this year with Silent Front. This September he will release a split album with Mark Mulholland called ‘Waiting For The Storm’ . His production credits include The Frames ‘For The Birds’ alongside Steve Albini. Craig has recently moved back to his native Glasgow.\r\n\r\nToby Litt is an English writer, born in Bedford in 1968. He studied at Bedford Modern School, read English at Worcester College, Oxford and studied Creative Writing at the University of East Anglia where he was taught by Malcolm Bradbury. In 2003 he was nominated by Granta magazine as one of the 20 'Best of Young British Novelists' and in 2009 his story ‘John & John’ won the Manchester Fiction Prize. Litt is the author of two collections of stories and eleven novels.\r\n\r\nSELECTED PREVIOUS PRESS:\r\n\"A wonderful debut”. 8/10 GoldFlakePaint\r\n“There is an earthy beauty to True Bypass.

Friends since their teens, when both were playing in bands in Glasgow and Edinburgh in the late '80s, the two have been travelling and playing music since, crossing paths at various points along the way. Craig produced Mark's band Two Dollar Bash's third album, “Lost River”, and accompanied the band on a 5 week North American tour in 2007. Around this time, the pair started talking of recording an album together, drawing from their mutual influences of the likes of Pentangle and Nick Drake. In the course of 2010 and 2011, they met up for a series of recording sessions in Berlin, Antwerp and Rotterdam, and the resulting album, “Waiting for the Storm”, will be released in summer 2012 by the Berlin label Cannery Row Records and the London-based Jezus Factory Records, accompanied by a tour of the UK, Ireland and France. The line-up is completed with the addition of Belgian double-bass player Hannes d'Hoine, and the trio completed a successful tour of Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and the Czech Republic in February and March 2012.\r\n\r\nMark Mulholland's musical peregrinations have taken him through most of Europe and North America to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, where he is now based. He has released 2 solo albums, “The Devil on the Stairs” (2008) and “The Cactus and the Dragon” (2011), and is also a member of Two Dollar Bash, who recently released their 4th album, “New Adventures”. Mark is a former member of Impure Thoughts, and The Oul' Bogwarriors, and has recorded with a wide variety of artists including Nikki Sudden and Captain Sensible. He is currently also working on various musical projects in Haiti, including collaborations with the world-renowned poet, dramatist, painter and actor Frankétienne, who also makes a guest appearance on “Waiting for the Storm”.\r\n\r\nCraig Ward moved from Scotland to Antwerp after an invitation from Stef Kamil Carlens (dEUS, Zita Swoon) to holiday there.

While their willingness, or rather compulsion, to explore psychedelic territory might have stood in the way of landing them serious airplay, it did contribute to the cult acclaim and fan base they have gathered since and made them a critical favorite with key music press.\r\n\r\nMuch respected by fellow musicians, Creature With The Atom Brain have toured extensively over the past few years throughout Europe and North-America supporting the likes of Queens Of The Stone Age (2008 - Europe), The Jesus And Mary Chain (2008 – Europe / US), The Dead Weather (2009 - Europe) and Alice In Chains (2010 – US / Canada) along with headline tours and festivals in Belgium, Holland, UK, Germany and Austria.\r\n\r\nCreature’s new and third album “The Birds Fly Low” will be released in the UK on December 3rd 2012. The album was recorded over the course of 2011 with the help of many friends, mixed by Greg Gordon and Alain Johannes and mastered by Howie Weinberg. We can already say that this is definitely Creature’s best album so far.\r\n   \r\n\r\nMeanwhile Aldo Struyf rejoined the newly erected Mark Lanegan Band in which he will be playing alongside Creature’s new drummer Jean-Philippe De Gheest and some of Belgium’s other finest (Steven Janssens on guitar and Fred “LYENN” Jacques on bass). On February 24th 2012 they kicked off a worldwide tour that will stretch until the end of the year.

Basic recording and programming were done at home on his pc. For two years he worked on the recordings in the ghosttownstudio's during his schoolholidays. \r\n\r\nAr a certain point he mailed some results to Rudy Trouvé, who liked it very much, and after this was playing a major guest-role, also inviting Sigrid Van Rosendaal, Mauro Pawlowski and Elko Blijweert to participate as guest-musicians, and released the CDs under the Heaven Hotel label. Sue Daniels does not like publicity or promotion, only one interview was ever done at Studio Brussels. \r\nA full list of the musicians participating: \r\n\r\n-Mauro Pawlowski(Mauro, Evil superstars, Kiss my Jazz) \r\n-Elko Blijweert (Kiss my Jazz, Dead man ray, Bad Influence, Franco saint de bakker, Morf) \r\n-Rudy Trouvé (Kiss my Jazz, Gore slut, Dead man ray, Horrowitz) \r\n-Sigrid van Rosendaal (Horrowitz, Franco saint de bakker) \r\n-Kalvin Smith & Bobo (Cinerex) \r\n\r\nSue Daniels sees himself as a \"techno singer-songwriter\" untill he finds a better definition. He claims to be mainly influenced by Nick Drake, Nick Drake, Nick Drake, Aphex Twins, Leonard Cohen, Howard Shore and some \"gabbercompilations\". \r\nPARIS is produced by Geert van Bever, who for Heavenhotel also recorded Goreslut, Dead man Ray and Horrowitz. Untill now a 45' vinyl single, Comfort and the single Constant raving and full album Paris were released on Heaven Hotel. \r\nThere is also the compilation 'Curse', on which a cover of the single is done by different Heaven Hotel bands in their own unique styles, including a 30 minute video-clip.

In 2007 he teamed up with drummer Dave Schroyen (Creature With The Atom Brain/Millionaire/Evil Superstars) and producer -bass player Christophe Albertijn. In their hometown of Antwerp “Birds” quickly attracted a cult following with their eclectic mix of melancholy psych folk and frisky sixties pop. Soon they became a regular fixture in the clubs of Ghent, Antwerp and Brussels. Koen’s warm expressive voice got noticed by Aldo Struyf who asked him to become Creature With The Atom Brain’s guest vocalist. This also led to a guest appearance on their album ‘Transylvania’ and a duet with Mark Lanegan.  \r\n\r\nWhile listening to Birds you can hear echoes of Syd Barrett, The Incredible String Band, and Midlake interwoven with the melodic harmonies of The Beatles. Although standing on the shoulders of these giants, Birds That Change Colour sound fresh and original. Their songwriting, recordings and performances combine tradition with a healthy dose of experimentation and wit, reminiscent of the young Kevin Ayers. Despite their shared love for the West Coast music, Country folk and even Krautrock, the sound of Birds That Change Colour has a distinctly British feel to it, always putting the song first and a dreamy ambience a close second.\r\n\r\nBirds’ first album ‘On Recording the Sun’ - - contains an intricate collection of hauntingly beautiful songs, studded with precious psych gems. “On Recording The Sun” captures the sound and essence of classic 70’s recordings. There are guest appearances from Pascal Deweze (Sukilove) and Nathalie Delcroix (Laïs, Country Ladies) whose voice is more enchanting than ever. Birds also cooperated with internationally acclaimed classical musicians, Patrick Denecker and Piet Stryckers. Their marvelous contributions on songs like Woods and O What a Day are of an irresistible beauty! \r\nThe entrancing vocals backed up by heartfelt string- and recorder arrangements add to the bucolic enchantment and melancholy of an album which sounds playful and dark at the same time, like riding a merry-go-round just before dawn. \r\n\r\nBirds That Change Colour are...\r\n\r\nKoen Kohlbacher\r\nvocals, guitars, songs\r\nChristophe Albertijn\r\nbass, guitars\r\nDavid Schroyen\r\ndrums & percussion\r\nNathalie Delcroix\r\nvocals\r\nJorunn Bauweraerts\r\nvocals\r\nBram Moony\r\nguitars, lap steel, vocals\r\n ","options":[{"id":15506403,"name":"CD Only","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15506405,"name":"Vinyl with CD","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50563235/-/199775_20birds_20that_20change_20colour_20on_20recording_20the_20sun.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50563235/-/199775_20birds_20that_20change_20colour_20on_20recording_20the_20sun.jpg","width":500,"height":449},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50562611/-/Birds_20that_20change_20colour.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50562611/-/Birds_20that_20change_20colour.jpg","width":750,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50563107/-/p.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50563107/-/p.jpg","width":170,"height":222},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46457459/-/birds.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46457459/-/birds.jpg","width":320,"height":240}],"artists":[{"id":46855,"name":"Sukilove","permalink":"sukilove","url":"/artist/sukilove"},{"id":46866,"name":"Creature With The Atom Brain","permalink":"creature-with-the-atom-brain","url":"/artist/creature-with-the-atom-brain"},{"id":98411,"name":"Birds That Change Colour","permalink":"birds-that-change-colour","url":"/artist/birds-that-change-colour"}],"categories":[{"id":1672090,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":1672103,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"},{"id":1672590,"name":"Other Distribution","permalink":"other-distribution","url":"/category/other-distribution"}]},{"id":4672945,"name":"Mauro Pawlowski and The Groom Picture disc","permalink":"mauro-pawlowski-and-the-groom-picture-disc","position":79,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mauro-pawlowski-and-the-groom-picture-disc","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-10-20T16:45:59.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":15307421,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/45789691/-/blackeuropa300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/45789691/-/blackeuropa300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":86719,"name":"Mauro Pawlowski","permalink":"mauro-pawlowski","url":"/artist/mauro-pawlowski"}],"categories":[{"id":1672103,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"},{"id":1929822,"name":"Mauro Pawlowski","permalink":"mauro-pawlowski","url":"/category/mauro-pawlowski"}]},{"id":4672915,"name":"iH8 Camera - Volume 2 digi CD with Fridge Magnet and Postcard","permalink":"ih8-camera-volume-2-digi-cd-with-fridge-magnet-and-postcard","position":80,"price":9.0,"default_price":9.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ih8-camera-volume-2-digi-cd-with-fridge-magnet-and-postcard","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-10-20T16:35:19.000Z","description":"SOLD OUT.

Rudy Trouvé gathered a bunch of friends and collaborators to perform a totally improvised set with no planning, leadership or prior discussion. iH8 Camera was formed and the concept stuck and the band has continued since on a semi regular basis. The chemistry between the musicians has meant music that is coherent as it is free and fun to listen to. \r\n\r\nWhat you hear on this CD is a selection of songs compiled and edited by Craig Ward onto one long track culled from performances spanning from 2004 to 2007.

Featuring guitars, synths, sax, drums, bass and vocals, \r\nthe music on the disc maintains a sense of melody whilst still being experimental \r\nand adventurous, the fact that band members also play in other groups together \r\ngiving them a cohesive sound that allows them to fit lyrics into the pieces. \r\nAlso impressive is the way the two very distinct guitar sounds merge so well, \r\nwhilst the rhythm section, adds energy and stability to the proceedings. After the \r\nrelaxed psych groove of “Breitenbach am Hertzberg”, the band display a heavier \r\nedge on the more brittle riffing of Grebenau, although this breaks down into a \r\nslower spacier ending, the guitars again proving their quality. The rest of the \r\nalbum mixes these to styles into an entertaining and beautifully played whole \r\nthat is worth hearing. \r\n\r\n\r\nPSYCHEMUSIC.ORG \r\nI heard Elko Blijweert live in one of his projects Tip Toe Topic. He \r\nreally mastered pedal use (and loops) on guitar and switching genres \r\nwith it very well, a bit technical at times but never the less \r\nimpressive. One of his many groups, here with Rudy Trouvé (Dead man \r\nRay, Deus, Zita Swoon, Kiss My Jazz,..), Craig Ward, Teuk Henri, Bert \r\nLenarts and Jeroen Stevens is the sextet iH8 Camera. They did a concert \r\nat Burg Herzberg Festival in Germany in 2006, which was remembered as \r\nbeing great and was released by the label. It surely was a moody trip, \r\nnot really clear to which it all brought us musically. It is a large \r\nspan with freak-out trippy effect, where the different guitars are able \r\nto colour the trip in totally different sounds, rhythms and areas with \r\nall sorts of contributing effects to it, while the songs that appear \r\nare like stories from the road. The result is something that has a \r\npsychedelic effect, but like a new underground rock trip. Well mixed \r\nand of great sonic quality. \r\n\r\n\r\nLOWCUT.DK \r\niH8 Camera is a new Belgium band that is described as \r\nexperimental rock. This CD was recorded live at the \r\nBerg Herzberg Festival in 2006. The bands music is largely \r\nimprovised and features 6 members. This is quite a \r\nspecial CD. A bit like the Talking Heads on acid at times, \r\na bit indie experimental, spoken words over strange noises, \r\nrepetitive kraut rock a bit like Circle, noisy Sonic Youth \r\nlike stuff, dreamy stuff, strange acid rock, ….you get the idea.. \r\nInteresting, every evolving and cool stuff… Excellent CD. \r\nWould have been a great concert but with this bands name, \r\nI guess we won’t see it… \r\n\r\n\r\nSONICDICE.COM \r\nThe début release of Belgian collective iH8 Camera is a 50-minute \r\nimprovisational freak out recorded live at the 2006 Burg Herzberg Festival. \r\nAlthough the band features a selection of sometime dEUS members \r\namidst its ever-changing line-up of players, the sounds produced by iH8 Camera \r\nare far more psychedelic and free-form than that of Antwerp’s most famous \r\nmusical sons. Indeed, leader Rudy Trouve claims that much of the band’s sound \r\nstems from the improvised strains of prog, jazz and afro that the likes of \r\nKing Crimson have been practising for decades now, and he is not wrong. [...] \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFILEUNDER.NL \r\nZe schijnen live volledig op improvisatie te leunen. Dus wanneer ze in 2006 in \r\nDuitsland spelen, op een festival dat het Burg Herzberg Festival heet, dan geven \r\nze de teksten van hun nummers (in dit geval een betere term dan liedjes of \r\nnummers) Duitse titels: \"Breitenbach am Herzberg\", \"Grebenau\", \"Schlitz\", \r\n\"Niederaula\" of \"Ottrau\". Maar als ik opener \"Breitenbach am Herzberg\" \r\nbeluister, krijg ik niet het idee dat het volledig live en onvoorbereid tot \r\nstand is gekomen, zo hecht klinken de muzikanten. Dat ook niet zo gek, want deze \r\nleden van de Antwerpse maffia zijn berucht om hun wisselende contacten. Als je \r\nde lijst bekijkt op de MySpace-pagina van iH8 Camera, zie je zo ongeveer elke \r\nband die je uit die contreien kent voorbij komen. Plus een aantal namen waar je \r\nnog nooit van gehoord hebt, maar die het ongetwijfeld ook meerdere malen met \r\nmeerdere muzikanten gedaan hebben. Al dan niet in een groepsverband. iH8 Camera \r\nbestaat uit de harde kern van The Love Substitutes, waarbij in dit geval Mauro \r\nPawlowski is thuisgelaten. Twee andere muzikanten met een dEUS-verleden doen wel \r\nmee, Rudy Trouvé en Craig Ward. De tracks leunen zwaar op de New Yorkse postpunk \r\nvan begin jaren tachtig - inclusief dansbare beats en krassende gitaren - maar \r\ndoen soms ook hun best om over te hellen naar de hedendaagse variant ervan. Gooi \r\ndaarnaast het gevoel voor gekte in de groep dat we kennen van andere Rudy \r\nTrouvé-combo’s als Kiss My Jazz en je hebt iH8 Camera te pakken. \r\n\r\nROCKTIMES.DE \r\n[...] Von den Gitarren angetrieben, serviert uns iH8 Camera einen galaktischen \r\nSound-Cocktail der wirklich anderen Art. Als Hörer begleitet man die Band in \r\nSphären, zu denen wohl eher selten Gruppen vordringen. Das Sextett begibt sich \r\nzeitweise an den äußersten Rand der musikalischen Milchstraße, besonders dann, \r\nwenn tonale Gedanken in Richtung Jazz wandern. \r\nDie Ereignisse um \"Grebenau\" müssen zweigeteilt gewesen sein, denn einerseits \r\nist der Track sehr aufgewühlt und andererseits finden sich auch ruhige Momente, \r\nin denen Jeroen Stevens seinen Drumsticks auch mal eine Pause gönnt. \r\nDie Gitarren dienen auch dazu, Geräusche zu erzeugen und dabei kommen \r\nschon Erinnerungen an die ganz jungen Pink Floyd auf. Stellenweise legt man \r\nSound-Landschaften an, die den Blick bis zum Ende des Horizonts schweifen \r\nlassen. Schaut, oder besser hört man da genau hin, gibt es dort immer noch \r\netwas zu entdecken. \r\nEs ist nun aber nicht so, dass iH8 Camera-Erzeugnisse nur Gefiepse, \r\nRückkopplungen oder Klangspielereien sind. In den Nummern finden sich \r\nauch Melodien. Zum Beispiel ist \"Schlitz\" eine rechte relaxt vor sich hinfließende \r\nAngelegenheit. Wie Zellteilungen entwickeln sich die Tonfolgen oder Riffs. \r\nDas An- sowie Abschwellen der Dynamik ist ein weiteres Markenzeichen der Band. \r\nMan kann sich nach hektischen Phasen herrlich zurücklehnen und mit zum Teil \r\nganz sparsamen Mitteln werden tolle Effekte erzeugt. [...] \r\n\r\n\r\nBABYBLAUE-SEITEN.DE \r\n2006 spielte das Musikerkollektiv iH8 Camera auf der Freakstage \r\ndes berühmten und kultigen Burg Herzberg Festivals, und eben jenes \r\nKonzert wird nun erstmals auf CD veröffentlicht und stellt einen \r\ndurchweg positiven Eindruck dieses Events dar. Ohne große Vorbereitungen \r\nenterten die Musiker die Bühne und zelebrierten fast 50 Minuten lang \r\neinen unterhaltsamen, improvisierten Mix aus lockerem Psychedelic Rock, \r\nleichtfüßigem Jazz und teilweise schön schrägen Gesangsmelodien, \r\ndie mich an David Byrne, bzw. die Talking Heads erinnern. \r\nDas Ganze nimmt dabei an Komplexität, Geschwindigkeit und \r\nEinfallsreichtum enorm zu, wandert vom Psychedelic Rock unmittelbar \r\nin die Jazz-Ecke und wird irgendwo mittendrin sogar fast zu einem \r\nInferno aus Blastbeats(!) und allem, was dazu gehört. Wirklich beeindruckend! \r\nWem bei „improvisierter Psychedelic Rock“ Fluchtgedanken in den Sinn \r\nkommen, den kann ich mit gutem Gewissen beruhigen und ihm diese \r\ndurchaus spannende Platte zum Antesten empfehlen. \r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESSIVE-NEWSLETTER.DE \r\nKlein-Woodstock im Hessischen.Das sind die Geschichten, wie sie vor allem auf dem legendären Burg Herzberg Festivalpassieren: eine Band verirrt sich auf dem Weg zum Festivalgelände, das tief im Nirgendwo in der Provinz liegt, schafft es gerade noch pünktlich auf die Bühne, die Instrumente werden flugs eingestöpselt und los geht’s. So passiert beim Musikerkollektiv iH8 Camera (=I hate Camera) aus dem belgischen Antwerpen, die 2006 beim Hippie Festival zu Gast waren. Vielleicht lag die ganze Odyssee einfach nur daran, dass die Band eben selten live spielt und man gerade einige Umbesetzungen zu verkraften hatte. Aber vielleicht waren noch ganz andere Mittelchen mit im Spiel… \r\n\r\nEgal, das titellose Debüt kommt sehr roh, direkt und schnörkellos, irgendwie leicht desorientiert, aber trotz des improvisativen Ansatzes erstaunlich songdienlich in die Gänge. Genauso scheint die Gegend um das Festivalgelände ihren nachhaltigen Eindruck hinterlassen zu haben, denn die Psychedelic / Alternative Rock Exkursionen namens „Breitenbach am Herzberg“, „Schlitz“ oder „Niederaula“ sind allesamt nach Ortschaften aus der nahen Gegend des Festivals benannt. So kracht, quietscht und zirpt es, die Instrumente graben sich krautig, hin und wieder fast schon punkig bzw. drogendurchtränkt beseelt durch die Takte. Vorangetrieben \r\nvon teils ehemaligen Mitgliedern der belgischen Rockformation Deus ist nach etwas mehr als 50 Minuten der Spuk schon vorbei. \r\n\r\nTrotz des recht experimentellen Ansatzes entstehen hin und wieder absolut faszinierende Momente, gerade dadurch, dass hier direkt Musik im Moment des Entstehens festgehalten wurde. Das Publikum schien genauso von der ungeplanten, komplett improvisierten Exkursion fasziniert bzw. weggeblasen, denn nur selten bis gar nicht sind irgendwelche Reaktionen aus dem Auditorium zu vernehmen. Harter Tobak aus den Randbereichen des kollektiven Deliriums! \r\n\r\n\r\nECLIPSED MAGAZIN \r\nEs geschah 2006 auf der Freakstage des Burg Herzberg Festivals. \r\nEine Momentaufnahme im Lebenszyklus von iH8 Camera. \r\nDieses belgische Projekt um die beiden ehemaligen dEUS-Musiker \r\nRudy Trouvé und Craig Wardversteht sich selbst als ein sich \r\nständig veränderndes Kollektiv, das führerlos improvisiert. \r\nDazu passt, dass die Band erst wenige Augenblicke vor dem Auftritt \r\nam Herzberg ankam. Umso erstaunlicher ist die Qualität dieser \r\ndort entstandenen Live-Aufnahme. Die Tracks strotzen vor \r\nabgehackten Rhythmen, in die sich seltsame Gitarren einschleichen. \r\nEs kratzt, es donnert, immerhin spielen gleich vier Leute Gitarre. \r\nDoch es wird nur selten chaotisch. Die Rhythmen bleiben übersichtlich, \r\nreissen mit. Die Gitarren heulen nicht (das erledigen ab und an \r\neinige Synthies), sind auch wenig verzerrt vielmehr fügen sich Noises \r\nzu Melodien zusammen. Das ist virtuos, keine Frage. Und entzieht \r\nsich eigentlich jeder Kategorisierung. Psych? Nicht wirklich. Avantgarde? \r\nVielleicht. Math Rock? Ein bisschen. Independent? Hier und da. \r\nHörenswert? Yes! \r\n\r\n\r\nMUSIKANSICH.DE \r\nWenn meine Recherche richtig ist, ist iH8 Camera das erste Album \r\nder belgischen Free Style Rocker. Allerdings ist 2009 noch ein weiteres \r\nAlbum erschienen. Dieses erste ist dann gleich ein Livealbum, \r\nallerdings ein besonderes. Es ist eine Aufnahme aus dem Jahr 2006, die \r\nauf der kleinen Freakstage des Burg Herzberg Festivals aufgenommen \r\nwurde. Im Info der Plattenfirma steht, die Band sei quasi direkt zu \r\nihrem Auftrittstermin auf dem Herzberg eingeschlagen, hat ihre \r\nInstrumente eingestöpselt und die Verstärker eingeschaltet und los \r\ngelegt. Die sieben Tracks, die nach Städte- beziehungsweise Dorfnamen, \r\ndie auf dem Weg zum Herzberg lagen, benannt wurden, sind dem \r\nentsprechend wild und rau. Zwei Gitarren, das Schlagzeug und der Bass \r\nsind die dominierenden Instrumente der sich langsam aufbauenden Tracks, \r\ndie irgendwo zwischen Krautrock der Marke Faust und experimentellen \r\nImprovisationsrock wie Acid Mother Temple liegen. Eruptive \r\nGitarrensoli, schräge, jazzige Saxophoneinlagen und ebenso schräge \r\nSounds aus dem Synthesizer bauen raue, aber doch schwebende \r\nSoundlandschaften auf, über denen der Sänger laut Firmeninfo freie \r\nGeschichten über die scheinbar für die Musiker spannende Anreise zum \r\nHerzberg erzählt. [...] \r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESSIA.NET \r\nLes groupes de rock qui pratiquent exclusivement l'improvisation \r\nse font finalement assez rares. Et pourtant, la liberté totale qu'elle \r\noffre semble bien correspondre à l'esprit de cette musique et à tous \r\nles symboles qui en découlent. Il faut néanmoins nuancer que \r\nl'improvisation rime également avec excès en tout genre, et l'époque \r\npendant laquelle cette pratique était « tendance » est bel et bien révolue : \r\nles soli interminables des membres de Led Zeppelin ou de Deep Purple \r\nne sont que de lointains souvenirs, comme s'il n'était plus possible d'en \r\nproposer un contenu novateur. En regardant toutefois du côté de formations \r\ncomme Sonic Youth, le vocabulaire rock peut toujours s'enrichir de cette liberté.

There’s a strange sense of displacement about this - the debut release by trio Tape Cuts Tape - as it constantly seeks - whether by accident or design - to throw you off balance and reeling about your footing. It’s a displacement intensified by its wilful want to avoid categorization or at least settle to a given groove or style. Instead it flits almost apparition like fancifully drawing from this and that. Headed up by Ruby Trouve one time of deus fame and these days seemingly spreading himself thin by having a hand in almost anything of recorded relevance escaping the territory of Belgium, Tape Cuts Tape features long time friends Eric Thielemans and Lynn Cassiers - the fruits of whose first collaborative recordings are gathered into the 12 track set ’pagan recorder’. a quietly beguiling set it is to which applies a disarming scatterbrained brush to its realisation that equally guaranteed to puzzle and perplex as it reward and amaze. Here you’ll find fixed between the grooves elements of distressed post rock cues, subtle jazz montages, disturbed chamber folk interludes (‘vacuum’), shamanic folk blues (‘reckless’) and razored skull grinding kraut boogie (the locked grooved grizzle of the psyched out shimmer tone of ‘this red’ all gorgeously bathed and haloed by Cassiers almost celestial opine to which gathers in stature and density to tail off like a futuristic Jefferson Airplane - while we are here we may as well add to the list the stoner space psyche of ‘layers’ whose enjoyment suffered from the quality control issues present on the CD). From the art jazz blues tomfoolery of the parting ’exit’ shaped in the kind of schizoid no wave crookedness we’ve come to love and expect from Medicine and Duty to ‘petrol blue’ in many ways is the albums sore thumb - rudimentary and focused its longingly brushed with a numbing down tempo groove more prevalent of the 90’s Bristol scene upon which a curious dark seduction is weaved as though some tryst between Garbage, Portishead and the Sneaker Pimps had been hatched, ‘pagan recorder’ is one of those weirdly wonderful records that every so often arrive and depart and without so much as a by your leave have you jaw agape and in its absence has you struggling to nail exactly what it is about it that caused the hairs on your neck to go all a frenzy and your ears to tentively prick up to attention. Both cut from the same melodic cloth ‘heavy’ and ’choosen profession’ offer perhaps the sets most explicit pop moments - the former sounding not unlike the Delgados scratched and splintered by a laid back and chilled Flying Saucer Attack and then delicately detailed with a nimble finger plucked riff artistry more becoming of Vinni Reilly having been commissioned to score some bleakly beautiful retrace by David Lynch of ’twin peaks’ with the latter hollowed, spectral and decidedly hymnal in countenance grained with a deceptively dreamy in a gloom gathering way as it navigates between a choking sonic forest pitched with Artery on one side and the Virgin Passages all the time orchestrated by a brooding and bloodied Bang Bang Machine. All said best of what is a strangely beguiling release is the fleet of foot macabre minimalism of the unsettling and creepy ‘night passage’ which amid the chill toned freak folk atmospherics lurks what could easily be Bjork’s impish elfin alter ego. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":10555479,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29849795/-/4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29849795/-/4.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29849875/-/tct.promopic.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29849875/-/tct.promopic.jpg","width":1000,"height":268}],"artists":[{"id":49713,"name":"Tape Cuts Tape","permalink":"tape-cuts-tape","url":"/artist/tape-cuts-tape"}],"categories":[{"id":1672103,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"},{"id":1672125,"name":"Heavenhotel Distribution","permalink":"heavenhotel-distribution","url":"/category/heavenhotel-distribution"},{"id":1929818,"name":"Rudy Trouve","permalink":"rudy-trouve","url":"/category/rudy-trouve"}]},{"id":3078189,"name":"Rudy Trouve Septet - 2007 - 2009 - VINYL","permalink":"2007-2009-vinyl","position":105,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/2007-2009-vinyl","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-12-31T02:04:27.000Z","description":"VINYL VERSION OF THIS FANTASTIC ALBUM FINALLY AVAILABLE IN THE JEZUS FACTORY WEBSHOP\r\n\r\n1 : Soundtrack for woman nr. 2 2 : 70ties softporn tribute 3 : Footage 4 : On a highway, barely awake 5 : Ted Cassidy 6 : Heat it up 7 : Stolen moments 8 : Dub undead 9 : Allright 10 : A farewell to the giant 11 : Le theme du souffleur 12 : The sound of our childhood 13 : Sunrise on Palavas beach\r\n\r\nMusicians : \r\nAarich Jespers - Dimitri Daggelinckx - Elko Blijweert - Geert van Bever - Joris Caluwaerts - Rudy Trouvé - Sigrid van Rosendaal -\r\n\r\nRecorded on tape by Mark De Decker. \r\nProduced by the Septet and Mark. \r\nMusic by the Septet.

After releasing “Live at the Ancienne Belgique” (2005) and 'Live at the Ancienne Belgique II' (2006), the band chose to name it’s new creation… 'Live at the Ancienne Belgique III'! It will be the third and last part of the “Live at the Ancienne Belgique” trilogy…\r\n\r\nThe seven-piece terror jazz-combo -sounding sweeter than ever, though- once again recorded everything live at AB in September 2009. The group initially concentrated on re-working jazz compositions by Charlie Parker, Sonny Clark, Mal Waldron a.o. After three albums, things seem to have changed. Apart from “Song Of The Universe”, composed in the sixties by the rather obscure organ player Baby-Face Willette, most of the album consists of original compositions. The result is surprisingly cheerful. Jazz is still the main root of the band, which we can hear clearly in “Leila”, a kind of tribute to Ornette Coleman/James Blood Ulmer. The rest of the tunes keep a lot of the improvisational aspect of jazz in mind, but are also influenced by African pop music, folk, 60s soundtracks (e.g. John Barry), etc. After making their own version of “No One Knows” (Queens Of The Stone Age) and “Blue Monday” (New Order), the new cd has another all-time favourite to become a Franco-classic: Richard Berry’s “Louie Louie”!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the personnel line-up of Franco is more impressive than ever with a.o. founding member Elko Blijweert (Wim Vandekeybus, Tip Toe Topic, The Rudy Trouvé Septet, ex-Kiss My Jazz,…), Karel De Backer (Novastar, ex-Dead Man Ray,…), Joris Caluwaerts (ex-Zita Swoon, The Go Find), Rudy Trouvé as special guest composer/musician, Saar van de Leest (Traktor, Capsule, Tip Toe Topic), Sigrid Van Rosendaal (Lionell Horowitz & His Combo, Rudy Trouvé Septet,…), Frans Van Isacker (several Jazz-combos) Thomas Sainderichin (several Jazz-combos). Guests during live performances: Tim Van der Poel, (Autistik Youth, Almanak,...)

Later that evening they performed together onstage which speaks volumes about the spontaneous and intuitive character of the pair, who felt from the beginning that there was something unique in the air whenever they picked up their acoustic guitars. \r\n\r\nTwo sensitive souls who, automatically and without planning, started writing songs together, acoustic and pure. \r\n\r\nWhether in a farmhouse attic in Hoegaarden, a bedroom in Portland, Oregon, or a studio in Mechelen, the songs kept coming. It was apparent, during recording sessions and live shows, that something special was happening - songs would emerge direct and unpolished from the heart, as True Bypass. \r\n\r\nThe debut album True Bypass will be released in Benelux and the UK by Jezus Factory and distributed by Bertus in the Benelux and Shellshock in the UK. \r\n\r\nThe album was mastered by Uwe Teichert (dEUS, Public Enemy, Placebo). \r\n\r\n1.

Tickytok \r\n\r\nCraig Ward moved from Scotland to Antwerp after an invite from Stef Kamil Carlens (dEUS, Zita Swoon) to holiday there. It was a long holiday. Craig joined Kiss My Jazz and found himself in the hub of a fervent music scene so much that Rudy Trouve suggested him as his replacement in dEUS ('In A Bar Under The Sea' and 'The Ideal Crash' era albums and tours). After leaving dEUS in 2004 Craig formed acclaimed band The Love Substitutes with Mauro Pawlowski and Rudy Trouve and is also a member of I H8 Camera. In 2008 the 3 released a split solo album as Pawlowski, Trouve and Ward….. Craig's production credits include The Frames ‘For The Birds’ alongside Steve Albini. \r\n\r\nChantal Acda has been performing as Sleepingdog since 2006 alongside Adam Wiltzie (Stars of the Lid/Dead Texan) and has released 3 full length albums as Sleepingdog. Previous to Sleepingdog, Chantal recorded under her own name to release 'Dreamly Yell' in 1999 before moving from her native Netherlands to Belgium. In 2003 her band Chacda released 'La Sortie' and in 2005 “Tonar’. They toured the UK with Lambchop. \r\nChantal has also shared stages with the likes of Calexico, Iron & Wine, Okkervil River and Daniel Johnston. \r\n\r\n“The sheer lushness and beauty of these minimal compositions cannot be denied” Rock-A-Rolla \r\n\r\n“Considerable charm” Rock Sound \r\n\r\n“As close to celestial as any human is going to achieve” Sonic Dice ","options":[{"id":9845836,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.2,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.2}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27266381/-/securedownloadr.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27266381/-/securedownloadr.jpg","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27235764/-/True_Bypass_CD.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27235764/-/True_Bypass_CD.jpg","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27266401/-/true_bypass.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27266401/-/true_bypass.jpg","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27266413/-/lamb1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27266413/-/lamb1.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30528981/-/TB_Rolling_Stone_0111.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30528981/-/TB_Rolling_Stone_0111.jpg","width":926,"height":391}],"artists":[{"id":46854,"name":"True Bypass","permalink":"true-bypass","url":"/artist/true-bypass"}],"categories":[{"id":1672090,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":1929820,"name":"Craig Ward","permalink":"craig-ward","url":"/category/craig-ward"}]},{"id":2814500,"name":"Sukilove - Static Moves (Vinyl with CD) or CD version - JF021","permalink":"sukilove-static-moves-vinyl-with-cd","position":113,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sukilove-static-moves-vinyl-with-cd","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-10-22T00:49:44.000Z","description":"Maybe the best record we have ever released? \r\n\r\n<a href=http://soundcloud.com/search?q%5Bfulltext%5D=sukilove=><b><i><font color=red>find out why here</font></i></b></a> \r\n\r\n\r\nSince forming in Antwerp, Belgium in 2002 Sukilove have built a reputation as one of Belgium’s most interesting and daring bands. Frontman and main songwriter Pascal Deweze (Metal Molly, Mitsoobishy Jacson, Mauro Pawlowski & The Grooms, Chitlin' Fooks and Ih8 Camera) is a master of textural songwriting combined with twisted pop melody. Recent career highlights include numerous festival appearances including this year’s Pukkelpop festival, US tours, support slots with David Bowie and appearing on a Mojo commissioned ‘Revolver Reloaded’ Beatles cover album. The relationship with Jezus Factory Records began when a long time admiration led to the organization of UK dates and then 2008’s ‘Natural Regression EP’ which saw the band gain significant UK press acclaim; bizarrely the first track ‘You Kill Me’ ended up being used on the BBC programme ‘Kill It, Cook It, Eat It’. Sukilove include in their ranks drummer Stoffel Verlackt who was a member of the legendary Flowers For Breakfast and guitarist Sjoerd Bruil also plays for Tim Vanhamel of Millionaire in his solo band as well as his own band Black Cassette. Their fourth full album ‘Static Moves’ is the first album to be recorded in Pascal’s own Studio Jezus (where he has produced albums for the likes of Creature With The Atom Brain (featuring Mark Lanegan), Tom Pintens and The Van Jets ao). With no studio clock ticking, one would expect recording sessions to last forever (or possibly longer), including massive overdubs, meticulously recorded stereo xylophones, the odd violin ensemble and candlelit meditation interludes for the musicians to focus their inner energy. Actually, it took a mere 14 days and they recorded the whole thing live, leaving only the vocals and an occasional piano to be added later. The result is a raw and intense collection of songs. Pascal describes the new record as \"homo erotic rock without the glitter\". ‘Static Moves’ was mastered by Uwe Teichert (dEUS, Placebo, Public Enemy). \r\nSukilove stand for honesty, integrity and quality. Look out for Sukilove on tour in the UK between 28th November and 5th December.

Koen Van den Camp - keyboards, Jurgen Leclercq - bass, Rudy Trouve - guitar, Dirk De Hooghe - drums. \r\n\r\nMark Meyers was an early member of dEUS, but perhaps his most widely noted contributions to the Antwerp music scene was his tenure with the legendary Belgian Big Band Kiss My Jazz. Rudy Trouve is one of the most respected bandleaders and collaborators in Belgian musical history. His unique guitar sound defined the dEUS’ classic debut album ‘Worst Case Scenario’ and it’s ground breaking follow up ‘My Sister=My Clock’. The tension of hard touring and life on a major label led to Rudy leaving dEUS to concentrate on a host of bands including Kiss My Jazz, Gore Slut, Dead Man Ray and The Love Substitutes. He also formed his own label Heavenhotel and is an acclaimed artist whose work adorns many album covers including the cover for ‘On Your House’. \r\n\r\nPox formed in Antwerp in 2005 when Mark Meyers and Koen van de Camp decided they wanted to soup up the sound of their previous co-operation Plank. Jurgen Leclerq, an old acquaintance and guitarist in Wall of Sweat, was asked to join on bass. After a couple of rehearsals with drummer Bekin Ratta, Rudy Trouvé joined the band. With this line-up a first demo was recorded. A decision is made to simplify the drum sound en Craig Ward (dEUS/The Love Substitutes) takes to the drum seat. A single track is recorded for the Jezus Factory compilation album. The recording of a full cd is scheduled but the nomadic nature of Craig (who moves to another country) leaves Pox in need of a new drummer.

His unique guitar style and vocals punctuated the landmark debut album ‘Worst Case Scenario’ and its beguiling follow up ‘My Sister=My Clock’, records which kick-started (in the mainstream consciousness at least) the Antwerp sound and the fertile scene that satellites around it. However Rudy always had projects away from dEUS and soon tired of life on a major label and the pressures of long term touring so quit the band at arguably the peak of its powers. \r\n\r\nHe formed his own label Heaven Hotel Presents; an avenue for his own bands and friend’s bands to release what they want how they want and when they want. Bands Rudy has released and been an integral part of read like a who’s who of Belgian guitar rock… Kiss My Jazz, The Love Substitutes, Dead Man Ray, Pox, Franko Saint De Bakker and Gore Slut. \r\n\r\nOn this album he is once more surrounded by Belgian talents such as Elko Blijweert on guitar (Seen with Front 242, Tip Toe Topic, Dead Man Ray, Kiss My Jazz, Franco Saint de Bakker, Bad Influence, Ow), Aarich Jespers on drums (Kiss My Jazz, Zita Swoon) and recently Joris Caluwaerts who was added on piano (Zita Swoon, Star Club West, Finster Ho). \r\nThe songs for this record were written over the last few years, some were recorded as early as 2006 but Rudy has been very busy. As well as becoming a Father for the second time he recently wrote the soundtrack for a few theatre shows for Braakland/ZheBilding which were performed live, started a new band ‘Rudy & the Unforgettable Wally’s’, recorded a solo-release together with Mauro Pawlowski (Evil Superstars, dEUS) and Craig Ward (dEUS, Kiss My Jazz, The Love Substitutes etc..) named ‘Pawlowski, Trouvé & Ward’ for the UK label Jezus Factory. The majority of the tracks were recorded early summer of 2007. \r\nThe CD is filled with pop-songs which instantly stick in your head, some in French, some in English, and are divided by short soundscapes to balance out the full CD, Rudy is very picky about the order of the songs and general feel of the CD, and all should fit somewhere to make the CD a whole. It’s a varied and beautiful album of late night songs. \r\n\r\nTwo singles from the album have already been made public and were freely downloadable from the record label’s site www.heavenhotel.be as teasers. This time also clips were made: for the first single ‘123 Soleil’ Rudy captured the full song & lyrics in 8 paintings, which were flashed together and synchronized with the music, and for the second single ‘Till the Next Time you Come Around’ a selection of live photos by Bache Jespers were picked and merged into a video-clip, both can still be seen on the site. \r\n\r\n“Quietly spoken, end of the night minimalist brilliance”. KERRANG! \r\n\r\n“Trouvé has found the vitriolic light-footedness of Velvet Underground, but quite some pinches brighter.”. WHITE HEAT \r\n\r\n“Trouve's contributions are models of inspired home recording in a combination of lo-fi roughness and echo familiar to any number of 90s bedroom performers and more pristine performances that result in a lovely blend”. ALL MUSIC GUIDE \r\n\r\n“Rudy Trouve occasionally reminds me of The Evens, but also of Jim White – work that one out if you can, it's beyond me. He keeps it stripped down and raw, often just his guitar and voice, but this only amplifies the soul and emotion in what he does.” SUBBA CULTCHA \r\n\r\n“…conjures up images of Robert Pollard's indie rock staples, Guided By voices. Trouve's advantage is, if the song has heart then it will succeed. It does. 'The God Of Small Disasters' has an almost Joy Division doom hidden behind the fragile guitar playing and vocal.

The only agenda was to each make 20 minutes of solo music in whatever manner or style they liked. The results are displayed here in this very special and unique album which ranges from acoustic melodies and electronic sounds to the outer reaches of experimental guitar rock. \r\n\r\nReleased on CD and Download on 31.07.07. Distributed via Shellshock in UK and Lowlands in Benelux and Japan. \r\n\r\nSince the early nineties these three musicians have been at the forefront of alternative guitar rock. Mauro Pawlowski, Rudy Trouve and Craig Ward have all had the same job; guitar player in dEUS, arguably the most significant guitar band to come from Belgium. Their paths have frequently crossed via frequent collaborations including the legendary Kiss My Jazz and they are all members of The Love Substitutes. \r\n\r\nThat's the way these guys roll. With this in mind we approached Craig Ward almost two years ago with the concept of a split solo album with Rudy Trouve and Mauro Pawlowski. After much conversation and message relaying these 21 new and exclusive solo tracks are another example of what makes these guys three of the most fertile and also bullshit free contemporary working musicians alive today. \r\n\r\nMauro Pawlowski first rose to fame as singer of the legendary Evil Superstars. After splitting the band at the peak of their powers (Guitarist Tim Vanhammel and Dave Schroyen went on to form Millionaire and Tim also played with Eagles of Death Metal) Mauro released the Dave Sardy produced solo album 'Songs From A Bad Hat'. Since then Mauro has been a fascinating collaborator with a ridiculous amount of bands and projects that include Mitsoobishy Jacson, Monguito, Mauro & The Grooms, Shadowgraphic City, Kiss My Jazz, I H8 Camera The Love Substitutes, Somnabula, Otot and Bum Collar. When Craig Ward left dEUS Mauro joined for the recent 'Pocket Revolution' album and tour, a position which he still holds. Mauro's blend of pop, noise and eccentricity is reflected within these tracks. \r\n\r\nRudy Trouve was a founding member of dEUS adding his distinctive songwriting, voice and guitar playing to what is considered to be their classic debut album 'Worst Case Scenario' and also the ground breaking follow up 'My Sister=My Clock'. Tired of major label life and an extremely heavy touring schedule he left dEUS and formed Heavenhotel records; an output to release his own bands and also to help other Belgian musicians which continues to this day and is an inspiration to all independent labels. Rudy has also been a successful band member and collaborator in a stupendous amount of bands which include Gore Slut, Dead Man Ray, Rudy Trouve Sextet, I H8 Camera, The Love Substitutes and Pox. Rudy is also a highly renowned artist whose work is frequently exhibited as has adorned many album covers. Rudy has provided an original piece of art for this album, and he explores his melancholic acoustic side with his contribution. \r\n\r\nCraig Ward is Scottish and found himself in Antwerp after an invite from Stef Kamil Carlens (dEUS, Zita Swoon) to holiday there. It was a long holiday. Craig joined Kiss My Jazz and found himself in the hub of a fervent music scene so much that Rudy Trouve suggested him as his replacement in dEUS (to which Craig lent his guitar and lilting vocal talents to the 'In A Bar Under The Sea' and 'The Ideal Crash' albums and tours) and his compositions and playing and singing style proved to be a great foil for Tom Barman. After his exit from dEUS Craig formed acclaimed band The Love Substitutes with Mauro and Rudy and is also a member of I H8 Camera and….. Craig's production credits include The Frames and Pox. His recent relocation to Berlin has yielded further collaborations with Das Huhn, Donkey Diva and Mark Mulholland.

Coincidentally, the lay-off bonus was the exact amount needed to pay for the mastering of “Ufo Conspiracy Believer” – a collection of songs Houben had recorded \r\nwith The Syphilis Madmen. \r\n\r\n2)With his first band, Nemo, Peter Houben had already gained considerable acclaim – showcasing their contorted interpretation of a high-speed rocktrio all over Europe, being invited to the New Music Seminar in New York even before the first album was recorded, drawing the attention of a.o. Brinkman Records (see also Bettie Serveert), subsequently recording their self-produced debut in a few days on no budget at all, getting hysterical press like “Nemo acts as if nothing has happened. Put up a milestone in rock, pff... 18 songs full of surprising angles and great ideas...” (Humo) \r\nLong time admirer Mauro Pawlowski used to be their roadie and dEUS played as their support. \r\n\r\n3)Meanwhile Mauro and Peter started Mitsoobishy Jacson, often labelled ‘the Belgian alternative lofi supergroup’ with a.o. Pascal Deweze (Metal Molly/Sukilove) and Guy Van Nueten (Tom Barman). \r\n\r\n4)After three Nemo and two Mitsoobishy Jacson albums, Houben felt it was enough and he started to mess around with synths and loops in a duo called UltraCowboy, causing immediate consternation with a ridiculously melodic radio hit called “the song that says fuck you”. \r\n\r\n5)After that, Houben said “fuck you” to the music business, bought an acoustic guitar, got a part-time job and filled his days with long walks and slow books about evolutionary biology, the philosophy of science and the possibility of artificial intelligence. He kept writing and recording music, having no intention however to release an album. \r\n\r\n6)Two things happened recently to change the natural course of things: an email from Jezus Factory and the aforementioned lay-off bonus – resulting in the appearance of Benny Zen the Recording Artist. \r\nHouben got some local musicians together, the marvellous Syphilis Madmen, and recorded 15 songs at home. Half the Belgian music scene – Mauro Pawlowski, Admiral Freebee, Tim Vanhamel from Millionaire, Pascal Deweze, … - dropped by to celebrate the new Houben incarnation by supplying the choir on the song “It follows what you do”. It took two days to clean the living room. \r\n\r\nThe album comes in a deluxe digi pack with artwork from the legendary designer Herman Houbrechts (Millionaire, Evil Superstars, Admiral Freebee etc etc) and was mastered by Uwe Teichert (dEUS, Public Enemy, Placebo). \r\n","options":[{"id":9848999,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.2,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.2}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27278180/-/DSCF5533.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27278180/-/DSCF5533.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27248355/-/27.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27248355/-/27.jpg","width":340,"height":340}],"artists":[{"id":46873,"name":"Benny Zen; The Recording Artist Featuring The Syphilis Madmen","permalink":"benny-zen-the-recording-artist-featuring-the-syphilis-madmen","url":"/artist/benny-zen-the-recording-artist-featuring-the-syphilis-madmen"}],"categories":[{"id":1672090,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":2815533,"name":"The Huaraz EP - JF007","permalink":"the-huaraz-ep","position":126,"price":1.5,"default_price":1.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-huaraz-ep","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-10-22T13:57:10.000Z","description":"Debut EP of ex Paul Hawkins & Thee Awkward Silences' Alex Templeton Ward, they came, they exploded into a wave of great reviews, they imploded into drunken drug enduced, banned from venues chaos... \r\n\r\n1: Getaway Car \r\n2: The Huaraz song \r\n3: Groping like the cave man \r\n4: The Beauty and the Horror \r\n\r\n\"Like Morrissey and Elvis Costello jamming at Elliott Smith's wake\" Room Thirteen\r\n\r\n\"The rhythm section sounds like early Hawkwind\" Get Ready To Rock\r\n\r\n\"Ultra f**king cool - expect Artrocker and NME arse kissing\" Losing Today\r\n\r\n\"Something To become very excited about\" Whisperin and Hollerin'\r\n\r\n \r\n\"Fusing the hypnotic polemic of Jesus & Mary Chain, the who-cares attitude of Doherty & some ramshackle passion kept in a bottle under their piss stained beds, TBM are Trashy, throbbing & on course to reek havoc!\" Subba Cultcha\r\n\r\n\"A different composition from the recent, run of the mill Camden rigmarole\" Is This Music?","options":[{"id":9848692,"name":"Default","price":1.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.2,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.2}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27424199/-/DSCF5545.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27424199/-/DSCF5545.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27246772/-/smallBeatMarasCover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27246772/-/smallBeatMarasCover.jpg","width":160,"height":160}],"artists":[{"id":46856,"name":"The Beat Maras","permalink":"the-beat-maras","url":"/artist/the-beat-maras"}],"categories":[{"id":1672110,"name":"E.P.","permalink":"e-p","url":"/category/e-p"},{"id":2132728,"name":"Bargains","permalink":"bargains","url":"/category/bargains"}]},{"id":2815508,"name":"Creature With The Atom Brain - Transylvania (CD)","permalink":"transylvania-cd","position":127,"price":9.0,"default_price":9.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/transylvania-cd","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-10-22T13:07:34.000Z","description":"Second full length from these critically acclaimed Belgian sons of Roky Erikson... \r\n\r\n\r\n1.

His first appearance on a stage was with ‘The Jump’ at the age of 12. \r\nLater on, he was found behind the drums in bands such as Sons Of Sinatra (together with Aldo Struyf from Millionaire and Creature With The Atom Brain) Scale Sheer Surface (who shared the stage with No Means No, Victims Family and other hardcore heroes) The Dutch sixties popband Ford’s Imaginary Inferno, the Mexican/American/Belgian ambient electro collab project LLIPS and some more...... \r\nThe last few years, he is and or was drummer and sometimes vocalist for Traktor, DAAU, One Louder, Dóttir Slonza, childrens music & theater with Kapitein Winokio, A Clean Kitchen Is A Happy Kitchen (where he teams up with former dEUS guitarist Craig Ward) and some impro & jazz-acts with different Antwerp musicians. \r\n\r\nAs Butsenzeller he deejayed half his life and started experimenting with tapeloops, samples and electronics in the late 90's. Made a tape (Beepshow 01) some selfreleased cd’s (Beepshow 05, Organic Organisations and Deviant Disco) and several contributions to Compilations like: Radioworm (NL), Rotkop (B), Gonzo Circus’ Mind The Gap (B/NL), Spacemen Don’t Live On Mars (UK). Remixed some befriended bands or his own, and made a soundtrack for a children’s puppettheatre play called “Goesting”. \r\n\r\nDutch label Wharf Records showed an interest in Bootsie's eclectic musical vision and released 'Natt' in 2008. An album where Butsenzeller collaborated with other artists for the first time, such as Simon Lenski (DAAU, Lais,...) Dieter Sermeus (The Go Find, Orange Black) Andrew Claes (Stijn, Brazzaville, Go_Tell,...)

The music is still naïve and dreamlike, but has developed a darker side. It's a filmic trip, sometimes quiet and melodic, often loud, dissonant, intense and hypnotic. \r\n\r\nAlthough OW's music is predominantly instrumental, it's actually about something. It evokes everyday things like loneliness, confusion, alienation, depression, being lost, snails, lost love, snowboarding, the decline of western civilization, evil women (on TV), food and alcohol abuse, loss of memory. \r\n\r\n\r\nOW features four members: \r\n\r\nChris Wauters: drums, bells, shakers, voice. \r\n\r\nJan Stoop: bass, big muff, delay, voice. \r\n\r\nElko Blijweert: keyboard, melodica, Chinese flute, echo, pro, shakers, voice. \r\n\r\nThomas Noppe: guitar, memory man, pulsar, toy harp, Casio, voice. \r\n\r\n\r\nThey have a rich history in loads of pivotal bands from the infamous Antwerp scene. Chris was in Elohim, Pockets of Resistance and Zen Torpedo. Elko played and/or plays in Goldorak, Kiss My Jazz, Bad Influence, Franco Saint de Bakker, Autistik Youth, Male or Female, Dead Man Ray, Rudy Trouvé Sextet, Con&Rot, Star Club West, Catsize, Miles Behind, Screaming Headache and Tip Toe Topic. Thomas was a member of Skunk, Bad Influence, Zen Torpedo, Gore Slut, Miles Behind, Screaming Headache and Catsize. Jan played in various bands in Madrid, Seattle (Red Stars Theory) and Beveren. Together with Thomas he was in Hell Beach. \r\n\r\n\r\nMoon Tan was recorded and mixed by Geert Van Bever in August 2006 on 16-track tape deck at Ghosttown studios. Special guests on the album are Sigrid van Roosendaal and Frans van Isacker on trumpet, alt sax and bass clarinet. The album was released by Heaven Hotel and distributed in the Benelux by Lowlands. \r\n\r\n\r\nPress Quotes for Ow: \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Musically OW touches common ground with the minimalist rock of Slint or even the slowcore of Codeine. With neither of those bands you'll hear cozy cricket sounds though, as happens in \"Vivid Dream of Holding Hands\". OW doesn't only juggle with subtle inventions, but also with power. The textures switch between dreamy, elated and uncomfortable.\"- De Morgen \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Desolate sound patterns, covered in a mystic haze of loneliness, depres­sion and lost love. Derailed guitars clash with a very tight rhythm section and eerie pas­sages alternate with venomous friction…the intensity oozes from the speakers.\" – KindaMuzik \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ow performs instrumental, dreamy, almost naïve music.

Volume 1 also has Sonic Youth-style guitar freakouts embellished with a brass section, and that comparison brings Nels Cline’s jazzier work and collaborations with Mike Watt to mind, too. One piece even sounds like Robert Fripp’s turned up to unleash an aural tornado with his boxes of guitar tricks. \r\n\r\nFor those who are already familiar with some of the Belgian bands I mentioned, i H8 Camera reuse elements of Kiss My Jazz and certainly some of the funk of Zita Swoon. The crazier times of early dEUS are also evoked: I’m particularly reminded of My Sister=My Clock, another single track LP. Fans of those bands’ experimental moments will most likely be fans of i H8 Camera by the time they’ve given this album a spin or two, whereas other listeners who favour a more predictable pop song structure might take a while to acclimatise to it… and some might not bond with it at all. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I’ve grown rather fond of Volume 1. At first it seemed to be a mad idea but it’s managed to pull me back time and time again.

Lost,. \r\nCassini Division also works with Teun de Lange in the electro acoustic duo \r\n\"Really Ready\" \r\nsee: www.jazzperiments.com \r\n","options":[{"id":9849195,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.2,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.2}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27385646/-/DSCF5534.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27385646/-/DSCF5534.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27248923/-/cassinidivision_sub03.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27248923/-/cassinidivision_sub03.gif","width":120,"height":120}],"artists":[{"id":47040,"name":"Cassini Division","permalink":"cassini-division","url":"/artist/cassini-division"}],"categories":[{"id":1672103,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"},{"id":1672590,"name":"Other Distribution","permalink":"other-distribution","url":"/category/other-distribution"}]},{"id":2815738,"name":"Outdoor Types - All Aboard That’s Coming Aboard","permalink":"all-aboard-that’s-coming-aboard","position":138,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/all-aboard-that’s-coming-aboard","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-10-22T16:42:17.000Z","description":"Folk Rock but far from Hey, Nonny. You could find a foothold here if you knew 70s facial hair gods Horslips or 80s barricade stormers The Men They Couldn’t Hang. But this is NOT retro and is informed by Indie aesthetics and an embracing of many musical pathways, not least Garage Rock. And it’s in the Garage we find the album’s grotesques such as the shadowy wraith “Jangler Swifteye” and particularly the twisted creep called “The Doll Enthusiast”. However “Got A Concept, Got A Job” could be Depeche Mode if they swapped synths for spit and sawdust. By closing track Over The Pylons Billy Bragg singing The Smiths (or is it The Smiths singing Billy Bragg) could be as appropriate. All topped by the amazing voice of Luke Novak. \r\nThe download single will be the alcoholic Mariachi of By The Gallon – if this doesn’t get you swinging you’re dead, or at the very least sober. \r\nAfter exceptional singles on the Hand Of God label, I Blame The Parents Records is delighted to release their album. So like the title says – ALL ABOARD THAT’S COMING ABOARD! \r\n\"I am just filled with an urge to make a fool of myself and dance all about my house. At other times, I am just left in awe of the creativity and catchiness. This album has me in awe!” \r\n\r\n- Music Emissions Review \r\nwww.myspace.com/theoutdoortypes","options":[{"id":9849198,"name":"half price sale","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12656448,"name":"normal","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.2,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.2}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27248939/-/allaboardfront.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27248939/-/allaboardfront.jpg","width":1000,"height":994}],"artists":[{"id":46880,"name":"The Outdoor Types","permalink":"the-outdoor-types","url":"/artist/the-outdoor-types"}],"categories":[{"id":1672090,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":1672590,"name":"Other Distribution","permalink":"other-distribution","url":"/category/other-distribution"},{"id":1726293,"name":"I Blame The Parents","permalink":"i-blame-the-parents","url":"/category/i-blame-the-parents"},{"id":2132728,"name":"Bargains","permalink":"bargains","url":"/category/bargains"}]},{"id":2815753,"name":"Paul Hawkins & Thee Awkward Silences - The Bigger Bone - JF006","permalink":"the-bigger-bone","position":139,"price":1.0,"default_price":1.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-bigger-bone","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-10-22T16:50:26.000Z","description":"The second single and the first to feature the full band and a multi colour sound.

You’re sucked into the irrepressible ravings of an endearing id.” – indiefolkforever \r\n\r\n“Wayward fuck off and leave alone buckled pop. Like Daniel Johnston but with better tunes. One of those must have releases I’m afraid” – Losing Today reviewing The Evil Thoughts \r\n\r\n“A genuinely dirty raw, rock energy I’ve been missing for a good few years. I mean can you name a new band that's made the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end and make you believe that twenty five thousand ants are crawling all over your skin? Refreshingly, there's never a sense of resolution, absolution or redemption. To Hawkins, there's only deterioration, decay and debility – which is exactly how life works” – Room 13 reviewing The Evil Thoughts \r\n\r\n“Blues-stomping, alcohol fuelled bitter despair. 8/10” – Drowned in Sound on The Evil Thoughts \r\n\r\n“I haven’t been able to get Paul Hawkins out of my head for the last 4 days” – Huw Stephens, Radio 1 \r\n\r\n“A very unusual charisma. I became captivated by the character in Paul’s voice”- Drunken Werewolf Magazine \r\n\r\n“Paul Hawkins & Thee Awkward Silences make your lungs bleed and your ears explode” – www.antifolk.co.uk \r\n\r\n“Pretty fucking untouchable. The best live act I’ve seen on any stage” – Alistair Harper, Extradition Order \r\n\r\n“The best band in the world” – Tim Ten Yen\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing on from the critically acclaimed 7” split single with Lil’ Lost Lou, “The Evil Thoughts”, Paul Hawkins & Thee Awkward Silences return on 26 November with The Bigger Bone taken from the band’s forthcoming album We Are Not Other People scheduled for release early next year. \r\n\r\nThe Bigger Bone is Hawkins’ most strident and confident statement to date. Throbbing guitars and apocalyptic drums underpin an Aesop’s Fables inspired lyric. As with much of Hawkins’ material the distinction between character study and autobiography is blurred and it is ambiguous whether the song is a parable on the folly of limitless ambition and a self-aggrandising statement of a band intent on world domination. The song is backed by two further tracks – the galloping, looping The Cavalry Ain’t Coming and the pounding, relentless Daily Mail paranoia bating Hate is All Around. \r\n\r\nPaul Hawkins was born in Bristol and started writing his unique brand of dark, twisted comic outsider art narrative songs in his teens but didn’t perform live until he had moved to London and needed a way to go out and meet people. For two years he played solo until producer Ian Button, (best known as the guitarist in Death in Vegas) came across Paul’s music and ended up producing Paul’s ultra-limited self-released debut album The Misdiagnosis of Paul Hawkins. Shortly after this Hawkins and Button formed Thee Awkward Silences, which comprise of Button on drums, Alex Templeton-Ward (lead singer of recent Jezus Factory signings The Beat Maras) on bass, Tom Mayne (frontman of cult antifolk band David Cronenberg’s Wife) on keyboards, Kate Arnold on violin, and Lawrence “Lunch” Pritchard (of the much missed Brazen Hussies) on guitar. \r\n\r\nJezus Factory first stumbled across the band live one fateful night in January 2007 and were dumbfounded enough to offer to sign them on the spot. They were first featured on ‘Welcome Back to The Jezus Factory’ compilation and released a split single “The Evil Thoughts” with L’il Lost Lou in June. “The Bigger Bone” is released on 26th November on download and highly limited edition CD. The LP We Are Not Other People will follow in early 2008. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nwww.myspace.com/theeawkwardsilences \r\nwww.myspace.com/jezusfactory","options":[{"id":9849253,"name":"Default","price":1.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.2,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.2}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27385666/-/DSCF5544.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27385666/-/DSCF5544.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27249083/-/biggerbutton.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27249083/-/biggerbutton.jpg","width":170,"height":170}],"artists":[{"id":46882,"name":"Paul Hawkins & Thee Awkward Silences","permalink":"paul-hawkins-thee-awkward-silences","url":"/artist/paul-hawkins-thee-awkward-silences"}],"categories":[{"id":1672090,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":1672663,"name":"Singles","permalink":"singles","url":"/category/singles"}]},{"id":2815797,"name":"Paul Hawkins & Thee Awkward Silences - We Are Not Other People - JF016","permalink":"we-are-not-other-people-jf016","position":140,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/we-are-not-other-people-jf016","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-10-22T17:13:30.000Z","description":"The full band debut album \r\n\r\n1.

Hate Is All Around \r\n12. Timing Is Everything \r\nPaul Hawkins & Thee Awkward Silences formed in late 2006 and have over recent months gained a fearsome live reputation as one of the most original and uncompromising underground acts in London and won admiration from the likes of BBC Radio 1’s Huw Stephens, Laura-Mary Carter of Blood Red Shoes and Dan Treacy of the Television Personalities. Debut single “The Bigger Bone” was the UK Student Radio Association’s track of the week and a student radio hit. \r\n\r\n“We Are Not Other People” is a collection of deceptively catchy primal pop songs shot through with a vein of black comedy that reinforces rather than deflects the savage emotional honesty of Hawkins’ lyrics. Songs range from the pure call-and-response rush of Huw Stephens’ favourite “I Fell in Love With a Moment in Time” to the apocalyptic broken disco of “Unexpected Error” and from the sheer punk thrash of “There Ain’t No Carrot, There Ain’t No Stick” to the epic murder ballad “Sarah Vincent”, with lyrics taking in traumatised soldiers, love-struck alcoholics drinking themselves to death and an old man driven by loneliness and boredom to seek a hospital admission by throwing himself down a staircase. \r\n\r\nPaul Hawkins maintains “It’s definitely a pop album, just pop done in a pretty twisted way. Some of the subject matter’s maybe a bit unusual but it’s hopefully done in an emotionally truthful way. I think with the kind of outsider characters I tend to write about it’s very easy to put them down as oddballs or weirdos and the challenge to me is to try and make the listener actually identify with the emotional reasoning going on in their minds”. \r\n\r\nJezus Factory Records’ Andrew Bennett added “I first stumbled across Paul Hawkins & Thee Awkward Silences supporting The Rebel.The singer was wearing pyjamas, the keyboardist had seven fingers, the bassist was comatose dribbling on the side of the stage and their was some older dude on drums. The vocals were relentless, and the songs were undeniable. I offered to release their records on the spot. This is important, beautiful and ugly music. Paul Hawkins could take on any lyricist on the planet”. \r\n\r\n“Laden with Pure Charisma” – NME \r\n\r\n“If indie music is plagued with soulless rats then Hawkins is the new pied piper” – Moderate Rock \r\n\r\n“It seems to be customary to compare Hawkins to Nick Cave and Tom Waits. This does him a huge disservice; he’s a considerably more marginal and interesting figure than these decidedly mainstream oddballs” – Drunken Werewolf Magazine \r\n\r\n“Rapidly becoming the greatest artist of 2008” – Bearded Magazine \r\n\r\n“I haven’t been able to get Paul Hawkins out of my head for the last 4 days” – Huw Stephens, Radio 1 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":9849362,"name":"Default","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.2,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.2}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27249463/-/22.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27249463/-/22.jpg","width":400,"height":389}],"artists":[{"id":46882,"name":"Paul Hawkins & Thee Awkward Silences","permalink":"paul-hawkins-thee-awkward-silences","url":"/artist/paul-hawkins-thee-awkward-silences"}],"categories":[{"id":1672090,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":2132728,"name":"Bargains","permalink":"bargains","url":"/category/bargains"}]},{"id":2815806,"name":"Paul Hawkins & Thee Awkward Silences - Every Word I Say To You Today Will Be A Lie - JF024","permalink":"every-word-i-say-to-you-today-will-be-a-lie-jf024","position":141,"price":1.0,"default_price":1.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/every-word-i-say-to-you-today-will-be-a-lie-jf024","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-10-22T17:18:45.000Z","description":"First single to be take from 'Apologies To The Enlightenment'.
