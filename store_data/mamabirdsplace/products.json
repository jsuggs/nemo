The fabrics and components that we use are sourced in North America and are guaranteed lead, phthalate and BPA free.\r\n\r\nNewborn 7 - 10 lbs / 3 - 5 kg \r\nSmall 8 - 15 lbs / 3.6 - 7 kg \r\nMedium 15 - 30 lbs / 7 - 14 kg \r\nLarge 30 lbs / 14 kg \r\nX-Large (White only) 40 lbs / 18 kg \r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":48536472,"name":"Rocket (XS)","price":12.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48536475,"name":"Rocket (S)","price":12.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48536478,"name":"Bloom (XS)","price":12.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48536481,"name":"Bloom (S)","price":12.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48536484,"name":"Flower (XS)","price":12.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48536487,"name":"Flower (S)","price":12.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127863915/-/Bummis_Jillians.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127863915/-/Bummis_Jillians.jpg","width":290,"height":290},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127863918/-/super_whisper_wrap_rocket_5557_200__31909_zoom.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127863918/-/super_whisper_wrap_rocket_5557_200__31909_zoom.jpg","width":200,"height":175},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127863921/-/super-whisper-wrap-bloom-5558-400__21352.1382497276.195.195.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127863921/-/super-whisper-wrap-bloom-5558-400__21352.1382497276.195.195.jpg","width":195,"height":177}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4891738,"name":"Cloth Diapers","permalink":"cloth-diapers","url":"/category/cloth-diapers"},{"id":4891741,"name":"Diaper Covers","permalink":"diaper-covers","url":"/category/diaper-covers"},{"id":5348385,"name":"Bummis","permalink":"bummis","url":"/category/bummis"}]},{"id":15185445,"name":"Bummis Simply Lite OS diaper cover","permalink":"bummis-simply-lite-os-diaper-cover","position":10,"price":16.95,"default_price":16.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bummis-simply-lite-os-diaper-cover","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-29T02:14:08.000Z","description":"Comfy and trim one-size wrap.

And rest assured - nobody will ever have to empty the pool because of your little darling! Fashion and peace of mind - what better combination can there be in a baby swimsuit ....\r\n\r\nEngineered with painstaking attention to detail and functionality:\r\n• A trim and attractive design that has a terrific fit on any baby \r\n• Interior polyester mesh for easy clean ups \r\n• Coated nylon layer sandwiched inside that will hold in the messiest stuff a baby can throw at you! \r\n• Fun cotton prints on the outside \r\n• Adjustable hook and loop closures for a snug and comfortable fit \r\n• Stretchy soft lycra bindings to protect baby’s tender skin \r\n\r\nWhat should you put inside the SWIMMI?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely nothing!\r\n\r\nDoes the Swimmi absorb pee?\r\n\r\nNo. Swim diapers are designed to hold messes in, not to absorb liquid. When you put an absorbent diaper in a swimming pool, it gets soaking wet – it’s no fun frolicking with a soggy bottom! When out of the water, you can add absorbency by inserting a doubler.\r\n\r\nCan you use this pant as a waterproof diaper cover as well?\r\n\r\nNo. The Swimmi is specially designed for use as a swim diaper. It may look like other wraps, but it's not meant to work like one!\r\n\r\nThe SWIMMI is made with careful attention to detail in our own wonderful factory in Montreal, so that we are assured of good quality and fair labour practices. Most of the fabrics and components we produce with are sourced in North America and all are guaranteed lead, phthalate and BPA free.\r\n\r\nSmall 9 - 15 lbs / 4 - 7 kg \r\nMedium 15 - 22 lbs / 7 - 10 kg \r\nLarge 22 - 30 lbs / 10 - 13.5 kg \r\nX-Large 30 lbs / 13.5 kg \r\n","options":[{"id":38007162,"name":"Koi Pond (medium)","price":13.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":38007165,"name":"Camping Critters (small)","price":13.75,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/118315326/-/03d4d958a72cae0de37fbe757c0858b6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/118315326/-/03d4d958a72cae0de37fbe757c0858b6.jpg","width":540,"height":270},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/118315338/-/20b0f2eae394e82349c691d90469ca7b.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/118315338/-/20b0f2eae394e82349c691d90469ca7b.jpg","width":540,"height":270}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4891738,"name":"Cloth Diapers","permalink":"cloth-diapers","url":"/category/cloth-diapers"},{"id":4626410,"name":"Swim Diapers","permalink":"swim-diapers","url":"/category/swim-diapers"},{"id":5348385,"name":"Bummis","permalink":"bummis","url":"/category/bummis"}]},{"id":13072533,"name":"Frugi / TotsBots OS AIO Nappy","permalink":"frugi-totsbots-os-aio-nappy","position":43,"price":29.99,"default_price":29.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/frugi-totsbots-os-aio-nappy","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-20T17:22:33.000Z","description":"And here it is...the long awaited Frugi Cloth Nappy!

Easy to stuff, easy to use! Now with minky!\r\n\r\n\t\r\nThe New Easy Fit combines the convenience of a one-size all-in-one diaper with the benefits of a 2-piece diaper: easy to care for and quick to dry. It’s the best of both worlds!\r\n\r\nNo assembly required! This innovative diaper has a fold-out liner, which makes it very easy to stuff. But don’t worry about unstuffing - the agitation in your washing machine will work the liner out of the pocket, so there’s no need to get your hands dirty!\r\n\r\nThe liner is made of three layers of soft minky fabric: it absorbs quickly, and it absorbs a LOT. The liner can be folded to create more layers where more absorption is needed, or to reduce bulk if desired. Bonus: minky dries VERY quickly, so after the wash is done, these diapers will be back on baby’s bum in no time.\r\n\r\nThis is a diaper engineered for successful leak containment and total convenience. With a wider elastic in the back and a stretchy waist, the New Easy Fit offers great protection, and a super comfy fit too.\r\n\r\nThe New Easy Fit is colour-coordinated for a sleeker look. Snaps, hook and loop, thread and minky are dyed to match the outer fabric - proof that cloth diapers are more fun and fashion-forward than ever!\r\n\r\nThe NEW EASY FIT is a one-size diaper (8-35 lbs); use the snaps on the front to adjust the rise. The NEW TINI FIT is a tinier version of the same diaper (5-14 lbs), which will sweetly and effectively accommodate a tinier baby.\r\n\r\nAll Tots Bots products are manufactured in their own factory in Glasgow, Scotland.

Easy to stuff, easy to use! Now with minky!\r\n\r\n\t\r\nThe New Tini Fit combines the convenience of a one-size all-in-one diaper with the benefits of a 2-piece diaper: easy to care for and quick to dry. It’s the best of both worlds!\r\n\r\nNo assembly required! This innovative diaper has a fold-out liner, which makes it very easy to stuff. But don’t worry about unstuffing - the agitation in your washing machine will work the liner out of the pocket, so there’s no need to get your hands dirty!\r\n\r\nThe liner is made of three layers of soft minky fabric: it absorbs quickly, and it absorbs a LOT. The liner can be folded to create more layers where more absorption is needed, or to reduce bulk if desired. Bonus: minky dries VERY quickly, so after the wash is done, these diapers will be back on baby’s bum in no time.\r\n\r\nThis is a diaper engineered for successful leak containment and total convenience. With a wider elastic in the back and a stretchy waist, the New Tini Fit offers great protection, and a super comfy fit too.\r\n\r\nThe New Tini Fit is colour-coordinated on the outside for a sleeker look. Snaps, hook and loop, outer fabric and thread are dyed to match - proof that cloth diapers are more fun and fashion-forward than ever!\r\n\r\nThe New Tini Fit will sweetly and effectively accommodate a tiny baby (5-14 lbs). Ideal for newborns, preemies, and multiples, it's just a mini version of the much-loved Easy Fit Diaper.\r\n\r\nThe New Tini Fit is available with hook and loop closures.\r\n\r\nAll Tots Bots products are manufactured in their own factory in Glasgow, Scotland.

No stuffing required. The Lil•Joeys are an AIO (all in one) design that is waterproof and requires no cover. Once your baby is ready for the next stage in diapers, The Rump•a•rooz® (Rumparooz) One Size Cloth Pocket Diaper will take your baby all the way through potty training with one diaper that has 4 size settings. No need to buy multiple sizes as your baby grows. The dual inner gussets can also be found on the Rumparooz One Size Cloth Pocket Diaper.\r\n\r\nThe Lil•Joeys make a great addition to any newborn stash.

Many may start researching cloth diapers, get overwhelmed and quit. Best Bottoms are YOUR solution! So easy to use yet comes with lots of options so you can get a customized system for your baby.\r\n\r\n1. Adjust front snaps to achieve the size needed.\r\n 2. Snap insert into diaper.\r\n 3. Put diaper on baby and go!\r\n 4. When baby needs a diaper change snap out soiled insert and snap clean one in.\r\n 5. Put diaper on baby and go AGAIN. The Best Bottom shell is wipe-able and can be used multiple times before washing but you may want to air dry between uses but it is not necessary.\r\n\r\nWe recommend getting as many shells as your baby poos in a 2-3 day time period (for newborns count how many explosions they have!!). We have found that poo does stay on the insert most of the time but in some cases it may not (but it will stay in the diaper cover avoiding an embarassing mess!) Three different size inserts in several different materials available. We don't believe in a one size insert. Newborns and toddlers are not the same size so in order for a one size insert to absorb enough for a toddler it will be HUGE on a newborn. Y ou may not need all three sizes of inserts and can skip the middle size - it is all up to you! We recommend approximately 24 inserts per size.\r\n\r\nSo to make it SIMPLE you will need approx 8-10 shells and 18-24 inserts per size. How easy is that?!\r\n \r\nQuality:\r\n\r\n The highest quality of materials available have been selected with as much of the raw materials made in the USA as we could find. The entire Shell is made with USA-made materials! ALL of our products are proudly handcrafted in the USA at local factories helping to support the local economy and reduce our environmental impact. We use durable snaps and hook & loop, double layer of waterproof PUL creating a perfect no-leak sturdy shell with a wipe-able inside lasting for many washes.\r\n \r\n\r\n See for yourself how Best Bottoms fit! \r\n \r\nWashing Instructions- Oh so easy!\r\n\r\nWe recommend washing every 2-3 days. We have found that the Best Bottom system washes beautifully as it takes up less space in your washing machine allowing more room for agitation getting your diapers super clean.\r\n\r\n1. Remove solids\r\n 2. Reuse the shell until soiled or wash day. Separate shell from insert before washing. Fasten laundry tabs (if applicable).\r\n 3. Do a cold rinse or cold quick wash (no detergent).\r\n 4. Warm or hot (not sanitary) full wash with 3/4 to full amount of additive-free detergent. Use the most amount of water possible.\r\n**Tip! Throw a soaking wet towel into your washing machine to “trick” it into using more water**\r\n 5. Extra rinse.\r\n 6. Inserts can be tumble dried. Shells should be line dried.\r\n***No fabric softeners, dryer sheets or additives such as vinegar, baking soda, washing soda, borax, oxyclean, etc. should be used. Rash creams can only be used with a barrier between baby and the diaper. We know that additive-free detergents work and are least likely to cause any problems with your diapers. \r\n","options":[{"id":27220157,"name":"Plum Pie","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":31472677,"name":"Strawberry Shortcake","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":31472680,"name":"Pink Giraffes","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32847229,"name":"Green Giraffes","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32847232,"name":"Cookie Monster","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32847235,"name":"Hedgehogs","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32847238,"name":"Hoot (owls)","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32847241,"name":"Huckleberry Cobbler","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":33155596,"name":"Fox Trot","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":33155599,"name":"Foxy Frolic","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35082597,"name":"Moo-licious","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":36074697,"name":"Very Cherry","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":36074694,"name":"Mint Chocolate Chip","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":36074691,"name":"Chunky Monkey","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":37106013,"name":"Cookies N Cream","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":37106010,"name":"Blue Moon","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":37106007,"name":"Key Lime","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43837149,"name":"Wild Berry","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46635480,"name":"Blue Giraffes","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46635477,"name":"Spearmint","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48610998,"name":"Camo","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48610995,"name":"Lace","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.25,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103079680/-/BB_Snap_Hedgehog.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103079680/-/BB_Snap_Hedgehog.jpg","width":125,"height":125},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98991775/-/1-bb-snaps-giraffe-pink-high.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98991775/-/1-bb-snaps-giraffe-pink-high.jpg","width":225,"height":225},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103073476/-/HootS__2_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103073476/-/HootS__2_.jpg","width":170,"height":170},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/104034013/-/BB_FoxyFrolic.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/104034013/-/BB_FoxyFrolic.jpg","width":125,"height":125},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/104034040/-/BB_FoxTrot.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/104034040/-/BB_FoxTrot.jpg","width":125,"height":125}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4891738,"name":"Cloth Diapers","permalink":"cloth-diapers","url":"/category/cloth-diapers"},{"id":4891852,"name":"Hybrid (All in 2) Diapers","permalink":"hybrid-all-in-2-diapers","url":"/category/hybrid-all-in-2-diapers"},{"id":5348400,"name":"Best Bottoms","permalink":"best-bottoms","url":"/category/best-bottoms"}]},{"id":8671163,"name":"Best Bottom inserts for Best Bottom cloth diaper shells (3 pack)","permalink":"best-bottom-stay-dry-inserts-for-best-bottom-cloth-diaper-shells-3-pack","position":67,"price":11.0,"default_price":11.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/best-bottom-stay-dry-inserts-for-best-bottom-cloth-diaper-shells-3-pack","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-24T18:32:52.000Z","description":"Stay Dry Inserts consist of 4 layers of super thirsty microfiber topped with a super soft no-pill fleece pulling wetness away from baby's bottom keeping them feeling dry.\r\n\r\nHemp/Organic Cotton Insert consists of 5 layers of hemp/Certified Organic cotton topped with a soft layer of hemp/Certified Organic cotton fleece.

On and off like undies! But there's more than meets the eye...\r\n\r\n\t\r\nSimple design. Tailored cut. Extra layers where it counts.\r\n\r\nAt Bummis, we love cloth diapers a lot. That being said, we know that at some point you’ll be happy to be done with them! Our Potty Pant will be your little one’s trusty companion for the transition from changing table to big-kid potty.\r\n\r\nWhat’s so great about cloth? It lets your little one feel the wetness. Peeing in a potty starts to seem like a better idea after all. The icing on the cake? Babies in cloth tend to potty train SOONER!\r\n\r\nSpecial features of the Potty Pant:\r\n•Very trim – can easily be worn under clothing. No fluffy bums here!\r\n•Looks like underwear – let your little one feel like a big kid! Easy on, easy off.\r\n•Accidents? No problem. Two hidden absorbent layers where it counts. One layer of long loop cotton terry and one layer of microfiber. Training takes practice!\r\n•Soft lining made of natural cotton-hemp fabric for maximum comfort and to allow for that helpful sensation of wetness.\r\n•Outer layer of waterproof fabric prevents leaks.\r\n•Stretchy lightweight side panels make for a trimmer fit, ultimate comfort and greater adjustability. Will accommodate wee ones of all sizes – from skinny minis to chunky monkeys!\r\n•Different sizes allow for a perfect fit. Most kids will potty train within a few months and will probably wear the same size throughout the process.\r\n\r\nThe Potty Pant is absorbent and was designed to prevent leaks when accidents happen.

Thirsties® Duo Fab Fitteds are shaped for a trimmer appearance and fabulous comfort for your mobile baby.  And now, thanks to our latest innovation, they're even easier on your wallet.  Just like our economical Duo Diaper and our Duo Wraps, the Thirsties® Duo Fab Fitteds feature an adjustable rise, which means one size will last twice as long.  In fact, you'll only need two sizes to cover your baby from birth all the way to potty-learning.  Period. \r\n\r\n\r\nExpertly crafted from stretchy, buttery soft textiles with a stay-dry liner, these super cute fitted diapers offer superior wetness protection for your baby's delicate skin.  Encased elastic wraps snugly, yet gently, around your baby's legs and torso to provide the very best protection from leaks.  And, Thirsties® Duo Fab Fitteds are easy to use.  Simply wrap around your baby and secure with the easy-to-use Aplix or sturdy snap closures for a secure, custom fit. \r\n \r\nWant a completely watertight diapering system? Remember, although you’re not going to want to cover up these adorable, ultrasoft diapers, Thirsties® Duo Fab Fitteds are not waterproof on their own. At times when you do need total protection, we recommend pairing your Thirsties® Duo Fab Fitted diaper with a Thirsties® Diaper Cover or Duo Wrap for the perfect adjustable fit and unstoppable performance.\r\n \r\nLet's face it...'one-size' options tend to be too big on the average newborn and too small for most toddlers over two years of age. What this means is that the 'one-size' option truly only fits your baby properly when he/she weighs between 10 lbs to 32 lbs. Each of the two sizes of our Duo Fab Fitted diaper feature three rows of snaps to adjust the rise to your baby's shape; it really is like having THREE sizes in one. \r\nOnly the best components come together to make Thirsties® Duo Fab Fitted diapers. The internal soaker is composed of spongy microfiber terry that can absorb up to seven times its weight in liquid! A maximum absorbency of 18 oz. makes this diaper appropriate for both light and heavy wetters alike. There is a tunnel behind the soaker which allows for stuffing additional absorbency, and for better washing and quicker drying. Touching your baby's skin is an entirely unique microfleece that is oh-so-soft to the touch and works to keep your baby feeling dry, thereby helping to prevent diaper rash. Textile pilling and stained diapers is a thing of the past with the help of the specially-made microfleece inner layer. You will likely notice that this diaper maintains its appearance and supple feel longer than many other brands on the market. Finally, the velvety cotton velour outer layer comes in a variety of fresh, fun color options (plus white). \r\n\r\nAnd just when you thought it couldn't get any better...it does.

Two sizes will take you from teeny-tiny (5 lbs) right through to potty training (35 lbs).\r\n•Slim fitting with multidirectional stretch - fabulous fit every time\r\n•Leak-proof design with adjustable legs and waist\r\n•Aplix fastening (like Velcro) - just as easy as a disposable diaper!\r\n•Hidden microfiber core and snap-in adjustable doubler increase absorbency and speed up drying time!\r\n•Fabric is durable and stays really soft, even when washing with hard water\r\n\r\nBamboo is miraculous and eco-friendly - a renewable resource with a very short growth cycle, it is grown without fertilizers or pesticides. A great environmental choice for diapers - the Bamboozle's fabric is also super absorent. Tests have shown that rayon from bamboo absorbs moisture 70% more quickly than cotton (on contact), and dries 20% faster.\r\n\r\nIn short, the BAMBOOZLE absorbs quickly and effectively, is comfortable for baby and not bulky under clothes!\r\n\r\nThe STRETCH BAMBOOZLE diaper pairs up nicely with the Super Whisper Wrap, Super Brite, Super Lite, Super Snap, or Pull-On.\r\n\r\nThis diaper will reach full absorbency after 10 washes, but it can be used after 2 washes. Wash in hot water and dry in the dryer. Line drying will extend the life of this diaper.\r\n\r\nThe Bamboozle is made by our friends at Tots Bots in Scotland.

Prefold cloth diapers are popular for their affordability and are the most common diaper supplied by cloth diaper services.   Though they don’t share all the bells and whistles as other more modern cloth diapers, they have their definite and permanent place in the industry and they have been proven dependable and economical.  \r\n\r\nHowever, Thirsties Duo Hemp Prefolds are no ordinary prefold!  We’ve solved many of the cons of prefold diapers in our patent-pending design.  Ordinary prefolds are bulky and take a long time to dry.  When hung to dry, they can become stiff and crunchy.  In addition, most prefolds are 8 layers thick in the middle, which makes it difficult to clean all layers of the diaper thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThirsties Duo Hemp Prefolds are designed to allow air flow and each panel is only 2 layers thick which allows for thorough cleansing with little effort and quick drying times.   Our custom hemp jersey is as soft as your favorite t-shirt and it knitted with love right here in the USA.  Hemp is an ideal diaper fabric as it displays anti-microbial properties, is many times more durable, and is more absorbent than cotton.  In fact, our hemp jersey is 25% more absorbent than a prefold of the same weight made from cotton alone!    This translates into a very trim and effective cloth diaper with a hefty amount of absorbing power.\r\n\r\nContent:         \r\n55% hemp/45% cotton\r\n Made in USA \r\n","options":[{"id":33699693,"name":"Size 1","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":33699696,"name":"Size 2 ","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/105635397/-/TDHP1-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/105635397/-/TDHP1-2.jpg","width":500,"height":335}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4891738,"name":"Cloth Diapers","permalink":"cloth-diapers","url":"/category/cloth-diapers"},{"id":4891753,"name":"Prefolds","permalink":"prefolds","url":"/category/prefolds"},{"id":5348379,"name":"Thirsties","permalink":"thirsties","url":"/category/thirsties"}]},{"id":10628995,"name":"Hemp Babies Bigger Weeds","permalink":"hemp-babies-bigger-weeds","position":78,"price":7.95,"default_price":7.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/hemp-babies-bigger-weeds","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-18T18:31:59.000Z","description":"Hemp Babies™ Bigger Weeds are made of hemp fleece composed of 55% Hemp, 45% Certified organic cotton, serged with natural thread and seamed to ease folding.

Flip open the pocket of the diaper and insert. Reverse the pocket opening and wrap diaper around baby.\r\n\r\nWhen adding to Thirsties Fab Fitted diapers, tuck the insert into your Thirsties Diaper Cover.

The BeautifulBASIC 2-Piece Cloth Diaper is an easy way to dive into the wonderful world of cloth diapering - trust us, it's easier than you think!\r\n\r\nIf you want to make cloth diapering even easier, add a Bio-Soft liner on top of the insert.

The adjustable rise of this wrap design means one size will last twice as long. In fact, only two sizes will cover your baby from birth all the way to potty-learning. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSimilar in feel to our best-selling Diaper Cover, Thirsties® Duo Wraps are completely waterproof yet remain breathable, pliable, and very comfortable for your baby’s delicate skin. Durable hook and loop closures provide a perfect and secure fit at every diaper change. All sizes offer convenient fold-over laundry tabs to protect your hook and loop closures from trapping lint in the wash. Thirsties Duo Wraps are also available with the option of durable snap closures in lieu of Aplix. Leg gussets provide advanced leak-proof protection and bindings are super-soft against baby skin. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThirsties® Duo Wraps are a result of more than six months of development and testing. This affordable wrap actually hatched as a one-size diaper cover. Logically, we thought a one-size diaper cover would be the most affordable option for the end-consumer. But what we actually discovered, no matter how many different cuts and protoypes we made, is that the 'one-size' options are too big on the average newborn and too small for most toddlers over 24 months of age. What this means is that the 'one-size' option truly only fits your baby properly when your he weighs between 10 lbs to 32 lbs. Alas, our findings confirm that the label 'one-size' diaper/cover simply does not live up to its claim. Most families purchasing a 'one size' cover would actually end up purchasing a newborn size, a 'one-size', and a toddler size: THREE sizes from birth to potty! Not ONE. Therefore, in the end, Thirsties® Duo Wraps are truly looking out for your wallet. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThirsties® Duo Wraps are a very trim fitting cover. They are the preferred wrap for trifolded prefold diapers and over trim fitted diapers, such as our Fab Fitted diapers.
