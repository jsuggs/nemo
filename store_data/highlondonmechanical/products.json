The front of this pendant boasts a mechanical design with an intriguing keyhole.  Flip it over and come face to face with a tiny robot in sleep mode.\r\n\r\nEach comes with a numbered users' manual that gives you a taste of the steamy, punkey world these robots come from, as well as original neo-victorian ad art.  The box itself is a work of art!\r\n\r\nThe robot also comes with an emergency shutdown key, just in case.  Keep it on your jacket, purse, backpack or on the chain with your robot.\r\n\r\nIn two variations to suit all persuasions!  The Ladies' Companion comes on a brass necklace chain, and the Gentlemens' Companion comes on a pocketwatch chain.  Replace your usual cosplay pocket watch with this little guy for extra flair.","options":[{"id":4340461,"name":"Ladies' Mechanical Companion","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4341851,"name":"Gentlemen's Mechanical Companion","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/10872621/-/BigCartel2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/10872621/-/BigCartel2.jpg","width":1000,"height":728}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":736341,"name":"Art Jewelry","permalink":"art-jewelry","url":"/category/art-jewelry"}]},{"id":1166791,"name":"Mechanical Companion Garage Kits","permalink":"mechanical-companion-garage-kits","position":4,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mechanical-companion-garage-kits","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-01-09T08:47:27.000Z","description":"Create your own custom Mechanical Companion with these ready-to-paint casts.

THIS BOOK IS A FAKE!\r\nYou won' learn anything from this so-called Self-Help Compendium. This is clearly just some smart-arse's idea of a joke.\r\n\r\nAlthough it's cover boasts that it will teach you all manner of spectacular things, it is only 60 pages long - the same size as a collection of Shakespeare's sonnets.\r\n\r\nIt's said that the author, Professor William Trumore, Ph.D. Esq. M.D. Ph.D., disappeared shortly after receiving his first royalty check from the book.  Readers were perplexed when, after a lengthy acknowledgments page, they were met with a book that had only one chapter, one page, one word: \"Cheat.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, upon reading Trumore's much-touted advice, you may be looking for other uses for this legendary book.  You might fill in the extra, blank pages with dirty limericks, or drawings of drunken leprechauns, or - as so many proud owners have - with curses on the name of William Trumore.\r\n\r\n(Hand-bound artist journal, 60 pages.)","options":[{"id":4341901,"name":"Green","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4342991,"name":"Orange","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4343001,"name":"Red","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/10865501/-/HTWAA_BigCartel.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/10865501/-/HTWAA_BigCartel.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":736471,"name":"Steampunkery","permalink":"steampunkery","url":"/category/steampunkery"}]}]
