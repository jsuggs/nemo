Datura causes intense hallucinations and an ability to seperate fantasy from reality.\r\n2. Toxicodendron Radicans (Poison Ivy) Probably the most well known on UK Soil, this nasty little plant causes a painful itchy rash and oozing blisters\r\n3.

Actaea Pachypoda (Dolls-Eyes) Don't be fooled by the rather sweet nickname, ingestion of these eye like berries can lead to cardiac arrest and even death\r\n7. SOLD\r\n8. Acokanthera Oblongifolia (Wintersweet) Traditionally used by African tribes as a virulent arrow poison. The berrys are sweet and tasty but the milky sap can kill a human very quickly.\r\n9. Brugmansia (Angels Trumpets) Effects of ingesting the seeds and leaves of this plant include muscle paralysis, hallucinations, cycloplegia and death.\r\n10.

There are 10 bees in total - 9 smaller worker bees (approx 2.5 inches in length) and one large Queen bee (approx 3.5\"). The worker bees will be up for $99 each and the Queen for $149. \r\n \r\nThese are the only bees that are being made - there will be no future series, it's a one off collaboration and so this is the only chance to grab one of these wooden delights.\r\n\r\nThe first 5 bees will be released Thursday 10th May. Please choose from the drop down menu which bee you would like (using main photo L-R) Daisy, Totem, Noctus, Dolly, Harley\r\n\r\nThe next 4 and the Queen will be available next Thursday the 17th May.\r\n\r\nSHIPPING:\r\nUK: 1st class Recorded\r\nUS/ AUSTRALIA / EUROPE (where available) / CANADA / BRAZIL / SWITZERLAND/ NEW ZEALAND / SINGAPORE / HONG KONG : AIRSURE\r\nREST OF WORLD : International signed for\r\n\r\nIf you would prefer a cheaper shipping option let me know and I will refund and send standard postage but then I cannot help if the parcel goes missing.\r\n","options":[{"id":19613957,"name":"Daisy","price":99.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19613959,"name":"Totem","price":99.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19613961,"name":"Noctus","price":99.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19613963,"name":"Dolly","price":99.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19613965,"name":"Harley","price":99.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60382911/-/photo_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60382911/-/photo_1.jpg","width":839,"height":380},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60382951/-/photo_1_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60382951/-/photo_1_2.jpg","width":553,"height":553},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60382967/-/photo_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60382967/-/photo_3.jpg","width":546,"height":546}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2686203,"name":"Toys","permalink":"toys","url":"/category/toys"}]},{"id":5436137,"name":"ROBOBEES : Series 3","permalink":"robobees-series-3","position":18,"price":85.0,"default_price":85.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/robobees-series-3","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-09T23:29:50.000Z","description":"These original resin sculpts by the super talented Cris Rose ( http://crisrose.co.uk ) were hand cast and then passed to me for painting and bringing to life.

He started off well performing his duties swiftly and accurately with a little 'beep-beep' each time a task was completed. As the days progressed, fellow workers noticed little changes in Robin. It began when his monotonous beep beeps started to change tone and form familiar festive tunes like Jingle Bells. Not long after that Robin started decorating himself with holly and fairylights, matching his own lights to their pretty twinkling colours. Days later Robin vanished - much to the dismay of his colleagues who had begun to enjoy their festive little robotic friend. Rumour has it a certain Mr Claus snapped him up to work in the North Pole Toy Factory where he happily works all day and night getting presents ready to be delivered on Christmas Eve.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\" handpainted 1/1 Cris Rose Resin Sprog \r\n\r\nP&P: \r\nUK - 1st class Recorded \r\nREST OF WORLD -standard international (Airsure available at extra cost please email littlemisslunabee at gmail dot com)","options":[{"id":16448663,"name":"Default","price":55.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49753641/-/robin.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49753641/-/robin.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49753657/-/robin2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49753657/-/robin2.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49753673/-/minis.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49753673/-/minis.jpg","width":800,"height":531}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2686203,"name":"Toys","permalink":"toys","url":"/category/toys"}]},{"id":4853691,"name":"The Woodland Warriors Dunny series","permalink":"the-woodland-warriors-dunny-series","position":20,"price":95.0,"default_price":95.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-woodland-warriors-dunny-series","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-15T16:29:20.000Z","description":"These 6 Woodland Creatures will be unleashed Tues 15th Nov 7pm London time.\r\n\r\nEach one is handsculpted and handpainted 3\" dunny that is completely unique, a one of a kind mini piece of art.\r\n\r\nPlease choose carefully from the drop down list to choose the dunny you want:\r\n\r\n1.
