Bread spread thick with golden butter and drizzled with a touch of honey. Bread with raspberry and blackberry jam fairly dripping from the crust. If anything reflects thousands of years of men and women cooking, it is bread.\r\n\r\nEven today, bread remains a staple. More than that, it is part of our traditions and memories. Bread is a volume of methods, heirloom recipes, and a sprinkling of our stories growing up around the oven and floured wooden countertops. It is to be enjoyed on the couch and used in the kitchen. A way for us to pass down the traditions handed to us and held so dear. \r\n\r\n<i><a href=\"mailto:mail@anchorfolk.com\">Contact us</a> for shipping rates outside the following countries: United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia.</i>\r\n\r\n76 pages, perfect bound, matte.

It has been a summer-long experience my whole life.
