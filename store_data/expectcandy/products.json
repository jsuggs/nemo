DOWNLOAD CODE\r\nEXC011\r\n\r\nRelease date: March 15, 2013\r\n\r\nPressing:\r\n372 copies on black vinyl\r\n100 copies on blue vinyl\r\n\r\nAfter more than ten years of guitar and vocal duties in All Girl Summer Fun Band (K Records, AGSFB Music), Kim Baxter wrote and co-produced her debut solo album, \"The Tale of Me and You\", with her husband, Chris Flanagan (Life at These Speeds). The pair played all the instruments on the album which was recorded in their home studio in Portland, Oregon. The album was self-released on CD (and digital download) in April 2012.\r\n\r\nBaxter is best known for her catchy, short and sweet pop song writing in All Girl Summer Fun Band, but on \"The Tale of Me and You\", she flexes her song writing muscles. The result is an album that is still fun and catchy but the songs are longer, the lyrics are deeper, and the instrumentation is layered and more dynamic. \"Flame Ball for Hire\" is quiet and intimate, \"The Afternoon\" is upbeat and poppy, while \"Intelligent Lovers\" is strong and driving. The songs are varied in their feel and texture but they come together to create a cohesive, unique and fun album.\r\n\r\nShortly after the release of the All Girl Summer Fun Band’s third album, \"Looking Into It\", the band decided to take a break from playing and recording. But with an arsenal of solo songs already written, Baxter decided it would be a perfect time to finish and release her first solo album. With the help of her husband she reviewed her collection of songs and selected ten of her favorites. These ten songs were then re-worked, re-structured, and re-recorded in order to create \"The Tale of Me and You\". Some of the original guitar solos that were recorded by Baxter years earlier were kept for their crunchy, rough basement recording sound. The rest of the album was rerecorded and mixed in Baxter and Flanagan's new home studio. Years of love and hard work went into these songs and it can be heard.\r\n\r\nThe German record label, Expect Candy, will be releasing the album on vinyl in March 2013. Kim and her band will travel to Europe for a two week tour in support of the vinyl release in April 2013.\r\n\r\n\"Baxter was the most noticeable voice in the wonderful Portland punk quartet All Girl Summer Fun Band. They never pushed too hard. On her first album under her own name, Baxter does. \"Oval Frame\" is Nirvana with radio distortion around the sides. \"Arc de Triomphe\", not that far from Freddy Cannon's \"Palisades Park\", is a celebration of an I'll-do-anything-for-you love that you know won't last, except in memory.” — Greil Marcus, The Believer (October 2012)\r\n\r\n\"Kim Baxter's The Tale of Me and You is nothing short of a musical marvel; smart, sophisticated indie rock that draws from The White Album to Doolittle and everything interesting in between. Ambitious in its various tones and textures, though consistently intimate, these ten tunes play like a best-of album. If there's any fairness left in the world, \"Devil On My Side\" would be blaring in record stores all summer long.\" — Joe Meno, author of Hairstyles of the Damned\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral info: If you want your order to be shipped to another country than Germany please see the \"Shipping\" info on the lower right hand side for additional information on shipping options.\r\n","options":[{"id":29202533,"name":"Black vinyl","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29202530,"name":"Blue vinyl","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91732406/-/EXC011_1200x1200.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91732406/-/EXC011_1200x1200.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91732598/-/DSC00567.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91732598/-/DSC00567.jpg","width":1000,"height":970},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91732874/-/20130131001354-kb_bluevinyl.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91732874/-/20130131001354-kb_bluevinyl.JPG","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":174062,"name":"Kim Baxter","permalink":"kim-baxter","url":"/artist/kim-baxter"}],"categories":[{"id":1849939,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":9515555,"name":"Expect Candy Vinyl Package (all 5 LPs!)","permalink":"expect-candy-vinyl-package-all-5-lps","position":2,"price":39.0,"default_price":39.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/expect-candy-vinyl-package-all-5-lps","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-02-16T10:57:11.000Z","description":"All our vinyl releases so far together for a very special price!

The latest release features 9 remixes by other artists and friends, and 1 remix by Arms and Sleepers themselves. Uzi & Ari, Lymbyc Systym, Amanda Rogers, Boy In Static/The Consulate General, The American Dollar, Nolens Volens, Thisquietarmy, Elika and Bigadiga all contribute and help create quite a diverse album, from snippets of R&B and club music to more mellow singer/songwriter moments to hypnotic electronica and trip hop-induced tracks. By the end of 44 minutes, it's clear that Matador Remixed is fully capable of standing on its own as a complete piece of music, independent of Matador and highlighting each of the artists' exceptional compositional skills. Every single track presents a unique and tasteful approach to song craft, making for a satisfying and complete listen from beginning to end. The feeling of nostalgia that is present throughout Matador still remains, but this time seen through quite a different lens – in fact, 10 different lenses each looking into quite a different direction.\r\n\r\nMatador Remixed is Arms and Sleepers' 11th release and the band's first remix album. It's also the 4th release in 6 months, a busy time period which has seen the band touring Europe and North America, completing a few remixes of their own, and putting out 4 releases including the second full-length album Matador, a split EP with The American Dollar From The Inland Sea, Matador Alternate Versions/B-Sides EP, and the aforementioned remix album. Arms and Sleepers return to Europe for a month-long tour in May, 2010 promoting this latest release.\r\n\r\nThe first 100 units come on beautiful clear transparent vinyl which is only available direct from Expect Candy.

Written and recorded throughout 2010 and early 2011, The Organ Hearts finds Max Lewis and Mirza Ramic collaborating once again with Ben Shepard (of Uzi & Ari) and Philip Jamieson (of Caspian).\r\n\r\nUnlike Matador, the band's sophomore effort, the new record features significantly less guitar and focuses more on electronics and drum-heavy compositions. Pulsing beats and driving synths replace the lush glockenspiels and melodicas of the previous album, while concise song structures and haunting melodies remain. Like Matador, the new record is intense, filled with varying textures and intricate layers, and unafraid to free itself of any genre constraints. The execution feels natural, showcasing the band's musical maturity developed over the past four years, 14 releases, and extensive touring.\r\n\r\nThe Organ Hearts is divided into three sections, much like the band's debut full-length album, Black Paris 86. Each part acts as a soundtrack for the ever changing daily and seasonal frames of mind, a cinematic reflection of our complex feelings and delicate emotions. In the end, the journey through the record embodies the opposing forces of our actual lives: excitement vs. anguish, clarity vs. confusion, satisfaction vs. longing. Acting collectively through the three sections, these 12 individual compositions paint an arresting picture encapsulating our life's variation and unbearable tenderness, but also evoking a sense of hopefulness that might be waiting around the corner. Nothing is certain, but not everything is lost. The album's poetic subtitle, then, seems to be quite appropriate: The Things That Make Me Feel Weak And Strange Get Engineered Away.\r\n\r\nThe Organ Hearts is Arms and Sleepers' 15th official release and is available worldwide via Expect Candy since 13 May 2011.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing\r\n01.

In an alleyway a man was bleeding with a cassette player in hand, the play button still on. What sounded like recordings of a gospel choir blared from the tin speaker while down the street, a jazz band could be heard. The man was dying. He dropped the cassette player on the cement and closed his eyes, the sound carrying through the air into his ears for one last time. Though this moment in time died with him, his cassette lived on - and Arms and Sleepers was born.\r\n\r\nWith the intention to keep the spirit and the music of this night alive, Max Lewis (programming, keyboards) and Mirza Ramic (bass, keyboards) founded Arms and Sleepers. With electronic sources being the main focus in their compositions, the two are nevertheless creating a warm sound with ambient undercurrents. Varying configurations of rich, brassy textures, choppy beats and ethereal vocals make up an overall yield that is an engaging, subterranean pulse driven by amorphous low-end frequencies. Overall the sound matches the intentional tragic tale.\r\n\r\nListening to \"Black Paris 86\" feels like sitting in a cinema, watching landscapes, beauty and tragedy. Feeling warm and safe while a hint of mystery seems to whisper that not everything is ok out there. The latter doesn't seem to be far fetched when Ramic talks about the band's name: \"For me, the meaning of Arms and Sleepers is the meaning of so much of the world today and in the past, and probably the future. While so many are fighting and killing (\"arms\"), others are ignoring it all (the \"sleepers\").\r\n\r\nThe live shows underline the cinematic experience. The duo's performance is combined with visuals by Dado Ramadani, a talented artist from Boston. The visuals, dealing with the subjects of the songs, are synchronized with the rhythm of each song. The collaboration between the band and Ramadani provides the audience with a full audio and visual experience.\r\n\r\n\"Black Paris 86\" is a tight, intense record, showing a young band at a stage you wouldn't expect it to be on yet. Connected to different kinds of music, from ambient-influenced indie rock to calm, sometimes hypnotic music with dozens of other styles flowing in, the album shows the development the band has made in the past year, resulting in a unique and original style.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing\r\n01.

Literary minstrel? The mythology has many permutations - decide for yourself.\r\nVague Angels is Chris Leo's current moniker. Fans of Chris Leo's former projects (The Lapse, Van Pelt, Native Nod) will recognize his distinct blend of verbosity and musical virtuosity on his new efforts. With strange lyrical narratives and dense arrangements, Vague Angels sound like the culmination of a style and sound that he's been developing for years.\r\n\r\nThough Chris dropped off the public radar for nearly five years after Southern's release of The Lapse's \"Heaven Ain't Happenin'\" LP in 2000, contrary to popular belief, he was not sitting idly by the jacuzzi with the gross of Crystal and ho's he'd accumulated from left over touring booty. In fact, he was busy working on novels and albums in tandem in the secrecy of Bolivia and Newark, New Jersey. The first novel, \"White Pigeons\", was originally released along with the album \"Truth Loved\" serving as Chapter 7 and performed by the book's fictitious band The Breaks, as played by Vague Angels. Seeing as all people see the same things differently and all things appear differently when seen at differing distances, the album \"Truth Loved\" is finally set free to be released on its own as its own. Rather than exist as a musical substory surrounded by a novel, perhaps some will feel it better suited as the premier story with the novel serving as rancid residue around it.\r\n\r\nYes, after two stripped down European and Statewide tours with little but himself and an acoustic guitar, Chris has decided to allow the songs of \"Truth Loved\" some breathing room from the text and stretch out as wide as they may choose to stretch.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing\r\n01. A Trinity Of Pairs\r\n02. Where Cherry Blossoms Breeze Past Lotus Leaves \r\n03. The Long, Coy Hue Of Steaming Emeralds\r\n04. Themepark Ashtray In Ashtray Themepark\r\n05. Secondhand Smoke\r\n06.

These are bands he'd toured with – a band from Barcelona, a band from Puglia, and a band from Brooklyn – and the songs congeal like these musicians have seen some nights together.\r\n\r\nSecondly, he finally feels comfortable with who he is, what he does, where his place here is. This allows the elements in each song to fall just where they're supposed to. These songs aren't forced, they sit comfortably in his discomfort; it's almost more disconcerting. But most startling we swear if you listen carefully you might actually hear him sing sometimes. That's right, sing. In fact, you may even hear a falsetto or two.

Tim said yes. Two years later, Tim refused to get in the car Sam had stolen from a Grateful Dead show, which as it turns out belonged to Owsley Stanley – the original purveyor of LSD to the hippies in Haight-Ashbury and creator of the Dead's \"Wall of Sound\". Friendship's a fickle thing and bands formed in friendship can be even more volatile, especially when some of those friends have been making music together for over a decade.\r\n\r\nWith their first musical project CAP’N JAZZ they became pioneers and protagonists of the sound that was called emo back then. Until today CAP’N JAZZ are considered one of the most remarkable and influential bands of that era.\r\n\r\nThe various other bands and projects Kinsella and Zurick played in since then had a much less straight approach mostly. Equally great and unique, bands like JOAN OF ARC were less loud, impetuous and spontaneous. Except for one: In 2004 Kinsella and Zurick released the first EP with their new band MAKE BELIEVE. Here it was again – youthful energy that reminds of spring, of first and last kisses. Exactly what made CAP’N JAZZ stand out. Tim Kinsella screamed again and the music was as raw as it was back in the 1990ies. Yet everything was different. With Tim’s cousin Nate Kinsella on keyboard and drums and Bobby Burg on bass MAKE BELIEVE featured two new steady members and as much as the bands early efforts reminded of CAP’N JAZZ the band felt too fresh and real to be considered just as a retro thing.\r\n\r\nSince then MAKE BELIEVE have grown, the enthusiasm of the beginning is naturally gone. Improved and complex, almost mathematic songwriting is their trademark nowadays and defines their style. Nevertheless their first songs are still as beautiful as they were in 2004. So far the first EP was only available on CD, apart from a limited to 250 vinyl edition released by Robert Lowe (90 Day Men) that was sold out right after its release and probably never made it to Europe. The two german labels Coraille and Expect Candy are now offering another chance for the vinyl lovers out there to get this first MAKE BELIEVE EP on vinyl. Yet again, it’s a limited edition, 500 copies will be made.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrack Listing\r\n01. We’re All Going To Die\r\n02. Britt’s Favorite\r\n03. Witchcraft\r\n04.

Gone are the banjo and pedal steel interludes, the erratic arrangements; gone are the sad sack lullabies and two minute strummers. Enter Mellotron drones, three part harmonies and at the core a rhythm section that still drives each narrative with a confidence to say that less is truly more. Somewhere Britt Daniel of Spoon just nodded.\r\n\r\nRecorded over five days at Seaside Lounge during a snow storm, the trio tapped an old friend in Aaron Prellwitz (Death Cab for Cutie, John Vanderslice, Mountain Goats, Mark Kozelek, Erase Errata) to help polish the edges of this once lo-fi conceit. What’s left is little regard for convention. Couched in a place where the bombastic folk of Bowie or early T. Rex gets smart, the nine tracks on Lake Effect are equal parts unique and obtuse, poetically indifferent and as plain as the Midwestern roots of the members themselves.\r\n\r\nFormed in early 2007, the then duo of Jason and Tim quietly released a five-song EP that at first blush sounded like John Darnielle fronting a drunken Bright Eyes. While not quite a cabin-in-Wisconsin success, the self-recorded EP nevertheless chronicled serious heartbreak, addiction, and a sudden move from San Francisco months before. Yet despite few expectations, the new trio with Michael’s input found a surprising balance (and noted buzz) between their DIY/punk pasts and the intimacy of the new aesthetic.\r\n\r\nMultiple tours followed, supporting the likes of Parenthetical Girls, WAVVES, White Rabbits, PWRFL Power, Karl Blau, Ghost Mice and Old Time Relijun that solidified a chameleon-like reputation as both an unhinged live band and three troubadours hauling a stage piano and homemade trap kit around the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral info: If you want your order to be shipped to another country than Germany please see the \"Shipping\" info on the lower right hand side for additional information on shipping options.","options":[{"id":11628276,"name":"CD","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.75,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":3.9,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/33525672/-/exc005.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/33525672/-/exc005.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":52871,"name":"Polite Sleeper","permalink":"polite-sleeper","url":"/artist/polite-sleeper"}],"categories":[{"id":1799841,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":9383831,"name":"Ef -

Moen\r\n\r\nOnly two years has passed since young IMMANU EL released their debut-album that was praised by a crowd of critics from all over the world. In this time the band have become one of the most touring independent bands in Sweden with 100 concerts in 20 countries and with a reputation as a glorious live act. From starting as totally self-driven on an underground level, IMMANU EL have stroked the world with an astonishing curiosity and a wide expectation for upcoming releases. In the summer of 2009 IMMANU EL went into the studio again to record their second album, and after a week of intense work and live takings the new record was complete. With captivating and moving melodies, mighty dynamics, forcing presence and with an unbelievable feeling, MOEN is without doubt one of the most interesting albums from the Swedish independent scene in a very long time. IMMANU EL here gives us a unique sound somewhere in between an attitude-driven pop music and a heartrendingly beautiful post rock, and they do it with a quality that will reach the whole world.\r\n\r\nLabel: Kapitän Platte\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n1.

This remains true with \"Dear God, I Hate Myself\" as it delivers a look at responsibility, fear, healing, and societal roles wrapped in rich gothic pop music. The sound is still distinctly Xiu Xiu, but Jamie Stewart's vocals are finally effortless paired with vibrant melodies full of subtlety and the distinct sonic accents expected of this anticipated Xiu Xiu release. The result is a record that proves that art can be pop and pop can challenge you to look inside yourself. Stewart is joined by new full-time band member Angela Seo on piano, synth, and drum programming; with production handled by Jamie and Deerhoof's Greg Saunier. Together they've crafted a fully-grown sound for \"Dear God, I Hate Myself\" with elements from Goth and pop that are expertly performed by a crop of brilliant musicians. \r\n\r\nSide A:\r\n\r\n    Gray Death\r\n    Chocolate Makes You Happy\r\n    Apple For A Brain\r\n    House Sparrow\r\n    Hyunhye's Theme\r\n    Dear God, I Hate Myself\r\n\r\nSide B:\r\n\r\n    Secret Motel\r\n    Falkland Rd.\r\n    The Fabrizio Palumbo Retaliation\r\n    Cumberland Gap\r\n    This Too Shall Pass Away (For Freddy)\r\n    Impossible Feeling\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral info: If you want your order to be shipped to another country than Germany please see the \"Shipping\" info on the lower right hand side for additional information on shipping options.","options":[{"id":21134835,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65242589/-/xiuxiu.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65242589/-/xiuxiu.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":57744,"name":"misc.","permalink":"misc","url":"/artist/misc"}],"categories":[{"id":1849939,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":6644375,"name":"Xiu Xiu - Daphny (Fuck The Police) 7\"","permalink":"xiu-xiu-daphny-fuck-the-police-7","position":23,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/xiu-xiu-daphny-fuck-the-police-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-08T13:35:14.000Z","description":"Polyvinyl 2011\r\ncolored vinyl\r\n\r\nThe newest XIU XIU 7\" features 1 original (\"daphny\") along with an earnest cover of the RIHANA hit, \"only girl (in the world)\".

Formed in 2006, they have produced multiple albums, EPs and hand-made releases, most notably the Bliss Was It In That Dawn To Be Alive EP (Fake Chapter, 2006) and the well-received Black Paris 86 (Expect Candy, 2008).\r\n\r\nFollowing an intense touring schedule in 2008 and 2009 that included appearances in the UK, Europe, and North America and saw the band opening for the likes of Asobi Seksu, The Books, Her Space Holiday, Cass McCombs, Lymbyc Systym, This Will Destroy You and Caspian, Max and Mirza took a break to focus on a new proper full-length in the summer of 2009. The result is Matador, featuring contributions from numerous musicians, including Tom Brosseau (Fat Cat Records), Shelley Short (Hush Records), Ben Shepard and Catherine Worsham (of Uzi & Ari), Philip Jamieson (of Caspian) and Mona Elliott (of Travels).\r\n\r\nMatador is an album studded with varying themes and textures. The synergy between a haunting sonic mix and delicate, ethereal lyrics yield an ambitious, precise whole. Maintaining consistent intensity and energy, the music and artwork both reflect the moodiness behind the concept of the album, which can be summarized as a reaction to the surroundings and circumstances Max and Mirza found themselves in throughout the past two years. Matador also finds the duo expanding on their sound, reaching for a new and fresh direction. Vocals are more prominent throughout the album than with previous releases, and the band ventures into new soundscapes, incorporating an expansive array of instruments.\r\n\r\nThe result is a cinematic and hypnagogic mix of rusts, antique grays and olive greens which evoke an eerie nostalgia – memories of places you’ve never been and things you’ve never seen.\r\n\r\nThe CD comes packed in a nice Digipak casing.","options":[{"id":10898061,"name":"CD","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.75,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":3.9,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/33525504/-/exc007.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/33525504/-/exc007.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":51489,"name":"Arms and Sleepers","permalink":"arms-and-sleepers","url":"/artist/arms-and-sleepers"}],"categories":[{"id":1799841,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
