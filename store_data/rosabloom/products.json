We recommend a 16\" chain, because if worn on a longer chain, the pendant is more likely to become tangled.\r\n\r\nPlease note - due to the nature of the materials, this piece is delicate. Avoid dropping or knocking it on hard surfaces, and handle the mechanism gently.  It is designed to be played with carefully, but will not withstand yanking!  Not suitable for children.","options":[{"id":50503455,"name":"Default","price":55.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.95,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":6.95,"amount_with_others":4.65}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129316281/-/49b.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129316281/-/49b.jpg","width":480,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129316272/-/49.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129316272/-/49.jpg","width":480,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129316284/-/49c.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129316284/-/49c.jpg","width":480,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129316290/-/box.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129316290/-/box.jpg","width":480,"height":640}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1664037,"name":"Jewellery","permalink":"jewellery","url":"/category/jewellery"},{"id":4066875,"name":"Jewellery - Kinetica Bloom","permalink":"jewellery-kinetica-bloom","url":"/category/jewellery-kinetica-bloom"}]},{"id":4878969,"name":"Beaded Cape - 'Emerald'","permalink":"beaded-cape-emerald","position":65,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/beaded-cape-emerald","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-18T17:58:27.000Z","description":"Crossing the borderline between jewellery and clothing, this stunning piece is made up of hundreds of strands of EMERALD GREEN glass beads, which give it a beautiful drape and movement when worn.
