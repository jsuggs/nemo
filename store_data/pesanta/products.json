Often described as, 'a thinkin' man's country music,' Munly's wide vocal range, from a low bass to a high soprano, on top of the Harlot's dark, often sensuous string arrangements make for a unique sound that remains long after the music stops. From the dirge-like despair of \"Jacob Dumb,\" the almost frenetic ditties like \"Of Silas Fauntleroy's Willingness to Impress the Panel\", to what seems to be a classic, \"Big Black Bull Comes Like A Caesar,\" the creative depth and range is at once challenging and invigorating.

However, this album is an indicator of quite the opposite, as if meditating on the peaks of Wreathes somehow gave them the perspective and inspiration they needed to further flesh out and fully realize the potential of Kinit Her. Full of tears, frights, goosebumps, shudders and trances, within Storm of Radiance the theater of Kinit Her unfolds around you in all directions. This is easily one of the most intricate and imaginative progressive folk albums to come out in the last thirty years. Join in as Kinit Her usher you through their ever-changing motifs of organic expression, bearing avalanches of anthemic strings, ceremonial drums and percussions, elliptical mantras derived from the cosmic writings of Klages and Schuler, living atmospheres radiating natural youth and brilliance. Everything about this album sounds simultaneously composed and spontaneous, both bare and eccentric, just perfectly raw. Considering their already lenghty discography as Kinit Her, their majestic opening gestures as the newly initiated Wreathes, and the fact that these two have also been involved with a slew of other projects over the last couple of years, (including Burial Hex, Rain Drinkers, Compass Hour, Circulation of Light, Devotion, Wormsblood, Spiral Joy Band, and The Second Family Band) the achievements of Storm of Radiance seem nothing less than miraculous.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pesanta Urfolk presentation features the album as a double 12\" displayed in a gatefold.

This edition also features a new color, glossy art section and extra material. \r\n\r\nQabalah, Qliphoth and Goetic Magic is a unique practical introduction to magic. The main thread of the book is the exploration of the Qliphoth and the dark mysteries which have for so long been a repressed part of western esotericism. Instead of ignoring and denying the dark side, the author reveals, step by step, how man can get to know his Shadow and, through this, reach a deeper knowledge of the Self. By exploring and not by repressing the Shadow it can be transformed from a destructive force into a creative power.\r\n\r\nThe book deals with the problem of evil, the symbolism behind the fall of Lucifer and man’s creation process according to Qabalistic philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe theories that are presented in this book are also linked to practice. Several examples of rituals, meditations, magical exercises and occult correspondences can be found within. Qabalah, Qliphoth and Goetic Magic contains more than one hundred demonic sigils and pieces of art that were created specifically for this book. A unique collection of all the sigils from the classic grimoires Lemegeton: The Lesser Key of Solomon and the infamous Grimorium Verum are also included.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE AUTHOR   \r\nThomas Karlsson has studied and practiced the occult sciences for more than fifteen years and is the founder of the esoteric order Dragon Rouge. He is Ph. D. in History of Religion and holds a M. A. in History of Ideas. Thomas Karlsson authored the book Uthark—Nightside of the Runes (Ouroboros Produktion, 2002) and gives seminars and lectures on a regular basis. \r\n","options":[{"id":48962214,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":11.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128169687/-/qbl3_cover_a442d595-ce39-42ac-a335-2757962d04da_1024x1024.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128169687/-/qbl3_cover_a442d595-ce39-42ac-a335-2757962d04da_1024x1024.jpg","width":384,"height":580}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1637718,"name":"Merch","permalink":"merch","url":"/category/merch"},{"id":1784139,"name":"Distro","permalink":"distro","url":"/category/distro"},{"id":6379287,"name":"New","permalink":"new","url":"/category/new"}]},{"id":15078555,"name":"PROPAGANDA AND HOLY WRIT book","permalink":"propaganda-and-holy-writ-book","position":59,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/propaganda-and-holy-writ-book","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-25T02:05:57.000Z","description":"PROPAGANDA AND HOLY WRIT OF THE PROCESS CHURCH OF THE FINAL JUDGEMENT\r\nSex Issue • Fear Issue • Death Issue\r\n\r\nAlso featuring:\r\nThe Gods on War in text and read by\r\nGenesis Breyer P-Orridge, Lydia Lunch,\r\nAdam Parfrey and Timothy Wyllie.\r\n\r\nTo follow up on the Feral House release, Love Sex Fear Death: The Inside Story of The Process Church of The Final Judgment, written by Timothy Wyllie, here are full color reproductions of the Process Church’s notorious and rare thematic magazines, all boldly imaginative and decades ahead of their time.

With respect to the latter, the original master tapes were mined for music that had not been heard by anyone in nearly three decades. \r\n\r\nThe newly unearthed recordings were then restored, cleaned up and combined with those previously released to make the anthology as complete as possible. The compositions that comprise the Suite are sequenced in an order that tells a story, after a fashion. It is a story that may be impossible to tell in a strictly literary manner, one that -- like a mirrors reflection into another -- is both personal and allegorical. \r\n\r\nA complete anthology of the recordings made for the Lucifer Rising motion picture soundtrack by Bobby Beausoleil with The Freedom Orchestra and The Magick Powerhouse Of Oz. \r\n\r\nThis fully authorized and definitive release will include: \r\n- Remastered recordings spanning 11 years, from the 67 recording to the Tracy Prison recordings of 78. \r\n- 4 full-length LPs worth of Lucifer Rising material with half being never-before-heard sessions personally selected by Bobby BeauSoleil. \r\n- 9 new pieces of art from Bobby: 8 record sleeve panels and one 2' x 3' poster. \r\n- 2 posters: one by Bobby BeauSoleil and one by Dennis Dread. \r\n- A much-extended version of the Fallen Angel Blues piece by Bobby that originally appeared in the Kenneth Anger DVD set. \r\n- Hymns to the Solar Temple - impressions on a visit to Bobby at the Oregon Correctional Facility in Pendleton, Oregon by Dennis Dread. \r\n- The Saga of a Soundtrack by Michael Moynihan. \r\n- Art from Dennis Dread for the front lid of the box which will provide a window into the works of Bobbys to be found within, one piece of which is included as a 2' x 2' poster\r\n- Remastered by Robert Ferbrache, well known for his work with Blood Axis, 16 Horsepower and others. All art has been created specifically for this release.\r\n\r\nAnd, this third edition comes on colored vinyl. Each vinyl color scheme was personally chosen by Bobby to correspond to the art related to the jackets and center labels for each respective disc.

Join in as Kinit Her usher you through their ever-changing motifs of organic expression, bearing avalanches of anthemic strings, ceremonial drums and percussions, elliptical mantras derived from the cosmic writings of Klages and Schuler, living atmospheres radiating natural youth and brilliance. Everything about this album sounds simultaneously composed and spontaneous, both bare and eccentric, just perfectly raw. Considering their already lenghty discography as Kinit Her, their majestic opening gestures as the newly initiated Wreathes, and the fact that these two have also been involved with a slew of other projects over the last couple of years, (including Burial Hex, Rain Drinkers, Compass Hour, Circulation of Light, Devotion, Wormsblood, Spiral Joy Band, and The Second Family Band) the achievements of Storm of Radiance seem nothing less than miraculous. Pesanta Urfolk will publish a 2xLP edition of the album in December; featuring much larger renderings of the stunning cover illustrations by the celebrated hand of Denis Forkas Kostromitin.","options":[{"id":25723479,"name":"Default","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/80175189/-/MYST008Digipack_original.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/80175189/-/MYST008Digipack_original.jpg","width":737,"height":681},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/80175309/-/DSC_0202_original.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/80175309/-/DSC_0202_original.jpg","width":1000,"height":444}],"artists":[{"id":143725,"name":"Kinit Her","permalink":"kinit-her","url":"/artist/kinit-her"}],"categories":[{"id":1784139,"name":"Distro","permalink":"distro","url":"/category/distro"}]},{"id":8155185,"name":"WREATHES | CD","permalink":"wreathes-cd","position":75,"price":11.0,"default_price":11.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wreathes-cd","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-23T08:38:25.000Z","description":"Distro Item: Brave Mysteries\r\n\r\nThis disc captures and reissues the entire output to date of the magnificent Perennialist Pop outfit Wreathes; by uniting their self-titled album (a gorgeous gatefold LP released by Pesanta Urfolk earlier in 2012) and their debut 7\" single \"The Reigns\" b/w \"Full Turn\" (from 2011, on Bathetic Records). The Wreathes full length LP, already hailed in some circles as the best neofolk album of 2012, seems so much more than what can fit within the limitations of the term neofolk. What one is really presented with here is an incredibly thoughtful, original and unpredictable folk rock album, augmented by elements of ancient and early musics and a fantastically martial sense of rhythm. Aside from the monumental talents of Troy Schafer and Nathaniel Ritter, this album also features guest appearances from Dani Dahlke (Devotion, Silt of the Sphynx's Tor, Kinit Her) and Clay Ruby (Burial Hex). For those of you unfamiliar with Wreathes, the duo of Ritter and Schafer started their dark musical intimacy long ago with a preceding band, the well-beloved Kinit Her. We have been captivated by Kinit Her for many years, as they progressed from mere flurries of primitive forest hymns into billowing gusts of advanced musical ceremony. Now Wreathes has climbed to a triumphant peak within this same architecture. In fact, this easily could be the duo's most profound and holistic working to date. Witness these young masters harness their personal demons and exploit their supernatural earnings in a maelstrom of pounding martial percussion, catchy guitar hooks, vibrant horn arrangements, and the commanding presence of their voices ever locked in the soaring harmonies of arcanum.

Though still having a similar depth of vision and spiritual, or even supernatural, dimensions, Circulation of Light does not rely as much on acoustic instruments, or even on musicality, as his other projects. Thus it is fitting that this album is branded with the title of \"Acheiropoieta\", which translates from Byzantine Greek as \"made without hands\".\" Previous output under Ritter's solo banner has involved a very meditative and ritualistic approach to capturing specific times and places within his memory. This older material was often personal to the point of being oblique, which is where Acheiropoeita makes an about-face and confronts the listener head on. This is glowing darkwave chamber music, flush with Ritter's cryptic vocals (which may sound comfortingly familiar to fans of Kinit Her and Wreathes), and oceanic atmospheres made with bells, gongs, pianos, organs, synths, woodwinds, dulcimer and other simple strings, all steeped in decadent reverb like the eternal echos of inner cathedrals. Still, through this near alien veil, the careful listener can gather up melody and song from the elegant polyrhythms of tone which congeal as if only to gather in support of the layers of tenderly intoned mantra and Reverend Ritter's otherworldly choir of responsive congregant voices. Baroque arpeggios and cosmic synth washes over you as you feel the intention of this music, deepened by the influence of ancient Taoist manuscripts, the lyrics and relaxed resolve of the proceedings reassure you, and with words and voice both strong and fragile, the message penetrates you as twin poetry simultaneously offering a warning to forget about the future and the keys to perfection in the now.

Founded on a steady bed of purely campfire instrumentation, these anthemic songs shift and shake underneath a small choir of witchy yet harmonious female voices which perfectly compliment the subdued and mournful variety of male voices. All of these lovely singers are further offset by the occasional otherworldly demon call or shadowy whisper, making for a uniquely dynamic flow through nine original and fantastic hymns. Though equally taken by the natural appeal of certain European influences, Black Light clearly exhibit a sturdy progressiveness shielding their weary colonial prison soul, which makes them another fine example of a specifically American voice within the modern Neofolk scene.\r\n\r\nEITARNORA | MURMURATIONS | C42\r\nChicago's Eitarnora have been pouring out tiny pools of inspired, improvised Americana since 2009. \r\nMade up of two outstanding young musicians, multi-instrumentalist and vocalist Val Dorr and his companion, the classical guitar virtuoso Jon Rosenthal. Rosenthal's playing is a evocative river of lyrical tranquility, moving constantly in the seemingly thoughtful phrases of a woebegone troubadour, while Dorr simultaneously pushes Rosenthal with a pulsing undercurrent of various instrumentation, while also following him in a gorgeously mournful falsetto lead vocal. Despite their current urban station, this duo seems to be staring intently out the window, painfully yearning for communion with the ancient expanse of our midwestern homeland as it speeds past us at 65mph. Not unlike a more centered take on the post-industrial animist folkways of the Jewelled Antler Collective, who created similar organic fantasy within the seething metropolis of San Francisco. Eitarnora have constructed their own transcendent mythology and musical pathworking which inspire both themselves and the listener along the crooked ways to ones own astral temple, where a certain natural harmony can be realized, no matter what your surroundings may be.\r\n\r\nKIRSCHSTEIN | S/T | C58\r\nAfter eight years in the making, the album Kirschstein is an extremely rare manifestation. This is a heroic musical collaboration between a multitude of unusual characters, originally started in Essen, Germany, in 2003. Kirschstein features a small circle of kindred spirits hidden throughout Europe, many of whom seem to wish to remain in the shadows, and these songs were slowly assembled from a combination of free jam sessions and long-distance collaborations. Aside from these mysterious types, there is also the unmistakable contributions of such amazing artists as Demian (aka Ô Paradis) and Flavio Rivabella (aka Der Bekannte Post-Industrielle Trompeter). Not to mention there is even involvement from some of our dear friends within the secretive and austere netherworld of the Franconian Underground, so far only expressed in the scarce works of Brannten Schnüre and Agnes Beil. Now, given the taste for this kind of music is neurotically specific, it is difficult to accurately describe how this album actually sounds. Let's start by saying that it would perfectly on the shelf next to anything by other post-industrialists like Nový Svět, Art Abscons, Wermut, Mushroom's Patience, Hirsche Nicht Aufs Sofa, or the great Prog outsiders like Robert Wyatt and Franco Battiato, or other examples of Germany's own eclectic psychedelic heritage of Krautrock like Amon Düül and Can. No matter whether those names mean anything to you or not, simply stated: this album is a hallucinogenic masterpiece. It's collection of songs come rushing past you in a hyper collage made using multiples of song and scene, motifs and languages, vision and fancy. It is as if any one detail might be completely meaningless, yet the profundity of their cohesion makes them all essential and inspired. Keep close listen or you will miss subtle steps (and sometimes garish leaps) between bouts of \"bizarro world\" bundeswehr, freewheeling krautrock, symbolist dreamscapes, rural folk reflections, catholic cabaret, kosmische meditations, erotic melancholia and maloche pop.\r\n\r\nEMME YA | EROTOGNOSIS (VOICES FROM THE VOID) | C40\r\n[Ltd. 100 Damballah Blue on Blood Sea] \r\nFollow-up to his debut on Cold Spring Records, Colombian FR Kerval is brewing a dynamic cauldron of maddening post-voodoo intoxicants, rank with the hallucinatory memory of sex magic trance, detached and traveling the void of mystic star systems, while drawing out the double solar miracle mambo inside of us all.\r\n\r\nLIGHTNING PATH | ASPIRE-{2}-YUGGOTH | C49\r\n[Ltd. 100 Vericose on Sun] \r\nRaw recordings of barbaric jubilee from little-known occult research unit in Columbus, Ohio. Thus far Lightning Path have only released a small preview of their sonic results to La Societe Voudon Gnostique. However, Brave Mysteries has now published a proper full length album, collecting sounds from a wide variety of Shamanic and Voudon Gnostic Thaumaturgy sessions.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND FAMILY BAND | TWELFTH NIGHT REUNION | C70\r\n[Ltd. 100 Lucite on Amethyst] \r\nMany of our chronic listeners know well who the Second Family Band is, at least in name and reputation. The Second Family Band is a leaderless collective of improvising musicians, based out of Madison Wisconsin. What unites this group is the shared background of meeting and playing together in improv units around southern Wisconsin, between the late 90s and the grand jubilee of Pasture Music Festival in 2004. All members of Second Family Band have once been or are intimately related to members of The Davenport Family, Drunjus, The Grass Magic, Zodiac Mountain, All Do Gather, Organon, Candiru, A Mercury Ensemble, The Midwestern Mudslide Hootenanny and Free Pentecostal Family Jams, Outlet, Jesus Balls, Maths Balance Volumes, Mirror Man and th' Oshun Oxtra, as well as dozens of unnamed gatherings and lost memories. The Family does have a completely free improv policy, and their sessions have a very open community vibe about them, though this hardly makes them accessible to outsiders. Since most of the regular members cut their improvising skills in this brilliant flood of psychedelic improv units that flourished through Wisconsin at the time, the musicians of Second Family Band find themselves in a uniquely exclusive reality where this music is tread on intricately cut local paths and it's elementals are speaking only in the familial tongue. The oldest members of Second Family have learned from nearly fifteen years of jamming like this, that the more intimate and old the association of the people in a Second Family jamming unit at any one point, the stronger their psychic musicianship bond together, thereby manifesting a clearer portrait from which we can understand the highly organic order of the forms within Second Family's unique structure. This is a paradox of the Second Family Band, highly misunderstood from both those without and within. What is not mysterious is that the Second Family exists much like any other family. Despite having a never-ending pile of memories to sift through, it always seems that the best moments are never really captured. Despite knowing eachother better than anyone else on earth, there is still all the more room for miscommunication. Despite being together all the time, it is so easy to be too stuck inside your own head and completely out of tune with the rest of the house. So many familiar problems mount in such situations that it is easy for the music to implode more often that not. Yet this same tense and personal territory is also exactly where some of the most brilliant magic is born. We are so thankful that Brave Mysteries has so often been blessed with recordings that exhibit Second Family Band at the height of their paranormal potential. There recordings seek to show the public what happens when the Second Family Band have the focus and energy to rise together and lift eachother up to play this music in true harmony. Last season we were able to present the enchanting Veiled Gallery cassette and now we here have the honor of presenting Twlefth Night Reunion, a collection of vivid recordings from the Winter of 2010, culminating in the miraculous Twelfth Night Reunion party on New Years Eve; an exciting annual party that hosts as many of that eldest family members that can be gathered in this area.\r\n\r\nBURIAL HEX | ESCHATOLOGY II | C60","options":[{"id":25724205,"name":"BLACK LIGHT | S/T | C30  ","price":5.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25724208,"name":"EITARNORA | MURMURATIONS | C42 ","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25724211,"name":"KIRSCHSTEIN | S/T | C58","price":5.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25724214,"name":"EMME YA | EROTOGNOSIS (VOICES FROM THE VOID) | C40","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25724217,"name":"LIGHTNING PATH | ASPIRE-{2}-YUGGOTH | C49","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25724220,"name":"THE SECOND FAMILY BAND | TWELFTH NIGHT REUNION | C70","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25724223,"name":"BURIAL HEX | ESCHATOLOGY II | C60","price":5.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.25,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/80175597/-/IMG_0179.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/80175597/-/IMG_0179.JPG","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[{"id":111477,"name":"Wreathes","permalink":"wreathes","url":"/artist/wreathes"},{"id":143725,"name":"Kinit Her","permalink":"kinit-her","url":"/artist/kinit-her"}],"categories":[]},{"id":8155125,"name":"BRAVE MYSTERIES | LPS","permalink":"brave-mysteries-lps","position":79,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/brave-mysteries-lps","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-23T08:32:51.000Z","description":"BURIAL HEX | BOOK OF DELUSIONS | LP\r\n[Ltd. 250 on 150G Black Vinyl] \r\nDuring the period in which Clay Ruby first began working on this piece of art, he had become so completely surrounded by evil and deception that he was forced to begin summoning a particularly extreme and ancient force of protection and vitality just to make it alive through the end of 2008. Aside from spiritually fortifying Ruby's life, the complexities of these new elemental entities brought with them circumstances causing a much more rich and intense recording experience than he could have ever composed on his own. Since then, it seems that the world at large, and the art scene in particular, may have become even more self-destructive, nihilistic and pathetic as ever. In this context, we fear that much of the true aesthetic and spiritual content of this album could certainly be lost on many of it's listeners; or even worse, it could take root and potentially cause damage to the lives of those who come into contact with it. Over the course of the three years it took to compose and record this album, at least six different record labels have offered to release this album, and over the course of these years, all of those labels have either gone bankrupt or rendered themselves completely irrelevant. Though we dearly adore this highly detailed and inspired music, Brave Mysteries hesitates to have anything to do with the release of this record, because it is most certainly cursed. The lives that have been shaken and ruined because of it, whether directly or even subtlety, is already far too many. Clay Ruby has vehemently refused to offer any commentary on the biographical, conceptual or musical details about this album; stating only that \"By the time you sell your last copy of this record, I will surely be dead.\" Our reactions to the harrowing darkness of this music and the ominous and fateful attitude of it's composer have left us at a total loss about how to proceed. All we can do is offer this landmark album to the public and pray for the lives of all who come in contact with it.\r\nWrapped in some of the most gorgeous artwork to have come out of the Harvest Abbey in Madison, WI. Exclusively limited to 250 copies, all orders come with a 12x12\" poster flat.\r\n\r\nPWIN ▲▲ TEAKS | AOXOMOXOA | LP\r\n[Ltd. 250 on 150G Black Vinyl] \r\nMost souls interested in modern underground music have already heard about Mater Suspiria Vision; whether through his breathtaking video output or his brooding dance mixes that all seem to go viral within mere hours of their release. Cosmas De Xam, director, composer, musician and multimedia guru has in recent years saturated the internet with his freakish videos, movies and multiple recording projects. He is also the mastermind behind the prolific Phatasma Disques imprint label, which releases CDX recordings and those of like-minded artists and friends, on very limited edition cdrs; all wrapped in his own fetishistic handmade collage art with Japanese obi-strips. His works are about fanaticism, psychedelia, mystery, nostalgia, drugs, magic; and very, very beautiful women. One of the first of his many highly-publicized obsessions was with Laura Palmer and the Twin Peaks television series. This deadly muse compelled Cosmas to release a two cdr compilations (Phantasma Disques' \"A Witch House & Okkult Guide to Twin Peaks\" volumes 1& 2), as well as some mesmerizing videos and a mysterious cdr titled \"Inside the Black Lodge\", under the name PWIN ▲▲ TEAKS. \"Aoxomoxa\" is the follow-up album to this first PWIN ▲▲ TEAKS release. Taking cues from progressive rascals like Nurse With Wound and German oddballs HNAS, Zweistein and Eroc, the music of PWIN ▲▲ TEAKS twists and turns like a kaleidoscopic reptilian nightmare, inducing a torrent of hallucinatory nausea not heard since the early solo tapes of James Ferraro. This vinyl is not only essential for being the only relic of PWIN ▲▲ TEAKS (and one of the very few in CDX's overall discography) to be released on wax, but this particular record seems to represent a pivotal moment in CDX's compositional styles. Since this work was finished, the trajectory of Mater Suspiria Vision has shifted from heavily screwed beats and zombie rave music into a continued refining of this very personal style of hypnagogic revelry, first explored through the PWIN ▲▲ TEAKS project. Though the \"Witch House\" kids may not appreciate or understand the cerebral and abstract direction of his current music, at least all his artwork and videos still have no shortage of Technicolor sex kittens and witchy euro femme fatales galore.\r\n\r\nRAIN DRINKERS | YESODIC HELICES | LP\r\n[Ltd. 250 on 150G Black Vinyl] \r\nRain Drinkers consists of two long-time Madison folks, but yet none of us have any real contact with either of them and they have never played live. Xavier Kraal (aka Troy Schafer in one of his numerous musical disguises) has moved out to the country, withdrawing into family life and a myriad of solo projects and many collaborations )including Kinit Her, Compass Hour, Wreathes, Spiral Joy Band, Pelt, Burial Hex, Wormsblood, and many more). Joe Taylor musically focuses exclusively on Rain Drinkers and, though he has lived in the Madison area for many years now, none but Kraal have actually met him. Rain Drinkers also consistently credits the Creative Spirit as a third member of their line-up for all of their releases. Regardless of what sounds the Creative Spirit is actually contributing, both Kraal and Taylor are such talented multi-instrumentalists, it is impossible to distinguish which of them is playing what parts and, often the arrangements are so organically entangled, it becomes difficult to determine what the instrumentation might be in any given movement. Much like their amazing 2011 release Urthen Web, Yesodic Helices flows in an out of a wide variety of tone poems. Musically they bring to mind artists who tend to create their own visionary worlds with a classic sense of depth and dynamics, such as Ennio Morricone, Sun Ra, Iasos, Moondog, Popol Vuh or modern characters like Cyclobe, James Ferraro or Ulver. The essence of Rain Drinkers also clearly bears the mark of their own Xavier Kraal, who graces all his projects with an inimitable musical signature. We don't know where these sessions were recorded or how, but the band always features themselves on the cover of their releases, in various stark settings around rural Wisconsin, exposing themselves only to the excellent black and white portraiture of photographer Dani Dahlke. Their oblique gaze and anachronistic looks further plunge the imagination into mania. Luckily the music itself is not so intangible. The Rain Drinkers music is made with a heady passion that keeps them moving forward, continuously expanding their pallet of sounds and stylistic touchstones. Yet, no matter how adventurous or exciting the musical terrain may be, the listener remains safely strapped in and always guided along by a familiar and benevolent presence. This angel journeyman, alive within the music of Rain Drinkers, are surely the results of a special transmutation that occurs between these two intense and sincere old souls, and it is surely what they are acknowledging when crediting The Creative Spirit as a third unique member of their private ensemble.","options":[{"id":25724466,"name":"BURIAL HEX | BOOK OF DELUSIONS | LP ","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25724469,"name":"PWIN ▲▲ TEAKS | AOXOMOXOA | LP","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":25724472,"name":"RAIN DRINKERS | YESODIC HELICES | LP","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":16.5,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":21.75,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.5,"amount_with_others":12.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/80178525/-/R-3202347-1320278897_original.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/80178525/-/R-3202347-1320278897_original.jpeg","width":600,"height":612},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/80178537/-/R-3307826-1325074301_original.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/80178537/-/R-3307826-1325074301_original.jpeg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/80178549/-/raindrinkers_original.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/80178549/-/raindrinkers_original.jpeg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":5177351,"name":"Distro: Anima Arctica - Key, Pyhä Kuolema, Virta","permalink":"distro-anima-arctica-key-pyha-kuolema-virta","position":80,"price":17.0,"default_price":17.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/distro-anima-arctica-key-pyha-kuolema-virta","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-01-03T21:21:04.000Z","description":"Pesanta Urfolk is happy to carry selected Anima Arctica release - Listen to selected songs from various Anima Arctica releases here: <a href=\"http://www.animaarctica.fi/index.php?pid=3\">Anima Arctica Radio</a>\r\n\r\n<b>KEY - Silver Moon Slumber</B>\r\n\r\nHailing from the cold but beautiful climes of Finland, Key are purveyors of dreamy and evocative neofolk. Their new release Silver Moon Slumber is a beautiful album, at once trancelike and atmospheric. Loaded with unique groove, and resonant with inflections from New Wave, this release conjures cold but joyous landscapes in the mind’s ear.\r\n\r\nMusically, the album’s architecture is built around jangling acoustic guitars, expressive basswork, and fluid drumming. Resonant and eerie vocals provide the direction for the music, which is also traced by the occasional support instrument such as chimes or fiddle.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements are sparse and hang together perfectly. The whole album has a supple momentum, the drums and guitars driving things along at a solid, albeit not frantic, tempo. The main source of melody tends to be provided by the bass work, which is very expressive and tasteful. Being a bass aficionado, this was right up my alley.\r\n\r\nThe combination of somnolent vocals, flowing drums, prominent bass, and jangling (if acoustic) guitars combine to intimate the feeling of New Wave bands from the early 1980’s, albeit presented within a more languid folk context. Key shares this influence with American neofolk outfit Cult of Youth, and both bands profit greatly from such fertile cross-pollination. This emerging direction in neofolk is very promising.\r\nThere’s something almost innocent or childlike about this album. It draws the listener down into a subconscious zone of awareness, deep and almost whimsical. The lyrics evoke naturalistic horizons and mysterious secrets, perfectly suited to the music. All of the elements combine to lead the listener into reverie and moments of animistic grace.\r\n\r\nKey are gloomy, and at times heavy in that particularly Finnish folk music way; but they are also playful and uplifting. I think this combination of moods is quite an achievement, and I can happily recommend Silver Moon Slumber to anyone who has the slightest liking for folk music. I hope we’ll be hearing more from this very talented ensemble!\r\n\r\nReview by Henry Lauer - <a href=\"http://hexmagazine.com/music-reviews/review-silver-moon-slumber-key/\">HEX Magazine</a> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Pyhä Kuolema - Saavun vaikken kulkisi</b>\r\n\r\nPyhä Kuolema is a solo project of Mikko Pöyhönen. It was founded a while after the neofolk-duo Tuhat Kuolemaa Sekunnissa decided to quit. The ruins of Tuhat Kuolemaa Sekunnissa left behind were still smoking when something new, beautiful and fresh started already grow from there. The death of the duo Tuhat Kuolemaa Sekunnissa was also the birth of Pyhä Kuolema - a birth of  an extremely intimate, emotional, personal, and spiritual solo-project.\r\n                Traditional to the bone, but still clearly finding it’s own sound despite the classic  ”man+guitar” approach, Pyhä Kuolema debut album ”Saavun vaikken kulkisi” brings forth a dozen of atmospheric, national romantic, extremely emotional and personal songs sung in Finnish. The style of playing and singing varies from solemn ritualistic neofolk-songs to troubadur-like playful approach to traditional folk.                \r\n                Despite the fact that he is also a quarter of the neofolk-lounge band MAA, and half of the gloomy neofolk and freezing ritual music duo Tervahäät, he is still driven by so such a great urge to create, that new songs for Pyhä Kuolema are found frequently. He composed, sung, played, recorded and mixed the whole album by himself, giving it the intimate touch and manages the handling of the double edged sword that this kind of folk can be – the  sometimes even rough and stripped down output with no gimmicks is this time succesfully shaking hands with the alluring soft intensity.\r\n\r\n<b>Virta - Elon syvä lempi</b>\r\n\r\nVirta is the channel of the musical ambitions of Santtu Forsström hailing from Kristiinankaupunki - alluring small town located at the beautiful West Coast of Finland. This nature-praising and original music draws its influences from folk and progressive folk-rock, and the music of five tracks of this fourty-minute album is woven together with drums, percussions, lively bass, acoustic guitars and woodwind instruments.\r\n\r\n   Skillful instrumentation and the progressive elements and song structures create an atmosphere that is at the same time sophisticated and primitively vigorous. \"Elon syvä lempi\" is rich in nuances, and full of feeling of longing and ethereal calmness. Combined with the ever-present feeling of the element of unpredictability the album truly bears resemblances to the streams and rivers of the North. The calm waters under thin ice can suddenly form a stream and powerful river might abruptly give away it's power, and rest for a while in a form of pond smooth as glass and evaporate slowly just to reincarnate in a from of a strom cloud to the horizon. \"Elon syvä lempi\" was released 12.12. (1st press 400 pc.) and contains artwork of Samuli Kontio and Eva-Maria Aitsam.\r\n\r\nsamples: http://www.animaarctica.fi/index.php?pid=3","options":[{"id":16800289,"name":"Key - Silver Moon Slumber","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16800291,"name":"Pyhä Kuolema - Saavun vaikken kulkisi","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16800293,"name":"Virta - Elon syvä lempi","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.25}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50841249/-/key.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50841249/-/key.jpeg","width":400,"height":400},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50841289/-/PK_svek.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50841289/-/PK_svek.jpg","width":600,"height":595},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50841297/-/cover-AUER010.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50841297/-/cover-AUER010.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1784139,"name":"Distro","permalink":"distro","url":"/category/distro"}]},{"id":3065767,"name":"V/A - Oak Folk, Ahnstern","permalink":"v-a-oak-folk-ahnstern","position":81,"price":14.5,"default_price":14.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/v-a-oak-folk-ahnstern","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-12-27T07:07:03.000Z","description":"CD in 6-side digipack / Ahnstern / AORTA\r\n\r\nOak Folk is a CD anthology compiled by Gerhard Hallstatt from ALLERSEELEN with exclusive contributions by numerous European and North American groups who have one thing in common: a close connection to nature, to trees and woods.
