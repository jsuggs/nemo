I won’t like you if you don’t like me. I’ll hate you if you hate me. I’ll love you if you love me, but then maybe again I won’t, as love rarely follows any kind of rules.\r\n\r\nUrban gritty fairytale inspirational love story. Self harm or Love? Addiction or Recovery?\r\n\r\nGabe is not a hero, he is damned to be different in a world where everyone seems to want to be the same. His friends are damned too. Damned to lives unpredictable, though a life of crime, sex and drugs is calling. But Gabe has dreams of better things and a secret that is so shameful, it is killing him. \r\n\r\nBorn Different is inspirational for young adults that wouldn't read inspirational books. Facing head on and at full speed; depression, addiction, self harm, alcoholism, suicide and all other issues that adults, old or young, face. Born different questions authority, society, morality and the universe.\r\n\r\nAll wrapped up in a modern urban fairytale like love story that takes you to the edge and back again. You might like it, it might just open your mind, it might just help you realise what you have to change.\r\n\r\n\"Born Different is inspiring. It is as edgy and real as it is fairytale. It touches on many of the modern day ills in a supposed civilized society. Breakdown of families, addiction, domestic violence, alcoholism, self harm, the disillusionment with it all; with authority. And the passion and hope within us all for a better future.\"","options":[{"id":40118451,"name":"Default","price":1.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121902867/-/born_different.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121902867/-/born_different.jpg","width":141,"height":200}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2132222,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":4393967,"name":"Born Different Paperback","permalink":"born-different","position":3,"price":7.99,"default_price":7.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/born-different","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-09-07T08:36:09.000Z","description":"I’ll like you if you like me.
