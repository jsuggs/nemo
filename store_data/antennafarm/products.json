Drawing upon finger-picked folk, traditional country, classical music and rock, White creates an expansive space for her intuitive lyrics and elegiac vocals. The spare skeletons of the songs on Ode to Sentience are fleshed out with subdued electric guitar thrums, diaphanous organ, ethereal pedal steel guitar, lush strings, and White’s dusky alto with its signature catch.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<i>Ode to Sentience</i> unifies White’s recurring themes and her fascination with Gothic America into an assured statement.

They’ve toured and recorded with the likes of Grizzly Bear, Beach House, and Deerhoof. Quever has also worked with some of the SF Bay Area’s most prominent bands and songwriters, including Vetiver, Casiotone for the Painfully Alone, Cass McCombs, and many more.  \r\n\r\nJason Quever handles all songwriting duties and much of the instrumentation on Mockingbird. He’s joined by Matt Popieluch (Foreign Born) on keys and backing vocals and Luke Top (Fools Gold) on drums, as well as Natalie Mazzuca on viola. \r\n\r\n“Somewhere between the dreamy dirges of Galaxie 500 and the offbeat charm of Jad Fair, topped off with an endearing, held-together-with-gaffer-tape feel which belies Quever’s instinctive ear for sharp-as-a-whip melodies and layered production.” — Uncut\r\n\r\n“A delicate mood piece made to cut through the din and chaos of modern life. ” — Pitchfork\r\n\r\n“Quever is the master of unhurried lyricism, songs that seem like they might go on forever, or at least for the length of a sunny afternoon.” — Dusted\r\n\r\nListen:\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F34845293&show_artwork=true\"></iframe>\r\n   ","options":[{"id":17300631,"name":"Default","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":15.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54285001/-/ANT508-LP.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54285001/-/ANT508-LP.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":33911,"name":"Papercuts","permalink":"papercuts","url":"/artist/papercuts"}],"categories":[{"id":1198031,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":5327709,"name":"Someone2Dance 7\"","permalink":"someone2dance-7","position":14,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/someone2dance-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-01-25T20:43:37.000Z","description":"<a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/someone2dance-cheap-words/id485562440\" target=\"_blank\"> MP3 available from iTunes<br><img src=\"http://www.antennafarmrecords.com/images/itunes.gif\" alt=\"Buy From Itunes\" border=\"0\" height=\"30\" width=\"110\" /></a>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<b>Side A: Someone2Dance\r\nSide B: Cheap Words\r\n\r\n\r\nBart Davenport follows up his critically acclaimed 2010 covers album Searching For Bart Davenport with a blast of power pop right out of 1980.

Whittled down to just an acoustic guitar and voice, these songs are stripped of their ornate garments and shimmering jewelry in order to reveal their inner beauty, the way only Bart Davenport can do.  \r\n \r\n\"Davenport's obvious sincerity shines through, his plaintive delivery breathing new life into David Byrne's 'Everyone's In Love With You' and Gil Scott-Heron's 'Better Days Ahead' - Q Magazine\r\n","options":[{"id":11303494,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":15.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/32389404/-/TR194_Searching_Cover_HiRes_01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/32389404/-/TR194_Searching_Cover_HiRes_01.jpg","width":1000,"height":899}],"artists":[{"id":33841,"name":"Bart Davenport","permalink":"bart-davenport","url":"/artist/bart-davenport"}],"categories":[{"id":1198031,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":3229839,"name":"The Bread and the Bait CD","permalink":"the-bread-and-the-bait-cd","position":20,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-bread-and-the-bait-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-02-03T09:49:58.000Z","description":"<h2>Now Available! <br> All copies ship with a limited edition Foxtails Brigade poster while supplies last!  </h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\n1) Creeping Ophelia\r\n2) The Hours\r\n3) Pan-Asian Delight\r\n4) Chat With Sivan\r\n5) The Bread and the Bait\r\n6) The Doll\r\n7) The Clown\r\n8) For Leo\r\n9) Long Day\r\n10) Steak and Cookies\r\n11) The Sycamores\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/album/the-bread-and-the-bait/id418053063\" target=\"_blank\"> MP3 available from iTunes<br><img src=\"http://www.antennafarmrecords.com/images/itunes.gif\" alt=\"Buy From Itunes\" border=\"0\" height=\"30\" width=\"110\" /></a>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\r\nSometimes the sweetest flowers have the sharpest thorns. Such is the case with Foxtails Brigade’s debut album The Bread and the Bait. Everything about the album is delicate, from the neo-Victorian storybook illustration of the cover to the intricate lyrics and pristine musical arrangements. You won’t any find drums here, just quiet, finger-picked guitar, ethereal vocals and simple violin and cello melodies; the perfect accompaniment for an afternoon tea.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYet underneath the lace and finery lies a cunning darker edge. Killer bees, hungry flies and porcelain dolls that come to life populate a lyrical landscape rife with hints of rot, aging, and death. Live audiences are similarly jolted when the tiny, doll-like front-woman Laura Weinbach switches from her pitch-perfect vocals to turbulent rants and complex classical guitar riffs on more chaotic songs like “Steak and Cookies”. Sharp thorns indeed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Bread and the Bait (recorded by Scott McDowell, Anton Patzner, Dave Reep and Drew Zagesec and mixed by Jay Pellicci, Anton Patzner and Dave Reep) will be released April 12th 2011 on Antenna Farm Records.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nListen:\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F11865055&show_artwork=true\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":10996941,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31463005/-/ant535-rgb.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31463005/-/ant535-rgb.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":51871,"name":"Foxtails Brigade","permalink":"foxtails-brigade","url":"/artist/foxtails-brigade"}],"categories":[{"id":1197961,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":2747771,"name":"Chateau Crone LP","permalink":"chateau-crone-lp","position":21,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/chateau-crone-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-09-13T07:35:27.000Z","description":"<h2>OUT NOW!<br><br><br>FREE BONUS TATTOO WITH ALL ORDERS!!</h2><br></p>\r\n\r\n<b>\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\n1) I'm Alright\r\n2) Grey Gardens\r\n3) Dada Girlfriend\r\n4) I'll Let You Be My Baby\r\n5) I Was Born To Sing Sad Songs\r\n6) Wallpaper of Skin\r\n7) Your Hands My Hands\r\n8) Oh La La!\r\n9) Rubik's Cube\r\n10) Wood Lead Rubber\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nTaking notes from bands like the Shaggs, the Boswell Sisters and the Zombies, Agent Ribbons reconcile seemingly unrelated genres, sounding like Girls in the Garage doing the Three Penny opera.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHATEAU CRONE is Agent Ribbons second full-length album, following the band’s self-released “On Time Travel and Romance” and two vinyl singles released through Acuarela and Seven Inch Project.

Lush arrangements and biting lyrical content (try \"Pan American Blues Pt. 2,\" or \"A Fairy Tale\") are reminiscent of Scott Walker or more recent practitioners of gloom such as Red House Painters, Okkervil River or Rufus Wainwright (minus all the bombast) but are given a unique urgency by Quever's reverb-soaked falsetto.
