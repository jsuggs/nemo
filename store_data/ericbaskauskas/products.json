Our work at the Joan Flasch Artists’ Book Collection at SAIC gives us the privilege of access to some of Ruscha’s most famous and rare book works such as <i>Twentysix Gasoline Stations</i> and <i>Nine Swimming Pools</i>, as well as insight to the glut of knock-offs and homages that the scene produces. We chose to merge these phenomena while looking at another: Ruscha’s love of empty space.\r\n\r\n<i>Various Blank Pages</i> consists of reproductions of the blank pages from Ruscha’s iconic books. Scanned directly from the original works and designed to look like one of his, perhaps the best part about this book is its alternate function as a notebook should the novelty of the piece ever fade.\r\n\r\n66 pages, 6”x8”, offset printed and perfect bound.","options":[{"id":12901600,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":15.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37723486/-/blankpages.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37723486/-/blankpages.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1587188,"name":"Print","permalink":"print","url":"/category/print"}]},{"id":14871297,"name":"The Musicians LP by Brain Vacation","permalink":"the-musicians-lp-by-brain-vacation","position":2,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-musicians-lp-by-brain-vacation","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-15T17:28:46.000Z","description":"The first release from <a href=\"http://wallofyouth.com\" target=blank>Wall of Youth Records</a>!
