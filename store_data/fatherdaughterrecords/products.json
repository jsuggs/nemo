The recording process was piecemeal, done sporadically by the band between shows, and with the exception of drums at Let ‘Em In Music in Brooklyn, was recorded and mixed in Dooley’s apartment. The themes weaving throughout <em>Love Hard</em> can be summed up with a few key words: Love hard. Fight hard. Live hard.  The same can be said for the variance of musical styles. Equal amounts of ferocity are heard on the bipolar “Comfortable Life” and bleak, hard-hitting “Monster,” as on their musical antithesis, the jubilant power-pop “Sugarcube.” Flagland is a multi-dimensional band that is impossible to label or define. Everything is open to interpretation. <em>Love Hard</em> will be released February 25, 2014.\r\n\r\n<object height=\"18\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/123928873&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=tiny\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed wmode=\"transparent\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"18\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/123928873&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=tiny\"></embed></object><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/love-hard/id776116884?uo=4\" target=\"itunes_store\"style=\"display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;background:url(https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/htmlResources/assets/en_us//images/web/linkmaker/badge_itunes-lrg.png) no-repeat;width:110px;height:40px;@media only screen{background-image:url(https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/htmlResources/assets/en_us//images/web/linkmaker/badge_itunes-lrg.svg);}\"></a>","options":[{"id":50213148,"name":"Black Vinyl","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50213151,"name":"Milky White Splatter Vinyl","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":50213154,"name":"CD","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129090222/-/cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129090222/-/cover.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":257736,"name":"Flagland","permalink":"flagland","url":"/artist/flagland"}],"categories":[{"id":1551953,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":1552107,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"},{"id":5248836,"name":"Digital","permalink":"digital","url":"/category/digital"}]},{"id":14720151,"name":"Running In The Fog - Silver (DIGITAL)","permalink":"running-in-the-fog-silver-digital","position":2,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/running-in-the-fog-silver-digital","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-08T23:21:30.000Z","description":"<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/runninginthefog/\">Running In The Fog</a> is the moniker of San Francisco’s Amanda Harper.

The packaging, including a gorgeous full color insert, was created & designed by Providence, RI artist Jenny Brown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Leapling began as home recordings, written by singer/guitarist Dan Arnes over the course of several months. From there, Dan and drummer, Yoni David, edited the tracks down to what would ultimately become <i>Losing Face</i> and also assembled a live band, which includes bassist R.J. Gordon (who also mastered the EP) and Joey Postiglione on lead guitar. The project is fairly new to the scene but the players are not -- they are the hearts and minds behind the Bushwick DIY venue/art space Big Snow Buffalo Lodge and the artist collective known as American Buffalo Recordings. You'd be hard pressed to find a group of people more committed to the local music community than these four dudes. Since their inception in early 2012, Leapling has performed live with friends and comrades Twin Sister, Ava Luna, Each Other and Total Slacker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Vinyl orders come with a digital download and are shipped 2-3 business days from date of purchase.
