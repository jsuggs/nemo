The Budda Cakes are just such a pleasure to partake of - their music is refreshingly strange, their sound is delightfully unusual, their lyrics are so beautifully 'normal'. Yep, I like The Budda Cakes muchly!!\r\n'X' is The Budda Cakes' new album - a pretty stunning work that can sound glib and tongue in cheek yet it's amazingly original and thoroughly enjoyable. Just a three-piece maybe but with their armoury of instruments and accessories that most bands would leave in the second-hand shop, The Budda Cakes make a wonderfully intoxicating 'noise', they sound as if they really enjoy themselves and their enthusiasm is contagious.\r\n\r\nThe Budda Cakes make great music, they refuse to be pigeonholed, they challenge musical normality and I love everything they do!!\" TOXIC PETE\r\n\r\n\"Fractious and haphazard as a raging manic-depressive, “X” exudes a quirky sense of mystery from beginning to end. Loaded with frantic references to Central London and accompanied by a flurry of accordion-like harmonium notes....\r\nResting somewhere between giddiness and raving insanity, “X” is by turns both an irrepressibly hyperactive and eerily tender slice of experimentalism.\"\r\nFaye Coulman / GLASSWERK\r\n\r\n*** IF YOU DONT HAVE A PAYPAL ACCOUNT SEND AN EMAIL WITH YOUR ORDER TO buddacakes@yahoo.co.uk***","options":[{"id":953929,"name":"X","price":7.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.2,"amount_with_others":2.2,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1752867/-/GonShot409.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1752867/-/GonShot409.jpg","width":901,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":195231,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":219770,"name":"The Budda Cakes EP","permalink":"the-budda-cakes-ep","position":3,"price":4.99,"default_price":4.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-budda-cakes-ep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-01-19T22:33:16.000Z","description":"THE BUDDA CAKES EP\r\n2006\r\n\r\nTracks:\r\n\r\n1.)

The Budda Cakes EP is a brilliant piece of work. I admire these guys for having the guts to lay down such a varied exhibition of contemporary music ... as inventive and as fresh as it gets. Superb!!\"\r\nPeter Brown / TOXICPETE\r\n\r\n\"The Budda Cakes release their debut EP and what an eclectic mix it is. Apparently recording their album by candlelight to capture an essence like no other album has done, The Budda Cakes have made sure this certainly shines through in their music... The Budda Cakes are quite unique from everybody else.\r\nNat Geraghty / GLASSWERK\r\n\r\n\"The debut three track release from London three piece The Budda Cakes combines more creative artistry and freewheeling melodic depth than a fair few bands currently receiving accolades and plaudits. They appear to have an uncanny knack at shitting tunes at will...each of these five tunes reveal a different facet of the ensembles creativity.\"\r\nMark Barton /LOSING TODAY\r\n\r\n...they ARE brilliant! Thank god for that. Marvellous...It's been quite a trip by the time the last note rings out, and one which is going to keep you interested for ages. Until it pops into existence, we can only predict the madness that would come with a full length album.\r\nLEEDS MUSICSCENE\r\n\r\nTheir sound is definitely unique.
