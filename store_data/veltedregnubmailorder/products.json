In their brief 8 month existence in 1985 they crafted a sound that is unlike anything else that I have ever heard. The 22 song demo reissued on this LP would seem to meld equal parts of the expected 80s Midwestern American Hardcore but sets it against the non-stop guitar frenzy of contemporary Japanese bands, or are they Robert Fripp solos played at breakneck speed? It’s hard to tell and is far stranger than that. With vocals in the vein of Naked Raygun’s earlier records and the non-stop solos of Randy Uchida this is a sound that stands apart from other recordings of the era. You really need to hear it to start to understand it. Comprised of two brothers John and Joe Bendik who would switch between guitar and drums, front man Bill Morris, who cut an intimidating figure on stage and bassist Alan Peters who went on to be in Agnostic Front and helped found Absolution this is a band that came and went fast, but left an amazing recording behind. Limited to 1,000 copies this remastered LP includes a fanzine style insert with lots of photos and flyers and folds out into a 35X22 inch poster. Includes a download card which gives a full version of the album as well as their complete set from their show opening for Agnostic Front in 1985.\r\n\r\nlabel: Mind Cure records","options":[{"id":49636035,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.5,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":0.15,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.9,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128665626/-/photo_1-1_(2).jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128665626/-/photo_1-1_(2).jpg","width":615,"height":630},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129388788/-/DSCF1353.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129388788/-/DSCF1353.JPG","width":2016,"height":1512},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129388803/-/DSCF1354.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129388803/-/DSCF1354.JPG","width":2016,"height":1512},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129388821/-/DSCF1355.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129388821/-/DSCF1355.JPG","width":2016,"height":1512},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129388836/-/DSCF1361.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129388836/-/DSCF1361.JPG","width":2016,"height":1512}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2186870,"name":"Lp","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]},{"id":15562185,"name":"Real Enemy - \"Life with the Enemy\" Lp (1983 PA/HC)","permalink":"real-enemy-life-with-the-enemy-lp-1983-pa","position":4,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/real-enemy-life-with-the-enemy-lp-1983-pa","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-14T22:37:08.000Z","description":"LP issues of the pre-Half Life PGH Hardcore band from 1983.

Deep Wound were one of a handful of great punk bands from the outer regions of Massachusetts who have been largely overlooked by HC history in favor of the \"Boston Crew\" bands who put out records on XClaim! or Modern Method. The four-piece recorded their one and only single with Lou Giordano and Frank Michaels (Proletariat) and released it on the Radiobeat label in 1982. Their one compilation appearance (on the otherwise excellent Bands that Could be God LP of Massachusetts punk) isn't quite as good as the raging insanity of this single. The record is snotty teenage punk rock but played at lightning speed with totally manic singing. The band also recorded some rough demo tapes in J's basement, which eventually found their way onto CD and vinyl on various bootlegs. Drummer J Mascis and guitarist Lou Barlow went on to further greatness by forming the seminal indie rock band Dinosaur Jr. (and Lou later started Sebadoh), and bassist Scott Helland played in the Outpatients until their breakup in 1995. The Deep Wound material is all amazing and essential.\r\n\r\nlabel: Armageddon Shop Label","options":[{"id":49636419,"name":"Default","price":6.49,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":0.1,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.75,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128674074/-/1479529_10151770385192548_1343260185_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128674074/-/1479529_10151770385192548_1343260185_n.jpg","width":960,"height":574},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128665962/-/1266722_416915225081134_1612854064_o.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128665962/-/1266722_416915225081134_1612854064_o.jpg","width":1000,"height":598}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2186868,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"}]},{"id":14771094,"name":"ネメシス (NEMESIS) - \"Gyou-Shou\" 7\"","permalink":"nemesis-gyou-shou-7","position":8,"price":5.49,"default_price":5.49,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nemesis-gyou-shou-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-11T16:11:50.000Z","description":"Introducing the 2nd E.P. from the voice of a new generation of Kyushu hardcore punk.

Their material here is possibly their most brutal and harsh recordings yet, in the style that they are known and loved for. Absolute shit-fi unlistenable garbage Extreme Noise Terror/Sore Throat worship mixed with lo-fi minimalist acid/house techno. This recording contains some new songs (including a slow mosh jammer that I think if the first slow song they’ve ever written?), some old songs re-recorded (like usual), and all songs that make us grin from ear to ear and feel like life is still worth living.\r\n\r\nLotus Fucker produces their most claustrophobic, paranoid, and anxious material yet in their standard “noise hardcore” style, fueled by sleep deprivation, lack of sunlight, and poor dietary decisions. We will never be defined by others. Noise forever.

However, returning as CHAOSCHANNEL, they have moved beyond the boundaries and limitations of that terminology to create a uniquely new style of 'noise and dance'. And there's nothing we love more at SPHC than bands with their own unique sense of identity beyond genre exercising and copying.\r\n\r\nChaos Channel - How You’d Never Been So High? (But Then You’d Never Needed To Be?) CD from 2010 is possibly the best noisy punk record of our times, a really fresh and exciting take on a style they already mastered years ago. And this 7\" single continues with these ideas. A meticulous recording of super catchy riffs fit into a bizarre and chaotic sense of songwriting and arrangements, with No. 6's instantly recognizable vocals belting out lyrics that border between absurd nonsense and high-art genius. Overall a totally unique punk rock experience for pogo and flight.\r\n\r\nScope a track here: http://soundcloud.com/sphc/sphc-30-chaos-channel-new\r\n\r\n\r\nlabel: SPHC records","options":[{"id":48228546,"name":"Default","price":5.49,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":0.1,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.75,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127653270/-/Clipboard01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127653270/-/Clipboard01.jpg","width":1000,"height":996},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129096855/-/DSCF0900.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129096855/-/DSCF0900.JPG","width":2016,"height":1512},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129096873/-/DSCF0901.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129096873/-/DSCF0901.JPG","width":2016,"height":1512},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129096876/-/DSCF0903.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129096876/-/DSCF0903.JPG","width":2016,"height":1512},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129096888/-/DSCF0904.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129096888/-/DSCF0904.JPG","width":2016,"height":1512}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2186868,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"}]},{"id":15519927,"name":"Instinct Of Survival ‎– \"Lapsed Into Absurdity\" 7\" flexi (ltd 300)","permalink":"instinct-of-survival-lapsed-into-absurdity-7-flexi-ltd-300","position":11,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/instinct-of-survival-lapsed-into-absurdity-7-flexi-ltd-300","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-12T18:59:50.000Z","description":"3 track flexi from Crust Punks INSTINCT OF SURVIVAL.\r\n\r\nA slight change in sound on this release that gives it a 90's UK Crust feel with an Anarcho edge.\r\n\r\nReally good stuff.

To co-incide with a trilogy of collectors CD/LP reissues of their recorded output, Boss Tuneage is proud to present this wonderful collectors archive DVD. Filmed totally DIY punk style on a single camcorder by their tour manager, “1987” follows the band on a tour of Belgium and Holland, featuring ultra rare live appearances and 17 full out blasting live songs to frenzied crowds! In addition to this, there are also some classic never seen before “behind the scenes” footage of the band and roadies which shows the bands humorous side too! There is also some remarkable archive footage of the band in the recording studio, recording the legendary “Thanks” 7” single!

After a couple of years Peaceville sold a majority of their back catalogue, including the Doom titles, to Music for Nations. This didn't sit well with the band's ideology, so they decided to quit the label for good. Doom then later released the subtly named Fuck Peaceville CD, which contained re-recordings of most tracks from the Peaceville era. \r\n\r\nThis hefty double vinyl package contains everything Doom recorded for Peaceville - War Crimes LP, tracks from the split LP with No Security and Police Bastard 7\" - all are the original recordings. The set features a reproduction of the original War Crimes gatefold jacket and a 8 page booklet with lyrics, photos and also brand new liner notes from the band.

Starting in the late 1980's a classic sounding Japanese hardcore band, SLANG's sound became heavily influenced in the 1990's by NYHC like AGNOSTIC FRONT, MADBALL and slower breakdowns as a means for impact, In the 00's the band embraced more metallic influences and slowly began to seam all of it together,: the tough, growling vocals, the slow, crushing breakdowns, raging guitar leads, lightening fast hardcore charge. Their Previous two albums \" The Immortal Sin\" and \" Life Made Me hardcore\" began the road to this, but \" Glory Outshines Doom\" goes to another level of combining all these elements to create an intense, dark, completely and totally brutal record, crashing barriers between Punk, Metal and hardcore.

Unfortunately, tracks like \"The cells of Messogion Street\", \"Subculture\", \"Political Party Sheepfold\" and the other songs of the album remain up to date as if nothing has changed since that time, in a country where poverty, oppression and autarchy have become the rule; where nazism and racism poison society and the regime has turned into parliamentary dictatorship. As a result of the urgency of the band's message and the rarity of the album (only 800 copies were initially pressed, most of which were traded abroad), \"38 millimeters\" soon became a very expensive collector's item. Occasionally, unauthorized replicas of the original album were released and sold at \"collector\" prices, of course. This gap is now filled in by the collective effort of B-otherSide and Scarecrow Records who have repressed the album on fully remastered for vinyl. This edition comes with a four page insert including lyrics and biography in two languages (Greek and English) supervised by the band, as well as unreleased photographs taken from band members themselves. \r\n\r\nFull album available online here:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHTiG4Go3jA\r\n\r\n\r\nlabel: B-OTHERSIDE records, Greek import","options":[{"id":46120752,"name":"Default","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.5,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":0.15,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.9,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126091758/-/adiexodo-final-cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126091758/-/adiexodo-final-cover.jpg","width":200,"height":204},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127599861/-/DSCF0086.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127599861/-/DSCF0086.JPG","width":2016,"height":1512},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127599879/-/DSCF0087.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127599879/-/DSCF0087.JPG","width":2016,"height":1512},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127599891/-/DSCF0088.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127599891/-/DSCF0088.JPG","width":2016,"height":1512},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127599918/-/DSCF0089.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127599918/-/DSCF0089.JPG","width":2016,"height":1512}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2186870,"name":"Lp","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]},{"id":14982735,"name":"COCKNEY REJECTS - \"Flares 'n Slippers EP\" 7\" ","permalink":"cockney-rejects-flares-n-slippers-ep-7","position":71,"price":6.49,"default_price":6.49,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cockney-rejects-flares-n-slippers-ep-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-20T20:21:40.000Z","description":"Released on Small Wonder in 1979, this unassuming slab signalled the emergence of a new genre, kickstarting both the Rejects' career and the entire oi movement.

Since the band's 25th anniversary things have changed and it seems as if the world finally starts to recognize the musical importance of one of the darkest and heaviest bands that emerged in the early 1980's from the English hardcore punk scene. The bands first release 'Behind The Realms Of Madness' paved the way for bands like Bolt Thrower and myriads of other heavy, crusty bands. While in the early years SACRILEGE's sound was more or less influenced by Discharge and Conflict, the band started in 1985 to integrate a strong doom metal component to their aggressiveness as well as to slow down the pace, which led to overwhelmingly powerful mid-tempo tracks. \r\n\r\nIn contrast to Amebix, who were strongly influenced by Killing Joke and Motörhead, SACRILEGE were attracted to bands like Trouble and Candlemass and this was unusually for a hardcore punk band in the first half of the 1980's. No wonder that not everyone had fallen in love with the first album and, later, when SACRILEGE became more and more a metal band, many of the old punks lost interest while thrash and doom metal fans have been gained. The second album 'Within The Prophecy', released in 1987, marks a transition between the old days and the last album 'Turn Back Trilobite', where SACRILEGE fully transformed into some sort of progressive doom metal band. 'Time To Face The Reaper', a compilation released by Absurd Records in 2010, is focused on the first four years of the band's relatively short career and consists of four demos recorded between 1984 and 1986. After the re-release of the first two albums, this is the first official compilation of these recordings which show the band's musical development from the very beginning as a Discharge-driven hardcore punk band to a doom-laden thrash metal band that is still deeply rooted with their past. \r\n\r\nFour out of the total of eight songs on the first two demos have been previously released on two compilations as well as on 'Realms' , whereas the last two demos include all tracks from 'Within The Prophecy' plus 'Insurrection' which later appeared on Under One Flag's 'Speed Kills III' compilation in 1987. With the exception of 'Bloodrun' and 'Dig Your Own Grave', all songs differ from later studio recordings that makes this compilation all the more interesting. The core of 'Time To Face The Reaper' are definitely the demo recordings for 'Within The Prophecy'. The problem of this record has been always the production that is simply too slick for a band like SACRILEGE. Nevertheless, the riffs and songs remain awesome, but the rough sound of the demo tapes is better suited for Damian Thompson's guitar attack. Even the vocals of Lynda \"Tam\" Simpson are more powerful than on the album. Truly, it would have been a real pleasure if the songs fom 'Within' had gotten the same studio treatment like the tracks of 'Behind', but fortunately both 1986 demos have an almost similar raw and unbridled, heavy sound. \r\n\r\nAs much as I worship Damian's riffs on the first album, I think his best work can be found around 1986. He elicits from his guitar an astonishingly powerful and continuously surprising spectrum of powerchords and solos: heavy, rhythmical pulsating, strong. Tam's clear and angry vocals are the icing on the cake, and everything is held together by a good, tight rhythm section. And last but not least, SACRILEGE had the talent to write some timeless classic songs where they have demonstrated unwittingly that they were ahead of their time. This is not just a catch phrase, but a plain fact. All 16 songs on this compilation have been remastered and 'Time To Face The Reaper' is packed in a wonderful glossy deluxe digipack, including a booklet with all lyrics, liner notes and a lot of unreleased photos. Don't waste your money on a shabby bootleg - here's the real deal! Very recommendable. \r\n\r\ntracklist:\r\n\r\n1. Apartheid \r\n2. Bloodlust \r\n3. Dig Your Own Grave \r\n4. Blind Acceptance \r\n5.

Mob 47 took the anger and intensity of early 80's Swedish hardcore and injected it with the speed and high energy of American Thrash. The result is some of the most powerful hardcore of the early 1980s. Recorded in 1984 these 8 tracks, one of which appeared on the PEACE comp, sent a shockwave through the world of hardcore. Powerful, fast and angry hardcore from some amped up young Swedes. This record has been bootlegged and re issued several times in different forms, but it's my intention to re produce the record as close to the way it dropped back in the 80's. The packaging is almost the same as the original except we've added a bunch of never before seen photos on the back of the insert.  Mob 47's lyrics are the product of the cold war era and the shadow of nuclear war that hung over the 80's. While the cold war might be over, the cry for social change and protest against oppression of songs like \"Ingen Framtid\" (without freedom) and \"Polisstat\" (Police State) ring just as true today. And we can't disagree with the sentiments of a song like \"Det Är Upp Till Oss\" (It's up to us). Perhaps these are sentiments borne of youthful idealism, but the 20 plus years since this records release shows that there is no shortage of war and injustice in the world to provoke outrage.  This record has been highly influential in the world of hardcore from crust, to grind to thrash.  Mob 47 have been playing gigs again and we hope to bring them to the USA to play some time in the future. Also looking into releasing more Mob 47 material soon, their new tracks rip just as hard as the classics. You can check out Mob 47's website at http://www.mob47.se for more up to date info. I'm not too crazy about Myspace, but there are some new tracks and videos posted on there as well.

They started out in 1980 as a pistols influenced punk band,not long after that they discovered the mighty discharge!,their all time favorite band. The discharge influence is definitely there,but with a style all of their own, great raw musicianship and gliding guitarsolos. The band was very infamous, because somehow they always managed to get into fights. They didn't have any problems finding trouble. Because of all the controversy and violence, they changed their name later into Genocide Express , who have 3 songs on the pushead's classic compilation lp Cleanse the bacteria. Not long after that, most band members started Agent Orange, who released 2 7\"s: Your mother sucks cock in hell (Graaf Hendrik records) and VD (New Wave) The gospelfuckers kind of grew into a myth over the years, also because they only released a demo tape. Many \"popular\" labels wanted to release it, but their (former band members) didn't care that much, so kangaroo had to push them a little bit for your pleasure.

Rejecting the then-popular trend to emulate British Oi bands, BGK took their musical cues from American hardcore bands such as MDC, and soon developed an ultrafast style of their own. The band was also committed to following through with its leftist political stance, both in terms of the punk scene (the band set up DIY shows with low door prices, and put out affordable records on their own label) and in a wider political spectrum (they often played benefits for various causes, and helped run the Emma squat in Holland).\r\n\r\n BGK released all their records on a label they started in their Nitwitz days, Vögelspin, and collaborated with U.S. labels R Radical and Alternative Tentacles. They helped touring bands playing in the Netherlands, and themselves toured Europe and the U.S. several times, finally calling it quits in 1987.\" -Kill From The Heart\r\n\r\n\r\ntracklist:\r\n\r\n\r\nPray For Peace & Kill For Christ     1:21   \r\nHoliday In Lebanon     0:57   \r\nIsolatiefolter     1:07   \r\nHonor & Justice     1:47   \r\nRace Riot     1:11   \r\nArms Race     1:11   \r\nElectroshock     1:08   \r\nAllegiance To No-one     1:36   \r\nFreeze Me     3:02   \r\nPolice Crimes     1:26   \r\nSpray Paint     1:41   \r\nVivisection     1:08   \r\nMembership     2:13   \r\nUp To You     1:07   \r\nRegering (Krijg De Tering)     1:10   \r\nSoylent Green     1:19   \r\nTout Les Flics     2:41   \r\nGet Killed     1:23   \r\nPill Party     1:46   \r\nVideo-Voodoo     1:33   \r\nCross Criminals     1:17   \r\nArms Race (Unreleased Version)     1:38   \r\nGone Mad     1:12   \r\nAction Man     0:51   \r\nKids For Ca$h     1:09   \r\nCrime Pays     1:40   \r\nRules     1:39   \r\nWhite Man Dumbinance     1:06   \r\nBite The Hand That Feeds (SHIT)     2:08   \r\nFollow The Trend     1:05   \r\nPencil Pusher     1:34   \r\nBlank State-Sharp Shot     1:39   \r\nCivil Terror     1:42   \r\nBloodsuckers     1:33   \r\nJonestown Aloha!     2:04   \r\nHave A Coke (And No Trial)     1:58   \r\nPay To Die     1:41   \r\nComputer Control     1:23   \r\nSafety Last     2:31   \r\nTV News Distorted Views     3:40   \r\nInstiutional Mentality     2:15   \r\nInjected Insanity     1:23   \r\nNo Limbs     4:45   \r\nThe Greatest American Zero     2:32   \r\nYouth For Crime     1:13   \r\nSad And Saintly (Untitled)     1:41  \r\n\r\nnotes:\r\n\r\nTracks:\r\n\r\n1-20 (A1 to B8) from \"Jonestown Aloha!\" (1983, Vögelspin),\r\n\r\n21-22 (B9-B10) from \"Alles Je Haar Goed Zit...Nr. 2\" Compilation (1983, Vögelspin)\r\n\r\n24-31 (B11 to C4) from \"White Male Dumbinance\" (1984, Vögelspin)\r\n\r\n 32-47 (C5 to D8) from \"Nothing Can Go Wrogn!\" (1986, Alternative Tentacles/Vögelspin).\r\n\r\nComes with a lyric insert. \r\n\r\nlabel: Alternative Tentacles records","options":[{"id":47223612,"name":"Default","price":17.49,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":16.5,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":23.9,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126894966/-/B.G.K._ADutchFeast_LP.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126894966/-/B.G.K._ADutchFeast_LP.jpg","width":303,"height":303}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2589577,"name":"2xLp","permalink":"2xlp","url":"/category/2xlp"}]},{"id":14578821,"name":"ANTISECT - \"In Darkness There Is No Choice\" Lp (1983)","permalink":"antisect-in-darkness-there-is-no-choice-lp-1983","position":119,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/antisect-in-darkness-there-is-no-choice-lp-1983","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-02T21:33:55.000Z","description":"classic UK anarcho, hardcore/punk from 1983, comes with a reprint of the original \"Crass Records\" style foldout poster cover!

A punk band from Tampere, Finland, Karanteeni was founded in 1978 by the Konttinen brothers Hate and Rina. Karanteeni were one of the catchiest bands to come out of Finland in the late 70's to early 80's (1978 - 1982). If you loved them on Bloodstains Across Finland, you’re in for a real treat. This is pure classic 77' Finn punk! Ramones, Sex Pistols, The Damned, cheap booze, youth, anger and a nack for great song writing. If these songs are not pogoing in your brain after a minutes listen, check yourself into a morgue. These tapes are DIY fan club made but have a very professional look. A lot of time was put into the packaging. The tapes are spray painted quality tapes from the national recording supply company, fold out J card on thick card stock and each one comes with a hand stamped sticker and a 8.5 X 11 band photo special only to this release.\r\n\r\nlabel: Seek Shelter In Hell tapes - 02","options":[{"id":46155636,"name":"Default","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":0.1,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.75,"amount_with_others":1.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126115785/-/1003347_10153077198255183_2033975025_n_original.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126115785/-/1003347_10153077198255183_2033975025_n_original.jpg","width":960,"height":720},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126115788/-/1005648_10153077197775183_792915303_n_original.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126115788/-/1005648_10153077197775183_792915303_n_original.jpg","width":960,"height":720}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2484233,"name":"cassette","permalink":"cassette","url":"/category/cassette"}]},{"id":14412678,"name":"Kansan Uutiset / Systematic Death - split Lp (ltd 250)","permalink":"kansan-uutiset-systematic-death-split-lp-ltd-350","position":129,"price":19.0,"default_price":19.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kansan-uutiset-systematic-death-split-lp-ltd-350","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-25T19:59:20.000Z","description":"paring of two raging 80's hardcore/punk bands from Finland & Japan!\r\n\r\ntracklist:\r\n\r\n  Propaganda Demos 83  \r\nKansan Uutiset –   Kauniita Unia        \r\n\r\nKansan Uutiset –   Etusiyun Juttu        \r\n\r\nKansan Uutiset –   Koti, Uskonto, Isaanma        \r\n  \r\n Beautiful Dreams LP  \r\nKansan Uutiset –   Cheerless Morning        \r\n\r\nKansan Uutiset –   Dog Is Better Police        \r\n\r\nKansan Uutiset –   Home, Religion, Native Country        \r\n\r\nKansan Uutiset –   Army Cannot Make A Man        \r\n\r\nKansan Uutiset –   Beautiful Dreams        \r\n\r\nKansan Uutiset –   Front Page        \r\n\r\nKansan Uutiset –   Pigs        \r\n\r\nKansan Uutiset –   Crazy Wonders        \r\n\r\nKansan Uutiset –   Informer        \r\n\r\nKansan Uutiset –   Pig-Lars        \r\n\r\nKansan Uutiset –   Too Pure        \r\n\r\nKansan Uutiset –   Cheerless Morning 2        \r\n\r\nKansan Uutiset –   Monster Baby        \r\n\r\nKansan Uutiset –   Economic Appraisal        \r\n\r\nKansan Uutiset –   Fuck J        \r\n\r\nkansan Uutiset –   Now I Wanna Fuck Your Dog   \r\n  \r\nKansan Uutiset –   Cannibus To Flower Shops        \r\n\r\nKansan Uutiset –   You Have It        \r\n \r\n Yokohama PENTA 1984.1.29  \r\nSystematic Death –   77 Kids        \r\n\r\nSystematic Death –   Systematic Death        \r\n\r\nSystematic Death –   Disobey        \r\n\r\nSystematic Death –   Sink You        \r\n\r\nSystematic Death –   Save        \r\n\r\nSystematic Death –   U.S. City        \r\n\r\nSystematic Death –   Alley Army        \r\n\r\nSystematic Death –   Japanese Punx        \r\n  \r\n Yokohama PENTA 1984.12.8  \r\nSystematic Death –   So What        \r\n\r\nSystematic Death –   ~Isshin-Kyo ~        \r\n\r\nSystematic Death –   Oi Oi Oi        \r\n\r\nSystematic Death –   Island        \r\n\r\nSystematic Death –   U.P.P        \r\n\r\nSystematic Death –   Pinfu Nippon        \r\n\r\nSystematic Death –   Near By War        \r\n\r\nSystematic Death –   From Hell  \r\n\r\n\r\nlabel: (unofficial release) from 2001, euro import\r\n\r\n\r\n*** postage/price went up since I last had copies (10) years ago, regardless these are the last few copies!

Each band shows the world how it should be done over the course of only two songs each; with VAASKA executing their mastery of raw hardcore all the while straying from the plethora of bands that have beaten the style into a boring submission and IMPALERS showcasing the ability to produce their own uniquely virulent metalpunk fist pumpers that have become the band's earmark over the past few years.

This band has the primitive late 80s-early 90s Medellin hardcore sound mixed with the old finish hardcore madness we all love. Medellin is the punkest city that I had ever been. There are punks everywhere, extreme organized violence and is one of the friendliest cities all at the same time. This has developed one of the most interesting punk scenes in the world, in my humble opinion. Exterminacion is part of it. They sing about living in a shithole like Medellin, something all south americans feel related too. Inept, honest and urgent hardcore is what you will find in this tape.

As one friend ones said: “Avichines sound is like they like so much raw rock and roll that they ended up playing punk by mistake”. Avichines are great! They manage to blend different influences and make something new and unique. It is weird; I don’t know how to explain it. Something that would sound like shit, Avichines manage to make it catchy and powerful. This shit is honest; this shit is made by real people without pretensions of any kind. Awesome tape that makes me want to pogo. I think some people from this band play in Inservibles, if you care about that kind of shit. Yellow shell tape, printed on recycled yellow paper.

Those of you who can’t get enough of Killed By Death-style punk will plunge right in. First up is Connecticut’s Target Cells’ Cerebral Hemorrhage demo from 1982, of which about twenty-five were originally sold via Maximumrock’n’roll’s mailorder. It’s a little rudimentary and not as exciting as the Circle Jerks, who they cover, but it’s forceful and gets the job done. The White Pigs (1982-1997) flirt with crossover, and, thankfully, never take the plunge in. There’s only one big question mark hanging over the band, and I’ll leave it up to you, the reader, to make the call: “Saying things that are on my mind/ hating spics in the unemployment line.” Last up is my favorite band of the three, Chronic Disorder (1983-1992), who seem more discordant, spastic, unique, and revved up, like a hyperactive Dils (they’ve got a political sensibility) cross-spliced with the Angry Samoans (they’ve got a lot of snot). Not a bad split at all. Definitely a labor of love.  –Todd Taylor (Coldsweat)\r\n\r\ntracklist:\r\n\r\n \r\n *Target Cells - The Cerebral Hemmorage Demo 1982*  \r\nTarget Cells, The –   Slave        \r\n\r\nTarget Cells, The –   Matter        \r\n\r\nTarget Cells, The –   Shot On The Spot        \r\n\r\nTarget Cells, The –   Cosmic Raze        \r\n\r\nTarget Cells, The –   Lead Us To The Grave        \r\n\r\nTarget Cells, The –   Elements Of Hate        \r\n\r\nTarget Cells, The –   Baby The Bathwater        \r\n\r\nTarget Cells, The –   Live Fast Die Young        \r\n\r\nTarget Cells, The –   Cerebral Hemmorage        \r\n\r\nTarget Cells, The –   Legacy Of Lethargy        \r\n\r\nTarget Cells, The –   Cancer Stew        \r\n \r\n* White Pigs*  \r\nWhite Pigs –   White Pigs Theme        \r\n\r\nWhite Pigs –   A.P.O.W.

Greg Anderson, fanatical about BL’AST!, wasted no time in sending the tapes to a studio to be baked. Needless to say, after 25 years gathering dust, the quality had deteriorated. Even when the tapes had been baked, nobody could have anticipated what would follow. With the tapes baked and audio digitised, Southern Lord contacted long time BL’AST! fiend, Dave Grohl about mixing this recording, his response was an enthusiastic “FUCK YEAH!, LETS DO THIS”!\r\n\r\nWhilst inside Grohl’s famous 606 Studios (and with the Neve console as featured in the recent Grohl produced documentary ’Sound City’) a remarkable discovery was made – a completely unheard, unreleased BL’AST! recording session from the mid–80s. The lineup of the band at the time of the recording included second guitarist William Duvall (from Neon Christ & interestingly now the vocalist for Alice In Chains) who had moved from his hometown of Atlanta out to Santa Cruz on a tip from mutual friends, Corrosion of Conformity to join the band. Unfortunately his tenure with BL’AST! was short–lived and no recordings from that lineup were ever released.\r\n\r\n From the thunderous bass intro of “Only Time Will Tell” to the apocalyptic warnings of “Its In My Blood” the album completely rips and rages from start to finish. All parties involved were completely amazed at how vibrant, unique and new the material sounded. All things considered, it is miraculous that this record survived it’s journey and that everyone who was involved in bringing this recording to life, could be. Everything fell into place, when it could have easily crumbled along the way. This record is a time capsule that is meant to be heard! $10\r\n\r\nBL’AST! – Blood!

This new release contains only material when III.Kategorija played fast speedy metallic HC in its best quality and when many people rightly called them one of the best European HC bands. Instead of long and metal songs the band members decided to add two bands that was created before III.Kategorija . In this way we show how the history of III.Kategorija was created. The sound went from total speed HC (Stres D.A.) from 1983 through a bit slower HC (Depresija) in 1984 to fast metallic HC (III.Kategorija) in 1985. The whole story is explained by KURI, the original and founding member of Stres D.A , Depresija and III.Kategorija. And so this release presents music from Stres D.A , through Depresija to  III.Kategorija. This record includes recordings by Stres D.A from 1983, recordings from Depresija  from 1984 (never before released) and the first demo recorded by III.Kategorija from 1985, from which some songs were used for the compilation HC LJubljana record in 1986. This is the music evolution that started in 1983 with Stres D.A  and ended in 1985 with III.Kategorija.\r\n\r\nlabel: Rest In Punk records, euro import\r\n\r\n                            ","options":[{"id":26439495,"name":"Default","price":13.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.5,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.7,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/88107674/-/Stres_DA_Depresija_3_kategorija_LP_front.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/88107674/-/Stres_DA_Depresija_3_kategorija_LP_front.jpg","width":280,"height":271},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/88107782/-/Stres_DA_Depresija_3_kategorija_LP_back.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/88107782/-/Stres_DA_Depresija_3_kategorija_LP_back.jpg","width":271,"height":275},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95134241/-/3waycompLp_019.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95134241/-/3waycompLp_019.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95136461/-/3waysplitinsert_002.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95136461/-/3waysplitinsert_002.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95136593/-/3waysplitinsert_001.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95136593/-/3waysplitinsert_001.JPG","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2186870,"name":"Lp","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"},{"id":4733660,"name":"REST IN PUNK  records, (Europe)","permalink":"rest-in-punk-records-europe","url":"/category/rest-in-punk-records-europe"}]},{"id":11371845,"name":"v/a - \"Kaj Je Alternativa + bonus live 1983\" Lp (ltd 300)","permalink":"v-a-kaj-je-alternativa-bonus-live-1983-compilation-lp-ltd-300","position":177,"price":13.99,"default_price":13.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/v-a-kaj-je-alternativa-bonus-live-1983-compilation-lp-ltd-300","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-25T11:06:59.000Z","description":"Kaj je alternativa comp.LP with bonus songs (U.B.R. + Odpadki Civilizacije + Stres D.A.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginally released on tape in 1983 in quantity of 200 copies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll songs remastered from original master tapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll bands biography written by original band members (Gigi for U.B.R),Kuri for Stres D.A. and Samo for Odpadki Civilizacije\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe LP including lyric sheets + many photos of all the bands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBonus songs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nU.B.R. \r\n\r\n*one song that was missed from 'kaj je alternativa' recordings,previously unreleased\r\n\r\n*2 live songs recorded on the first hardcore gig in yugoslavia in 1983,previously unreleased\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStres D.A. \r\n\r\n*one live song recorded on the first hardcore gig in yugoslavia in 1983,previously unreleased\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOdpadki Civilizacije \r\n\r\n*one live song recorded on the first hardcore gig in yugoslavia in 1983,previously unreleased\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlabel: Rest In Punk records, euro import\r\n\r\n\r\n ** distro & mailorder folks I will have wholesale/trade copies!

K7 those you record you radio and often did not even know who the group was.\r\n  Lei them in some fanzine and I liked both musically expressing ideas in their songs ... direct and raw. True stabs of hatred and viscera, songs of seconds, fast, dirty .... too many adjectives I can think of, songs that last bit but not forgotten.\r\n  At that time I was going to classes at the academy JOSO comic, which was then in RD. University and I remember I got a photo Shanti, Sistematika Torture singer, and put it in the folder of my comics all proud ... jejejejejej things of youth, which also still keep.\r\n  Re-listen to this CD K7 and me back to that time ... that time that groups of music knowing nothing, having no idea what was knowing touch, got together and spat their ideas without thinking whether musically were good or not ... and that was precisely what I was attracted by and still fascinates me.\r\n  82 subjects carrying the CD, including direct and demos, with excellent sound and k7 more raw sounding, but brutal for my taste.\r\n  Excellent maquetacion, design, and content of both the CD and the K7\r\n  So congratulations to David for this great job, you notice made ​​with love and admiration towards the group.\r\n\r\nthe tape comes with 4 recordings. 3 of them are also in the cd, but the 4th one is veeeeeery long, it takes part of side A and the whole side B of the tape, and it is NOT included in the cd\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8dtBXGYM0A\r\n\r\n\r\nlabel: Truco Espárrago records, Spanish import\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":38384418,"name":"CD","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":38401536,"name":"Cassette","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":0.15,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.75,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/119447142/-/f041a-tr-025.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/119447142/-/f041a-tr-025.jpg","width":300,"height":297},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/119447178/-/TR-026.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/119447178/-/TR-026.jpg","width":550,"height":543},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/119447154/-/TR-025_TR-026.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/119447154/-/TR-025_TR-026.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/119430018/-/DSC01953__2_.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/119430018/-/DSC01953__2_.JPG","width":400,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122471658/-/DSCF4289.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122471658/-/DSCF4289.JPG","width":2016,"height":1512}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2186872,"name":"cd","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"},{"id":2484233,"name":"cassette","permalink":"cassette","url":"/category/cassette"}]},{"id":12940275,"name":"Hardcore Anachronistic Assembly Vol. 1 Fanzine","permalink":"hardcore-anachronistic-assembly-vol-1-fanzine","position":183,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/hardcore-anachronistic-assembly-vol-1-fanzine","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-13T15:36:56.000Z","description":"48 page international fanzine omnibus with contributions from General Speech (USA), Radiation Sickness (USA), Got Myself (USA), La Ciudad Mas fea del Mundo (Venezuela), More Noise (UK), Night Reader More Than Fight (France), Your War (USA), Decapitated (Japan), Concrete Guerrilla (USA) & Eskupe Al Alkalde (Spain).

As always, Isterismo remain at the forefront of the contemporary Japanese raw noise hardcore scene along with peers Zyanose and D-Clone. Isterismo’s unique blend of noise is no doubt indebted to the older statesmen Gloom who lead Japan’s 1990s raw noise crasher scene mixed with a healthy fascination for classics of Italian hardcore, notably the loud message of ‘chaos non musica’ from Italian anarchists Wretched. In 2012, Isterismo is no longer the young upstarts of Tokyo hardcore punk scene that they were once coming up, but after a number of important records and regular gigs at home as well as abroad, today Isterismo is an established, hardened and mature band. The timing of the new Isterismo record, a 12” mini LP co-released by La Vida Es Un Mus and Crust War, is absolutely perfect.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn what will surely be remembered as their defining record, Folia Verso L’interno starts with the longest and slowest song of the record which like the calm before the storm builds up for the sounds of the nuclear destruction that follows. Spanning the best part of ten minutes, split by five tracks on each side of the record, consisting of minute long bursts of violent, chaotic and disordered eruptions of anguish, anger and pure unadulterated loudness!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSound production of this new record is absolutely great! Despite the thick wall of Isterismo’s violent, chaotic and above all loud assault on all the senses, every instrument can perfectly be heard in the mix! While this may be the loudest Isterismo record so far—and likely one of the loudest records ever—it's paradoxically Isterismo’s most accessible record to date. Above all, it is with this new release that Isterismo come into their own sound and style, making all cheap references to other bands entirely redundant.\r\n\r\n The one word that best describes this recording is not noise, as many may expect, but finesse. You will hear finesse in the expert guitar play, with subtle solos and riffage hidden in the high distortion and messy chaos, drum rolls are complex while the bass guitar is crisp and loud. For sure, this is the most important Japanese hardcore punk LP since the Kriegshög LP.\r\n\r\n \r\nwrite up by:\r\nTonny Gunnarson\r\n\r\n\r\nlabel: La Vida Es Un Mus records, UK import","options":[{"id":40423398,"name":"Default","price":14.49,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.5,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.9,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122121588/-/1858-2058-large.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122121588/-/1858-2058-large.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2186870,"name":"Lp","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]},{"id":12705066,"name":"DISASTER - \"War Cry\" mlp + flexi (1991)","permalink":"disaster-war-cry-mlp-flexi-1991","position":194,"price":15.49,"default_price":15.49,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/disaster-war-cry-mlp-flexi-1991","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-31T23:53:06.000Z","description":"Originally released in 1991 War Cry was one of the first purely DISCHARGE influenced bands to span what later become popularly known as D-Beat. Hailing from Halifax, they were part of a new wave of raging UK bands with worshiped \"Why\" as the finest piece on non-music ever recorded.

Everything seems to change, usually for the worse. Death is inevitable, though when it will come can rarely be predicted. Amidst all the flux here is a certainty: Framtid plays ripping d-beat raw punk, and they will never change. At the same time as their new album is released, the first in over a decade, 540 Records presents a vinyl collection of their four early demo cassettes. Most remarkable is how consistent Framtid’s vision has been, since first set down on a rehearsal tape in 1997. There is no chaff, nothing extraneous: just short, sharp bursts of feedback, noise, distortion, pummeling drums, and memorable råpunk riffs. This LP’s release accompanied their first visit to the United States, some years after border authorities had halted a previously planned one. What many suspected then became clear in 2013: Framtid is the most powerful live hardcore band on the planet, playing with ferocity unmatched by their peers (particularly drummer Takayama, who it seems barely survives the all-out effort he gives). After first seeing them in Japan a friend remarked to me that the sensory experience was like living through trench warfare. Perhaps outsiders will never grasp how fans of a deeply anti-war outfit, whose lyrics barely stray from that single message, can crave such an experience. But for the initiated, it makes perfect sense. At last, the initiated legion (and others!) can easily obtain the band’s crucial cassettes. The versions on this record, none ever before on vinyl, also include some songs that appear nowhere else. The band’s third demo, in particular, was produced in a micro-edition. This LP’s packaging is lavish, with a gatefold cover and a booklet of extremely difficult-to-find flyers, photos, and other material. -- Stuart Schrader (G.O.T.A.)\r\n\r\nlabel: 540 records","options":[{"id":37777233,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.5,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.9,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/117616746/-/540037-FRAMTID.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/117616746/-/540037-FRAMTID.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2186870,"name":"Lp","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]},{"id":11941194,"name":"Final Conflict - \"Nineteen Eighty-Five Demo\" Lp (gatefold)","permalink":"final-conflict-nineteen-eighty-five-demo-lp-official","position":207,"price":14.0,"default_price":14.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/final-conflict-nineteen-eighty-five-demo-lp-official","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-21T23:59:07.000Z","description":"\"Aaaarrgggh!

Yes indeed, punk hath long since been frozen in the ice age or by the cold wave, or whatever.  Punk is hippies is noisers is hip hop gothers. Maybe you were too busy collecting dirt on white jeans, and scrubbin off any trace of bourgeois privelege. Or maybe you were gossiping about whose Italian motor cycle boots were the harshest or whatever, or maybe when you were eBaying Skinny Puppy shirts and Totenkopf pins for the freezing weather to come, you missed out on things like the Music Not Music 7” by Chaos Destroy or their Stupid Night tape on Hierodule. Indeed maybe you thought you discovered the new Black Flag in a Midwest sine wave or in some noise-hop karaoke or maybe you just realized that you really wanted to tie girls up all along and fascist haircuts were the best compliment to yr imaginary order. EITHER WAY. Chaos Destroy hath since emerged, behind your back and laughing at you for how much you have grown!..... Yep, in some parts of the world, say like Southern Maryland, “music” began with the first notes and drum slams of the “Mental Disorder” EP and only flashed here and there since, on say a few flexi discs or 3rd degree bootleg cassettes, mostly of Japanese origin. You won’t get a better invitation to a real barn-yard violent party than from Chaos Destroy. For in the land of Chaos Destroy, the sound track is Dust Noise and Gai and the milk and honey is cider and glue. Nope, you’re not gonna get this from all the new records with black and white photos of dudes in fetish masks around magickal alters they got from Party City.

I think this band is going to get bigger than ever and they will be placed on the seat they earned a long time ago. Because this band is one of the best part of the history of ex-YU punk!\r\n\r\nGola Jaja comes from, Pula, beautiful city located by the Adriatic coast. But while the town isn’t particularly large, it’s has a large punk scene. GJ was not only an awesome punk band; GJ was an amazing gang and for them, the most important thing, and the reason they started the band, was their friendship. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything about the band feels real: their music, their lyrics and their friendship. Their friendship is truly touching and inspiring, I say this now after having gotten the honor to familiarize myself with the bands history and got to learn many details. From a wonderful friendship a great band was born, that in my opinion was something different and a genuine rarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGJ with their front man Denis has really played and lived their punk all the way! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEven though GJs biggest inspirations were the bands Sex Pistols and The Clash I can’t stop thinking of bands like Social Distortion, Social Unrest, TSOL and similar american HC bands when listening to their music. I found this a bit odd, but maybe it’s because of the singer, Denis, emotional and genuine way to express himself when singing. Denis, with Mario (the singer from Lublanski Psi) had maybe the emotional voices of everyone from the ex-YU punk scene. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the lyrics that were progressive and brave, dreaming or realistic, GJ turns back time and can make you stop and close your eyes just for a second. But don’t be fooled – GJ plays energetic, real punk and in their music they haven’t left anything for chance. Theirs music is filled with beautiful melodies and powerful refrains that are so perfectly arranged that the whole material feels properly done and meaningful. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor me this is a masterpiece, but not noticeable when they first recorded it, back in ‘84. They play with their own twist and their sound has such convincing authenticity that they couldn’t sound any better, but unfortunately this is something that was too often discovered much later in ex-yu punk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt feels like I’ve just started writing this text, and I could continue writing about this impressive band for hours, but instead I’m going to let you form your own opinion.\r\n\r\nThe cover you see is almost the same as it would’ve looked in the 80’s when the band dreamed of releasing an album.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n800 pressed (300 black/ 200 red/200 yellow/ 100 clear). 500 of these contain copies of their record in CD format .\r\n\r\n\r\nlabel: NE! records, import from Sweden","options":[{"id":35843625,"name":"Default","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.5,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.9,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111980442/-/GJ_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111980442/-/GJ_1.jpg","width":998,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111980526/-/GJ_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111980526/-/GJ_2.jpg","width":1000,"height":998},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111980550/-/GJ_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111980550/-/GJ_3.jpg","width":625,"height":627}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3618325,"name":"Lp+cd","permalink":"lp-cd","url":"/category/lp-cd"},{"id":4733735,"name":"NE! records, (Sweden)","permalink":"ne-records-sweden","url":"/category/ne-records-sweden"}]},{"id":11787720,"name":"NADE IZ INKUBATORA - \"SKALPER\" 7\" (gatefold)","permalink":"nade-iz-inkubatora-skalper-7-gatefold","position":219,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nade-iz-inkubatora-skalper-7-gatefold","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-14T14:39:53.000Z","description":"Old punks \"NII\" strikes again!

Each box is a work of art and something any audiophile would love to have in their collection. \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\"Born Without A Face Sound Recordings 1984-1986\" consists of 23 tracks spread out over two 12-inch LPs on 210-gram vinyl, each in its own hand-silkscreened sleeve enclosed in a handmade 19\" x 13\" magnetic closure box. \r\nThe first LP collects all the tracks from the magnificent Freakshow self-released cassette and puts them on one record, restored and re-mastered from the original studio tapes. Until now, Freakshow has never been available on vinyl or CD. Original copies of the cassette are by now over 26 years old. \r\n\r\nThe second LP collects songs that were originally released on the two 7\" EPs, plus one additional track (\"Hostages\") that was originally released on the There's a Method to Our Madness compilation. The tracks on this LP are also from the original studio master tapes. Please note that there were two tracks on the Unbecoming 7\" EP that were taken from the Freakshow sessions. These two tracks are only on the Freakshow vinyl, not on the second LP. \r\n\r\nAlso included in this set is a 22-track CD (vinyl includes one bonus track) of the music, three original 11\" X 17\" screen-printed release posters, and a sticker. \r\n\r\nThe magnetic-closure portfolio itself is handmade with archival materials, with a screen-printed black-on-black bookcloth cover and white-on-black inner graphics and information. Designed and manufactured by the band, the Born Without A Face Sound Recordings package is being issued in a limited edition of just 300 copies.\r\n\r\n\r\nlabel: Sargent Cherry records\r\n\r\n *** Canadian & overseas orders please email for a shipping quote, these weigh 7 pounds each set and can not be shipped with other records than maybe a few 7\"s!

John Trompetas started in 1980 with the short-lived band Guillotine. The next year, after he met George Havoc Alevras, the bands name changed into Soldiers Of Anarchy. During 1982, George Havoc took over as lead vocalist and along with John Trompetas (bass) and Andreas Ferdianakis (drums) they made their first ever live appearance as Ex Humans (Summer of 1982, at Grava). They usually played at Sofita and Skylamb and in other clubs and music stages of that era. In 1983, Fivos Pergaliotis replaced Andreas in drums and with this line-up they recorded twelve (12) songs, that would be the basis of their one and only full album. In contrast to what is commonly known, a cassette tape (Bluurg Tapes 34), that was released around that period with 5 demo tracks, is not an official release from the band itself, but rather a bootleg, made without the permission of the band. In 1984 Fivos left and George Damellos (from the band Anipofori) took charge behind the drum kit. George Glinelis and Stathis Kaliviotis from the same band participated also as session musicians. This was the line-up that participated in the classic Greek punk compilation “Διαταραξη Κοινης Ησυχιας” (Disorderly Conduct) with two songs, “Εκτυφλωτικη Λαμψη” (Glare) and “Αυτοκτονια Σε Αργη Κινηση” (Slowmotion Suicide) (Its long version  previously unreleased - is included in this album). The band would be active until the summer of 85, when they had to disband for several reasons (George had to serve his time in the army and John was inspired by more harsh and hardcore sounds). Consequently and, after George had returned from the army, they formed Abolish Authority. But thats a different story... The album will come out on Sunday, December 30, 2012 as your New Years Eve nightmare It is fully remastered and the 2 bonus tracks come from a cassette tape, 30 years old. The restoration was not an easy thing to do, but Chris Manolitsis did his best and the result sounds great !! 390 copies have been printed, 225 black and 165 deep transparent red, all of them hand-numbered.

Seven songs over the course of 30 minutes, for the first time ever on vinyl. Limited to 500 copies.\r\n \r\nLife in Peru during the mid-1980’s was a cauldron of simmering tensions threatening to push society over the edge. A Maoist inspired insurgent group promised to level the country into a killing field, Khmer Rouge style. The state’s security apparatus responded in kind, through a scorched earth policy, a catch-22 scenario of killing the patient to cure the disease. Teenagers growing up in the capital of Lima had few outlets to channel the overwhelming dread of those times.\r\n \r\nThe worldwide Trash Metal explosion coupled with the more extreme HC/Punk sounds provided a source of inspiration; a way to exorcise the doom & destruction via the creation of their own apocalyptic noise. This wasn’t easy, in a country with limited resources: A lack of equipment, indifferent studio engineers, frequent power outages, antagonistic adults/peers & the all-too real possibility of\r\n being “mistakenly” shot by the army or the police.\r\n \r\nIt is to Curriculum Mortis credit that in spite of all these obstacles, they succeeded in creating such a vital musical document. The title of the demo, Sentencia De Muerte, takes on a morbid literal meaning. End times were here; society would either be destroyed or irrevocably altered during the year of zero. The pummeling rhythm section, howling guitar riff & the agonizing vocals reflect dark days. Listen closely & you’ll hear the executioner’s song heralding the end of this life/death sentence. --Freddy Alva, 2012\r\n","options":[{"id":31282981,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.5,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.9,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98264167/-/Picture_4.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98264167/-/Picture_4.png","width":453,"height":466}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2186870,"name":"Lp","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]},{"id":7663062,"name":"the CORPSE - \"Fight Against Rules\" LP","permalink":"the-corpse-fight-against-rules-lp","position":255,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-corpse-fight-against-rules-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-24T14:30:13.000Z","description":"The appearance of THE CORPSE in the mid 80s was a milestone, and the opening of a new chapter of the native music scene. This coming from the speakers-Lask formation is rightly seen as a precurso\r\nr of mainstream hardcore in Poland. Their paramount, powerful sound which is a result of HC, thrash metal and punk was a complete surprise and something quite unique for its time. The band had already set a new quality which is then transformed punk movement. It resulted in the second half of the 80th HC entire wave bands that appeared literally across the country (such as the UOM, HCP, Supervision, From Tomorrow, Chaos, Total Attack, Vermin Political Dirt or the Court) issued a lot of fanzines and the creation of a genuinely independent networks, which became the foundation home DIY hardcore punk scene.\r\n The ensemble has performed in a number of Polish regions, including in Jarocin performed. Faced with one hand, and a complete misunderstanding of the rejection of the orthodox crew, and on the other with hot welcomed by the first wave of the home team HC.\r\n With an international network of exchange tapes, recordings of The Corpse were known in many places around the world, met with an enthusiastic reception (at least in American history \"Maximum Rocknroll\" zine). Despite the proposals coming from abroad, the team failed to deliver at the time the wider material (not counting the cartridges, including the split with Moscow and recordings on compilations). This release make up the arrears, so that documentation of native HC / Punk becomes a much more complete. So after almost three years after the release of \"Fight against rules\" CD (Refuse Records), shows a long time awaited vinyl materiałem.W the meantime the band reformed and touring regularly.\r\n This version of the compact received great reviews in zines around the world. Mariam Bastani in Maximum Rock'n'Roll \"wrote:\" THE CORPSE is the best thing I've heard in a while. This is definitely my album years and I'm sure it will go on my top 10, and will be one of my favorite albums for the rest of my life. Yes, it's so good. \"\r\n \r\nThe album \"Fight against rules\" contains 11 tracks from the best team period. It contains recordings from their legendary demo of 1988, extended to the song \"Fight\", recorded in the studio a year later Izabelin (included on the second version of the demo). The CD contains an additional 16-page booklet with biography, history, texts, and lots of archival photos and images of famous team. Mastering recordings made dragon and Hole in Studio As One.

It also brought together two of the strongest scenes of the Eastern Bloc - Polish and Yugoslavian. All of the recordings were done in Borut Cine Studio, in Ljubljana, during Abaddon's tour of Yugoslavia. Invited by Peter Barbaric, they also played a couple of shows with bands like Pankrti or U.B.R. The \"Wet za wet\" LP was then released by New Wave Records from France. Because of this, and also thanks to worldwide tape-traders and the band's appearances on comp. tapes like \"Noise Behind the Iron Dustbin\" or \"Cultural Compost Pit\", as well as a bootleg split-tape with Rejestracja, they were quite well-known beyond their home country. In Poland, their regular performances at the Jarocin Festival and appearances on legendary compilations like \"Fala\" and \"Jak punk to punk\" established the band as one of the classics of the genre.\r\n In the 90s, two bootleg 7\"s of Abaddon were released and in 2001, Pop Noise Records released the CD version of \"Wet za wet.\"\r\n The LP contains 8 fast, direct, and tight Hardcore Punk ragers and a great roots/dub song called \"Ljubljana night.\" Coming from their Polish/Eastern European perspective, the album's lyrics and artwork expressed a protest against any form of authoritarian power - from the brutality of fascism during WWII and the 1981 revolts\r\n in Poland, to more current world problems of the time, like Apartheid in South Africa and the global arms race. In the context of Poland's political climate in the 80s, their lyrics and music were seriously impressive.\r\n Mastering for the reissue was done from the original sources by Jarek Smok at Studio As One (Warsaw). The LP features a gatefold cover, an additional booklet with an exclusive interview with Tomasz Dorn, drummer of Abaddon and plenty of rare photos (including the work of Michał Wasążnik - one of the best documenters of 80s punk in Poland).

Kult music is compact, rugged and sweaty, uncompromising  in the mid-tempo 80's (anarcho) punk of the best kind. All this is spiced with a very strong screaming and determined, varying vocal as a lovely mix of the good (sometimes his way of singing reminiscent of Jello Biafra, Allan Deek and Johnny Rotten).\r\n\r\nTheir lyrics were socially critical, brave and clear, but clever and very bold and uncomfortable and difficult to manage. Therefore heavily guarded and forbidden!\r\n\r\nAlthough the O!Kult was one of the most radical bands in ex-Yu and their songs were banned from playing on the radio to avoid that their music would affect and damage the fine and normative youth, label SKUC gave out their only cassette (first in 300 and then 200 copies). \r\n\r\nHere no one will be disappointed and those who like anarcho punk will get a nice surprise!\r\n\r\nLTD 680 copies (450 black, 230 red vinyl) in great 4-color gatefold sleeve, printed inner with english lyrics...\r\n\r\nAll songs are remastered!!\r\n\r\nNE!Records \r\n\r\nwww.nerecords.se\r\n","options":[{"id":26876988,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.75,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84156609/-/300_1-o-kult-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84156609/-/300_1-o-kult-1.jpg","width":300,"height":302},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84156951/-/2__O__Kult_inside.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84156951/-/2__O__Kult_inside.jpg","width":1000,"height":496},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84157029/-/3_O__Kult.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84157029/-/3_O__Kult.jpg","width":988,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84157389/-/4_O__Kult__innersleeve.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84157389/-/4_O__Kult__innersleeve.jpg","width":1000,"height":495},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84157497/-/5_Label_A.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84157497/-/5_Label_A.jpg","width":532,"height":532}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2186868,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":4733735,"name":"NE! records, (Sweden)","permalink":"ne-records-sweden","url":"/category/ne-records-sweden"}]},{"id":7879227,"name":"KUZLE – ARCHIVED - \"PRAZNA GENERACIJA/NAREDTE REVOLUCIJO\" Lp + cd","permalink":"kuzle-archived-prazna-generacija-naredte-revolucijo-lp-cd","position":261,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kuzle-archived-prazna-generacija-naredte-revolucijo-lp-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-07T20:39:21.000Z","description":"Kuzle (the Bitches) belongs to the core of second wave of Slovenian punk from the early 80’s.\r\n\r\nI my opinion they were simply one of the best bands - they had everything a good punk band needs: brilliant courageous rebellious lyrics that melted in good played energetic music. \r\n\r\nOn top of that they had very expressive and explosive visuality and stole the stage every time they played. \r\n\r\nThey really had all they needed to make it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLike many other quality bands from ex-Yu (Termiti,Problemi, Mrtvi Kanal…) what made them so good and interesting was what hindered them from getting what they deserved; a record deal.

Early Italian Hardcore with members of 5° Braccio, Plastination and the very first line-ups of NEGAZIONE and DECLINO. This was the missing band in the classic Torino HC/Punk reissues (Declino, 5° Braccio, Contr-Azione, Negazione etc) and certainly the most raging and political.. a furious mix of Wretched and Disorder, very fast for the time it was recorded.
