Tiny detailed stitching (including faux front pockets and zipper) is completed before the jeans are distressed.\r\n\r\nA lot of time and experimentation (and yes! painful mistakes along the way) have gone into perfecting these tiny distressed jeans.\r\n\r\nJeans will vary as they are all unique. The process to make these little gems is very tedious and time consuming and only done a few times a year. Due to the nature of the process - each pair is unique.\r\n\r\nFabric/care details: Jeans are 100% cotton, Machine washable. Minimal Machine Drying is good - finish by Air Dry to prevent shrinkage.\r\n\r\nJust like people jeans these jeans need to be stretched out a little after washing. In other words - they'll be a little tight when your doll first puts them on - but, they stretch out with wear.\r\n\r\nThis is for the jeans only. Doll, shoes, shirts, accessories not included.\r\n\r\nReady to ship!\r\n\r\nShipping prices have risen in the US recently, please be aware that all shipping from SqueakyMonkey includes insurance.\r\n","options":[{"id":34718778,"name":"Default","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102545152/-/jeans_mhlong2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102545152/-/jeans_mhlong2.jpg","width":533,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4087686,"name":"Monster High","permalink":"monster-high","url":"/category/monster-high"}]}]
