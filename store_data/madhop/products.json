On his second album, the producer from Krakow follows the path he marked out on his debut \"White Mice\" (Asphalt Records, 2011). Outcome oscillates on the border of experimental hip-hop and electronics introducing a consistent climate. A novelty for fans of Minoo may be invited guests. We can hear not only great Polish MC's and producer (O.S.T.R., Teielte, ZBRKLKU) but also from those from other countries (Jon Kennedy, 3ck, Oh-Neco, Pixelord). All the World is released in two versions - digital , which you can download for free with Bandcamp, and on exclusive transparent vinyl, which you can buy directly from Mad-Hop Label. After official vinyl premier (1.08.2012) you can bay it also Asphaltshop, and in many music shop around the word (actual list is in Mad-Hop site).
