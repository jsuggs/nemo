The Skunk2 Rear Lower Control Arms are forged from aircraft quality AL2024 billet aluminum, precision CNC machined and are over 25% lighter than stock arms. Skunk2 Lower Control Arms feature adjustable sway bar mounting holes so you can fine tune the feel and balance of the rear suspension, and also feature low deflection polyurethane bushing which act as bearings for quicker response and a more positive feel.

The results are the best performing, best fitting intake system available.\r\n\r\nSkunk2’s Cold-Air Intake is manufactured from molded polymer plastic for superior intake air insulation when compared to aluminum as well as for a smooth, continuous taper. When compared to aluminum, the thicker polymer material results in a superior thermal barrier and lower intake air temperatures. Each kit includes a 3.5-inch internal diameter lower tube and a tapered, 3.5-inch to 3.0-inch internal diameter upper tube that connects to the factory throttle body with a high-quality, silicone connector (larger diameter connectors for use with Skunk2 throttle bodies or similar sold separately). The two piece design and supplied MAF sensor adapter allows for compatibility with vehicles utilizing the factory ECU. A silicone coupler featuring a smooth, tapered transition between the two tubes is also included for vehicles equipped with aftermarket engine management systems that don’t utilize MAF sensors.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to reduce the possibility of submerging the air filter during wet conditions, Skunk2’s design positions the air filter downward-facing for approximately two inches of additional ground clearance when compared to competitors’ designs that locate the air filter from the side. That, combined with a design that doesn’t require cutting or modifying the factory fender liners, greatly reduces the chances of water entering the intake during wet conditions.\r\n\r\nEach Cold-Air Intake kit includes relocation hardware for the battery, ECU, fuse box, and cooling system reservoir tank as well as high-quality stainless steel clamps and mounting hardware. Unlike other intake systems, only Skunk2’s unique design and brackets allow for the OEM battery to be retained. A specially shaped, silicone upper radiator hose is also included with each kit to ensure maximum clearance for the intake tubing and proper fitment.\r\n\r\nSkunk2 developed its unique Cold-Air Intake system in 2009 for back-to-back Grand-Am champions and racing partners Compass360 Racing. Now that the team is retiring its eighth-generation Civic race cars, we can finally release this race-proven technology to enthusiasts.","options":[{"id":49891773,"name":"Default","price":325.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128843781/-/skunk2cain12civsi.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128843781/-/skunk2cain12civsi.jpg","width":796,"height":533},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128843736/-/343-05-0200a_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128843736/-/343-05-0200a_1.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128843769/-/SK2-343-05-0100_05-800x533.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128843769/-/SK2-343-05-0100_05-800x533.jpg","width":800,"height":533},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128843757/-/cold-air-intake-cai-skunk2-para-civic-si_MLB-F-3859620139_022013.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128843757/-/cold-air-intake-cai-skunk2-para-civic-si_MLB-F-3859620139_022013.jpg","width":800,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6296862,"name":"Engine Components","permalink":"engine-components","url":"/category/engine-components"},{"id":6723279,"name":"Honda/Acura","permalink":"honda-acura","url":"/category/honda-acura"}]},{"id":15419265,"name":"Agency Power Short-throw shift lever","permalink":"agency-power-sti-6-spd-short-throw-shift-lever","position":13,"price":90.0,"default_price":90.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/agency-power-sti-6-spd-short-throw-shift-lever","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-08T20:06:58.000Z","description":"Agency Power Short Shifter: Agency Power Short Shifters are available for your performance vehicle needs.

The turbocharger kit is designed from top to bottom specifically to the FR-S and BRZ, and consists of the all the parts necessary to bolt the kit up to the car. \r\n\r\nWe utilize an AVO18/49 turbocharger that mounts up under the front of the engine via our stainless steel unequal exhaust manifold, and then it bolts up to the stock exhaust with our polished stainless steel turbo outlet (also referred to as a downpipe). \r\n\r\nCooling the pressurized air is an aluminum bar and plate front mount intercooler which uses black piping throughout, mechanical oil scavenging pump, oil reservoir tank, and all necessary water and oil hoses and fittings. \r\n\r\nThis turbokit has been designed to bolt up to the stock air intake box and to the stock exhaust system. We have spent a lot of time ensuring it will work with the standard fueling system for a complete bolt on and go setup. The beauty of the system is that it looks very stock from above! The FMIC has been specifically designed to fit with the standard bumper without trimming as well, and on FR-S models would be be difficult to see unless you are looking for it.\r\n\r\n*So what can you expect from this kit?*\r\nFrom our testing, you will see anywhere from 220 to 250whp on pump gas, dependent entirely upon the quality of the pump gas. We saw 230whp (276 crank hp) and 197 ft/lbs of torque at 5-6 psi on 92 octane gas literally from a nearby Chevron gas station. This was with the stock airbox with an AVO high-flow panel filter installed, and a stock secondary cat in place.

It will not reduce the life of your factory computer because it is designed to draw the same ammount of power as the factory BCS but flows better and reacts faster. It plugs in and requires no splicing or soldering of resistors. With the included bracket you can bolt it in, plug in the connector, and start tuning for fast boost response, increased boost pressure and free up lots of power. Planning on returning the car to stock? Just reverse installation.\r\n\r\n*Why run an Electronic BCS over a Manual Boost Controller?*\r\nA MBC allows you to run higher than stock boost levels by preventing the wastegate from opening at its rated pressure. It does a great job at this but if boost is available under the MBC setting it will give you that full boost. So for instance, you set your MBC to 18psi because from 3000-6000rpm thats what you want. But then say you get detonation with 18psi when you are at 7000rpm unless you are below 16psi. With a MBC, you do not have this control so you are forced to run 16psi through the entire rev range. With an electronic boost controller you could run 18psi from 3000-6000 and 16psi at 7000rpm because you can tune the boost map in the ECU which will allow you to run the maximum amount of boost at every given rpm. This gives you more power throughout the range and better control. Revolutionizing the boost solenoid market, we have created model specific install brackets that allow you to directly fit our Boost Solenoid into your vehicle for a factory fit. No more Zip-tying! We give you the factory fitment you have been waiting for.\r\n\r\nStaying with the OEM fitment theme, the GrimmSpeed Electronic Boost Control Solenoid uses an OEM style wiring harness so you can simply unplug your OEM solenoid and plug ours in. No more cutting the oem wiring and crimping wires together!\r\n\r\nAlso new to the electronic boost solenoid market, we have used ultra low-profile hose fittings to keep the unit as small and clean as possible. The hose fittings are nickel plated brass so you don't have to worry about them snapping off like the plastic hose fittings!\r\n\r\n*More Features*\r\n* Users can use AN fittings with the solenoid.\r\n* MAC Valve has completely custom made the valve for us(only MAC valve on the market to be custom made for automotive tuning use).\r\n* Specifically designed by GrimmSpeed™ to work safely with the factory ECU (requires tuning) and to reliably handle the vibrations and temperatures of your engine bay!\r\n* Direct bolt in mounting bracket and hardware included!\r\n* Faster response and greater flow than any other valve out there. (by more than 10%!)\r\n* Nickel plated brass fittings. (unlike the competitors failure prone plastic fittings)\r\n\r\nRETAIL: $119.00","options":[{"id":48965964,"name":"02-05 WRX","price":106.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48965967,"name":"04-08 Subaru Forester XT / 06-07 WRX / 04-07 STi","price":106.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48965970,"name":"05-09 Subaru LGT / 08  WRX ","price":106.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48965973,"name":" 05-07 MazdaSpeed6","price":106.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48965976,"name":" 07-10  Mazdaspeed3","price":106.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48965979,"name":"08-10  Evo X ","price":106.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48965982,"name":"10  Hyundai Genesis","price":106.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128173092/-/mcQdnUtijk7W5aQ8VzpB9AA.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128173092/-/mcQdnUtijk7W5aQ8VzpB9AA.jpg","width":225,"height":225},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128173107/-/sub.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128173107/-/sub.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6423231,"name":"Turbo Components","permalink":"turbo-components","url":"/category/turbo-components"}]},{"id":14580603,"name":" BLOX Racing Brake Booster Elimi-Plate Honda/Acura","permalink":"blox-racing-brake-booster-elimi-plate-honda-acura","position":31,"price":48.0,"default_price":48.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/blox-racing-brake-booster-elimi-plate-honda-acura","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-02T23:22:41.000Z","description":"The Elimi-Plate is ideal for enthusiasts looking to clean up their engine bay presentation by putting that final touch on their brakeline tuck.

Skunk2 Lost Motion Assemblies will fit any B-Series DOHC VTEC engine (Type-R/GSR B16A, B17A, B18C).\r\n\r\nThe Skunk2 Lost Motion Assembly is an advance spring device that is designed to put pre-load on the center portion of the VTEC rocker when it is in the unlocked position (when VTEC mode is disabled). During extended operating conditions, the contaminants in the oil will more than likely cause the piston to seize resulting in the VTEC rocker rattling when VTEC is not engaging or when the vehicle is in idle.\r\n\r\nEach Skunk2 Lost Motion Assembly is manufactured exclusively from chrome silicone steel using the latest 3D CAD (Computer Aided Design) modeling and FEA (Finite Element Analysis) to ensure maximum optimization. Each chrome silicone steel spring features a hardened tip for added durability. Skunk2 engineers then tested and proved their design on the engine dyno as well as the race track.\r\n\r\nThe Skunk2 Lost Motion Assembly Kit replaces the factory piston-style LMA design with an improved design commonly found in newer generation Honda engines. Replacing LMA's are recommended when installing aftermarket camshafts and required when installing Skunk2 Pro Series and other high-lift camshafts.\r\n\r\nEach Lost Motion Assembly Kit includes a set of 8 assemblies for an entire Honda DOHC VTEC B-Series 4-cylinder engine (Type-R/GSR, B16A, B17A, B18C) and are compatible with all camshafts. When using camshafts with +12.5mm lift, LMA's are an absolute must, and Skunk2 Lost Motion Assembly springs are 3 percent stiffer than ITR springs.","options":[{"id":47537832,"name":"Default","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127135290/-/g-923-a31f67a56866d72861a259f4cf94a2ba5cf19c9d.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127135290/-/g-923-a31f67a56866d72861a259f4cf94a2ba5cf19c9d.jpg","width":796,"height":533},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127134987/-/800lma10.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127134987/-/800lma10.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127135008/-/1251997871-Skunk2_logo.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127135008/-/1251997871-Skunk2_logo.jpg","width":424,"height":90}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5385492,"name":"Engine Internals","permalink":"engine-internals","url":"/category/engine-internals"}]},{"id":14602191,"name":"Eibach 25mm Front & 19mm Rear Anti-Roll-Kit for 13 Scion FR-S / 13 Subaru BRZ ","permalink":"eibach-25mm-front-19mm-rear-anti-roll-kit-for-13-scion-fr-s-13-subaru-brz","position":46,"price":450.0,"default_price":450.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/eibach-25mm-front-19mm-rear-anti-roll-kit-for-13-scion-fr-s-13-subaru-brz","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-04T02:50:52.000Z","description":"The Eibach Sway Bars are the perfect compliment to any aftermarket suspension upgrade you make on the Scion FR-S and Subaru BRZ.

                       Skunk2 Pro-Series Camber Kit - Rear: \r\nThe design of Skunk2 Rear Camber Kits is based on camber kits that have been used in Skunk2 race cars for many years. Skunk2 Rear Camber Kits are a must if you want to fine tune your rear suspension. With the ability to adjust positive and negative camber, you can reduce tire wear and significantly improve your vehicle’s handling. Made from forged alloy steel and aircraft quality AL7075 aluminum, Skunk2 Rear Camber Kits feature low deflection polyurethane bushings. The bushings act as a bearing allowing your camber kit to pivot smoothly without the harsh side effects of using actual spherical bearings. Unlike the steel and rubber bushings that are found on low quality rear camber kits, these will not tear or break free. The Skunk2 Rear Camber Kit is the perfect choice for street and race applications, and works even better when used in conjunction with Skunk2 Rear Lower Arms, Arm Bars, Strut Bars, and Front Camber Kits.","options":[{"id":46946844,"name":" Pro Series 88-00 Honda Civic/CRX/Del Sol/90-01 Acura Integra Adjustable Rear Camber Kits ","price":170.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46946847,"name":" Pro Series 01-05 Honda Civic/02-05 Civic Si/02-06 Acura TSX Adjustable Rear Camber Kits","price":180.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46946850,"name":" Pro Series 06-09 Honda Civic Gold Anodized Adjustable Rear Camber Kits ","price":300.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46946853,"name":" Pro Series 06-09 Honda Civic Hard Anodized Adjustable Rear Camber Kits ","price":300.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126693762/-/3892_2_lg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126693762/-/3892_2_lg.jpg","width":900,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126693744/-/516-05-0520.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126693744/-/516-05-0520.jpg","width":360,"height":291},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126693741/-/12_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126693741/-/12_1.jpg","width":1000,"height":669},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126693750/-/927-1166-thickbox.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126693750/-/927-1166-thickbox.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126693801/-/SK2-516-05-0520_01-800x533.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126693801/-/SK2-516-05-0520_01-800x533.jpg","width":800,"height":533}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5385477,"name":"Suspension","permalink":"suspension","url":"/category/suspension"}]},{"id":14448345,"name":"Tein Street Flex Coilovers","permalink":"tein-street-flex-coilovers","position":53,"price":1350.0,"default_price":1350.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tein-street-flex-coilovers","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-27T23:54:26.000Z","description":"                               TEIN Dampers - Street Flex: \r\nThe Street Flex damper is the evolution of our popular Type Flex coilover.

The Chro-Molly will last just as long as the stock units that they will replace. Unlike Titanium these will not become brittle over time. They are only a few grams heavier than Titanium and will not affect performance. GSC Chro-Molly retainers are universal to use with either our single valve springs or our dual springs. The single valve springs do not require a new seat or different seals where as the duals will.\r\n\r\nA set of valve springs can be changed in a matter of 2 hours with the correct tools, and is the best insurance a car with upgraded cams can have. The single springs have been tested higher but we suggest a max rev limit of 8500rpms. If higher revs or prolonged periods of revving i.e. road race applications, we suggest going to our dual springs which is more stable at higher rpms and can be revved to 10500rpms. The Single Spring kit includes: Single springs 78@39.6 with either Titanium or Chro-Molly Retainer. \r\n\r\n\r\n*Beehive Spring Set*\r\nGSC Power-Division Beehive springs feature some of the most impressive manufacturing techniques in the industry. Our beehive spring uses an ovate wire which utilizes advanced material heat treatment methods for superior load loss capabilities. What this means to you is our spring has the highest level of spring load retention while still maintaining good fatigue threw out the life of the spring.\r\n\r\nThe retainer side of the valve spring has a smaller diameter to greatly reduce coil spring surging and improve valve control even at extreme rpm levels.\r\n\r\nOnly the best materials go into the GSC Power-Division Beehive valve spring. Each batch is scrutinized for tensile strength properties, ductility, inclusion content, and fatigue toughness.\r\n\r\nEach new design is tested to 9,000RPMS so you can rest assure that you have the best possible valve spring set available on the market.\r\n\r\nThe GSC Beehive spring is a factory replacement and will use your stock OEM retainer and Valve Seat to ensure an easy install.","options":[{"id":46658943,"name":"Subaru EJ Turbo Series Valve Spring Kit (set of 16) ","price":255.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46658946,"name":"EJ257 Beehive Valve Springs w/ Titanium Retainer Valvetrain Kit (Use factory spring seats) ","price":369.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46658949,"name":"2JZ Beehive Valve Springs w/ Titanium Retainer Valvetrain Kit (Use factory spring seats) ","price":522.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46658952,"name":"4G63T EVO 7-9 Stage 1 Beehive Valve Springs (Use factory retainers and spring seats) ","price":199.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46658955,"name":"VQ35DE (turbo High Rev) Beehive Valve Spring and Titanium Retainer Kit ","price":522.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46658958,"name":"VR38DETT Beehive Spring Set w/ Titanium Retainer Kit ","price":522.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46658961,"name":"4G63T EVO 1-9 Stage 3 Beehive Valve Springs w/ Titanium Retainer Valvetrain Kit ","price":369.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46658964,"name":"4B11T / 4B11 Theta Beehive Valve Springs w/ Titanium Retainer Valvetrain Kit (Use factory spring seats) ","price":369.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46658967,"name":"VQ35DE Single Spring w/ Titanium Retainer Valvetrain Kit ","price":522.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46658970,"name":"2JZGTE/2JZGE/VVTI Variants Valve Spring Kit (set of 24) ","price":382.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46658973,"name":"4G63T EVO 1-9 Stage 2 Beehive Valve Springs w/ Titanium Retainer Valvetrain Kit (Use factory spring seats) ","price":369.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46658976,"name":"SR20 Single Spring w/ Titanium Retainer Valvetrain Kit ","price":369.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46658979,"name":"K-series Vtec K20/K24 Beehive Valve Spring and Titanium Retainer Kit Higher REV ","price":386.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46658982,"name":"7MGTE Beehive Valve Spring and Titanium Retainer Kit ","price":522.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46658985,"name":"B-Series Vtec Dual Spring Set and Titanium Retainer ","price":310.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46658988,"name":"Hyundai G4KF Theta Beehive Valve Spring and Titanium Retainer Kit ","price":369.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126491634/-/4846.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126491634/-/4846.jpg","width":352,"height":352},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126491637/-/5743.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126491637/-/5743.jpg","width":800,"height":694},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126491649/-/gscpowerdivision.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126491649/-/gscpowerdivision.jpg","width":150,"height":100}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5385492,"name":"Engine Internals","permalink":"engine-internals","url":"/category/engine-internals"}]},{"id":14424540,"name":"Perrin Intercooler Kits","permalink":"perrin-intercooler-kits","position":58,"price":900.0,"default_price":900.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/perrin-intercooler-kits","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-10-26T14:54:39.000Z","description":"                                 Perrin Intercooler Kits\r\nThe process of compressing incoming air to create boost and power also has a nasty byproduct of heat. Heated air lacks the density to make higher horsepower, increases detonation and forces the ECU to pull timing. All of which reduce the power you are looking to create.\r\n\r\nEasy solutions do exist for this problem and PERRIN offers several choices for your vehicle and personal taste.\r\n\r\n* For mild modifications and a stealthy look turn to our Top Mount Intercooler upgrades, available for Impreza, Forester, and Legacy models. These bar and plate cores offer more surface area per square inch than cheap tube and fin choices from our less worthy competitors and the overall size is more than 200% of the OEM unit! \r\n\r\n* The PERRIN Front Mount Intercooler upgrades offer gargantuan cores, cast endtanks, high velocity tubing and proper mounting supports - there simply isn’t a better choice for your car - period. These intercoolers will support more than 1000 HP and due to our stringent quality control process have less than 1/4 psi drop across the core at 20 psi., improving throttle response and putting the boost where it belongs in the the combustion chamber!\r\n\r\nAll PERRIN Intercoolers are true 'bolt-on' although many kits do include replacement piping, silicon, mounting hardware and clamps. PERRIN Performance intercooler boost tubes are mandrel bent and offered in a High Luster Polish or a Wrinkle Red 'Signature Series' for Subaru applications. PERRIN Boost tubes are specifically optimally sized and designed to shorten air paths lowering boost lag. Silicone couplers with special hose clamps secure all piping insuring leak free operation.","options":[{"id":46674057,"name":" LGT/08 WRX Black TMIC (Top Mount Intercooler) ","price":766.8,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46674060,"name":" 08  WRX/STi FMIC Black Core and Beam ","price":789.3,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46674063,"name":" 08  STi FMIC Red Boost Tubes w/ Black Silicone ","price":740.7,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46674066,"name":"08  WRX/STi FMIC Silver Core and Beam ","price":789.3,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46674069,"name":"02-07 WRX/STi FMIC Black Core and Beam ","price":789.3,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46674072,"name":" 02-07 WRX/STi FMIC Silver Core and Beam ","price":789.3,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46674075,"name":" LGT/08 WRX Silver TMIC","price":766.8,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46674078,"name":" 02-07 WRX/STi FMIC Red Boost Tubes w/ Black Silicone ","price":740.7,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46674081,"name":" Perrin Silver Front Mount Intercooler for 08-10 Mitsubishi Evolution X ","price":900.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46674084,"name":"Perrin Black Front Mount Intercooler for 08-10 Mitsubishi Evolution X ","price":900.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46674093,"name":" 02-07 WRX/STi FMIC Silver Boost Tubes w/ Black Silicone ","price":720.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46674090,"name":"08  WRX FMIC Red Boost Tubes w/ Black Silicone ","price":740.7,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46674087,"name":" 08  WRX FMIC Black Boost Tubes w/ Black Silicone ","price":740.7,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126505047/-/image_02_600_(1).jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126505047/-/image_02_600_(1).jpg","width":600,"height":407},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126505074/-/perrinfmic.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126505074/-/perrinfmic.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126505083/-/perrin-fmic-kits-08-wrx-and-sti-psp-eng-43x-1149-14337-lrg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126505083/-/perrin-fmic-kits-08-wrx-and-sti-psp-eng-43x-1149-14337-lrg.jpg","width":1159,"height":808},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126504990/-/1077.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126504990/-/1077.jpg","width":600,"height":417},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126505038/-/image_02_600.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126505038/-/image_02_600.jpg","width":600,"height":417}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6423231,"name":"Turbo Components","permalink":"turbo-components","url":"/category/turbo-components"}]},{"id":14159085,"name":"Turbo XS Downpipe","permalink":"turbo-xs-downpipe","position":59,"price":255.15,"default_price":255.15,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/turbo-xs-downpipe","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-14T01:52:46.000Z","description":"                              Turbo XS Downpipe\r\n* MITSUBISHI EVOLUTION\r\nT304 Stainless Full 3\" with a custom flange that allows the factory cat pipe to bolt up to the exhaust system without having to neck down.\r\n\r\n* SUBARU WRX/STi\r\nMade from heavy gauge 4\" inside diameter 304 stainless steel, the Turbo XS Downpipe is larger than any other WRX/STi Downpipe on the market.

To accommodate the needs of the market, a significant change was made in 1998 by adding an oversized rectangular shaped top mount for increased positive camber adjustment. In 2000 we pioneered the use of a one-piece forged ball joint. And in 2004 the [patent pending] Pro-Series ball joint was introduced. Today this same design has become the industry reference standard. The Skunk2 Camber Kits are the number one choice of many pro racing teams and have been on Honda Factory road race cars since 1997. By replacing your factory upper control arms with Skunk2 camber kits, you gain the ability to correct negative camber that results from lowering your vehicle. Skunk2 front camber kits allow tuners to accurately dial in their suspension settings utilizing quick adjustment sliding ball joints. With over +/- 3 degrees of adjustment our camber kits can minimize the effects of negative camber, help reduce abnormal tire wear, and increase stability at high speeds. Skunk2 camber kits are ideal for race or street applications. Available in Pro-Series Plus, Pro-Series, and Tuner Series.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRO-SERIES PLUS\r\nThis is Skunk2's flagship camber kit for enthusiasts that are serious about performance. Each camber kit comes with Skunk2's one-piece forged [patent pending] Pro-Series balljoint. The Pro-Series balljoint features a low profile top plate for additional clearance and higher clamping loads for no-slip performance; and can quickly be adjusted from the bottom-up. The Pro-Plus camber kit also includes 3-piece low-deflection polyurethane bushings that dramatically improve handling response, feel, and performance.\r\n\r\nPRO-SERIES\r\nThis is recommended as a good entry-level camber kit. The Pro-Series camber kit features the same one-piece forged Pro-Series balljoint used in the Pro-Plus kit, but instead of polyurethane bushings, the Pro uses standard high quality rubber bushings. Though the Pro kit is slightly more expensive than the Tuner series, the benefits and convenience offered by the Pro-Series ball joint provide excellent value.\r\n\r\nTUNERSERIES\r\nFor the budget minded enthusiast there's the Tuner Series; which is the same classic design that Skunk2 has been offering to enthusiasts for over a decade. Each arm includes standard one-piece forged ball joint, and uses standard rubber bushings. The Tuner series also includes [patent pending] “square” washer plate for improved clamping performance and durability. Not only does the Tuner Series offer more features and superior quality over “clone” camber kits, it is also competitively priced. \r\n\r\nIf you can have Skunk2, why settle for less?","options":[{"id":46945506,"name":"Pro Series 88-91 Honda Civic/90-93 Acura Integra/04-08 Acura TSX Front Camber Kit Ball Joint ","price":37.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46945509,"name":"Pro Series 92-00 Honda Civic/94-01 Acura Integra Front Camber Kit Ball Joint and Top Plate ","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46945512,"name":" Pro Series 88-91 Honda Civic/CRX Adjustable Front Camber Kits ( /- 3.3 Degrees) ","price":220.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46945515,"name":" Pro Series 96-00 Honda Civic Adjustable Front Camber Kits ( /- 5 Degrees) ","price":207.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46945518,"name":" Pro Series 92-95 Honda Civic/94-01 Acura Integra Adjustable Front Camber Kits ( /- 5 Deg) ","price":207.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46945521,"name":" Pro Series 90-93 Acura Integra Adjustable Front Camber Kits ( /- 3.3 Degrees) ","price":220.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46945524,"name":" Pro Series Plus 92-95 Honda Civic/94-01 Acura Integra Adjustable Front Camber Kits ( /- 4 Deg) ","price":230.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46945527,"name":" Pro Series Plus 96-00 Honda Civic Adjustable Front Camber Kits ( /- 4 Degrees) ","price":230.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46945530,"name":" Pro Series 03-06 Acura TSX/04-08 TL Adjustable Front Camber Kits","price":300.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":46945533,"name":" Classic Series 96-00 Honda Civic Adjustable Front Camber Kits ( /- 4 Degrees) ","price":190.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46945536,"name":" Classic Series 92-95 Honda Civic/94-01 Acura Integra Adjustable Front Camber Kits ( /- 4 Deg) ","price":190.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126692796/-/skunk2-pro-series-front-camber-kit-acura-integra-516-05-5670-500x500.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126692796/-/skunk2-pro-series-front-camber-kit-acura-integra-516-05-5670-500x500.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126692952/-/1251997871-Skunk2_logo.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126692952/-/1251997871-Skunk2_logo.jpg","width":424,"height":90},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126692760/-/1355966682-1330456032-ef-proplus-041.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126692760/-/1355966682-1330456032-ef-proplus-041.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126692823/-/thumbnail.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126692823/-/thumbnail.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5385477,"name":"Suspension","permalink":"suspension","url":"/category/suspension"}]},{"id":14182017,"name":"Skunk2 Pro Series Full Coilovers","permalink":"skunk2-pro-series-full-coilovers","position":63,"price":720.0,"default_price":720.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/skunk2-pro-series-full-coilovers","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-15T02:26:46.000Z","description":"                              Skunk2 Pro-Series Full Coilovers\r\nSkunk2 Pro-Series high performance coilovers are based on over a decade of racing and suspension tuning experience. The advanced technology used in numerous road racing and drag racing championships is now being applied to Skuns2's new line of Pro-Series coilover suspensions. Skunk2’s track and street tested valving offers the perfect balance for the daily drive or for spirited performance driving.\r\n\r\nPro-Series coilovers feature shortened shock bodies and shortened shaft strokes so suspension travel can be maintained on lowered vehicles for improved performance and comfort. With Skunk2 coilovers, enthusiasts can quickly and precisely set ride heights and corner weights to improve the vehicle’s handling response, cornering ability, stability, and balance. \r\n\r\nPro-Series Coilover suspension is offered in a nonadjustable dual-tube PRO-S design, or PRO-C adjustable mono-tube design.

Skunk2 springs are CNC-wound using the highest quality SAE9254V spring steel. Each spring is designed to optimize the balance between performance and comfort, and are custom matched to PRO-S dampers. PRO-S dampers provide an average drop from 1” to 3” for a sporty yet aggressive look.

Similar to Skunk2’s industry-leading Pro-C Coilovers, Pro-S II Coilovers now feature double-adjustable ride height and a state-of-the-art mono-tube design. Thanks to threaded shock bodies, Pro-S II Coilovers now offer height adjustments independent of spring preload, which results in ride-height changes as low as three inches without sacrificing shock travel or ride comfort. Quick and precise ride-height adjustments can now be made for dialing in corner balancing as well as for improved handling, responsiveness, and overall balance. Skunk2’s track- and street-tested Pro-S II shock valving offers the perfect balance between daily driving and track performance and its all-new, shortened shock bodies and reduced shaft strokes help maintain adequate suspension travel on lowered vehicles for improved performance without sacrificing comfort.\r\n\r\nPro-S II Coilovers feature vehicle-specific valving dialed in by Skunk2’s suspension engineers, carefully selected springs designed to dramatically improve handling, and a race-inspired, mono-tube design for superior performance. Skunk2’s micro-polished, mono-tube design, combined with its precision-machined, oversized shafts and pistons, ensure that each Pro-S II Coilover is both responsive and durable. The results are unmatched cornering grip, reduced body roll, and a feel of vehicle control and stability like no other.\r\n\r\nLike all Skunk2 Coilovers, its Pro-S II Coilovers feature hard-anodized, CNC-machined, forged 6061-T6 aluminum spring perches and CNC-wound racing springs manufactured from high-quality, SAE9254V spring steel. Each spring is designed to optimize the balance between comfort and performance and is custom-matched to their respective shocks. Pro-S II Coilovers offer ride-height adjustments as low as three inches for an aggressive and sporty appearance.\r\n\r\nJust like the entire Pro Series lineup, Pro-S II Coilovers set the benchmark for suspension performance. Similar to how Skunk2’s Pro Series Camshafts and Valvetrain revolutionized Honda engine performance, its fully adjustable, Pro-S II Coilovers do just that for enthusiasts who are looking for high-performance suspension components at an affordable price.

They’re proud to advertise their products as being equipped with ARP rod bolts. And for good reason. The “weak link” in a connecting rod has always been the bolt, and racers know that nobody builds a better bolt than ARP. However, it is critically important to monitor the stretch of each bolt and replace it when it has permanently elongated by .0005˝. Below you will find an extensive listing of aftermarket connecting rods and replacement bolt specifications.\r\n\r\nIn some instances, you may want to go to an ARP rod bolt made from a better grade of material. This will provide you with improved reliability. However, please understand that when you want bolts made from exotic, super high strength materials, the cost will increase significantly. If you’re on a budget, it’s best to go with the most cost-effective solution. This is typically defined by the loads that are carried by the bolts in terms of piston/rod weight and the rotational speed of the engine. The most cost effective design is the one in which the bolt strength is just great enough to handle its anticipated load – plus a safety margin for the occasional overloads. Using a material which has far more strength than required is not as cost effective – but will definitely give you an extra margin of safety and longer service life.\r\n\r\nYou should also know that ARP rod bolts are superior to those from other manufacturers. Especially in the area of fatigue strength. Testing has shown ARP rod bolts to have ten times the fatigue strength of other bolts. In the chart below, you’ll find a bar chart that graphically shows the difference between ARP Pro Series rod bolts and the fastener made by a leading competitor. It’s easy to see why ARP bolts are superior. As such, it makes good sense to rely on ARP for optimum connecting rod service and reliability. Make the most of your racing budget and rely on ARP rod bolts. You’ll find the ARP name proudly stamped on each bolt as your assurance of quality.\r\n\r\n*Features*\r\n* Forged in-house at ARP using only the finest quality materials\r\n* Heat-treated using special vertical racks to assure complete 360° penetration\r\n* Threads rolled after heat-treat to provide up to 10-times longer fatigue strength\r\n* Precision CNC-machined to exacting specifications\r\n* Specially designed for optimum reliability in each application\r\n\r\n*Wave-Loc Features*\r\n* Wave-Loc surface contacts the rod and cap for optimum alignment and reduction of fluctuating stress – which strengthens the rod itself!\r\n* Provides snug fit for all OEM connecting rods (interference range of .001˝ to .005˝), despite wide range of factory rod bolt hole tolerances.\r\n* Available for most applications.\r\n* Superior material grain flow because of patented Wave-Loc surface design as compared to knurled bolts that have sharp edges and “built-in” stress risers.\r\n* Galling and scoring of the rod is virtually eliminated because there\r\nis only smooth contact and absolutely no “digging.”\r\n\r\n*Materials Used In ARP Connecting Rod Bolts*\r\n*8740 CHROME MOLY:* Until the development of today’s modern alloys, chrome moly was popularly considered a high strength material. Now viewed as only moderate strength, 8740 chrome moly is seen as a good tough steel, with adequate fatigue properties for most racing applications, but only if the threads are rolled after heat-treatment, as is the standard ARP production practice. Typically, chrome moly is classified as a quench and temper steel, that can be heat-treated to deliver tensile strengths between 180,000 and 210,000 psi.\r\n\r\n*AERMET:* With a typical tensile strength of 290,000-310,000 psi, Aermet is a new martensitic super-alloy that is stronger and less expensive than the super-alloy austenitic materials that follow. Because it is capable of achieving incredibly high clamping loads, it is ideal for short but extreme environments like top fuel, funny car and some short track applications. Although Aermet is a maraging steel that is far superior to other high strength steels in its resistance to stress corrosion, it must be kept well-oiled and not exposed to moisture.\r\n\r\n*ARP2000:* ARP2000 is an alloy steel that can be safely heat treated to a higher level, producing a greater strength material than 8740. While 8740 and ARP2000 share similar characteristics – ARP2000 is capable of achieving a clamp load at 220,000 psi. ARP2000 is used widely in short track and drag racing as an up-grade from 8740 chrome moly in both steel and aluminum rods. Stress corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement are typically not a problem, providing care is taken during installation.\r\n\r\n*L19:* This is a premium steel that is processed to deliver superior strength and fatigue properties. L19 is a very high strength material compared to 8740 and ARP2000 and is capable of delivering a clamp load at 260,000 psi. It is primarily used in short track and drag racing applications where inertia loads exceed the clamping capability of ARP2000. Like most high strength, quench and temper steels – L19 requires special care during manufacturing to avoid hydrogen embrittlement. This material is easily contaminated and subject to stress corrosion. It must be kept well-oiled and not exposed to moisture.\r\n\r\n*INCONEL 718:* A nickel based material that is in the high temperature, super-alloy class, it is found to be equally suitable in lower temperature applications. This material delivers tensile strengths in the 210,000-230,000 psi range and exhibits improved fatigue properties. Best of all, Inconel 718 is completely immune to hydrogen embrittlement and corrosion.\r\n\r\n*ARP3.5 (AMS5844):* While similar to Inconel 718, these superalloys are found in many jet engine and aerospace applications where heat and stress attack the life of critical components. The high cobalt content of this alloy, while expensive, delivers a material with superior fatigue characteristics and typically tensile strength in the 260,000-280,000 psi range. The immunity to hydrogen embrittlement and corrosion of these materials is a significant design consideration. These materials are primarily used in connecting rods where extremely high loads, high RPM and endurance are important factors – Formula 1, NASCAR and IRL applications.\r\n\r\n*CUSTOM AGE 625 PLUS:* This newly formulated super-alloy demonstrates superior fatigue cycle life, tensile strength and toughness – with complete resistance to atmospheric corrosion and oxidation. ARP is the first to develop manufacturing and testing processes for fasteners with Custom Age 625+. Best of all it is less expensive and expected to soon replace MP-35 as the material of choice in the high strength, super-alloy field. Typical tensile strength is 260,000-280,000 psi.","options":[{"id":45658956,"name":"Honda/Acura 1.2L&1.6L M8 Rod Bolt Kit ","price":53.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45658959,"name":" Honda/Acura 1.28L M9 Rod Bolt Kit ","price":108.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45658962,"name":"03-06 Evo 8/9 4G63 8mm Rod Bolt Kit ","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45658965,"name":"Mitsubishi 2.0L (4B11T) Rod Bolt Kit ","price":146.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45658968,"name":"90-94 Eclipse Connecting Rod Bolt Kit ","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45658971,"name":"Subaru EJ25 DOHC Turbo Rod Bolt Kit","price":102.25,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45658974,"name":"Subaru EJ Series Press Fit Rod Bolt Kit","price":140.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45658977,"name":"Nissan SR20 Rod Bolt Kit ","price":74.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45658980,"name":"Toyota 4AGE M9 Rod Bolt Kit ","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":45658983,"name":"93-98 Supra 2JZA80 Rod Bolt Kit ","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45659007,"name":"BMW 2.8L (M52Euro) 3.0/3.2L (S50/S52US) 12pc Rod Bolt Kit ","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45659004,"name":"Nissan KA24DE Rod Bolt Kit ","price":67.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45659001,"name":"Honda/Acura K20A Rod Bolt Kit ","price":134.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45658998,"name":"02-06 Mini Cooper S Rod Bolt Kit ","price":76.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45658995,"name":"Porsche 944 Rod Bolt Kit ","price":208.55,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45658992,"name":"87-92 Supra 7MGTE Rod Bolt Kit ","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":45658989,"name":"Nissan VQ35 Rod Bolt Kit ","price":212.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45658986,"name":"Nissan VG30 V6 Rod Bolt Kit ","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125776953/-/arp-rod-bolts.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125776953/-/arp-rod-bolts.jpg","width":500,"height":150},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125776965/-/ARP_Con-RodBolts_small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125776965/-/ARP_Con-RodBolts_small.jpg","width":300,"height":313},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125776983/-/ph_21699.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125776983/-/ph_21699.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5385492,"name":"Engine Internals","permalink":"engine-internals","url":"/category/engine-internals"}]},{"id":14158029,"name":"Turbo XS Exhaust Systems","permalink":"turbo-xs-exhaust-systems","position":65,"price":347.49,"default_price":347.49,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/turbo-xs-exhaust-systems","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-14T00:42:03.000Z","description":"                              Turbo XS Exhaust\r\nDesigned specifically for each vehicle, Turbo XS Exhaust Systems are all 3\", 304 Stainless Steel Steel and Titanium components are offered for certain models.

                             Hallman ES Boost Controller\r\nThe Hallman ES Boost Controller kit contains a billet aluminum body that is anodized black, vacuum line and general installation instructions. Specific installation instructions may be downloaded from the files section of this site. The ES (Essentials) kit was designed for those looking for the best \"bang for the buck\" in boost control. This controller is not able to be upgraded to cockpit control.\r\n\r\n                              Hallman Pro RX Boost Controller\r\nThe Hallman Pro RX Boost Controller has a ceramic ball instead of the 316 stainless ball that comes in our other valves. The ceramic ball only weighs a fraction of what the stainless steel balls weighs. This weight difference allows the ceramic ball to act very quickly as it is constantly changing directions during operation. The ceramic ball in conjunction with the use of a lighter spring will allow very fine adjustment of boost up to 4 to 5 pounds of boost over stock. Boost has been able to be adjusted in half pound increments very consistently with this valve.\r\n\r\nThis kit was specifically designed for those that only wish to add a few pounds of boost over stock and have a great amount of control over those few pounds. This is the kit that we recommend for RX'7s or other vehicles that are sensative to overboost situations. This kit also includes the heavy spring for those that would like add more than 5 pounds of boost and want to take advantage of the ceramic ball.\r\n\r\nThe Hallman Pro RX kit contains the Hallman Pro Valve w/ ceramic ball, light and heavy springs included, Standard Barb Fittings with 3 feet of vacuum line or -4 AN Fittings no lines included, mounting bracket, hardware packet and complete installation instructions all in one kit. The Pro RX kit was designed to allow very specific control of boost. Kits are available in Black, Red, Blue, Purple, Silver or Gunmetal.\r\n\r\n                              Hallman Pro Boost Controller\r\nThe Hallman Pro Boost Controller Kit contains the new Hallman Pro valve. The new Pro valve is machined out of billet aluminum and stainless steel pieces. The new design of the valve incorporates some great new features not currently available on any other manual boost controller.\r\n\r\nThe Pro valve has been designed to not require the use of a lock nut or any type or allen wrench(s) to be able to adjust your boost. Simply turn the adjustment knob and it stays. Another great feature is the fact that the adjustment knob cannot be lost or come out of the valve. Simply put there is not a potential for overboosting since the adjustment knob cannot vibrate loose and come out.\r\n\r\nThe Pro kit also includes: Standard Barb Fittings with 3 feet of vacuum line or -4 AN Fittings no lines included, mounting bracket, hardware packet and complete installation instructions all in one kit. This kit has all the installation hardware that is needed for most all turbo installs. Plus, it comes with a mounting clamp to hold the valve. \r\n\r\nKits are available in Black, Red, Blue, Purple, Silver or Gunmetal.\r\n\r\n                        Hallman Cockpit Cable Add-On\r\nHallman Cockpit Cable Add-On: The Hallman Pro Cockpit Controller Add-on kit contains a cable system that will adapt to our Pro and Pro RX Hallman boost controller valves. The cable is 72 inches in length. \r\n\r\nThis cable system will allow the user to control and adjust boost from inside the car. This new system makes it very easy to set initial desired boost level as there is no need to stop the car, open the hood, make an adjustment, and then drive the car and see what boost is. Then repeat the process if boost is not at desired level. \r\n\r\n*This kit does not contain a boost control valve, that is sold separately.*","options":[{"id":45799932,"name":"Hallman ES Black MBC","price":72.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":45799935,"name":"Hallman PRO RX Purple MBC ","price":117.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45799938,"name":"Hallman PRO RX Red MBC ","price":117.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45799941,"name":"Hallman PRO RX Blue MBC ","price":117.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45799944,"name":"Hallman PRO Black MBC ","price":102.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45799947,"name":"Hallman PRO Red MBC ","price":102.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45799950,"name":"Hallman PRO Gunmetal MBC ","price":102.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45799953,"name":"Hallman PRO Blue MBC ","price":102.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45799956,"name":"Hallman PRO Purple MBC ","price":102.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45799959,"name":"Hallman PRO Silver MBC ","price":102.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":48073866,"name":"Hallman Cockpit Cable Add-On","price":82.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125873202/-/e4bbedf8-713a-4e08-bf50-e88f950a799b-350.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125873202/-/e4bbedf8-713a-4e08-bf50-e88f950a799b-350.jpg","width":192,"height":100},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125873217/-/hallman_pro_rx.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125873217/-/hallman_pro_rx.jpg","width":632,"height":632},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125873244/-/hallman_boost2_no_logos__09663.1351449934.1280.1280.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125873244/-/hallman_boost2_no_logos__09663.1351449934.1280.1280.jpg","width":520,"height":390},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127540884/-/hallman_pro_cockpit_controller.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127540884/-/hallman_pro_cockpit_controller.jpg","width":200,"height":150},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127540893/-/Hallman_Evolution_Boost_Controller.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127540893/-/Hallman_Evolution_Boost_Controller.jpg","width":400,"height":310}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6423231,"name":"Turbo Components","permalink":"turbo-components","url":"/category/turbo-components"}]},{"id":14143572,"name":"ARP Headstuds ","permalink":"arp-headstuds","position":67,"price":185.0,"default_price":185.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/arp-headstuds","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-13T01:08:32.000Z","description":"                                  ARP Head Stud/Bolt Kits\r\nIt is for good reason that virtually every top professional engine builder relies on ARP Pro Series head studs for their all-out competition powerplants. Simply stated, there’s not a better stud setup on the market today.\r\n\r\nFor openers, ARP uses a premium grade 8740 alloy that is rated far superior to “aircraft” quality. Each stud is placed vertically in special racks and precisely heat-treated to 200,000 psi. This procedure ensures complete heat penetration and the results are far superior to those lesser quality studs from other manufacturers who just dump pieces in a basket and hope for the best.\r\n\r\nFollowing heat-treat, each stud is centerless ground to make it as close to perfectly concentric as possible. This procedure involves about ten very slight cuts and results in an exceptionally straight part. It’s important to note that lesser quality studs are not even centerless ground – the material is thread rolled in bar stock form (mostly before heat-treat, when the material is easier to machine). Because ARP studs are manufactured to such exacting tolerances, you will note that gaskets and cylinder heads literally glide into position and are perfectly aligned – something that won’t happen with inferior quality head studs.\r\n\r\nARP studs are thread rolled after heat-treat, which gives them about 1000% (that’s ten times) better fatigue strength than those studs that are threaded prior to heat-treat (a very common industry practice). It costs a lot more to do it this way, because it’s tough on tooling, but the results are well worth the extra effort.\r\n\r\nYou will also note that ARP offers specially undercut studs for several engines. This procedure (done only to the shorter studs) more equalizes the “stretch” of both studs, which makes for a more consistent clamping force – and one that compensates for head gasket compression when the cylinder heads are installed. This helps prevent blown head gaskets, and assures optimum engine sealing!\r\n\r\nPremium quality heat-treated 8740 chrome moly steel head stud kits are available for most every domestic and import applications.\r\n\r\nYou won’t find a better quality stud on the market from any other source. Look for ARP stamped on each stud as your assurance of quality.\r\n\r\nClearly, ARP Head Stud/Bolt Kits are the best on the market today, and the favorite of leading professional engine builders in all forms of racing.\r\n\r\n*HIGH PERFORMANCE SERIES*\r\nHigh Performance head bolts are available with a reduced wrenching hex or 12-point and wide area flanged head that eliminates the need for valve train removal to facilitate cylinder head retorquing. All High Performance Series bolts are 180,000 psi (which is 15% stronger than Grade 8) and kits come complete with hardened parallel-ground washers.\r\n\r\n*PRO SERIES*\r\nAll Pro Series bolts are cold-forged to ensure molecular integrity, heat-treated prior to thread rolling and machining, and are rated nominally at 200,000 psi. ARP Pro Series head bolt kits are application specific – designed for use with typically competition only components. These fasteners deliver superior strength and meet the ARP “ZERO defect – ZERO failure” quality standard. Hardened and parallel-ground washers are included with each kit to ensure even load distribution and accurate torque readings. All Pro Series head bolts have a reduced wrenching hex or 12-point head and wide area flange to eliminate the need for valve train removal for cylinder head retorquing and permits the use of larger diameter valve springs. Most applications have undercut short bolts that can help eliminate head gasket failures through providing more “stretch” to compensate for the additional compression of gaskets.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Head Studs vs Bolts*\r\nOn many street-driven vehicles, where master cylinders and other items protrude into the engine compartment, it’s probably necessary to use head bolts so that the cylinder heads can be removed with the engine in the car. \r\n\r\nFor most applications, however, studs are recommended. And for good reason. Using studs will make it much easier to assemble an engine (especially a racing powerplant which must be serviced frequently and quickly!) with the cylinder head and gasket assured of proper alignment. \r\n\r\nStuds also provide more accurate and consistent torque loading. Here’s why. When you use bolts to secure the head, the fastener is actually being “twisted” while it’s being torqued to the proper reading. Accordingly, the bolt is reacting to two different forces simultaneously. A stud should be installed in a “relaxed” mode – never crank it in tightly using a jammed nut.\r\n\r\nIf everything is right, the stud should be installed finger tight. Then, when applying torque to the nut, the stud will stretch only on the vertical axis. Remember, an undercut shorter stud will have a rate similar to a longer, standard shank stud. This provides a more even clamping force on the head. Because the head gasket will compress upon initial torquing, make sure studs and bolts are re-torqued after the engine has been run.\r\n","options":[{"id":45656664,"name":"Honda/Acura B18C1 VTEC 12pt Head Stud Kit ","price":185.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":45656667,"name":"Honda B16A Head Stud Kit ","price":182.25,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45656670,"name":"Honda D16A / D16Z M10 Head Stud Kit","price":154.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45656673,"name":"Honda/Acura K20A (A2 & A3) Head Stud Kit ","price":190.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45656676,"name":"Honda B20B w/ B16A head Head Stud Kit ","price":185.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":45656679,"name":"Honda/Acura B18A1 12pt Head Stud Kit ","price":195.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45656682,"name":"Honda D16Y Head Stud Kit ","price":141.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45656685,"name":"Honda H22 A4 VTEC Head Stud Kit ","price":208.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45656688,"name":"Honda H23A Head Stud Kit ","price":202.25,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45656691,"name":"Honda F20C Head Stud Kit ","price":188.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45656694,"name":"Up To 03 Dodge Neon SRT-4 Head Stud Kit ","price":161.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45656697,"name":"Nissan GTR RB26DETT 2000 Head Stud Kit ","price":314.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45656700,"name":"03-06 Evo 8/9 / 95-98 Eclipse 4G63 2nd Gen Head Stud Kit ","price":155.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45656703,"name":"Hyundai 2.0L G4KF Turbo Head Stud Kit ","price":215.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45656706,"name":"Up to 03 Chevy LS1 Pro-Series 12pt Head Stud Kit ","price":455.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45656709,"name":"VW Audi 1.9L Turbo Diesel Head Stud Kit ","price":233.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45656712,"name":"VW/Audi 2.0L (FSI) 4cyl Head Stud Kit","price":186.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45656715,"name":"Golf/Jetta 1.8L 16 valve Head Stud Kit ","price":165.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45656718,"name":"GM 2.2L ECOTEC Head Stud Kit ","price":185.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":45656721,"name":"03-08 350Z / 03-07 G35 VQ35 Head Stud Kit ","price":264.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45656724,"name":"Supra 7MGTE Head Stud Kit","price":175.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45656727,"name":"08  Evo X Mitsubishi 2.0L (4B11) Turbo Head Stud Kit ","price":215.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45656730,"name":"Toyota 4AG 16V Head Stud Kit","price":191.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":45656733,"name":"Nissan 2.4L KA24DE 12pt.

                              Whiteline Sway Bar\r\nAs the name suggests their objective is to reduce sway, or body roll, and stabilise a vehicle under lateral (cornering) forces. Formula 1 cars still use sway bars along side the shocks and springs as it is the ONLY suspension component principally designed to control body roll. Unfortunately, many aftermarket spring manufacturers still design their lowered springs too hard, trying to control body roll when it’s the sway bars job.\r\n\r\nThe fitting of bigger Whiteline Swaybars is still the best dollar for dollar handling improvement you can make.\r\n\r\nWhy? First, while car manufacturers appreciate the role the sway bar plays in vehicle control, safety and comfort, their standard bars, like the vehicles they are fitted to, are built to a compromise of price, performance and comfort. Secondly, handling and suspension design is an evolutionary process with constant changes.\r\n\r\nWhiteline Swaybars are at the cutting edge of this process through their close association with motorsport. We understand the new technologies and design products to put your car at the very front of handling development. Cornering loads are spread more evenly across the tyres delivering more grip and frankly, that’s what it’s all about. You also get improved tyre wear as your tyres stay flatter and more upright. Comfort improves because your car sits flatter through bends meaning less movement inside the vehicle.\r\n\r\n*BARS on CARS - What applies to me and my vehicle?*\r\n* Front Wheel Drive – increase the rear sway bar size\r\n* Rear Wheel Drive – increase the front sway bar size\r\n* 4 Wheel Drive – increase front then rear bar size\r\n* All Wheel Drive – increase rear then front bar size\r\n\r\nWhiteline Swaybars are manufactured using the finest grade Australian spring steel. They are powder coated and supplied with high performance Synthetic Elastomer mounting bushes in a DIY kit form, ready to simply bolt on.\r\n\r\n*Whiteline Adjustable Sway Bars*\r\nAdjustable sway bars allow their stiffness to be altered by increasing or reducing the length of the lever arms. This permits the roll stiffness to be tuned for different situations without replacing the entire bar. The stiffer the bar, the more force required to move the left and right wheels relative to each other. This increases the amount of force required to make the body roll.\r\n\r\nWhiteline adjustable sway bars offer from 2 up to 4 points of adjustment allowing in some cases 10 distinct stiffness settings for precise handling bias adjustment. The Whiteline Blade is available across a huge range of applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhiteline Swaybars are part of the Whiteline handling system. Designed to match and integrate with Chassis Bracing and key alignment products to deliver a fully balanced handling solution. Adjustable sway bars allow their stiffness to be altered by increasing or reducing the length of the lever arms.\r\n\r\nSo without reducing comfort, a Whiteline Swaybar will make your suspension system and tyres perform better, making the car more responsive while delivering more grip.

Skunk2 manifolds significantly increase horsepower between 3000-8800 rpm; the broadest powerband increase in the industry. Skunk2's new Pro-Series design features a 22% increase in power over our previous design. \r\n\r\nEngineered with a larger plenum and tapered runners, Skunk2 manifolds increase and accelerate airflow, and are designed to increase the effects of wave scavenging at the engine’s optimum operating RPM range providing a broad overall increase in usable power. Each runner entry is also modified to balance airflow between cylinders. Oversized throttle bodies can be used as a result of the modified IAC opening on the flange. Like OEM factory manifolds, Skunk2 manifolds are shell molded and CNC machined, to achieve superior strength, high-quality finish, and a precise fit. Each manifold is vacuum tested to ensure quality and leakfree operation. \r\n\r\nThe Skunk2 Pro-Series manifold utilizes all stock sensors and auxiliaries for a simple bolt-on installation that delivers maximum power.\r\n\r\n* Ideal for NA and Forced Induction\r\n* Increased Plenum and Runner Size\r\n* Oversized Throttle Body Opening\r\n* Made From High-Grade 356 Aluminum\r\n* OEM Quality Shell Molded Casting\r\n* Nitrous Mounting Bungs\r\n* Skunk2 Acid-Etched Nameplate\r\n* Broadest Usable Powerband\r\n* Vacuum Tested To Ensure Quality\r\n* Utilizes Stock Sensors\r\n                              Skunk2 Ultra Series Intake Manifold: \r\nThe engineers at Skunk2 Racing have worked tirelessly to develop the next generation of high performance intake manifolds and are proud to announce the release of the much anticipated Ultra Series Intake Manifold. Years of R&D have culminated in a multi-piece cast aluminum intake manifold that offers advantages that only a modular design could allow.\r\n\r\nBuilding upon the performance legacy of our Pro Series Intake Manifold, as well as using the latest in CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software; Skunk2 Racing has created a three-piece modular design that allows for easy disassembly, porting, and plenum volume changes through the use of a removable plenum and optional plenum spacers. In addition to CFD testing, the Ultra Series Intake Manifold has undergone extensive in-house dyno and on-car testing which has led to a design that is less restrictive, yielding both torque and power gains well over many of the competitors.\r\n\r\nUltra Series Intake Manifolds are made from high-grade 356 aluminum alloy for a strong and lightweight design, CNC-machined for a precise fit, and individually inspected for quality assurance.

Paint your suspension components, paint your emblems, paint your wheels, anything you think of could be perfectly matched! There is NO other way to get a perfect color match and now it is available in a convenient spray can.\r\n\r\n*Subaru World Rally Blue*\r\nFinally an answer to all of the World Rally Blue owners out there. We came up with a perfect paint match to (WRB) World Rally Blue in a convenient can! So you can piant match your side-skirts, hood scoops, bumpers, mirrors, you name it!\r\n\r\n*GrimmSpeed Gold*\r\nGrimmSpeed presents \"GrimmSpeed Gold\", your only BBS gold wheel paint match... you can't even get this color directly from BBS!! Our engineer has been working on this color match the entire summer!\r\n\r\nWe personally know that when you damage those beauitful gold BBS rims it is impossible to find a paint that is an exact match so you end up with the whole world knowing that you rubbed that extra high curb. Well now you can spray a bit of our \"GrimmSpeed Gold\" Wheel Paint on them and they will look like new!\r\n\r\nAnd for all of you that don't have BBS wheels, well now you can paint your wheels the same color as the BBS wheels. Being Subaru owners ourselves, we are all addicted to the gold look but it is impossible to find a good gold color at your local paint/auto parts store(especially one that is even remotely close to BBS gold). Search no more!\r\n\r\n\r\nExpanding the possibilities, it's what you can expect from Grimmspeed.\r\n\r\n*Clear Coats and Application*\r\nWe suggest the color coats to happen within an hour of each other. We recommend using clear coat 3-4 days AFTER the coats to prevent the occurence of lifting and/or wrinkling. Any clear should work but we suggest testing a sample area first. A clear coat isn't necessary however.\r\n\r\n2 Cans of GrimmSpeed Paint will thoroughly coat the faces of 4 wheels. If you want to coat the inside drums and outside fully we suggest 3-4 cans\r\n\r\nSold as 12oz Cans.","options":[{"id":47726328,"name":"Gold","price":13.25,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47726331,"name":"Silver","price":17.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":47726334,"name":"World Rally Blue","price":13.25,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47726337,"name":"Cherry Blossom Red","price":13.25,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127283256/-/GrimGoldPaintl.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127283256/-/GrimGoldPaintl.jpg","width":289,"height":243},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127283196/-/054004m.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127283196/-/054004m.jpg","width":200,"height":200},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127283202/-/blue_paint_300_2l.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127283202/-/blue_paint_300_2l.jpg","width":300,"height":225},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127283298/-/f64798c4-0659-47d0-bf83-310524d3c1b2-420-280x280.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127283298/-/f64798c4-0659-47d0-bf83-310524d3c1b2-420-280x280.jpg","width":280,"height":280}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6623181,"name":"Exterior/ Body","permalink":"exterior-body","url":"/category/exterior-body"},{"id":6564384,"name":"WRX/STI","permalink":"wrx-sti","url":"/category/wrx-sti"}]},{"id":15259503,"name":"Enkei RPF1 Wheels","permalink":"enkei-rpf1-wheels","position":83,"price":266.0,"default_price":266.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/enkei-rpf1-wheels","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-02T03:43:56.000Z","description":"Enkei Lightweight Racing Series - RPF1: *MAT PROCESS* \r\nShaping by the MAT process reduces wheel weight by 10%-15%.
