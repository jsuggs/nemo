I started out playing music with lyrics from a 60's club members point of view and that turned into a three camera, two car shoot from California to South Dakota to interview the original members of the Venice and South Bay Heathens Motorcycle Family. Crazy. I couldn't believe I was going to actually do it while I was coordinating the camera crew and renting vehicles. If someone came to me and said \"hey, I'm going to hang out with this motorcycle gang that I met. You want to bring a video camera and film it?\" I would think that guy was crazy. Motorcycle clubs don't put up with that shit. Well, this group liked me enough to let me sit down with them and tell the story of the rise and fall of their club in the 70's and 80's. Hours and hours and hours of video footage, interviews, hundreds of vintage photos collected and too many crazy stories to tell in one sitting. That turned into the book that you see here. It turns out editing is extremely expensive and this movie is going to take a good chunk of time in the editing booth.

We are NOT printing these they are New but Old Stock from almost 30 years ago. The skull motor logo is on the front and the \"in the ghetto\" 3rd street bridge logo on the back. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe bought out the inventory of 300 mostly N.O.S. old chopper and HD shirts from the '70s through about '87. The shop was in the San Fernando Valley and we are selling these with permission from the family of the passed on that owned it all. Check back often, we have lots of shirts to put up.
