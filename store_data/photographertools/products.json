I use these actions in my daily workflow.\r\n\r\nEach action is unique and different than the others. For example, there are three different “Contrast Boost” actions. They all give that boost using three different methods and each have a slightly different look. The vintage/haze actions are perfect for adding a little something to your pictures.\r\n\r\nAll blog template actions are sized at 900 pixels wide. You can resize that for specific blog dimensions that you want. These actions work in Photoshop only and can be used on any blog.\r\n\r\nBonus Actions: Facebook Resize, Horizontal 900px resize, Vertical Resize, Blogging Templates (You can see all that are included by viewing the gallery of images). Other bonus actions that are included are, Contrast Boost I,II,III, three different black and white actions, flattening action, web sharpening, print sharpening, 2 haze actions, vintage action, convert to sRGB action and a detail pop action.\r\n\r\nInstructions are included in a PDF file, however if you are still having troubles or cant figure something out shoot me an email at info@jessicafeely.com and I can help solve any issues.
