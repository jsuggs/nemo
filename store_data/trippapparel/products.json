The original publication by the Gazette is the earliest known pictorial representation of colonial union produced by a British colonist in America.\r\nThe cartoon appeared along with Franklin's editorial about the \"disunited state\" of the colonies, and helped make his point about the importance of colonial unity. During that era, there was a superstition that a snake which had been cut into pieces would come back to life if the pieces were put together before sunset. This cartoon was used in the French and Indian War to symbolize that the colonies needed to join together with England to defeat the French and Indians. It became a symbol of colonial freedom during the American Revolutionary War.\r\n\r\nLife's a Tripp, Tripp Forever™\r\n\r\n6 oz. 100% Cotton Tubular Jersey.\r\n\r\nDouble-needle bottom hem and sleeves.\r\n\r\nShoulder-to-shoulder tape.\r\n\r\nPreshrunk to minimize shrinkage","options":[{"id":35260257,"name":"Small","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35260260,"name":"Medium","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35260263,"name":"Large","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35260266,"name":"X Large","price":15.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35260269,"name":"XX Large","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110230929/-/Join_or_Die.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110230929/-/Join_or_Die.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110231181/-/Join_or_Die2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110231181/-/Join_or_Die2.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110230536/-/Join_or_Die1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110230536/-/Join_or_Die1.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110230557/-/Join_or_Die2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110230557/-/Join_or_Die2.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110230689/-/Join_or_Die.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110230689/-/Join_or_Die.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2273844,"name":"Tee's","permalink":"tee-s","url":"/category/tee-s"},{"id":2273882,"name":"ON SALE","permalink":"on-sale","url":"/category/on-sale"}]},{"id":11209581,"name":"Come Play - Black","permalink":"come-play-black","position":11,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/come-play-black","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-05-17T07:50:24.000Z","description":"In the original script for the movie, Cleon is killed by the Grammercy Riffs, Cochise is killed by the Baseball Furies, Ajax is caught by the police, Vermin is killed by the Lizzies, and Swan gets kidnapped by the Dingos.

SOA's creator, Kurt Sutter, has said, “I don't want to overplay that but it's there. It's not a version of Hamlet but it's definitely influenced by it.” Clay (Ron Perlman) is based on the role of King Claudius, who murdered his own brother (Hamlet’s father) to win the throne and marry Queen Gertrude (Hamlet’s mother). Clay marries Gemma (Katey Sagal), the Gertrude figure, and gains control of The Sons of Anarchy, which her dead husband used to run. Jax is Hamlet. His confusion over the SOA lifestyle is like Hamlet's melancholy about the kingdom. While Jax communicates with his father by reading his journal, Hamlet literally speaks with the ghost of his father. Ron Perlman said in an interview, “I'm sure they’re going to stick to the structure of Hamlet all the way to the end” of the series.\r\n\r\nLife's a Tripp, Tripp Forever™\r\n\r\nClassic Fit Vintage Classic Adult Full Zip Hooded Sweatshirt\r\n\r\n8.0 oz 50% Cotton / 50% Polyester\r\n\r\nAir jet yarn soft feel and no pilling\r\n\r\nUnlined hood\r\n\r\nOverlapped fabric across zipper\r\n\r\nPouch pockets\r\n\r\nDouble needle stitching\r\n\r\nDouble needle cuffs\r\n\r\n1 x 1 athletic rib with spandex\r\n\r\nQuarter-turned to eliminate center crease","options":[{"id":34519830,"name":"Small","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34519833,"name":"Medium","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34519836,"name":"Large","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34519839,"name":"X Large","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34519842,"name":"XX Large","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/107948097/-/Anarchy_blk.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/107948097/-/Anarchy_blk.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/107948109/-/Anarchy_blk.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/107948109/-/Anarchy_blk.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/107948133/-/Anarchy_blk.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/107948133/-/Anarchy_blk.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/107948145/-/Anarchy_blk2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/107948145/-/Anarchy_blk2.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/107948169/-/Anarchy_blk.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/107948169/-/Anarchy_blk.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5233386,"name":"Outerwear","permalink":"outerwear","url":"/category/outerwear"},{"id":5233392,"name":"COMING SOON","permalink":"coming-soon","url":"/category/coming-soon"}]},{"id":10975932,"name":"Bay Fan -
