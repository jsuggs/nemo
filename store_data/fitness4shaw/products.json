We’ve all made incorrect supplement choices, choosing supplements that we don’t need, won’t help us achieve our goal and are simply far too over-priced.\r\n\r\n We’ve all fallen for the over-priced US products, promising huge gains within miraculous time scales, you are not alone in believing in miracles, the product designers at PhD have all been there in years gone by, we’re athletes the same as you, all seeking nutritional and supplementation synergy.. \r\n\r\nThere have been attempts at providing “everything under one-roof” in a sports supplement before, so to speak, but none have been designed with total nutritional synergy. Until now! Synergy-ISO-7™ is the answer to the all-in-one conundrum, it’s also an answer to the prayers of those seeking nutritional synergy, essentially it’s a premium product designed to maximize the various needs of all modern-day athletes.\r\n\r\nStrength and Mass gains\r\n\r\nMethyl-T3 strength stack: Synergistic compounds designed to maximize production of anabolic hormones. 5-Methyl-7-Methoxy-Iso Flavone is the most potent, legal anabolic compound available.\r\n\r\nWhen stacked with Zinc and magnesium it forms a powerful anabolic triple header. \r\n\r\nMuscle Volumising Matrix:\r\n\r\nPharmaceutical-grade standards of the most potent and research-driven cell-volumising amino-acids, designed to induce intra-muscular super-compensation, ensuring muscle fullness, maximum pump and strength re-generation. \r\n\r\nThis matrix primes muscles for maximum volume during intense training ensuring extreme muscle pumps and recovery between heavy sets.\r\n\r\nRecovery and muscle repair\r\n\r\nCombining the finest 2 protein sources known to mankind (37 grams per serving and 74 grams per daily use of Whey protein Isolate and Whey Protein Concentrate), with naturally-high levels of vital and synergistic BCAA’s & Leucine. Leucine has been shown to significantly increase protein synthesis within athletes. \r\n\r\nIn simple terms this equates to more useable and more instant protein to use for muscle growth and repair.\r\n\r\n Synergy-ISO-7™ also includes electrolytes, often lost during intense exercise and need to be re-stocked immediately upon conclusion. Synergy-ISO-7™ contains synergistic amounts of these vital electrolytes.\r\n\r\nEnergy and Vitality\r\n\r\nUsing a triple-action carbohydrate blend, the energy and vitality section within Synergy-ISO-7™ completes the synergistic blend within this premium product. Maltodextrin and Fructose contain relatively low-GI carbohydrates, whilst dextrose monohydrate ensures quick and efficient glycogen replenishment after exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\nNutritional profile: per 66.6G serving (Based on Double chocolate cookie flavour)\r\n\r\n\r\n30 servings per container\r\n\r\n\r\nProtein: 37G\r\n\r\nCarbs: 17G\r\n\r\nSugar: 10G\r\n\r\nFats: 3.9G\r\n\r\nOf which saturated: 1.75G\r\n\r\nFibre: 3.6G\r\n\r\n\r\nMuscle Volumising matrix: 6.5 grams\r\n\r\nContaining: Micronised Creatine Monohydrate, Micronised L-Glutamine, Micronised taurine\r\n\r\n\r\nMethyl-T3-Strength-stack: 330mg\r\n\r\nContaining: 5-Methyl-7-Methoxy-Isoflavone, Zinc Oxide, magnesium oxide, Vitamin B6.\r\n\r\n\r\nMicronutrient blend: 707mg\r\n\r\nContaining: Potassium, calcium, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Phosphorus.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecommended use: Use 2 servings of Synergy-ISO-7™ daily.
