Craig Tattersall’s eulogy to the nobility of final decisions makes ash of leaving the dust behind.\r\n\r\nAlways the love.\r\n\r\nThe limited edition run of 150 copies is presented in letter-pressed A4 kraft folders.

Birthed as two original Orla Wren tracks ‘Five Acre Ladder’ and ‘Mountains And Wishbones’ which were recorded in the same session, Tui then worked the cello, bass and vocals of Aaron Martin into two alternative versions of each track, making up the 4 tracks on the 10” vinyl for Facture.\r\n\r\nHe then offered the same to Isnaj Dui who contributed some flute for him to then create the two versions with her as guest. To complete the companion 8 track letter pressed CD version the two \"reprise\" versions were created by Tui utilizing parts from the other tracks.\r\n\r\nMastered precisely by James Plotkin, the project is released as a limited edition run of 300 copies designed by Daniel Crossley; 4 track 10” vinyl on reverse board heavy card with printed inner sleeves with designs by Montreal designer Urban9, download code, 8 track 4-panel letter pressed CDs with wrap-around letter pressed bands, 4 prints resting inside typed/numbered glassine photo bags, 2 x double sided large prints, pressed flowers, all resting inside large tagged/scented letter pressed envelopes with beautiful artwork again by Urban9.\r\n\r\nTo accompany the album an exclusive promo film was made for the track Five Acre Ladder (re-prise) by Lumacell. And a very special exclusive bonus track The Cup Of Remembered Things is also included as a free download.\r\n\r\nA returned honour of growth and loss, this album complements her predecessor as an expressive companion piece requiring little explanation.\r\n\r\nwww.fac-ture.co.uk\r\nwww.orlawren.eu\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/80904250&amp;color=666666&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":46669350,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":127,"name":"Iran","code":"IR"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":22,"name":"Israel","code":"IL"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":138,"name":"Lebanon","code":"LB"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":27,"name":"Malaysia","code":"MY"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":46,"name":"Afghanistan","code":"AF"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":59,"name":"Bangladesh","code":"BD"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":76,"name":"Cambodia","code":"KH"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":8,"name":"Chile","code":"CL"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":9,"name":"China","code":"CN"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":90,"name":"Cuba","code":"CU"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":12,"name":"Dominican Republic","code":"DO"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":18,"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HK"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":126,"name":"Indonesia","code":"ID"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":133,"name":"Korea (North) (People's Republic)","code":"KP"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":176,"name":"Pakistan","code":"PK"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":182,"name":"Philippines","code":"PH"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":207,"name":"South Africa","code":"ZA"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":209,"name":"Sri Lanka","code":"LK"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":40,"name":"Thailand","code":"TH"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127841283/-/2.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127841283/-/2.jpeg","width":650,"height":650},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127841280/-/1.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127841280/-/1.jpeg","width":650,"height":650},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127841289/-/3.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127841289/-/3.jpeg","width":650,"height":650}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":14358081,"name":"Talvihorros - Eaten Alive","permalink":"talvihorros-eaten-alive","position":4,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/talvihorros-eaten-alive","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-23T10:36:00.000Z","description":"“To hold as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show time his form and pressure.” - Shakespeare\r\n\r\n......................\r\n\r\nIf art is a mirror held up to nature, ‘Eaten Alive’ by Talvihorros is art that reflects the worst of human nature: eight interrogatory pieces that explore manipulation, addiction, betrayal and the fight-or-flight responses of shame, guilt, anger and fear.\r\n\r\nBen Chatwin’s two-year collaboration with Dan Crossley delivers an 80’s East London minus the current urban tropes, the two finding their coexistent aim in confronting a post-industrial fluxus of identity and rehabilitation. In mapping their shared personal histories of redemption, Chatwin and Crossley sketch details of crime, homelessness and desperation that words cannot do justice to.\r\n\r\nMastered by James Plotkin, ‘Eaten Alive’ is released by Fluid Audio in a limited numbered run of 200 copies: Letter-pressed CD covers sealed in oversized letter-pressed scented craft envelopes (215mm x 215mm) / Numbered letter-pressed inserts / 5 x double sided prints on heavy card stock (210mm x 210mm) / 40 page oversized photographic booklet of East London (200mm x 200mm) / Pressed rose buds & Tagetes / Download

Ben has been releasing his home-recorded experimental folk music on small-run CD-Rs and tapes since 2009, primarily on his own Lily Tapes & Discs, but also on other labels including Rok Lok Records, Diving Station, and now Fluid Audio.\r\n\r\nThis album was written and recorded 2011-2013 between bedrooms at school and at home, inspired and informed by long aimless walks through familiar neighborhoods in the dark, trying to pretend that eventually there would be something different behind the houses.\r\n\r\nMusic by Ben Lovell, drums on \"To the Grid and Back\" by Sean Kelly.

It’s an exploratory, elemental union that includes a significant, immersive and expressive vocal narrative. The overall theme of light and hope is perhaps not so apparent on the first few listens because the vocals are full of hidden mystery. However, its nascent sense of optimism does become apparent the more you listen to it, essentially it’s a journey of hope” – Tim Diagram / Genoveva – May 2013.\r\n\r\nBluhm is the exquisite outcome of six months of collaboration between intelligent musical innovator Tim Diagram and enigmatic Macedonian songstress Genoveva. The album’s genesis began with Tim putting down basic unforced song structures. The musical production side utilises his trademark palette of drone, delay, reverb, discord, distortion, tape effects and granular synthesis. All consciously crafted with the light, ardour and purity that is always associated with his oeuvre.\r\n\r\nThese primary melodies were presented to Genoveva, who then added her seraphic vocals. Both protagonists contributed to the powerful and inspirational lyrical content of the work that exposes glimpses of the beauty and significance of true reflection. The album plays out like a journey of personal sacrifice and self-development. These artists bring swathes of emotional intelligence to the table, and this comes out in vocals which ebb and flow with a haunting poetic melancholy. There’s a strong sense of attachment to each of the songs, all of which possess dynamic emotive themes. There are tales of despair, of isolation, of staring into the abyss and being lost inside your own mind, chased by your own monsters and demons.\r\n\r\nBoth contributors view music as being a key element of their lives, and of their ultimate salvation. They find a release in creativity and relate to each other’s challenges and dilemmas. So this work is also the story of a blossoming friendship, one that was generated through a complete love and utter devotion to music. There is no formula to any of the songs, it all pieced together organically as the work progressed, with little or no arrangement with the vocals, they are as they were sung.\r\n\r\nAll of humanity can relate to the life-changing experiences that are so eloquently documented here. The effort of coming to terms with life’s ups and downs, the semiotic visions of self-pity, the torment, the psychotic episodes, the desire for acceptance; and above all, the hope of an eventual salvation that can only be gained through respective responsibility and inestimable self-effort.\r\n\r\nBluhm is pure euphoria; it leaves one feeling wholesome inside as its emotional and sensual overtones induce an altered sense of self-realisation. Sentient soundscapes of virtue and lucidity create a fabulous feeling of solid inner strength that permeates every fibre of human existence. Overcome by the profundity of the experience one will be fully prepared to dare to live one’s life once again.\r\n\r\n<object height=\"18\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\"

The joined arsenal boasts acoustic instrumentation as well as synthesizer, manipulations and field recordings. Here guitar, cello, piano, harmonica, melodica, percussion and voice ring alongside Korg Monotron, Orla Wren’s processing, and Coniglio’s vinyls.\r\nTracks range from glowing string examinations to humming whitewashes, from vocal reveries to textured pop allure. Listeners may already be familiar with the guitar reverberations of opening track \"The Void,\" which was originally released on the Wire Tapper CD #26, in August 2011. Remaining tracks are previously unreleased, yet still beckon like old companions. \"Touching the Void\" regales with De Dominicis' surreal choir of one, the coquettish spoken word as lovely as her ravishing vibrato. \"Skyline Obscured\" tenders the gentle optic brume of ambient--that one kind of visual pollution worth hoping for. Keeping with the subject of horizons, \"Sunset Eyed\" sets electronic pinpricks against De Dominicis' tender dexterity, English's hopeful pizzicato, and the composite thud of percussion.  \r\n\r\nElsewhere \"Fading to White\" floats above a simple, unadorned guitar lick, weightless with Sheeran's savory vocals and the untethered gusts of harmonica.  Sheeran also delivers a humming, layered performance on \"The Body Tired,\" a languid, guitar-driven beauty which simply mesmerizes.  With this tender and crafted release, Coniglio has announced a new direction, and a number of Fluid Audio alumni have headed there with him. Perhaps we are all at risk of sinking in.\r\n\r\nPresented in four panel letter pressed covers, twelve page photographic book by Giacomo Vianello, five bespoke prints wrapped in archival paper, pressed lavender... All wrapped in lyric sheets and sealed. The whole thing then rests inside hand typed/numbered envelopes.

His wanderings have led him to Seatown, Sandbanks, the woods of Zeist, and the inner city of Vancouver. Now he documents a week-long trip to Lamorna, Cornwall, in the summer of 2012.\r\n\r\nShaw writes: “The recordings were made in the Lamorna valley, the cove, the woods and also within the Iron Age Boleigh Fogou which is an underground structure over 2,000 years old. The Fogou derives from the Cornish for Fou or Vou, meaning cave.”\r\n\r\n“In terms of the sound of the finished music, it was recorded largely on location using acoustic guitar, bowed guitars, Moog Prodigy, my voice and a sprinkling of effects where required. It relied on the sounds of the places themselves, the trees, river and Fogou in particular. The mixing process was based on taking these raw ingredients and sculpting them into a finished whole, with the place as the focus.”\r\n\r\nThe result is a slow tide of strings, ambient vistas, and delirious harmonies that echo, then dissipate into the eponymous landscape. From the inner triumph of “Rosemerrynwood” to the tense and pulse-quickening modern composition “Bo-Lech” and the buoyant, living title track, Lamorna is a remembered call from an ancient place.\r\n\r\nFluid Audio presents Lamorna in a limited edition run of 100 hand made letter pressed CD’s, along with 6 large format (150mm x 150mm) double sided photographic prints taken by the artist on his journey. The package also includes a natural Larch wood slice, pressed Viola flower, rare poem by Ithell Colquhoun, download code and scent. All of the above rests inside hand typed/numbered/sealed Manilla envelopes.\r\n\r\nRelease Date: 29.03.13\r\n\r\n<object height=\"18\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F82190764&amp;color=666666&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=tiny\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed wmode=\"transparent\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"18\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F82190764&amp;color=666666&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=tiny\"></embed></object>","options":[{"id":30621892,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":76,"name":"Cambodia","code":"KH"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":46,"name":"Afghanistan","code":"AF"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":8,"name":"Chile","code":"CL"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":12,"name":"Dominican Republic","code":"DO"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":126,"name":"Indonesia","code":"ID"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":127,"name":"Iran","code":"IR"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":27,"name":"Malaysia","code":"MY"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":182,"name":"Philippines","code":"PH"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":209,"name":"Sri Lanka","code":"LK"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":59,"name":"Bangladesh","code":"BD"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":9,"name":"China","code":"CN"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":90,"name":"Cuba","code":"CU"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":18,"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HK"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":22,"name":"Israel","code":"IL"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":133,"name":"Korea (North) (People's Republic)","code":"KP"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":138,"name":"Lebanon","code":"LB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":176,"name":"Pakistan","code":"PK"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":207,"name":"South Africa","code":"ZA"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":40,"name":"Thailand","code":"TH"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.2}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99927991/-/1.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99927991/-/1.jpeg","width":700,"height":700},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99928039/-/3.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99928039/-/3.jpeg","width":700,"height":700},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99928024/-/2.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99928024/-/2.jpeg","width":700,"height":700}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":8922545,"name":"United Bible Studies -

Billowing curtains of harp and voice are incised with guitar, percussion and lyrical aphorisms. Not so much inventive as it is self-inventing, and not so much electroacoustic as it is dreamscaped and CTRL+Shifted, this deceptively complex composing ethic will reach out to the acoustic purists and the electron snipers in almost equal measures. And don’t even say the word genre out loud.\r\n\r\nIf it occurred to us, we could assemble the ghosts-nay, the magicians-of acoustic guitar, lap steel guitar, piano, harp, harmonica, electronics and drum, then stir in some Amsterdam mythology to taste, and our results might come close to Spoicke. But that is what makes United Bible Studies so extraordinary: it would never have occurred to us. Fluid Audio presents Spoicke in a limited edition CD run of 77 for the world, with letter-pressed CD cover, homemade sewn fabric pouch, 300gsm double sided luxury postcard, handmade Larch Elder Futhark rune that has had the symbol burnt into it and finished with natural beeswax, mini card, printed insert with download code, black envelope, all stamped, numbered and sealed. Oh yes and of course some fire resin incense. \r\n\r\nThe cover design...\r\n\r\nThe design is variants of the same composition, but the details are different - the idea is that they represent alchemical concepts of the unity of opposites. Day and night (front and back cover) scenery also represent life and death of the magician, who's ghost Doppelgänger haunted the city after his death.\r\n\r\nThe symbols represent Three Principles, Four Elements, planets and metals. The fact that the title hero was from Amsterdam was truly helpful and inspiring, allowing us to include all four elements/representations in the scenery: air (sky), earth (ground and buildings), fire (sun) and water (river). \r\n\r\nCredits...\r\n\r\nDavid Colohan: Voice, Acoustic & Lap Steel Guitars, Tin Whistle\r\nRichard Moult: Piano \r\nÁine O'Dwyer: Harp, Voice \r\nGavin Prior: Acoustic & Lap Steel Guitars, Electronics \r\nOscar Strik: Percussion \r\nMichael Tanner: Guitar, Bowed loops, Voice, Sampled Glass Harmonica\r\n\r\nRecorded and mixed by Berry Kramer and VPRO in Amsterdam on the 22nd/23rd May 2009.

The initial composition “Quiet times at the library” defines the tone, but the album also sees many shades; the solo piece “Poems written by an old (prepared) piano”, the crow haunted field recordings of “Interlude” and reverent remixes provided by Yasuhiko Fukuzono (aus) and P Jørgensen specially for the CD edition.\r\n\r\nThe direct intimacy of the material is a stark counterpoint to the sweeping cinematic grandeur and electronic sound manipulation of previous releases as Field Rotation, and is also the logical progression from 2011 releases ‘Acoustic Tales’ and ‘And Tomorrow I Will Sleep”; the former a tribute to literature, and the latter a paean to hibernation after exhaustion. Completed in the brief escapes allowed by gaps in graduate study, “Paraphrases” is a recontextualisation of the experience of exhaustion, written in other words.\r\n\r\nTrack List...\r\n\r\n01 Falling

Available <em><strong><a href=\"http://matthewcollings.bandcamp.com/album/splintered-instruments\" target=\"_blank\">Here</a></strong></em>\r\n\r\nSplintered Instruments is not an empty claim. It is the sound of acoustic components on the verge of collapse, as if spitting out something articulate with their dying breath. It is real-world, analog, dusty and broken, but still forward-looking.\r\n\r\nMatthew Collings – the Edinburg-based composer and producer – makes his solo debut with this Fluid Audio release. He says, “Emotionally this record comes out of reckoning with the destructive forces in my life. I’ve felt my whole life as if there is an immense, violent force ready to come out of me. I wanted to finally reach it and reckon with it. Here it rears its head, filtered through melody.”\r\n\r\n“I was completely sick of ambient. I wanted something direct, to look you straight in the eye, to involve and shake your entire body. If I could somehow take the electric guitar and melt the sound of it and play it with my body I would.”\r\n\r\nOf the album’s spilling percussion, exquisite spans of silence and its almost petroleum viscidity, Collings writes, “Very few thing in nature are truly repetitive. There is always subtle variation and imprecision. It’s a revolt against machines: precision doesn’t express anything and is pretty unnatural. Everything I play is messy, but on the border of being out of place. I use the computer for convenience, not as a principle. It is electronic only because I don’t have the hands or people to do it all at once. If I could, then I would.”  Nearly all of Splintered Instruments is organic, played on acoustic instruments or sourced from physical objects and then manipulated, often considerably.\r\n\r\nThe album was produced and engineered by Ben Frost, who also performed synthesizer and piano on “Vasilia.” Collings says, “If anything is influenced by Ben it’s the physicality and size of the sound. That’s something that really speaks to me in his music, this force of nature through noise and volume. I wanted to reach into the deepest part of me and pull out the true nature of things, or at least a faithful side to them: admitting you are violent, you are a beast of nature as much as a romantic, civilised human being.”\r\n\r\nSplintered Instruments acknowledges ferocity as much as it does beauty, and the result is something candid, universal, and unforgettable. Fluid Audio is proud to offer this stunning debut in a limited edition run of 200 hand made letter pressed CD’s, along with photo prints stored in archival paper, guitar pick, cards/download code all packed neatly into hand typed/numbered sealed envelopes.\r\n\r\n.........................\r\n\r\nComposed and Performed by Matthew Collings\r\nExcept 'Vasilia', Composed by

surgical exploration of a classic era noir: a descent from glittering surface tension to sinister murky depth. As with all Tape Loop Orchestra releases, the theme is one of decay – a certain blurred focus disintegrating into fragile remembered phrases, echoing the \"film’s dive from romantic optimism into malevolent violence.\r\n\r\n“I Died When She Left Me”\r\n\r\nIn a textbook example of art mirroring life, the album’s script within a script reflects the tension and emotion of the film director Nicolas Ray was directing his then wife Gloria Grahame during the breakdown of their relationship. Recorded and edited by Andrew Hargreaves over three months on a modified 4-track and walkman loop, these three powerful and precise pieces from one side of a C90 are proudly brought to you on a limited edition 300 run on 180gm vinyl by Facture. Mastered in black and white widescreen by James Plotkin, the stunning packaging features hand numbered heavy-duty gatefold and printed inner sleeves designed by Craig Tattersall, photography by Joe Borreson, hand numbered/stamped A2 collage poster designed by Alice Clarke, hand numbered cut out ACD Sleeve CD with inserts, 12 x 12 heavy card stock print, download code, plus scent and extras.\r\n\r\n“I Lived A Few Weeks While She Loved Me”\r\n\r\n.............................\r\n\r\nInterview:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fluid-radio.co.uk/2012/12/film-noir-discussion-with-tape-loop-orchestra/\" target=\"_blank\">Fluid Radio</a>\r\n\r\nReviews:\r\n\r\nReviews:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://boomkat.com/vinyl/638395-tape-loop-orchestra-in-a-lonely-place\" target=\"_blank\">Boomkat</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.tinymixtapes.com/music-review/tape-loop-orchestra-in-a-lonely-place\" target=\"_blank\">Tiny Mix Tapes</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.normanrecords.com/records/138267-tape-loop-orchestra-in-a\" target=\"_blank\">Norman Records</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://anhedonicheadphones.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/review-tape-loop-orchestra-in-lonely.html\"target=\"_blank\">Anhedonic Headphones</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.textura.org/reviews/tapeloop_inalonelyplace.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Textura</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://beachsloth.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/tape-loop-orchestra-in-lonely-place-84.html\" target=\"_blank\">Beach Sloth</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://theneedledrop.com/2012/12/tape-loop-orchestra-i-died-when-she-left-me/\" target=\"_blank\">The Needle Drop</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.chaindlk.com/reviews/?id=7351\" target=\"_blank\">Chain D.

allowFullScreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n.................\r\n\r\nWritten and recorded over a period of more than two years, “Paraphrases” is a collection of chamber music compositions performed, recorded and layered through numerous recording sessions in a small room in northern Germany near the Baltic Sea.\r\n\r\nChristoph Berg scores the history of eight narrow worlds, carved only from wood – violin, piano and double bass. The initial composition “Quiet times at the library” defines the tone, but the album also sees many shades; the solo piece “Poems written by an old (prepared) piano”, the crow haunted field recordings of “Interlude” and reverent remixes provided by Yasuhiko Fukuzono (aus) and P Jørgensen specially for the CD edition.\r\n\r\nThe direct intimacy of the material is a stark counterpoint to the sweeping cinematic grandeur and electronic sound manipulation of previous releases as Field Rotation, and is also the logical progression from 2011 releases ‘Acoustic Tales’ and ‘And Tomorrow I Will Sleep”; the former a tribute to literature, and the latter a paean to hibernation after exhaustion. Completed in the brief escapes allowed by gaps in graduate study, “Paraphrases” is a recontextualisation of the experience of exhaustion, written in other words.\r\n\r\nMastered with precise weight by Ian Hawgood, the 250 run limited edition 180gm vinyl is packaged inside heavy gatefold four panel sleeves, wrapped within an A1 double-sided poster. The package also includes a double sided 12 x 12 hand numbered print along with a hand numbered embossed letter-pressed CD with fold-out booklet featuring striking photography by Aela Labbe. Extras as always will include scent, card and download code containing audio and PDFs. The album is a treasure of both talent and soul, and the extraordinary packaging from the label and considered art design by Ian Hazeldine reflects the classic nature of the material.\r\n\r\nReviews:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://boomkat.com/vinyl/625278-christoph-berg-paraphrases\" target=\"_blank\">Boomkat</a>\r\n<a
