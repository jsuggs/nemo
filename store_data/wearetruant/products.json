I heard a rough cut of what was to be this EP more than a year ago, and I can say that he's really come a long way in short span of time. Still a disciple of dusty cut and paste, GLK has found the sweet spots of all sorts of records, pasted them together into an undulating amoeba of musk, snares, and exotic instruments. For a beats release, this thing really travels in different directions... you get a sense that you're on a journey... maybe through the back alleys of Morocco being chased by hustlers, to a hash den in Islamabad, to the back of that famous record store in Hungary listening to undiscovered beats. The thrill kinda reminds me of listening to MoWax singles back in the day. Seven tracks in all. Signed and numbered edition 2000. Highly recommended.","options":[{"id":1674366,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3465707/-/glkweb12_03.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3465707/-/glkweb12_03.gif","width":417,"height":469}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":366526,"name":"Puta Magazine #1","permalink":"puta-magazine-1","position":4,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/puta-magazine-1","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-08-11T01:39:45.000Z","description":"\"Every single page in this bastard is fucking great.
