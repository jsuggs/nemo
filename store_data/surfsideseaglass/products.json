If you are not yet knowledgeable about these magnificent works of art, allow me to give you a brief history. Back in the 1970's, the two Lundberg brothers started a glass making factory in Davenport, California. Their unique method of creating glass products helped make some of the most beautiful vases, paperweights and other glass objects the USA has ever created. In fact, Lundberg glass is displayed in the Smithsonian Institute, the White House, the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Art Institute of Chicago among other institutions.\r\n\r\nAccording to one worker I spoke to at the Lundberg Studios during a visit, decades ago, glass remnants of each day's production was dumped into the stream that ran past the studio which, in turn, made its way into the Pacific Ocean. It is called end-of-day glass - same way end-of-day glass was created in Northern England. Decades later, it is the source of the magnificent sea glass washing up on one particular beach in Santa Cruz, California.\r\n\r\nWhat a true gem! This Santa Cruz sea glass gem is gorgeous with layers of opaque white.It has a gorgeous pink stripe across its front. I paired it with a pretty Sterling Silver vine bail. This piece is truly one-of-a-kind. I can promise you that there will never be an exact duplicate of this piece found! The entire pendant measures 3/4\" 1 1/8\". Perfect necklace for the sea glass lover looking for something completely unique!\r\n\r\nAn 18 inch .925 Sterling Silver chain comes with the pendant. \r\n\r\nLike all my pieces, this necklace comes beautifully-boxed with pretty ribbon - always complimentary.","options":[{"id":42913329,"name":"Default","price":85.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123903372/-/il_570xN.417028817_cijf.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123903372/-/il_570xN.417028817_cijf.jpg","width":570,"height":650},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123903378/-/il_570xN.417024398_hjxm.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123903378/-/il_570xN.417024398_hjxm.jpg","width":570,"height":739},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123903396/-/il_570xN.430735451_f9p6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123903396/-/il_570xN.430735451_f9p6.jpg","width":570,"height":562}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6114657,"name":"Sea Glass Necklaces","permalink":"sea-glass-necklaces","url":"/category/sea-glass-necklaces"}]},{"id":13435389,"name":"Aqua Sea Glass Bracelet With Lampwork Bead And Crystal Pearls","permalink":"aqua-sea-glass-bracelet-with-lampwork-bead-and-crystal-pearls","position":34,"price":38.0,"default_price":38.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/aqua-sea-glass-bracelet-with-lampwork-bead-and-crystal-pearls","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-08T14:17:59.000Z","description":"Beautiful aqua sea glass bracelet with a gorgeous, handmade globe lampwork focal bead !

The sea glass almost looked like a stone until I held it to the light and saw the faintest hint of light shining through a small edge of the glass. This piece is very old. Look carefully at the gorgeous patina of this sea glass. It is beautifully-pitted and polished. It probably started off its life as an old rum bottle back when it was believed that black glass preserved the alcohol longer than lighter shades of glass. This piece, in all probability, was tossed around in the ocean for 200 + years before washing ashore!. It is wire-wrapped with .925 Sterling Silver wire. A Swarovski crystal pearl completes the pendant. Either the front or the back is suitable for display as seen in the pictures. It measures 5/8\" by 1 1/2\". A pretty Sterling Silver chain in the length of your choice comes with the pendant. \r\n\r\n** True GENUINE black sea glass will have an aura of olive and brown (if very old) outline around the edges of it when held to the light. However, it will NOT appear olive or brown. It will look black. That is very important to keep in mind when investing in a black piece of sea glass. Olive and brown are very common colors and, therefore, least desirable to collectors and lower in value and price. If you would like to know more about the history of black sea glass, please contact me. I can talk history all day long;) I love it!!\r\n","options":[{"id":42802230,"name":"Default","price":70.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123830013/-/il_570xN.422160511_hl0r.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123830013/-/il_570xN.422160511_hl0r.jpg","width":485,"height":518},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123830001/-/il_570xN.422160445_cze0.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123830001/-/il_570xN.422160445_cze0.jpg","width":475,"height":584},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123830025/-/il_570xN.430735451_f9p6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123830025/-/il_570xN.430735451_f9p6.jpg","width":570,"height":562}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6114657,"name":"Sea Glass Necklaces","permalink":"sea-glass-necklaces","url":"/category/sea-glass-necklaces"}]},{"id":13383780,"name":"Genuine Eco Friendly Aqua Sea Glass Cresting Wave Necklace","permalink":"genuine-eco-friendly-aqua-sea-glass-cresting-wave-necklace","position":38,"price":48.0,"default_price":48.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/genuine-eco-friendly-aqua-sea-glass-cresting-wave-necklace","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-05T19:33:10.000Z","description":"Sea glass as lovely as these pretty bright aqua and white gems used in this pendant need an equally lovely partner to accompany it.

If you are not yet knowledgeable about these magnificent works of art, allow me to give you a brief history. Back in the 1970's, the two Lundberg brothers started a glass making factory in Davenport, California. Their unique method of creating glass products helped make some of the most beautiful vases, paperweights and other glass objects the USA has ever created. In fact, Lundberg glass is displayed in the Smithsonian Institute, the White House, the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Art Institute of Chicago among other institutions.\r\n\r\nAccording to one worker I spoke to at the Lundberg Studios during a visit, decades ago, glass remnants of each day's production was dumped into the stream that ran past the studio which, in turn, made its way into the Pacific Ocean. It is called end-of-day glass - same way end-of-day glass was created in Northern England. Decades later, it is the source of the magnificent sea glass washing up on one particular beach in Santa Cruz, California.\r\n\r\nWhat a true gem! This Santa Cruz sea glass gem is a gorgeous, thick nugget with streaks of various shades of Spring green on all four sides . The top is a misty clear color that really makes its bottom half pop! I paired it with a pretty Sterling Silver vine bail. This piece is truly one-of-a-kind. I can promise you that there will never be an exact duplicate of this piece found! The entire pendant measures 1/2\" 1 1/4\". Perfect necklace for the sea glass lover looking for something completely unique!

If you would like a 16\" or 20\" chain, please contact me and I will be happy to accommodate you.","options":[{"id":43258665,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124145835/-/il_570xN.338481779.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124145835/-/il_570xN.338481779.jpg","width":552,"height":615},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124145847/-/il_570xN.338607906.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124145847/-/il_570xN.338607906.jpg","width":570,"height":756},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124145856/-/il_570xN.338607914.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124145856/-/il_570xN.338607914.jpg","width":570,"height":761},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124145871/-/il_570xN.430735451_f9p6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124145871/-/il_570xN.430735451_f9p6.jpg","width":570,"height":562}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6114657,"name":"Sea Glass Necklaces","permalink":"sea-glass-necklaces","url":"/category/sea-glass-necklaces"}]}]
