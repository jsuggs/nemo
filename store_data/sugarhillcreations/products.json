His \"feathers\" are a distinguished textured deep brown created from a top quality vinyl. \r\n\r\nDexter loves to waddle (or strut) around the lake with his infamous slapping sound \"webbed feet\". With a large wooden knob for easy grasping, this is a wonderful push toy to accompany those first steps!\r\n\r\n\r\nDimensions: 11\"L x 6\"W x 28\"H\r\n\r\n\r\nWarning: This disclaimer of liability affirms that Sugar Hill Creations LLC, is not responsible or liable for any loss, damage, or injury arising from the use or misuse of this product.
