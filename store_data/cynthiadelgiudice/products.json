I designed and made this necklace for the contemporary, art loving, recycling, eco-friendly woman who dares to wear jewelry that is out of the ordinary. I think it would look spectacular on a bride.\r\n\r\nThis necklace is delicate and almost weightless. I used pieces of plastic bags and fused them into free form shapes to make the delicate white flowers which are flexible but very sturdy. I've secured these flowers onto a silk cord with sterling silver wire. Three of these flowers have tiny 4mm peacock cultured pearls (matching the color of the cord), and placed randomly on the necklace.\r\n\r\nNecklace measures 17 1/2\" (45 cm). Flowers' diameters are about 2 1/2\" (6 cm)to 1 1/4\" (3cm).\r\n\r\nLet me know if you'd like a different length, or if you'd prefer white cord and pearls.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!","options":[{"id":807788,"name":"Default","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1165123/-/eco-necklace_III_017a.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1165123/-/eco-necklace_III_017a.JPG","width":773,"height":580}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":163951,"name":"Fused Plastic","permalink":"fused-plastic","url":"/category/fused-plastic"},{"id":163946,"name":"necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]},{"id":178585,"name":"Fused Plastic Pin","permalink":"fused-plastic-pin","position":2,"price":32.0,"default_price":32.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fused-plastic-pin","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-11-05T05:26:30.000Z","description":"This listing is for a Fused Plastic Pin. It is made to order. The one pictured above has been sold, but I will make another one just like it (but not exactly, as it is handmade). Please allow 4 business days for completion.\r\n\r\nIt is \"Eco-Friendly\" and beautiful. These delicate fused plastic \"flowers\" are light, yet very durable. I have layered several of these fused flowers to make a graceful bloom. I've placed a sterling silver ball in the middle which adds to this piece. I have tumbled the sterling silver pin for shine and resistance. It is slightly curved towards the front for easy placement on your garment. I have added a little copper cap to the end of the pin for safety and attached a length of steel flex wire to it so it doesn't get lost.","options":[{"id":807809,"name":"Default","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1165199/-/fused_plastic_brooch_model_II.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1165199/-/fused_plastic_brooch_model_II.JPG","width":537,"height":479}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":163951,"name":"Fused Plastic","permalink":"fused-plastic","url":"/category/fused-plastic"},{"id":163948,"name":"Pins","permalink":"pins","url":"/category/pins"}]},{"id":178589,"name":"Fused Plastic Earrings","permalink":"fused-plastic-earrings","position":3,"price":22.0,"default_price":22.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fused-plastic-earrings","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-11-05T05:30:21.000Z","description":"For the contemporary, art loving, recycling, eco-friendly woman who dares to to wear jewelry that is out of the ordinary.\r\n\r\nThese earrings are delicate and almost weightless.
