During his four-year stay at the Sorbonne university in Paris, von Jackhelln, a Norwegian citizen with remote German origins, developed a strong interest in his own identity and culture. The Sturmgeist name, meaning \"stormspirit\" in German, was inspired by Goethe's ballads from the \"Sturm und Drang\" era. \r\n\r\nIn \"Manifesto Futurista\" Sturmgeist explores the aesthetics of early 20th-century Futurism. \"There is no masterpiece that has not an aggressive character,\" F.T. Marinetti wrote in 1909. Exactly one century later, it is only appropriate to commemorate Futurism with the song \"Manifesto Futurista\", a blazing anthem to speed and technology. However, also the darkest moments of last century are treated. The song \"Verdun\" tells the destiny of a young soldier in WWI, whereas the French lyric \"Elégie d'une modernité meurtrière\" describes a Genesis gone wrong, the creation of Man by God and Man's subsequent creation of industrial death camps. \r\n\r\n\"Manifesto Futurista\" contains four poems from von Jackhelln's book \"Galderhug/Spellmind\" (bilingual Norwegian/English edition, Cappelen Damm publishers, 2008). Also a writer, von Jackhelln's bibliography counts six titles exploring the crash between Norse mythology and contemporary culture. In 2007 Von Jackhelln won the Bonnier-Cappelen publishing group's Great Nordic Novel Competition with the saga \"The Fall of the Gods\", landing him massive media attention, translations into three languages and a considerable prize sum. \r\n\r\nOn November 7th, 2007, Sturmgeist got the worst phone call a musician can get: a news reporter stated that a young Finn using \"Sturmgeist89\" as his YouTube login had killed nine people, including himself, at his high school in Jokela. As a result, Sturmgeist considered giving up music entirely. When confronted with such an example of real evil, the extreme metal fascination with imaginary evil seemed shallow and shameful. However, Sturmgeist decided to persevere. Giving the critics right would be equal to admitting guilt for a crime committed by a deranged kid alien to the band. In a press release the same day, von Jackhelln retorted that \"although extreme metal as a genre deals with topics such as isolation, misanthropy and despair, blaming the musicians is both wrong and unfair. It is people that kill people. Not music.\" The furious song \"Sturmgeist_89\" is a message from the real Sturmgeist, with the short question \"Why did you do it?\" as its desperate chorus. \r\n\r\nWhen Sturmgeist now returns after three years of silence, it is with an album that screams with fury and vengeance. Sturmgeist has adopted the extreme expression of Norwegian Black Metal and evolved beyond the eclectic Black/Thrash/Industrial style of the band's two previous albums, \"Meister Mephisto\" and \"Über\" (Season of Mist, 2005 & 2006). Centered around blitzing blastbeats, shattering riffs and hellish screams, \"Manifesto Futurista\" is the angriest and most intense album ever recorded by Von Jackhelln. \r\n\r\nThe album cover displays Norwegian artist Pushwagner's monumental work \"Dadadata I\". \"Manifesto Futurista\" was recorded in desolate surroundings in Sofia and Berlin, and masterfully mixed by Stamos Koliousis and Vangelis Labrakis at 210 Studios. Released on Sturmgeist's own Berlin-based Inhuman Music under the motto \"I speak of war but pray for peace\", \"Manifesto Futurista\" is set to enthuse and to infuriate, to alienate and to arouse. \r\n\r\nThe CD is a six-page digipack with a booklet featuring lyrics and poems, limited to 1000 copies and signed by hand.\r\n\r\nTrack list:\r\n\r\n1. Monolith\r\n2. Himmelen faller\r\n3. The Siegfried Order\r\n4. Skyggestrykerne\r\n5. Verdun\r\n6. Elégie d'une modernité meurtrière\r\n7. Ritorno glorioso\r\n8. Manifesto futurista\r\n9.

The members of Third Rebel hail from different professions, cultures and nations, but share a passion for listening to & reflecting on dark & extreme music. Think of our everlasting chat as a tv series popu- lated by nerds with a love/hate relationship to totalitarian aesthetics & the sublime, or as a stand-up cabaret with geese pitching bronze-coloured lines for the sake of rhetoric.\" \r\n\r\nFree shipping world wide is included in the price. \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":25944837,"name":"Default","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/80938893/-/couv.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/80938893/-/couv.jpg","width":690,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1720220,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":2921074,"name":"Solefald - Norrøn livskunst CD+LP","permalink":"solefald-norrn-livskunst-cd+lp","position":12,"price":46.0,"default_price":46.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/solefald-norrn-livskunst-cd+lp","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-11-24T02:41:17.000Z","description":"Our long awaited seventh studio album is here!

that features the \"Jernlov\" demo from 1996, available on cd for the first time. Four songs of total screaming madness. 300 numbered tapes of the demo were printed in 1996. The demo sold out quickly and has been unavailable ever since. \"Jernlov\" has been remastered by Endre Kirkesola and sounds pretty much like Solefald gone necro.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, \"The Circular Drain\" includes remixes of several Solefald faves. Havoc Unit has remixed \"Sun I Call\" quite beautifully; The Bombs of Enduring Freedom has given \"Survival of the Outlaw\" the bigbeat aggression it needed; Newcomer Exorcise offers a breathtaking version of \"Red for Fire + Black for Death\"; Lazare has finally remixed his favourite track \"Fluorescent\" (he has been fantasising about that since we recorded \"Neonism\" in 1998); I [Cornelius] have recorded a semi-unplugged version of \"When The Moon Is On The Wave\" as G.U.T. Check out the tracklist below for all the details. \r\n\r\nThe cd is a 6-page digipack designed by Trine Paulsen and Kim Sølve, who have done Solefald's last four releases. The front cover should be a surprise: It features the Theodor Kittelsen drawing that gave \"Solefald\" our name. \r\n\r\nI will personally sign and number every cd by hand. Along with the cd I will also send you a hand-printed card from an old-fashioned Berlin typographer stating that you belong to the Solefald hardcore of fanatics. Your red certificate will carry beautiful German gothic fonts, and I will add your name and the number of your cd by hand. \r\n\r\nBeing number seven in our discography \"The Circular Drain\" is an official Solefald release. \r\n\r\nTrack list: \r\n\r\nJERNLOV - THE IRON LAW \r\n\r\nSolefald Demonstration Tape - 996 AF \r\n\r\n1.

Since 1999 I have been writing electronica-based songs, and in August 2005 I finally committed myself to making a full album. For that purpose I rented the Graffitti Studio in Sofia, Bulgaria for four weeks' worth of studio time. Working in a wholly new country with new people turned into a genuine pleasure, given the resolute professionalism of the Graffitti crew. Ognian Kiossovski engineered the recording sessions. The Bulgarian composer and conductor Christo Pavlov arranged six of the G.U.T. songs for the Strrings (sic!) Quartet. After a rather quiet year with some additional vocal takes and editing by the sea in Kragerø, Norway, I received a generous grant from the Cultiva Express trust in Kristiansand, sponsoring the mixing of the album. Consequently I asked the mixer Endre Kirkesola at Dub Studio to board ship. The album \"My Only Drug Is Madness\" was released through my own label, Inhuman Music, in May 2007. \r\n\r\nAfter ten years of working with various well-established record labels, I decided to go solo. Being the total-control anarchist that I am, I wanted to experience the whole process of writing, performing, producing, publishing, promoting and financing an album, addressed to the people that really matter: the fanatics that enjoy my music. You will see no magazine ads for the album, and only a handful of reviews, if any. The release of \"My Only Drug Is Madness\" is an experiment in order to know if and how self-publication works. The album is available from my mail-order company in Berlin, as well as from Twilight Distribution (Germany, Austria, Switzerland), Indie Distribution (Norway), Season of Mist (France) and CDBaby (USA).
