We will use this opportunity to explore the assumptions we make around song writing by examining various examples and ways that we and others may 'shake the tree' of expectations in a bid to find new, expressive musical language. We will listen to work (yours, mine, India's and others) discuss ideas of theory and practice and generally 'play in the songwriters sandpit' for two days.\r\n\r\nI am delighted, on this occasion, to be co-leading this course with India Bourne who, as well as being a founder player with Ben Howard is very much an explorative songwriter in her own right...The specific purpose of this weekend is to create a forum of support for new, innovative, explorative work.  A place to ‘dare to try something new’\r\nThis course is an opportunity to share work (both complete and work in progress) and receive feedback in a ‘group master-class’ setting.  \r\n\r\nThe course leaders and participants will discuss your work in detail and suggest ideas and strategies for  further development. \r\n\r\nPlease apply in writing to: Julian@wigglylines.co.uk  \r\n\r\nThe weekend will also include a pre-given task (given out early September) www.londonsongcompany.com 07832 200980","options":[{"id":40531776,"name":"Full Price","price":225.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43056117,"name":"#shakeyourtree discount","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122196150/-/_ShakeTheTree_promo_square_jpeg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122196150/-/_ShakeTheTree_promo_square_jpeg.jpg","width":768,"height":768}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":9668281,"name":"LSC Develop Your Songwriting London - 6 week evening course Oct/Nov 2013","permalink":"lsc-developers-course-may-june","position":3,"price":150.0,"default_price":150.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lsc-developers-course-may-june","status":"sold-out","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-02-28T19:04:04.000Z","description":"(Click on the drop down arrows above to see different payment options)\r\n\r\nFacilitated by Julian Marshall and Jonathan Whiskerd, you will explore all elements of your songwriting (structure, lyrics, harmony, rhythm, pulse, hooks etc), and develop and refine your skills through writing a new song each week, to a brief given by your tutor at each class.
