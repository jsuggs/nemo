Plants come in a deep cell tray that ensures a large and healthy root ball.  The mix of plants consists of approximately 75% annual varieties and 25% perennial and biennial varieties.  \r\n\r\nIF CARED FOR PROPERLY, THESE PLANTS WILL PRODUCE ENOUGH FLOWERS TO KEEP YOUR HOME FILLED WITH BOUQUETS ALL SEASON. \r\n\r\nAll plants are grown from seed by Love 'n Fresh Flowers in our greenhouse using only organic practices so that they are robust and ready to go right into your planting beds.  The exact mix of plants in this share will be determined in February, but all will be good for sun/part-sun and average soil conditions.  All make excellent cut flowers and foliage for your own backyard bouquets.  \r\n\r\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\r\n\r\nThe following are some possible plants in the share.  Shares may not be identical.   \r\n\r\nThere is no cut flower quite like the lisianthus (<i>Eustoma grandiflorum</i>).  A lover of full sun and hot weather, it happily flowers through the dog days of August and into the fall.  The flowers last several weeks in the vase and just a few stems can make a big bouquet.  \r\n\r\n<i>Euphorbia marginata </i> 'Icicle' is another must-have in the cutting garden.  The icy white edges of its leaves make an elegant and dramatic foliage filler in bouquets.   \r\n\r\n<i>Ammi majus</i> goes by the common name False Queen Anne's Lace, but it's anything but true bliss in bouquets.  The lacey heads full of millions of teeny tiny white flowers instantly inject any arrangement with a romantic dreamy quality.  \r\n\r\nA much loved bloom in days gone by, Sweet Williams (<i> Dianthus barbatus</i>) are regaining popularity as a cut flower due to their longevity in the vase...up to 20 days when picked at the right stage! \r\n\r\nFresh cut snapdragons (<i>Antirrhinum majus</i>) are always a marvel for their beautiful and abundant spikes of delicate colors and the honeyed fragrance (yes, fragrance!)  that each blossom exudes.  \r\n\r\nBlack-eyed Susan (<i>Rudbeckia</i>) is an instant reminder of the relaxed summer days of childhood and picking wildflowers along the road.  Varities for cutting have tall stems and add cheerful charm to bouquets.  \r\n\r\nJoe Pye Weed (<i>Eupatorium</i>) is a real delight, both in the garden and in the vase.  It attracts hordes of butterflies while outside and loads of admirers inside.  A very long lasting cut flower that adds delicate lavender notes to arrangements.  \r\n\r\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\r\n\r\nPlants come in a deep cell tray, the perfect size for planting straight into the garden.  Since we are growing these plants for you from seed or cuttings that may not produce as planned, <i>Love 'n Fresh reserves the right to substitute varieties as needed.</i>  All plants are grown using organic fertilizers and sustainable practices.\r\n\r\n<u>Shipping is not available.  Plants will be available for pick up at the Love 'n Fresh design studio in Chestnut Hill and a private home in West Philly in late April when the spring weather becomes stable enough for planting in the garden.  You will receive an email with the pick up details in mid-April once we see how the spring weather is unfolding.</u>  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions before ordering, please email info@lovenfreshflowers.com.

Each Bouquet Share member will receive a vase at the beginning of the season that they can use each week for their flowers and is theirs to keep.  </u> \r\n\r\nThe bouquet share is also a great choice for the local business looking to add color and a fresh distinctive touch to your sales or reception area.  Great for doctor's offices or hostess stations.\r\n\r\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\r\n\r\n<b>You can share your share!!</b> Since our flowers last so long, sometimes you don't need a new batch every week or you might be going on vacation during the summer.

I received many compliments for my flowers from family and friends. It was lovely having fresh flowers throughout the house. I just purchased a new kitchen table and could not wait until it was delivered to put my flowers on the table. Cannot wait until next year!\"\r\n\r\n\"Each week there were a few flowers that took my breath away. This week it was apricot colored zinnias and a heavenly blue flower I don't know the name of. I put them together and the result was stunning! what I enjoyed most about my experience was the exposure to so many new flowers and realizing as the summer went on that I love flowers now even more than I did before!\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't grow my own flowers this year, and I was so happy to get Jennie's buckets every week of great, fresh flowers. They are much more pleasant to work with than flowers from the store.\"\r\n</i>\r\n","options":[{"id":15555097,"name":"Default","price":120.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129493890/-/4_week_bouquet.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129493890/-/4_week_bouquet.jpg","width":683,"height":1024},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129494088/-/SummerJamSession_074.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129494088/-/SummerJamSession_074.jpg","width":800,"height":533},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129494397/-/Love_'n_Fresh_Flowers65.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129494397/-/Love_'n_Fresh_Flowers65.JPG","width":683,"height":1024}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1796075,"name":"Flower CSA","permalink":"flower-csa","url":"/category/flower-csa"},{"id":2582557,"name":"CSA Bouquet Share","permalink":"csa-bouquet-share","url":"/category/csa-bouquet-share"},{"id":2582581,"name":"CSA - 4 Weeks","permalink":"csa-4-weeks","url":"/category/csa-4-weeks"}]}]
