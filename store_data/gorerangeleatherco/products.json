I do not like this and many other people do not as well. I designed a NATO strap that has 25% more leather so the buckle lands on the 6 o'clock position or the bottom of the wrist like a normal band. I kept the location the same for the 2 rings near the watch case so as to keep the classic look. I have to charge more because it takes more leather to make the band.   Almost a whole piece of shell cordovan has to be cut down the middle to make it for the length.  Man it looks sweet though.
