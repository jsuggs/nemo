The sizes included in the pattern range from 6m all the way through 10 yrs.

It's designed to flatter the  figure with a waistline that hits at the natural waist and a skirt that gently skims over the lower waist and hips.  In plainer fabrics the skater dress lends itself to a casual wardrobe staple that's cute with sneakers, or snag yourself a fancy fabric for a knock-out evening dress.  There are eight sizes included in the pattern, ranging from a 30” to 44” high bust, and a 24” to 38” high waist.  It's a perfect garment to make if you are new to sewing knits and very quick to sew up. The pattern itself prints over only 22 pages, and the tutorial takes two streams: a full photo tutorial with hints and tips for visual learners and a shorter crib sheet for more experienced garment sewers.\r\n\r\nFor materials required and sizes covered, please see the second picture.  For how to take your measurements, see the third picture. For an assortment of gorgeous ladies rocking their skaters, see the forth picture.  For a visual representation of swagger, see the last picture.\r\n\r\nThis pattern is a PDF and not a paper pattern, you will need to print and assemble the pieces.\r\n\r\n<b>**Please note that Kitschy Coo is a VAT registered business and this product is subject to VAT as a digital pattern.

It's a perfect garment for layering and for the transitions between seasons, and great fun for combining fabrics! It is suitable for both boys and girls.\r\n\r\nThe sizes included are 18m/2T/3T/4T. Fabric requirements are dependant on which size you are making, the width of your fabric and whether or not the print is directional but you should be able to make a hoodie for all sizes with 1m of both shell and lining fabric.

The hoodie is fully lined with all seams hidden inside so if you use a reversible zipper you get two hoodies in one! With a generous cut, the hoodie is designed to be worn for up to two years per size, and there are also two length choices within each size for added flexibility based on whether your child is tall or average. It's a perfect garment for layering and for the transitions between seasons, and great fun for combining fabrics! It is suitable for both boys and girls.\r\n\r\nThe sizes included are 5Y/6Y/7Y/8Y.  Fabric requirements are dependant on which size you are making, the width of your fabric and whether or not the print is directional but you should be able to make a hoodie for all sizes with 1.5m of both shell and lining fabric.  Additionally, you will require 1/4m of ribbing for the bands and a zipper measuring at least 16in (5y), 17in (6yr), 18in (7Y) and 19in (8Y).\r\n\r\nThis pattern is a PDF and not a paper pattern, you will need to print and assemble the pieces. \r\n\r\n<b>**Please note that Kitschy Coo is a VAT registered business and this product is subject to VAT as a digital pattern.

The beauty of the design is a tall yoga waistband... no irritating elastic to dig into the waist and the added modesty of being able to wear the band up in the back to fully cover little bottoms. The body of the briefs is a single unseamed piece to reduce irritation. The legs are bound with knit fabric and not elastic so they stay put and there's no wedgies in sight! Although roomy enough for boy bits, this underwear design is also great for girls.\r\n\r\nRequiring less than half a yard of knit fabric for the main body of the briefs, it's a great way to use up scraps or even upcycle old t-shirts.

They're all lined with contrasting fabric for peeking. The top of the bag has a zippered closing to keep all of your bits safe, it's lined with contrasting fabric and has an integral zippered pocket for segregating super precious bits.
