Emotion propels our lives, connected to one another and all things through infinity. Floods reaches inward, to the icy depths of the heart to touch and to return with ancient elements unfolding in spectral bliss and horror. Reality of pain and agony is equally married with yearning, dreaming and joyous exaltation. Stephen Kasner evokes a fully-realized painting-to-music translation, with collaborations by David Beaver, Mat Woods, Cheryl Pyle and the vexing vocals of Yoshiko Ohara (Bloody Panda). Floods calls forth a remarkable section of time and feeling, simultaneously compressed and unfurling. A frozen monster of memories, hope and love, and a constant reminder of death's door. Seamless, endless, connected energy. These are fragments of hauntings within us all. We must always remember. <b>LIMITED EDITION of 750 CD's</b>.","options":[{"id":1477301,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2898015/-/blood-fountains-floods.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2898015/-/blood-fountains-floods.jpg","width":666,"height":666}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":294061,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":364742,"name":"Blood Fountains - \"Birds\" T-Shirt","permalink":"blood-fountains-t-shirt","position":2,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/blood-fountains-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-08-08T12:08:09.000Z","description":"Metallic Silver on Black Gildan. \r\n100% heavy cotton.\r\nSizes L, XL, & XXL","options":[{"id":1482327,"name":"L","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":1482332,"name":"XL","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":1482333,"name":"XXL","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2898011/-/blood-fountains-tee.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2898011/-/blood-fountains-tee.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":294064,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":365213,"name":"Stephen Kasner WORKS: 1993 - 2006 (Paperback Edition)","permalink":"stephen-kasner-works-1993-2006-paperback-edition","position":3,"price":29.95,"default_price":29.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/stephen-kasner-works-1993-2006-paperback-edition","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-08-09T06:26:47.000Z","description":"Foreword by Dwid Hellion\r\nIntroduction by Douglas Max Utter\r\n160 pgs.\r\n10.5\" x 10.5\"\r\nFirst Edition\r\nPaperback edition ISBN \r\n0-09764035-6-0 ","options":[{"id":1483795,"name":"Default","price":29.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2902307/-/book_softback.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2902307/-/book_softback.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":295354,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":365214,"name":"Stephen Kasner WORKS: 1993 - 2006 (Hardback Edition)","permalink":"stephen-kasner-works-1993-2006-hardback-edition","position":4,"price":39.95,"default_price":39.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/stephen-kasner-works-1993-2006-hardback-edition","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-08-09T06:28:27.000Z","description":"Foreword by Dwid Hellion\r\nIntroduction by Douglas Max Utter\r\n160 pgs.\r\n10.5\" x 10.5\"\r\nFirst Edition\r\nHardback edition ISBN \r\n0-09764035-5-2 ","options":[{"id":1483799,"name":"Default","price":39.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2902315/-/book_hardback.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2902315/-/book_hardback.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":295354,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]}]
