WASH COLD, TUMBLE DRY LOW. DO NOT BLEACH. DO NOT IRON.\r\n\r\nDREAM IN COLOR: PARADISE\r\n\r\n     Jonathan slowed to watch a fleet of birds pass by overhead.  Their outstretched bodies of feathers were a deep, rich crimson that glistened under the sun as they flew in graceful unison.  He dared not make a sound.  Under his bare feet lay a coat of cool moss that he planted his toes into gently.  A Koi pond was to his left that had a strong but smooth water-fall pouring into it, and to his right was a lush orchard of the most vibrantly yellow lemon trees he had ever seen.  \r\n     Incredible, he whispered under his breath.\r\n     Back at the cabin he watched his uncle fast at work before a spread of fixings for dinner.  Candied yams, hand-mashed potatoes, barbecue baked beans, sweet cornbread, slow-cooked ribs.  The smells were intoxicating.  Periodically his uncle would hum a tune to himself that would grow louder at the end of each new line, which always brought a smile to his rich, old face.  Jonathan studied the walls of his uncle's beautiful country cabin and tried to know them.  Soon they would be his.  The walls, the garden, the meadows, the river, the lemon trees; soon he would be handed the keys and responsibilities of caring for everything.  Cows could be seen grazing in the pastures from the kitchen window.  Birds played melodic masterpieces to each other somewhere in the trees above.  Clouds drifted thoughtfully by in the distance.  His uncle peeked over at him.\r\n     \"Paradise, ain't it m'boy?\" He said.  Jonathan turned to his uncle and nodded. \r\n     \"I just can't believe it,\" he said blankly.  \"This place is a dream.\"  His uncle threw back his head and let out a deep laugh that let the meadows know his presence.  \r\n     \"Oh, it's all real, no question about that.  And it's all yours!\"  He washed his hands and began bringing dishes over to the table where Jonathan was.  Steam rose gently into the air and aromatized the dining area.   His uncle slid a plate in front of him and then took a seat across the table.  When he got situated he began to speak in a different tone.  It was calm, earnest, and slightly rhythmic.  His eyes were closed and his hands outstretched.  He spoke about the food, the cabin, the rain, the sunshine, and the land.  He brought them all to the table with him as though to acknowledge everything before he did anything else.  He ended by saying, \"thank you,\" and then opened his eyes and smiled.  \"Dig in!\"  \r\n     Jonathan hesitated.  He had some questions that needed answering first.  \r\n     \"But why me?\"  He motioned all around him. \"I am just a guy, and here I am being handed the most beautiful ranch, your ranch!\"  His uncle nodded and scooped a giant bite of mashed potatoes into his mouth and breathed smoothly through his nostrils.  \r\n     \"You know,\" he started.  \"Some might choose to call a place like this 'home' and some might not.  Some might even call it 'Hell'!\" He roared with laughter, his belly bouncing and eyes forming small tears.  \"But I prefer to call it something sweeter.  I call it, 'Paradise,' 'cuz I can't think of a better place to be in the whole wide world.\"  Jonathan felt the weight of his new responsibility even more as he watched the emotion exude from his uncle's body.  \r\n     The old man's face now became more serious.  \"We always get a choice in life,\" he said, stopping to swallow.  Jonathan listened carefully.  \"As you know, it was my choice to leave this place to you.  It's a land that reflects my craft, my determination, and my hard-work, and when I decided it was time for me to move on and focus on something new, I needed to leave it with someone I knew, and I preferred to give it to someone I loved.  You're my blood, after all.\"\r\n     \"But what if I fail?  What if I can't tend it like you did?\"\r\n     His uncle waved his hands wildly in the air.  \"Nonsense,\" he said.  \"I've written everything out for you.\"  He pointed at the desk in the den that held a neat stack of papers.  \"But always remember that it's not a matter of ability but of choice.  While you are here, you can tend it and give it what it needs, or you can set your sights on something outside of this.  It's yours to enjoy so long as you follow the instructions that I've given you.\"\r\n     Jonathan did not speak for a while.  His uncle was right, his fear did not indicate his inability, after all, he had been tending ranches as a hired-hand from the time he was able to tie his own shoes.  It was the willingness to receive such wealth without compensating for it that he lacked.  He was never taught to receive anything without giving in return, and something about it seemed to deflate his sense of self-worth.  His stomach grew hot with anguish, and in that moment he could almost hear his heart pleading with his head.  He absolutely desired the ranch, but his mind could not help but trip on the bricks of blessing that now stood in front of his own hand-built empire.  \r\n     His uncle wiped his face and sat back in his chair.  His excitement seemed to settle down now for the first time all evening.  He peered out at the pastures and peacefully studied them.  The evening sun illuminated the land with powerful beams of orange, red, and yellow.  Jonathan was still. \r\n     \"Something to remember,\" his uncle broke through the silence.  He looked at his nephew, who was still watching the way the sun was coming to a close.  \"Paradise is a place for us all, son.  Must of us just don't know it yet.\"\r\n","options":[{"id":27146766,"name":"ANTIQUE WHITE SMALL","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28940363,"name":"ANTIQUE WHITE MEDIUM","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29568677,"name":"ANTIQUE WHITE LARGE","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29570933,"name":"ANTIQUE WHITE X-LARGE","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29736650,"name":"ANTIQUE WHITE X-SMALL","price":32.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74430129/-/Paradise-CREW.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74430129/-/Paradise-CREW.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":298791,"name":"MENS","permalink":"mens","url":"/category/mens"},{"id":2584883,"name":"MENS - CREWS","permalink":"mens-crews","url":"/category/mens-crews"}]},{"id":13977675,"name":"REGAL RING","permalink":"regal-ring","position":5,"price":26.0,"default_price":26.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/regal-ring","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-04T20:23:44.000Z","description":"BRASS \"REGAL\" RING, COMES IN SIZES 6-10","options":[{"id":44964024,"name":"SIZE 6","price":26.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44964027,"name":"SIZE 7","price":26.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44964030,"name":"SIZE 8","price":26.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44964033,"name":"SIZE 9","price":26.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44964141,"name":"SIZE 10","price":26.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125353986/-/Screen_Shot_2013-10-04_at_1.21.28_PM.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125353986/-/Screen_Shot_2013-10-04_at_1.21.28_PM.png","width":152,"height":135}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2152214,"name":"WOMENS","permalink":"womens","url":"/category/womens"},{"id":279012,"name":"ACCESSORIES","permalink":"accessories","url":"/category/accessories"},{"id":2152252,"name":"ACCESSORIES - RINGS","permalink":"accessories-rings","url":"/category/accessories-rings"}]},{"id":12585420,"name":"MANACLE","permalink":"manacle","position":6,"price":38.0,"default_price":38.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/manacle","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-25T21:21:05.000Z","description":"MATERIAL: BRASS\r\n\r\nDIAMETER: 2.75\"\r\nHIEGHT: 1.5\"\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":40016661,"name":"BRASS","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121828827/-/Jewelry.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121828827/-/Jewelry.jpg","width":2316,"height":2678}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":279012,"name":"ACCESSORIES","permalink":"accessories","url":"/category/accessories"},{"id":2152248,"name":"ACCESSORIES - BRACELETS","permalink":"accessories-bracelets","url":"/category/accessories-bracelets"}]},{"id":8554341,"name":"&#x27;MERICA - WOMEN&#x27;S SWEATSHIRT","permalink":"merica","position":7,"price":44.0,"default_price":44.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/merica","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-14T20:36:54.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

It is nestled neatly into leather interior, riding shotgun during early commutes as we treat the noise of world news like a nagging mother-in-law. It is the steps along the corporate ladder, the heavy oak office door and dark red mahogany desk. It is the long-anticipated lunch with the exec's, lobster and wine on the company dime. It drifts drowsily home with us again, passing the hungry and homes made of shopping carts, the litter, the drunken, the helpless, the drug-enslaved, the weeping, the gnashing. It goes perched alongside us under chandelier light, consuming hard-earned sirloins and whiskey neats, reviewing the better parts of the day's events with the Misses. It closes up the blinds and pours another drink and serenly floats away, unconscious upon the arm chair, buried in wall street and warm alcoholic exhalation. \r\n\r\nIt is sweet Liberty ever along for the ride, abused, yet ignored, and so willingly taken for granted. She is the most delectable drink that we could savor, the preciously inherited liquor of the American experience gone tragically guzzled like one glass too many. \r\n\r\nCherish and remember her, you inheritors.

WASH COLD, TUMBLE DRY LOW. DO NOT BLEACH. DO NOT IRON.\r\n\r\nCHOP AND RAGE//WILL TURN THE HEART INTO STONE\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of reasons to be upset with her. She has been a vehicle, a carrier even, for atrocity. To some she has conjured frustration with her often narrow-minded, legalistic perspectives. To others she has harvested anger due to gossip and broken relationships within her, as well as her sometimes apparent ignorance to such incredible injustices everywhere. Still to others she has become a subject to resent on account of her lazy and often fickle outlook on politics and lifestyle. Most tragic, though, is that to some she is a whore, opening and lending herself to hypocritical happenstance and willful action alike.\r\n          Whether she is a part of your story or not, chances are good that, at some point, she has left a negative impression upon you. Such feels ironic given all that she is chocked up to be. After all, it was written once that she should be different from the rest in her charity, her mercy, and her kindness; she was to be graceful and self-sacrificing, an organism of several appendages that all operate differently, but that all meet as equals to eat dinner together.\r\n          What goes forgotten too often is that every living thing is constructed of different parts that all come together to accomplish something natural and good. A man is not simply a man but a combination of a heart, a will, a mind, and thousands of physical organs that all come together and allow him to eat, sleep, think, love, and stand for something. Without even one working part he is incomplete, and his body must compensate for his deficiency. \r\n          Plenty can conclude that she is riddled with infection more abhorrent than the grossest of malarias and poxes ever known. But who among us out there have dared to do anything about it? It is true that the chop and rage of her angry and unpredictable ocean can turn and churn our hearts into stone, and she may very well be a whore, but she is still our mother. She is still our sisters, our fathers, our brothers, our friends, and truly the only life-giving body we have.","options":[{"id":26878689,"name":"SMALL","price":44.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26878692,"name":"MEDIUM","price":44.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26878695,"name":"LARGE","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26878698,"name":"X-LARGE","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84161697/-/507-SS.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84161697/-/507-SS.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":298791,"name":"MENS","permalink":"mens","url":"/category/mens"},{"id":4219608,"name":"MENS - SWEATSHIRTS","permalink":"mens-sweatshirts","url":"/category/mens-sweatshirts"}]},{"id":8592999,"name":"FLY AWAY - WOMEN'S BOX-IT","permalink":"fly-away-women-s-box-it","position":10,"price":36.0,"default_price":36.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fly-away-women-s-box-it","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-17T21:28:43.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

The paint-chipped deck creaked below her feet as she stepped out upon the porch.  The sun had long since set and she stared out at the black sky.  Remaining with age was the moon, bright and full, among an array of glittering stars.  On the street a dark sedan appeared and passed and Sarah watched the glow of its tail lights.  It was Mr. Wallace out to pick up his daughter from the train station, an act he made regular since she took a job in the city for extra money after his wife passed.  A yearning ached inside Sarah as the sedan turned the corner at Mayberry Street and rolled out of sight.   She hesitated.  The mystery of the night, the open road, and freedom forged a warm impress upon her heart that stirred up a flurry of fear and excitement within her chest.   She tugged the straps of her neatly packed backpack on her shoulders and felt its weight.  It gave her confidence to know she could still turn around but knew this would be the last opportunity to escape from the force of her father for a long time.  She drew in a deep breath, hoping it would put her fear to rest, and then let it billow outward like smoke from her lungs.  Then, she started across the lawn.  As she watched her tightly tied shoes bend dozens of individual blades of grass she recalled a strange memory.  She remembered a television series about birds, about how, at the right time, mother birds nudge their young from their nests and allow them to free-fall into the open air below.  The mother expected its chicks to instinctively know how to spread their new wings if they would survive.  As a child she watched with an estranged curiosity and wondered about the role of a mother.  The swoosh of her shoes within the grass below ceased as she reached the sidewalk in front of the house.  She turned and peered up at it for a moment and briefly watched her childhood, her bondage, roll through her mind as it had been for as long as she could determine between right and wrong.  Risk is inevitable if we ever expect to live, she whispered to herself, taking courage in the words of a radio preacher she had begun listening to in secret.  She clenched her backpack straps again and turned toward the direction of the moon, leaving a cold, relentless darkness at her back.","options":[{"id":26978577,"name":"X-SMALL","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26978580,"name":"SMALL","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26978583,"name":"MEDIUM","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26978586,"name":"LARGE","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84531057/-/447-BOXIT.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84531057/-/447-BOXIT.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2152214,"name":"WOMENS","permalink":"womens","url":"/category/womens"},{"id":4235895,"name":"WOMENS - BOX-IT","permalink":"womens-box-it","url":"/category/womens-box-it"}]},{"id":8591730,"name":"MANMADE - MEN&#x27;S CREW","permalink":"manmade-men-s-crew","position":11,"price":32.0,"default_price":32.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/manmade-men-s-crew","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-17T20:20:33.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON. WASH COLD, TUMBLE DRY LOW. DO NOT BLEACH. DO NOT IRON.\r\n\r\nMANMADE \r\n\r\nThe indian hunter crept forward slowly as his prey came into view.  His left hand rested on his machete against his thigh, and his right hand clutched his bow.  Both could be needed, he thought.  He inched closer, his buffalo-skin moccasins doing most of the work.  His game now stopped lapping up water from the creek and kept its focus still.  He knew its round eyes watched him from the side, and he watched its fear rise through its quickened breath.  The slimy creature took another lap with its long, pink tongue and froze again.  Joey quietly pulled a finely crafted arrow from his home-made quiver and nestled it between his line, an old shoe lace, and his bow, a curved stick he came upon in the woods.  He envisioned his victory well before he released his arrow: the praise from his tribe upon his return with enough game for all to feast upon for weeks.  He exhaled, and then let his arrow fly.  The frog anticipated his attack and lurched forward.  Joey scrambled up and dove upon the amphibian with his arrow sack.  A great splash coated all spectating plants along the creek bed.  Joey waited to rise to see if the frog moved, all the while knowing his duty may be to lay in the water and mud for days if that was what it took.  Just then, a faint bump bulged into his stomach, and then another.  He peered underneath at his bag and saw the creature's figure moving about in his quiver sack.  He leaped to the air and held the bag high and screamed, \"I am your new chief, you indian people! Who else has brought you as much food as I?\"  A smile beamed from ear to ear across his face as he quickly gathered his weapons and darted toward home.  To his victorious catch he imagined the warm and loving smile of his mother, and upon his father's return from his work trip, if he was lucky, he might receive a nod of proud approval and a man's hand-shake.\r\n     \tFrom a distance he could see his mother seated upon the porch.  He trotted out from the woods, his face pink with fatigue and excitement.  She had not seen him approaching and her face was buried in her lap.  As he got closer he pretended he had been hit by a wall of wind, and went falling to ground as though shot in battle.  From the grass he peered over toward his mother, wondering if she had noticed, but she was still crouched downward.  He watched her quietly for a few seconds and made some assessments.  She was not cheerful, though she was not physically hurt.  He envisioned the enemy's attack and concluded that it must have been minimal.  Just then, he heard something.  As he listened carefully he heard short, quick sobs coming from the direction of the family porch.  He focussed on his mother again and saw that her body was shaking.  He was immediately stunned and he realized that he had never heard his mother cry before.  She was small, beautiful, and kind, and it made him angry to see her sad, so he rose and made his way toward the house.  She noticed and wiped her cheeks with her sleeves and held her arms open to him.  A cautious curiosity welled over him.  He still clutched his arrow bag, and his bow was slung over his shoulder.  He moved in slowly but did not hug her; something more important was happening.  She lowered her arms.\r\n     \t\"Son,\" his mother said in a tremble.  \"I need you to sit down next to me.\"  He did not move.  Instead, he carefully attempted to interpret his mother's words, wondering what kind of strange poison she must have drank.  He thought about his indian tribe and how he had to bury many of their dead after they had been poisoned by the enemy, the neighbor girls next door.  \r\n     \"Joseph.  Right now.\"  His mother's trembling tone was instantly substituted for one of sternness.  He blinked and jumped down next to her, knowing not to ignore this tone.  He moved in next to his mother.  \r\n     \"Buddy, I need to tell you something.\"  Her voice shook again.  He looked closer at her face now: her forehead had formed tiny beads of sweat; her cheeks were dampened in a way that showed she had been crying for a while; her eyes seemed to squint with pain.  A heavy weight that he had never felt began to rise up in his chest and it made him feel uncomfortable.  His mother passed her arm around his shoulders and held him close.  She brought a piece of crumpled paper that he had not yet seen into view.  Its scribbles and poor hand-writing made it appear to have been written by a man.\r\n     \"What's that?\"\r\n     \"It's a letter.\"\r\n     \"Who from?  Uncle William?\"\r\n     \"No.\"\r\n     \"Uncle John?\"\r\n     \"No, son.\"  Joey was confused.  He could not think of any other men that he had seen write words.\r\n     \"Well, what is it then?\"  His mother had ceased sobbing, but tears still rolled from her eyes.  She did not answer him immediately, and when she felt his little body grow distracted and squirm with anticipation she held him tighter.  He wanted to get away, to check on his frog and perhaps to find another one.  But, as he did he felt the heaviness in his chest again.  It made him feel sick and sad, and now he did not want to move at all; his desire to explore and play in the woods behind his home went completely lost.  As he felt the strength of his mother holding him still he came to know something well beyond his years.  It would take him a long time to understand the significance of this moment, as well to understand why it felt so unnatural.  As he peered up at her again he realized for the first time that something could hurt his mother.\r\n     \"Its from your father,\" she said softly.\r\n     \"What did he say?  Say when he's coming home from business?\"\r\n     \"No, it doesn't say that.\"  This annoyed him.  He missed his dad and so he grew quiet.  A few moments passed before his mother sobbed once more, took a deep breath that he could feel filter in and out of her close body, and then said, \"Son, your father will be gone for a very long time, and I don't know when he's coming back.\"  This confused him even more.  He knew that if anybody knew the actions of his father, it was her.  She always knew the day and the hour of his return.\r\n     \"Why, mother?\"\r\n     \"Because in this letter he doesn't write about a plan to come home, only that, among other things, that he will not be coming back.\"\r\n     \"No, mother.  Not that.\"  Joey leaned away from his mother and sat up straight.  He looked away distantly, and then as he had seen his father do, he furrowed his brow and looked at her seriously and said, \"why doesn't father want to live with us anymore?\"","options":[{"id":26975013,"name":"SMALL","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26975016,"name":"MEDIUM","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26975019,"name":"LARGE","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26975022,"name":"X-LARGE","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29565527,"name":"X-SMALL","price":32.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84519333/-/505-CREW.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84519333/-/505-CREW.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":298791,"name":"MENS","permalink":"mens","url":"/category/mens"},{"id":2584883,"name":"MENS - CREWS","permalink":"mens-crews","url":"/category/mens-crews"}]},{"id":8593221,"name":"PEOPLE TURN AROUND - WOMEN&#x27;S BOX-IT","permalink":"people-turn-around-women-s-box-it","position":12,"price":36.0,"default_price":36.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/people-turn-around-women-s-box-it","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-17T21:37:58.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

WASH COLD, TUMBLE DRY LOW. DO NOT BLEACH. DO NOT IRON.\r\n\r\nMANMADE \r\n\r\nThe indian hunter crept forward slowly as his prey came into view.  His left hand rested on his machete against his thigh, and his right hand clutched his bow.  Both could be needed, he thought.  He inched closer, his buffalo-skin moccasins doing most of the work.  His game now stopped lapping up water from the creek and kept its focus still.  He knew its round eyes watched him from the side, and he watched its fear rise through its quickened breath.  The slimy creature took another lap with its long, pink tongue and froze again.  Joey quietly pulled a finely crafted arrow from his home-made quiver and nestled it between his line, an old shoe lace, and his bow, a curved stick he came upon in the woods.  He envisioned his victory well before he released his arrow: the praise from his tribe upon his return with enough game for all to feast upon for weeks.  He exhaled, and then let his arrow fly.  The frog anticipated his attack and lurched forward.  Joey scrambled up and dove upon the amphibian with his arrow sack.  A great splash coated all spectating plants along the creek bed.  Joey waited to rise to see if the frog moved, all the while knowing his duty may be to lay in the water and mud for days if that was what it took.

They have been constructed to teach children to read, poetically placed to speak sweet nothings to lovers, fashioned to coax consumers to make purchase, arranged and disarranged to bring entertainment in sport and game, formed to lead masses to rhythmic religious devotion, and crafted to create fervor and action among attendees of spoken speech. They are the ingredients to words and thoughts as water and dough are to bread: not always enough when alone to stand as substantive, but completely necessary in order to make an idea influential. Furthermore, if verbal and written communication are the vehicles by which said influence travels in thought, idea, sentiment, suggestion, exhortation, and lesson, then letters are the nuts and bolts that drive change into being.","options":[{"id":26978022,"name":"DUSTY BLUE X-SMALL","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26978025,"name":"DUSTY BLUE SMALL","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26978028,"name":"DUSTY BLUE MEDIUM","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26978031,"name":"DUSTY BLUE LARGE","price":36.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":33248293,"name":"ANTIQUE WHITE SMALL","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":33879192,"name":"ANTIQUE WHITE X-SMALL","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":33879195,"name":"ANTIQUE WHITE MEDIUM","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84529413/-/501-BOXIT.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84529413/-/501-BOXIT.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2152214,"name":"WOMENS","permalink":"womens","url":"/category/womens"},{"id":4235895,"name":"WOMENS - BOX-IT","permalink":"womens-box-it","url":"/category/womens-box-it"}]},{"id":432970,"name":"GIN INTO OBLIVION - MEN&#x27;S CREW","permalink":"gin-into-oblivion","position":17,"price":32.0,"default_price":32.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/gin-into-oblivion","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-10-21T06:29:07.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES.  100% COTTON.

WASH COLD, TUMBLE DRY LOW. DO NOT BLEACH. DO NOT IRON.\r\n\r\nGLASS HALF FULL\r\n\r\nI remember the day I met Charlie. It was the summer of 1991 in a suburb near Nashville. School had just let out and my family had just moved to town. As we rolled in along the main drag I could see kids flooding the streets everywhere, dipping in and out of cafes, theaters, and toy stores. Boys played catch with tennis balls and girls were in clusters of two's and four's whispering and giggling to each other. I felt my breath begin to quicken as my innards were becoming a nervous orange mixture of excitement and apprehension. Each summer brought a new city. We were lucky to stay put for even ten months with my Dad's line of work. \r\n          A small craftsman with large, white squared pillars and a long front porch was our destination. As my Dad threw our long, beige station wagon into park in our new driveway, the tires teetering back and forth until finally finding a resting place, I hesitated. In the past I'd quickly molded my life around our family's new surroundings. I joined baseball teams, cub scouts, and went to block party barbecues. But it never mattered. Every year the friends I made were swept from beneath me like disposable floor mats, leaving me sore and ever more close to closing myself off completely. The hole in my jeans on the left knee was growing and I stuck my thumb in it. I stared at the inter-woven fabrics for a few seconds, the blues, grays, and whites flooding together, and then I heard a voice. It was a monotoned low whisper, like it was giving directions to a squadron over a radio. \"Hey you, OVER,\" it said. I looked past my left shoulder toward a tall hedge dividing our yard and the neighbor's. It was coming from that direction, but I couldn't make anyone out. My parents were beginning to unload the wagon. I slowly opened my door and emerged, keeping my eyes fixed upon the hedgerow.\r\n          \"Hey you, OVER!\" It came again, this time louder. I then found two beady eyes behind black-rimmed glasses staring at me. The boy was on his hands and knees, trying to keep low and out of sight. I approached slowly. \"It's right there,\" he said. I didn't understand. He pointed through the thick at a small, black walkie-talkie. It was part of a set from Spy Tech, a company that made the best spy gear a kid could ask for. \r\n          \"Get down! What, do you want to get us killed?\" Then the boy jumped up and awkwardly sprinted around the far corner of his house. \"Come in, Eagle, this is Hawk, OVER,\" the walkie-talkie rang. I could hear him huffing and puffing between words. I picked it up slowly and held down the receiver.\r\n          \"I umm…what are we running from exactly?\"\r\n          \"Eagle, get down, they're right behind you!\" I looked back and saw my parents, my Dad smiled as he carried a box, and my mom trying to wave while carrying my sister inside the house. A smile began to emerge across my face and relief seemed to wash over me gently. \r\n          Today, as I look forward to meeting up with Charlie Daniels again for the first time in ages, I can't help but smile in the same way I did that day. He is truly the best friend I've ever had.","options":[{"id":26978724,"name":"X-SMALL","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26978727,"name":"SMALL","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26978730,"name":"MEDIUM","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26978733,"name":"LARGE","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84531633/-/511-BOXIT.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84531633/-/511-BOXIT.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2152214,"name":"WOMENS","permalink":"womens","url":"/category/womens"},{"id":4235895,"name":"WOMENS - BOX-IT","permalink":"womens-box-it","url":"/category/womens-box-it"}]},{"id":8555388,"name":"DREAM IN COLOR: NAIL POLISH - WOMEN&#x27;S SWEATSHIRT","permalink":"dream-in-color-nail-polish-women-s-sweatshirt","position":25,"price":44.0,"default_price":44.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dream-in-color-nail-polish-women-s-sweatshirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-14T21:50:23.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

And after all, of course we believe this. How could we not?  Now, regarding our new community pool.  There will be no rules.  It too will be a gratuitous pond of infinite beliefs and ideas. None are denied and all are welcomed. The way I see it, the hours of operation will operate when we like, and we can all sing the same, beautiful songs in unison, whenever we like. It will be like paradise!\r\n     Sir, maybe this is just in my head, but if I may interrupt...\r\n     Yes?\r\n     Well, this ideal of your…uhh ours, which is incomparable to anything of course…\r\n     Of course.\r\n     Well, it actually shows that we believe something.  \r\n     Well, sure we do.  We believe in everything!\r\n     At times I have to wonder if it is not very charitable to do so, as you seem to think it is. \r\n     How do you mean?\r\n     You are implying that a place that is all-accepting, and nothing less, can and ought to exist.  And sure, you'll say, well what is so uncharitable about that?  Let me explain. What, if you will, of those people who think, defiantly of course, that not all should be accepted, and that complete harmony is impractical? Should we deny them access to the pool too?

WASH COLD, TUMBLE DRY LOW. DO NOT BLEACH. DO NOT IRON.\r\n\r\nGOOD MAN'S PAY\r\n\r\nI am looking for a way to get out of here. Right now it is too much. People are talking in clusters throughout the house, lazily holding plates with half eaten appetizers. I have done a great job avoiding most of the attention so far by clearing a table here or reorganizing items on the bathroom sink there. There's always something to be done when you're supposed to be mourning. But now, right now, as I watch the way my sister-in-law has busied herself with enough tasks to last the rest of the month, I grow weary with nostalgia. I see him in her, and I can see that for her he hasn't passed yet, and the more she moves about the kitchen, or socializes with aunts, second cousins, or old neighbors, the more depressed I become. I understand that she has not come to a place of dealing with her husband's death yet, but I have just arrived.\r\n          A southbound breeze is curling around the bend in the lake and moving right through me. I am like a ghost. I cup my hands to my face and struggle with the breeze for a moment until I have my cigarette lit. I shuffle around and lean upon a railing on the dock. I pull cool air deep into my lungs and then release it back into the atmosphere. I feel incredibly small as I look out at the stars. I consider the thought of being squashed by one that falls to the earth. How mindless, how pure to go by sudden and unforeseen death. At least then, I think, this pain would go away. I unfold my speech from my pocket and run through it once more:\r\n          A mother will cry at the funeral of any of her children, good or bad. A father, though, is more likely to share his emotion at the passing of a child he truly respected and loved. My brother would have made my father cry like a baby. In every sense of the word, he was a good man. He loved his wife, adored his children, and ran his business with class. He cared about the poor, calling them those whom Jesus had most compassion for, which I never understood. He also cared about me even when I couldn't have been further from sharing the sentiment. As my older brother, I grew up in his shadow and learned all I could from him. But somewhere along the line I slipped off his path and headed downward really fast. It was my choice, and yet he still lent me his hand time and time again. As a prideful man who just wanted to make it on his own, I hardly accepted him. I have always sort of known that unlike him, I am not a good man. Even still, I have received much from him, and now he's gone. I feel as though in carrying on in this world after his passing I have received his lot. I have received a good man's pay.

A young man emerged and threw his door shut thoughtlessly.  The old brass bell above the door sounded as the young man pushed into the rustic fishing shop.  His eyes quickly danced along each wall and studied their few and modest contents.  The old man knew his kind, but he called out to him anyway.\r\n     \"Afternoon there, sir.\"  The young man swung his head toward the old man.\r\n     \"Gill nets,\" he said plainly.  The old man looked him over.  He was wearing a blue cotton sweatshirt, jeans of the same color, a ball cap, and tall rubber boots that were still wet.  The old man shrugged, playing dumb.  \r\n     \"No gill nets?\"\r\n     \"Sorry, son.  Not in this shop.\"  The young man sarcastically cocked his head to the side and stepped closer.\r\n     \"You run a fishing shop.\"\r\n     \"That's right.\"\r\n     \"On the coast of the Pacific northwest.\"\r\n     \"Yep.\"\r\n     \"And you don't sell any gill nets.  And I bet you don't have trawls or seine's neither?\"\r\n     \"I have seine's, just not the kind you're looking for.  I just sell to us old guys, you see,\" he chuckled.\r\n     \"No, I still don't see,\" the young man said, throwing his arms up in defeat and making for the door.  The old man smirked and called after him.\r\n     \"Hold on there.\"  The young man stopped and looked back at him annoyed.  The old man went on.\r\n     \"You know, I'll probably be dead before someone gets around to expanding this shop into something that'll make me an extra buck, and that's alright.\"  As he spoke he placed his weathered hands upon the countertop and gazed down at the floor.  The young man noticed two great scars on the old man's forearms.  \"And you may not have the time for the kind of fishing that I enjoy, and that's alright too.\"  The young man looked at him and then peered around the shop again.  This time he found antique fishing rods, trophies, and old fishing photographs upon the walls.  He spotted a picture of a stout young man holding a four-foot King Salmon.  He walked over to it.\r\n     \"Is that you?\"  The old man nodded.  \"That has to be a sixty pound King Salmon.\"\r\n     \"Sixty-two, actually.\"  The young man thought about the persistence it had to take to wait for and pull in a fish of that size.  He looked at the old man again, now with a curious kind of respect.\r\n     \"Brick by brick,\" the old man said.\r\n     \"Sorry?\"\r\n     \"Patience proves how great a man believes in something.  The greater its value, the more worth your time it is.\"  The young man listened closer now.  The old man leaned back against the wall and stared out the window.  \"Not many buildings get built overnight,\" he smiled and folded his arms.  \"Every building gets put together one brick at a time.\"  The young man nodded in understanding and let a couple moments of silence pass through the room.  \r\n     \"Thank you,\" the young man said finally as he extended his hand.  The old man shook it gladly, and then watched him tip his hat and exit.","options":[{"id":26973711,"name":"X-SMALL","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26973714,"name":"SMALL","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26973717,"name":"MEDIUM","price":36.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26973720,"name":"LARGE","price":36.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84513705/-/454-BOXIT.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84513705/-/454-BOXIT.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2152214,"name":"WOMENS","permalink":"womens","url":"/category/womens"},{"id":4235895,"name":"WOMENS - BOX-IT","permalink":"womens-box-it","url":"/category/womens-box-it"}]},{"id":8592867,"name":"BARBIES SUCK - WOMEN'S BOX-IT","permalink":"barbies-suck-women-s-box-it","position":35,"price":36.0,"default_price":36.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/barbies-suck-women-s-box-it","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-17T21:23:25.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

WASH COLD, TUMBLE DRY LOW. DO NOT BLEACH. DO NOT IRON.\r\n\r\nDREAM IN COLOR: PARADISE\r\n\r\n     Jonathan slowed to watch a fleet of birds pass by overhead.  Their outstretched bodies of feathers were a deep, rich crimson that glistened under the sun as they flew in graceful unison.  He dared not make a sound.  Under his bare feet lay a coat of cool moss that he planted his toes into gently.  A Koi pond was to his left that had a strong but smooth water-fall pouring into it, and to his right was a lush orchard of the most vibrantly yellow lemon trees he had ever seen.  \r\n     Incredible, he whispered under his breath.\r\n     Back at the cabin he watched his uncle fast at work before a spread of fixings for dinner.  Candied yams, hand-mashed potatoes, barbecue baked beans, sweet cornbread, slow-cooked ribs.  The smells were intoxicating.  Periodically his uncle would hum a tune to himself that would grow louder at the end of each new line, which always brought a smile to his rich, old face.  Jonathan studied the walls of his uncle's beautiful country cabin and tried to know them.  Soon they would be his.  The walls, the garden, the meadows, the river, the lemon trees; soon he would be handed the keys and responsibilities of caring for everything.  Cows could be seen grazing in the pastures from the kitchen window.  Birds played melodic masterpieces to each other somewhere in the trees above.  Clouds drifted thoughtfully by in the distance.  His uncle peeked over at him.\r\n     \"Paradise, ain't it m'boy?\" He said.  Jonathan turned to his uncle and nodded. \r\n     \"I just can't believe it,\" he said blankly.  \"This place is a dream.\"  His uncle threw back his head and let out a deep laugh that let the meadows know his presence.  \r\n     \"Oh, it's all real, no question about that.  And it's all yours!\"  He washed his hands and began bringing dishes over to the table where Jonathan was.  Steam rose gently into the air and aromatized the dining area.   His uncle slid a plate in front of him and then took a seat across the table.  When he got situated he began to speak in a different tone.  It was calm, earnest, and slightly rhythmic.  His eyes were closed and his hands outstretched.  He spoke about the food, the cabin, the rain, the sunshine, and the land.  He brought them all to the table with him as though to acknowledge everything before he did anything else.  He ended by saying, \"thank you,\" and then opened his eyes and smiled.  \"Dig in!\"  \r\n     Jonathan hesitated.  He had some questions that needed answering first.  \r\n     \"But why me?\"  He motioned all around him. \"I am just a guy, and here I am being handed the most beautiful ranch, your ranch!\"  His uncle nodded and scooped a giant bite of mashed potatoes into his mouth and breathed smoothly through his nostrils.  \r\n     \"You know,\" he started.  \"Some might choose to call a place like this 'home' and some might not.  Some might even call it 'Hell'!\" He roared with laughter, his belly bouncing and eyes forming small tears.  \"But I prefer to call it something sweeter.  I call it, 'Paradise,' 'cuz I can't think of a better place to be in the whole wide world.\"  Jonathan felt the weight of his new responsibility even more as he watched the emotion exude from his uncle's body.  \r\n     The old man's face now became more serious.  \"We always get a choice in life,\" he said, stopping to swallow.  Jonathan listened carefully.  \"As you know, it was my choice to leave this place to you.  It's a land that reflects my craft, my determination, and my hard-work, and when I decided it was time for me to move on and focus on something new, I needed to leave it with someone I knew, and I preferred to give it to someone I loved.  You're my blood, after all.\"\r\n     \"But what if I fail?  What if I can't tend it like you did?\"\r\n     His uncle waved his hands wildly in the air.  \"Nonsense,\" he said.  \"I've written everything out for you.\"  He pointed at the desk in the den that held a neat stack of papers.  \"But always remember that it's not a matter of ability but of choice.  While you are here, you can tend it and give it what it needs, or you can set your sights on something outside of this.  It's yours to enjoy so long as you follow the instructions that I've given you.\"\r\n     Jonathan did not speak for a while.  His uncle was right, his fear did not indicate his inability, after all, he had been tending ranches as a hired-hand from the time he was able to tie his own shoes.  It was the willingness to receive such wealth without compensating for it that he lacked.  He was never taught to receive anything without giving in return, and something about it seemed to deflate his sense of self-worth.  His stomach grew hot with anguish, and in that moment he could almost hear his heart pleading with his head.  He absolutely desired the ranch, but his mind could not help but trip on the bricks of blessing that now stood in front of his own hand-built empire.  \r\n     His uncle wiped his face and sat back in his chair.  His excitement seemed to settle down now for the first time all evening.  He peered out at the pastures and peacefully studied them.  The evening sun illuminated the land with powerful beams of orange, red, and yellow.  Jonathan was still. \r\n     \"Something to remember,\" his uncle broke through the silence.  He looked at his nephew, who was still watching the way the sun was coming to a close.  \"Paradise is a place for us all, son.  Must of us just don't know it yet.\"","options":[{"id":26979060,"name":"X-SMALL","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26979063,"name":"SMALL","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26979066,"name":"MEDIUM","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26979069,"name":"LARGE","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84532653/-/446-BOXIT.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84532653/-/446-BOXIT.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2152214,"name":"WOMENS","permalink":"womens","url":"/category/womens"},{"id":4235895,"name":"WOMENS - BOX-IT","permalink":"womens-box-it","url":"/category/womens-box-it"}]},{"id":8555835,"name":"EVEN GOOD MEN - MEN&#x27;S SWEATSHIRT","permalink":"even-good-men-men-s-sweatshirt","position":37,"price":44.0,"default_price":44.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/even-good-men-men-s-sweatshirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-14T22:21:13.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON. WASH COLD, TUMBLE DRY LOW. DO NOT BLEACH. DO NOT IRON.\r\n\r\nEVEN GOOD MEN\r\n\r\nI walk the streets alone each night. The cold air no longer abrades my lungs like sandpaper, and the snow I once trudged through has become like grass to the bare foot. I am used to the winter now, and I am used to being alone too. I am honest with myself and I don’t pretend to know my surroundings like distant relatives anymore. I am true to my past in all of its hideousness. I have known the life of a con artist in my marriages, stealing from the sweet fidelity of patient women. I am not a good man, but I have received a good man’s pay: I have received graciousness like sunlight, daily meriting favorable rays disproportionate to my past. \r\n\r\nI have brother who is completely unlike me. My brother is a good man, you see. He is successful at his trade, and in his marriage he is content. He does not walk cold streets nor trudge through snow, for his home has been made with honesty and virtue. He gives of himself relentlessly, and without partiality. He is an icon to be imitated, a father to learn from, and a friend to rely upon. \r\n\r\nBut were you to ask him of his grace and benevolence he might answer first with his eyes. For, of him, they speak loudest. They might show that he actually believes he is the bad man. He does not rest in grace-received as I do. The bad man always needs grace, and he receives it eventually. The good man, who always gives grace, tends to disqualify himself from receiving it back. He falls apart, internally, and believes in secret that he is unworthy. Grace is, for the good man, a paradoxical pitfall. \r\n\r\nBut if grace was such a misery it would not be grace at all, for even the good man needs grace.","options":[{"id":26878944,"name":"SMALL","price":44.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26878947,"name":"MEDIUM","price":44.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26878950,"name":"LARGE","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26878953,"name":"X-LARGE","price":44.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84162609/-/433-SS.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84162609/-/433-SS.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":298791,"name":"MENS","permalink":"mens","url":"/category/mens"},{"id":4219608,"name":"MENS - SWEATSHIRTS","permalink":"mens-sweatshirts","url":"/category/mens-sweatshirts"}]},{"id":7582845,"name":"LEGACY","permalink":"legacy","position":41,"price":30.0,"default_price":30.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/legacy","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-18T02:16:44.000Z","description":"MATERIAL: BRASS\r\nLENGTH: 18 INCHES\r\n","options":[{"id":23950219,"name":"BRASS","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74431105/-/J970.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74431105/-/J970.jpg","width":667,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":279012,"name":"ACCESSORIES","permalink":"accessories","url":"/category/accessories"},{"id":2152244,"name":"ACCESSORIES - NECKLACES","permalink":"accessories-necklaces","url":"/category/accessories-necklaces"}]},{"id":8593239,"name":"SEXY DIES - WOMEN'S BOX-IT","permalink":"sexy-dies-women-s-box-it","position":43,"price":36.0,"default_price":36.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sexy-dies-women-s-box-it","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-17T21:38:42.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

Some men gasped and held their old hands to their mouths.  Others just froze.  I could have nudged them over.  My arms were still riding high in the air and I was exhaling like a maniac.  I swallowed quickly and screamed again,\r\n\t“You’ve wrung me out too many times! You got that?  Too many times!”  I let out one last breath and made for the door.

No man in my family has been as rash to relinquished himself from his work, and no man in this nation would have been as stupid to walk from the kind of money I made.  To them, my liberty would crisply translate to abandonment.  My shining moment was just ludicrous enough to get me killed.\r\nI have come to resent that we called it work at all.  Selling sex like door mats and footwear is the atrocious trade, and how it aches at me so.  We have spread our kitchen tables with its surplus, feeding on children and their salty tears.  As a young man I held tenderness and impressionability as high as my soles, and my worth was as ripe as my own disgusting greed.  What was theirs was mine, and what was mine was a parasite of perpetual robbery.  If only my greed could fathom the blow of the innocence I have already killed.  \r\n\tBut this thievery I saw no longer for I believed in something better for my nation, my fellow sisters.  The scars I have dug and the graves I have scratched upon shall no longer be mine.  My story must change, even if it means running from my own front door for the rest of my life.  \r\nI now break the soiled washboard and bite the familiar hands that wring: the fibers of my essence will henceforth be spared and the virtue of my character one day restored.

WASH COLD, TUMBLE DRY LOW. DO NOT BLEACH. DO NOT IRON.\r\n\r\nDREAM IN COLOR: PARADISE\r\n\r\n     Jonathan slowed to watch a fleet of birds pass by overhead.  Their outstretched bodies of feathers were a deep, rich crimson that glistened under the sun as they flew in graceful unison.  He dared not make a sound.  Under his bare feet lay a coat of cool moss that he planted his toes into gently.  A Koi pond was to his left that had a strong but smooth water-fall pouring into it, and to his right was a lush orchard of the most vibrantly yellow lemon trees he had ever seen.  \r\n     Incredible, he whispered under his breath.\r\n     Back at the cabin he watched his uncle fast at work before a spread of fixings for dinner.  Candied yams, hand-mashed potatoes, barbecue baked beans, sweet cornbread, slow-cooked ribs.  The smells were intoxicating.  Periodically his uncle would hum a tune to himself that would grow louder at the end of each new line, which always brought a smile to his rich, old face.  Jonathan studied the walls of his uncle's beautiful country cabin and tried to know them.  Soon they would be his.  The walls, the garden, the meadows, the river, the lemon trees; soon he would be handed the keys and responsibilities of caring for everything.  Cows could be seen grazing in the pastures from the kitchen window.  Birds played melodic masterpieces to each other somewhere in the trees above.  Clouds drifted thoughtfully by in the distance.  His uncle peeked over at him.\r\n     \"Paradise, ain't it m'boy?\" He said.  Jonathan turned to his uncle and nodded. \r\n     \"I just can't believe it,\" he said blankly.  \"This place is a dream.\"  His uncle threw back his head and let out a deep laugh that let the meadows know his presence.  \r\n     \"Oh, it's all real, no question about that.  And it's all yours!\"  He washed his hands and began bringing dishes over to the table where Jonathan was.  Steam rose gently into the air and aromatized the dining area.   His uncle slid a plate in front of him and then took a seat across the table.  When he got situated he began to speak in a different tone.  It was calm, earnest, and slightly rhythmic.  His eyes were closed and his hands outstretched.  He spoke about the food, the cabin, the rain, the sunshine, and the land.  He brought them all to the table with him as though to acknowledge everything before he did anything else.  He ended by saying, \"thank you,\" and then opened his eyes and smiled.  \"Dig in!\"  \r\n     Jonathan hesitated.  He had some questions that needed answering first.  \r\n     \"But why me?\"  He motioned all around him. \"I am just a guy, and here I am being handed the most beautiful ranch, your ranch!\"  His uncle nodded and scooped a giant bite of mashed potatoes into his mouth and breathed smoothly through his nostrils.  \r\n     \"You know,\" he started.  \"Some might choose to call a place like this 'home' and some might not.  Some might even call it 'Hell'!\" He roared with laughter, his belly bouncing and eyes forming small tears.  \"But I prefer to call it something sweeter.  I call it, 'Paradise,' 'cuz I can't think of a better place to be in the whole wide world.\"  Jonathan felt the weight of his new responsibility even more as he watched the emotion exude from his uncle's body.  \r\n     The old man's face now became more serious.  \"We always get a choice in life,\" he said, stopping to swallow.  Jonathan listened carefully.  \"As you know, it was my choice to leave this place to you.  It's a land that reflects my craft, my determination, and my hard-work, and when I decided it was time for me to move on and focus on something new, I needed to leave it with someone I knew, and I preferred to give it to someone I loved.  You're my blood, after all.\"\r\n     \"But what if I fail?  What if I can't tend it like you did?\"\r\n     His uncle waved his hands wildly in the air.  \"Nonsense,\" he said.  \"I've written everything out for you.\"  He pointed at the desk in the den that held a neat stack of papers.  \"But always remember that it's not a matter of ability but of choice.  While you are here, you can tend it and give it what it needs, or you can set your sights on something outside of this.  It's yours to enjoy so long as you follow the instructions that I've given you.\"\r\n     Jonathan did not speak for a while.  His uncle was right, his fear did not indicate his inability, after all, he had been tending ranches as a hired-hand from the time he was able to tie his own shoes.  It was the willingness to receive such wealth without compensating for it that he lacked.  He was never taught to receive anything without giving in return, and something about it seemed to deflate his sense of self-worth.  His stomach grew hot with anguish, and in that moment he could almost hear his heart pleading with his head.  He absolutely desired the ranch, but his mind could not help but trip on the bricks of blessing that now stood in front of his own hand-built empire.  \r\n     His uncle wiped his face and sat back in his chair.  His excitement seemed to settle down now for the first time all evening.  He peered out at the pastures and peacefully studied them.  The evening sun illuminated the land with powerful beams of orange, red, and yellow.  Jonathan was still. \r\n     \"Something to remember,\" his uncle broke through the silence.  He looked at his nephew, who was still watching the way the sun was coming to a close.  \"Paradise is a place for us all, son.  Must of us just don't know it yet.\"","options":[{"id":26884986,"name":"ONE SIZE","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84184929/-/446-CLOAK.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84184929/-/446-CLOAK.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2152214,"name":"WOMENS","permalink":"womens","url":"/category/womens"},{"id":2068800,"name":"WOMENS - CLOAKS","permalink":"womens-cloaks","url":"/category/womens-cloaks"}]},{"id":8558037,"name":"LIVIN&#x27; ON NOODLES - WOMEN&#x27;S CLOAK","permalink":"livin-on-noodles-women-s-cloak","position":58,"price":38.0,"default_price":38.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/livin-on-noodles-women-s-cloak","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-15T01:41:02.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

Picking up groceries was close to last on the list of things I really wanted to do. I made my turns with careless ease, and browsed through sale items rather half-heartedly. To be honest, I had to reach into my pockets three or four times just to remember what I had come to get. I heard a kid screaming a couple aisles over and it made me laugh inside. I wondered what he wanted but was not getting, probably a cookie, or a balloon. I gazed around and decided simply to get something that would suffice. I really didn’t care what it was so long as it kept me going. What I really wanted to be doing, if I could have ignored the pangs of hunger roaring from below, was dreaming. Maybe that sounds a little funny to you, but its true. \r\nDreams, my friends, are infants armed with potential. With quiet explosions they keep me up at night— No matter the magnitude of my exhaustion. They are ideas, filled with passion and drive. The y invade my thoughts and hold my heart captive. Dreams inspire. Dreams encourage.\r\n\r\nThe screaming kid was still performing on aisle 12, and had I paid to come and listen, I would have already been demanding my refund. I reached for a bag of ten-cent noodles and proceeded to check out. As I walked I thought of what would lie ahead:\r\n\r\nDreams don’t come wrapped in bows and ribbons, you see. Dreams can carry on handbags the size of mountains. The journey is long. The journey is dangerous. And nobody said the risk was easy, or safe. But no adventure is ever safe.\r\n\r\nSo that’s me—just another guy living on dreams and ten-cent noodles.","options":[{"id":26884968,"name":"ONE SIZE","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84184854/-/419-CLOAK.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84184854/-/419-CLOAK.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2152214,"name":"WOMENS","permalink":"womens","url":"/category/womens"},{"id":2068800,"name":"WOMENS - CLOAKS","permalink":"womens-cloaks","url":"/category/womens-cloaks"}]},{"id":8557983,"name":"HOME - WOMEN&#x27;S CLOAK","permalink":"home-women-s-cloak","position":65,"price":38.0,"default_price":38.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/home-women-s-cloak","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-15T01:35:40.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

Do you remember how frightened I was?”\r\n“Oh, I'll never forget the look on your face. Did I ever tell you how beautiful you looked?”\r\n“Yes.

It was the moment I knew.”\r\n“The moment you knew what, James?”\r\n“It was the moment I knew I needed to stand up.”\r\n“To stand up?”\r\n“Yes. So I slid my jacket from my chair and into my arm, and just stood. Then, I took a deep breath and made toward you. It was then that your gaze fell from mine to the dirty floor as you stepped backward, remember?”\r\n“A drunk was wildly approaching me; yes, of course I stepped backward.”\r\n“Halfway to you, though, my left foot found the corner of a table leg and my face came to meet the floor in a blurred frenzy of surprise and humiliation.”\r\n“Oh honey, you looked a fool, but I loved it.

It is found in swollen lips after fistfights, buried deep beneath blankets following heartbreaks, and embedded into lessons on lamenting that teach how to sing the most royal of blues.  Struggle can be the bitterest of battles, for in its moment it hardly offers lenience toward peace and comfort.  Often, however, struggle is necessary; often pain is crucial, for the best kind of wisdom is acquired not by the brave or strong, but by the humble and weak.

Remember patience in her wedding gown, finally coming to fruition. Remember kind charity in the way she never puts the lantern down, and remember midnight skies and long train rides that commemorate creativity, wisdom, and peace.\r\n\r\nAnd remember these for more than what they can give you back--they are no petty transaction. Like ageless gold, they are weighty with transcendence. They are for us to give and to receive, but even more, they are like detectable codes braided into the fabric of our life stories. They powerfully speak about how much more there is. When pooled together they tell an attractive tale of eternity, and such beauty, such grandeur, such benevolence (against which who could argue?) are the codes that will certainly outlast all humanity. Remember these things, and tell their story as often as possible.\r\n\r\nRemember too that there is a stark difference between these, and those that fade away. In our world, these can be easily confused. Beauty, for example, is often relegated downward and mistaken for sexiness. But beauty is not a passing fad as sexy is. It is not a life-stage, a sentiment, nor simply a place of being. Beauty is both imminent and already acquired; it is both now and for all eternity. There is much in this place that will pass away, and surely sexy will die just the same, but love, patience, charity, beauty, and so on, will stand forever.\r\n","options":[{"id":26884482,"name":"X-SMALL","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26884485,"name":"SMALL","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26884488,"name":"MEDIUM","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26884491,"name":"LARGE","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84182205/-/502-BLOUSE.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84182205/-/502-BLOUSE.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2152214,"name":"WOMENS","permalink":"womens","url":"/category/womens"},{"id":2632587,"name":"WOMENS - BLOUSE","permalink":"womens-blouse","url":"/category/womens-blouse"}]},{"id":8557809,"name":"GOTTA BE A NO ONE, 5TH EDITION - WOMEN&#x27;S BLOUSE","permalink":"gotta-be-a-no-one-5th-edition-women-s-blouse","position":78,"price":38.0,"default_price":38.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/gotta-be-a-no-one-5th-edition-women-s-blouse","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-15T01:15:45.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

In her presence her students felt a warmness about her, which was very unlike the typical cold, \"closed door\" persona they were used to finding in authority figures. She had big, bright blue eyes that she knew how to use to look past her student's faces and into their minds, their hearts; it was like she could look right past the surface and could see what pains or struggles they dealt with. She treated her job like it was a calling, like it was her purpose for existing. Every student that walked through her door dreading their first day of school became her priority, her life's work, her child. \r\n\r\nYou won't find Mrs. Zapata's name on billboards, nor in magazines. She hasn't walked a red carpet to receive a prestigious award for her dedication and service. The stories she taught, the ideas she implored, the rules of grammar that she insisted upon all may never be remembered. But her influence, deep, assertive, and caring, will forever live on in the hearts and minds of her students.\r\n\r\nMrs. Zapata daily put down her life in pursuit of the betterment of each and every one of the students she adopted as her own. She knew that if she was ever going to help her students she would have to become second to their needs; she would first have to humbly accept herself as a nobody before she could lead her students into becoming somebodies.","options":[{"id":26884443,"name":"X-SMALL","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26884446,"name":"SMALL","price":38.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26884449,"name":"MEDIUM","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26884452,"name":"LARGE","price":38.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84182061/-/506-BLOUSE.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84182061/-/506-BLOUSE.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2152214,"name":"WOMENS","permalink":"womens","url":"/category/womens"},{"id":2632587,"name":"WOMENS - BLOUSE","permalink":"womens-blouse","url":"/category/womens-blouse"}]},{"id":8557803,"name":"DREAM IN COLOR: NAIL POLISH - WOMEN'S BLOUSE","permalink":"dream-in-color-nail-polish-women-s-blouse","position":79,"price":38.0,"default_price":38.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dream-in-color-nail-polish-women-s-blouse","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-15T01:14:41.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

WASH COLD, TUMBLE DRY LOW. DO NOT BLEACH. DO NOT IRON.\r\n\r\nMANMADE \r\n\r\nThe indian hunter crept forward slowly as his prey came into view.  His left hand rested on his machete against his thigh, and his right hand clutched his bow.  Both could be needed, he thought.  He inched closer, his buffalo-skin moccasins doing most of the work.  His game now stopped lapping up water from the creek and kept its focus still.  He knew its round eyes watched him from the side, and he watched its fear rise through its quickened breath.  The slimy creature took another lap with its long, pink tongue and froze again.  Joey quietly pulled a finely crafted arrow from his home-made quiver and nestled it between his line, an old shoe lace, and his bow, a curved stick he came upon in the woods.  He envisioned his victory well before he released his arrow: the praise from his tribe upon his return with enough game for all to feast upon for weeks.  He exhaled, and then let his arrow fly.  The frog anticipated his attack and lurched forward.  Joey scrambled up and dove upon the amphibian with his arrow sack.  A great splash coated all spectating plants along the creek bed.  Joey waited to rise to see if the frog moved, all the while knowing his duty may be to lay in the water and mud for days if that was what it took.  Just then, a faint bump bulged into his stomach, and then another.  He peered underneath at his bag and saw the creature's figure moving about in his quiver sack.  He leaped to the air and held the bag high and screamed, \"I am your new chief, you indian people! Who else has brought you as much food as I?\"  A smile beamed from ear to ear across his face as he quickly gathered his weapons and darted toward home.  To his victorious catch he imagined the warm and loving smile of his mother, and upon his father's return from his work trip, if he was lucky, he might receive a nod of proud approval and a man's hand-shake.\r\n     \tFrom a distance he could see his mother seated upon the porch.  He trotted out from the woods, his face pink with fatigue and excitement.  She had not seen him approaching and her face was buried in her lap.  As he got closer he pretended he had been hit by a wall of wind, and went falling to ground as though shot in battle.  From the grass he peered over toward his mother, wondering if she had noticed, but she was still crouched downward.  He watched her quietly for a few seconds and made some assessments.  She was not cheerful, though she was not physically hurt.  He envisioned the enemy's attack and concluded that it must have been minimal.  Just then, he heard something.  As he listened carefully he heard short, quick sobs coming from the direction of the family porch.  He focussed on his mother again and saw that her body was shaking.  He was immediately stunned and he realized that he had never heard his mother cry before.  She was small, beautiful, and kind, and it made him angry to see her sad, so he rose and made his way toward the house.  She noticed and wiped her cheeks with her sleeves and held her arms open to him.  A cautious curiosity welled over him.  He still clutched his arrow bag, and his bow was slung over his shoulder.  He moved in slowly but did not hug her; something more important was happening.  She lowered her arms.\r\n     \t\"Son,\" his mother said in a tremble.  \"I need you to sit down next to me.\"  He did not move.  Instead, he carefully attempted to interpret his mother's words, wondering what kind of strange poison she must have drank.  He thought about his indian tribe and how he had to bury many of their dead after they had been poisoned by the enemy, the neighbor girls next door.  \r\n     \"Joseph.  Right now.\"  His mother's trembling tone was instantly substituted for one of sternness.  He blinked and jumped down next to her, knowing not to ignore this tone.  He moved in next to his mother.  \r\n     \"Buddy, I need to tell you something.\"  Her voice shook again.  He looked closer at her face now: her forehead had formed tiny beads of sweat; her cheeks were dampened in a way that showed she had been crying for a while; her eyes seemed to squint with pain.  A heavy weight that he had never felt began to rise up in his chest and it made him feel uncomfortable.  His mother passed her arm around his shoulders and held him close.  She brought a piece of crumpled paper that he had not yet seen into view.  Its scribbles and poor hand-writing made it appear to have been written by a man.\r\n     \"What's that?\"\r\n     \"It's a letter.\"\r\n     \"Who from?  Uncle William?\"\r\n     \"No.\"\r\n     \"Uncle John?\"\r\n     \"No, son.\"  Joey was confused.  He could not think of any other men that he had seen write words.\r\n     \"Well, what is it then?\"  His mother had ceased sobbing, but tears still rolled from her eyes.  She did not answer him immediately, and when she felt his little body grow distracted and squirm with anticipation she held him tighter.  He wanted to get away, to check on his frog and perhaps to find another one.  But, as he did he felt the heaviness in his chest again.  It made him feel sick and sad, and now he did not want to move at all; his desire to explore and play in the woods behind his home went completely lost.  As he felt the strength of his mother holding him still he came to know something well beyond his years.  It would take him a long time to understand the significance of this moment, as well to understand why it felt so unnatural.  As he peered up at her again he realized for the first time that something could hurt his mother.\r\n     \"Its from your father,\" she said softly.\r\n     \"What did he say?  Say when he's coming home from business?\"\r\n     \"No, it doesn't say that.\"  This annoyed him.  He missed his dad and so he grew quiet.  A few moments passed before his mother sobbed once more, took a deep breath that he could feel filter in and out of her close body, and then said, \"Son, your father will be gone for a very long time, and I don't know when he's coming back.\"  This confused him even more.  He knew that if anybody knew the actions of his father, it was her.

And after all, of course we believe this. How could we not?  Now, regarding our new community pool.  There will be no rules.  It too will be a gratuitous pond of infinite beliefs and ideas. None are denied and all are welcomed. The way I see it, the hours of operation will operate when we like, and we can all sing the same, beautiful songs in unison, whenever we like.

We believe in everything!\r\n     At times I have to wonder if it is not very charitable to do so, as you seem to think it is. \r\n     How do you mean?\r\n     You are implying that a place that is all-accepting, and nothing less, can and ought to exist.  And sure, you'll say, well what is so uncharitable about that?  Let me explain. What, if you will, of those people who think, defiantly of course, that not all should be accepted, and that complete harmony is impractical? Should we deny them access to the pool too?  What if they tell others in the water of their beliefs…err opinions?  What if they start raising hell?  \r\n     Well, we certainly don't want that.  \r\n     But I thought we believed anything was permissible?  \r\n     Perhaps just this one thing, this one small act of defiance will not be tolerated: any who disagrees with complete acceptance of everything should go swim somewhere else.

It was then that your gaze fell from mine to the dirty floor as you stepped backward, remember?”\r\n“A drunk was wildly approaching me; yes, of course I stepped backward.”\r\n“Halfway to you, though, my left foot found the corner of a table leg and my face came to meet the floor in a blurred frenzy of surprise and humiliation.”\r\n“Oh honey, you looked a fool, but I loved it.

In her presence her students felt a warmness about her, which was very unlike the typical cold, \"closed door\" persona they were used to finding in authority figures. She had big, bright blue eyes that she knew how to use to look past her student's faces and into their minds, their hearts; it was like she could look right past the surface and could see what pains or struggles they dealt with. She treated her job like it was a calling, like it was her purpose for existing. Every student that walked through her door dreading their first day of school became her priority, her life's work, her child. \r\n\r\nYou won't find Mrs. Zapata's name on billboards, nor in magazines. She hasn't walked a red carpet to receive a prestigious award for her dedication and service. The stories she taught, the ideas she implored, the rules of grammar that she insisted upon all may never be remembered. But her influence, deep, assertive, and caring, will forever live on in the hearts and minds of her students.\r\n\r\nMrs. Zapata daily put down her life in pursuit of the betterment of each and every one of the students she adopted as her own. She knew that if she was ever going to help her students she would have to become second to their needs; she would first have to humbly accept herself as a nobody before she could lead her students into becoming somebodies.","options":[{"id":26883123,"name":"X-SMALL","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26883126,"name":"SMALL","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26883129,"name":"MEDIUM","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26883132,"name":"LARGE","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84176517/-/506-CROP.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84176517/-/506-CROP.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2152214,"name":"WOMENS","permalink":"womens","url":"/category/womens"},{"id":2068798,"name":"WOMENS - CROPS","permalink":"womens-crops","url":"/category/womens-crops"}]},{"id":8557134,"name":"MANMADE - WOMEN&#x27;S CROP","permalink":"manmade-men-s-crop","position":97,"price":38.0,"default_price":38.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/manmade-men-s-crop","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-15T00:11:43.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON. WASH COLD, TUMBLE DRY LOW. DO NOT BLEACH. DO NOT IRON.\r\n\r\nMANMADE \r\n\r\nThe indian hunter crept forward slowly as his prey came into view.  His left hand rested on his machete against his thigh, and his right hand clutched his bow.  Both could be needed, he thought.  He inched closer, his buffalo-skin moccasins doing most of the work.  His game now stopped lapping up water from the creek and kept its focus still.  He knew its round eyes watched him from the side, and he watched its fear rise through its quickened breath.  The slimy creature took another lap with its long, pink tongue and froze again.  Joey quietly pulled a finely crafted arrow from his home-made quiver and nestled it between his line, an old shoe lace, and his bow, a curved stick he came upon in the woods.  He envisioned his victory well before he released his arrow: the praise from his tribe upon his return with enough game for all to feast upon for weeks.  He exhaled, and then let his arrow fly.  The frog anticipated his attack and lurched forward.  Joey scrambled up and dove upon the amphibian with his arrow sack.  A great splash coated all spectating plants along the creek bed.  Joey waited to rise to see if the frog moved, all the while knowing his duty may be to lay in the water and mud for days if that was what it took.  Just then, a faint bump bulged into his stomach, and then another.  He peered underneath at his bag and saw the creature's figure moving about in his quiver sack.  He leaped to the air and held the bag high and screamed, \"I am your new chief, you indian people! Who else has brought you as much food as I?\"  A smile beamed from ear to ear across his face as he quickly gathered his weapons and darted toward home.  To his victorious catch he imagined the warm and loving smile of his mother, and upon his father's return from his work trip, if he was lucky, he might receive a nod of proud approval and a man's hand-shake.\r\n     \tFrom a distance he could see his mother seated upon the porch.  He trotted out from the woods, his face pink with fatigue and excitement.  She had not seen him approaching and her face was buried in her lap.  As he got closer he pretended he had been hit by a wall of wind, and went falling to ground as though shot in battle.  From the grass he peered over toward his mother, wondering if she had noticed, but she was still crouched downward.  He watched her quietly for a few seconds and made some assessments.  She was not cheerful, though she was not physically hurt.  He envisioned the enemy's attack and concluded that it must have been minimal.  Just then, he heard something.  As he listened carefully he heard short, quick sobs coming from the direction of the family porch.  He focussed on his mother again and saw that her body was shaking.  He was immediately stunned and he realized that he had never heard his mother cry before.  She was small, beautiful, and kind, and it made him angry to see her sad, so he rose and made his way toward the house.  She noticed and wiped her cheeks with her sleeves and held her arms open to him.  A cautious curiosity welled over him.  He still clutched his arrow bag, and his bow was slung over his shoulder.  He moved in slowly but did not hug her; something more important was happening.  She lowered her arms.\r\n     \t\"Son,\" his mother said in a tremble.  \"I need you to sit down next to me.\"  He did not move.  Instead, he carefully attempted to interpret his mother's words, wondering what kind of strange poison she must have drank.  He thought about his indian tribe and how he had to bury many of their dead after they had been poisoned by the enemy, the neighbor girls next door.  \r\n     \"Joseph.  Right now.\"  His mother's trembling tone was instantly substituted for one of sternness.  He blinked and jumped down next to her, knowing not to ignore this tone.  He moved in next to his mother.  \r\n     \"Buddy, I need to tell you something.\"  Her voice shook again.  He looked closer at her face now: her forehead had formed tiny beads of sweat; her cheeks were dampened in a way that showed she had been crying for a while; her eyes seemed to squint with pain.  A heavy weight that he had never felt began to rise up in his chest and it made him feel uncomfortable.  His mother passed her arm around his shoulders and held him close.  She brought a piece of crumpled paper that he had not yet seen into view.  Its scribbles and poor hand-writing made it appear to have been written by a man.\r\n     \"What's that?\"\r\n     \"It's a letter.\"\r\n     \"Who from?  Uncle William?\"\r\n     \"No.\"\r\n     \"Uncle John?\"\r\n     \"No, son.\"  Joey was confused.  He could not think of any other men that he had seen write words.\r\n     \"Well, what is it then?\"  His mother had ceased sobbing, but tears still rolled from her eyes.  She did not answer him immediately, and when she felt his little body grow distracted and squirm with anticipation she held him tighter.  He wanted to get away, to check on his frog and perhaps to find another one.  But, as he did he felt the heaviness in his chest again.  It made him feel sick and sad, and now he did not want to move at all; his desire to explore and play in the woods behind his home went completely lost.  As he felt the strength of his mother holding him still he came to know something well beyond his years.  It would take him a long time to understand the significance of this moment, as well to understand why it felt so unnatural.  As he peered up at her again he realized for the first time that something could hurt his mother.\r\n     \"Its from your father,\" she said softly.\r\n     \"What did he say?  Say when he's coming home from business?\"\r\n     \"No, it doesn't say that.\"  This annoyed him.  He missed his dad and so he grew quiet.  A few moments passed before his mother sobbed once more, took a deep breath that he could feel filter in and out of her close body, and then said, \"Son, your father will be gone for a very long time, and I don't know when he's coming back.\"  This confused him even more.  He knew that if anybody knew the actions of his father, it was her.

And after all, of course we believe this. How could we not?  Now, regarding our new community pool.  There will be no rules.  It too will be a gratuitous pond of infinite beliefs and ideas. None are denied and all are welcomed. The way I see it, the hours of operation will operate when we like, and we can all sing the same, beautiful songs in unison, whenever we like. It will be like paradise!\r\n     Sir, maybe this is just in my head, but if I may interrupt...\r\n     Yes?\r\n     Well, this ideal of your…uhh ours, which is incomparable to anything of course…\r\n     Of course.\r\n     Well, it actually shows that we believe something.  \r\n     Well, sure we do.  We believe in everything!\r\n     At times I have to wonder if it is not very charitable to do so, as you seem to think it is. \r\n     How do you mean?\r\n     You are implying that a place that is all-accepting, and nothing less, can and ought to exist.  And sure, you'll say, well what is so uncharitable about that?  Let me explain. What, if you will, of those people who think, defiantly of course, that not all should be accepted, and that complete harmony is impractical? Should we deny them access to the pool too?  What if they tell others in the water of their beliefs…err opinions?  What if they start raising hell?  \r\n     Well, we certainly don't want that.  \r\n     But I thought we believed anything was permissible?  \r\n     Perhaps just this one thing, this one small act of defiance will not be tolerated: any who disagrees with complete acceptance of everything should go swim somewhere else.  I know it sounds mean, so lets keep quiet about it; lets not let anyone know that, as it turns out, we don't want certain ideals in our pool.","options":[{"id":23978593,"name":"X-SMALL","price":38.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23978595,"name":"SMALL","price":38.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23978597,"name":"MEDIUM","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23978599,"name":"LARGE","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74532889/-/IN_MY_HEAD-CROP.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74532889/-/IN_MY_HEAD-CROP.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2152214,"name":"WOMENS","permalink":"womens","url":"/category/womens"},{"id":2068798,"name":"WOMENS - CROPS","permalink":"womens-crops","url":"/category/womens-crops"}]},{"id":8557044,"name":"THIS T-SHIRT EXPLOITS FASHION - WOMEN'S CROP","permalink":"this-t-shirt-exploits-fashion-women-s-crop","position":102,"price":38.0,"default_price":38.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/this-t-shirt-exploits-fashion-women-s-crop","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-15T00:01:53.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

The paint-chipped deck creaked below her feet as she stepped out upon the porch.  The sun had long since set and she stared out at the black sky.  Remaining with age was the moon, bright and full, among an array of glittering stars.  On the street a dark sedan appeared and passed and Sarah watched the glow of its tail lights.  It was Mr. Wallace out to pick up his daughter from the train station, an act he made regular since she took a job in the city for extra money after his wife passed.  A yearning ached inside Sarah as the sedan turned the corner at Mayberry Street and rolled out of sight.   She hesitated.  The mystery of the night, the open road, and freedom forged a warm impress upon her heart that stirred up a flurry of fear and excitement within her chest.   She tugged the straps of her neatly packed backpack on her shoulders and felt its weight.  It gave her confidence to know she could still turn around but knew this would be the last opportunity to escape from the force of her father for a long time.  She drew in a deep breath, hoping it would put her fear to rest, and then let it billow outward like smoke from her lungs.  Then, she started across the lawn.  As she watched her tightly tied shoes bend dozens of individual blades of grass she recalled a strange memory.  She remembered a television series about birds, about how, at the right time, mother birds nudge their young from their nests and allow them to free-fall into the open air below.  The mother expected its chicks to instinctively know how to spread their new wings if they would survive.  As a child she watched with an estranged curiosity and wondered about the role of a mother.

WASH COLD, TUMBLE DRY LOW. DO NOT BLEACH. DO NOT IRON.\r\n\r\nGLASS HALF FULL\r\n\r\nI remember the day I met Charlie. It was the summer of 1991 in a suburb near Nashville. School had just let out and my family had just moved to town. As we rolled in along the main drag I could see kids flooding the streets everywhere, dipping in and out of cafes, theaters, and toy stores. Boys played catch with tennis balls and girls were in clusters of two's and four's whispering and giggling to each other. I felt my breath begin to quicken as my innards were becoming a nervous orange mixture of excitement and apprehension. Each summer brought a new city. We were lucky to stay put for even ten months with my Dad's line of work. \r\n          A small craftsman with large, white squared pillars and a long front porch was our destination. As my Dad threw our long, beige station wagon into park in our new driveway, the tires teetering back and forth until finally finding a resting place, I hesitated. In the past I'd quickly molded my life around our family's new surroundings. I joined baseball teams, cub scouts, and went to block party barbecues. But it never mattered. Every year the friends I made were swept from beneath me like disposable floor mats, leaving me sore and ever more close to closing myself off completely. The hole in my jeans on the left knee was growing and I stuck my thumb in it. I stared at the inter-woven fabrics for a few seconds, the blues, grays, and whites flooding together, and then I heard a voice. It was a monotoned low whisper, like it was giving directions to a squadron over a radio. \"Hey you, OVER,\" it said. I looked past my left shoulder toward a tall hedge dividing our yard and the neighbor's. It was coming from that direction, but I couldn't make anyone out. My parents were beginning to unload the wagon. I slowly opened my door and emerged, keeping my eyes fixed upon the hedgerow.\r\n          \"Hey you, OVER!\" It came again, this time louder. I then found two beady eyes behind black-rimmed glasses staring at me. The boy was on his hands and knees, trying to keep low and out of sight. I approached slowly. \"It's right there,\" he said. I didn't understand. He pointed through the thick at a small, black walkie-talkie. It was part of a set from Spy Tech, a company that made the best spy gear a kid could ask for. \r\n          \"Get down! What, do you want to get us killed?\" Then the boy jumped up and awkwardly sprinted around the far corner of his house. \"Come in, Eagle, this is Hawk, OVER,\" the walkie-talkie rang. I could hear him huffing and puffing between words. I picked it up slowly and held down the receiver.\r\n          \"I umm…what are we running from exactly?\"\r\n          \"Eagle, get down, they're right behind you!\" I looked back and saw my parents, my Dad smiled as he carried a box, and my mom trying to wave while carrying my sister inside the house. A smile began to emerge across my face and relief seemed to wash over me gently. \r\n          Today, as I look forward to meeting up with Charlie Daniels again for the first time in ages, I can't help but smile in the same way I did that day. He is truly the best friend I've ever had.","options":[{"id":26880738,"name":"X-SMALL","price":44.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26880729,"name":"SMALL","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26880732,"name":"MEDIUM","price":44.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26880735,"name":"LARGE","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84168429/-/511-LONGDRESS.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84168429/-/511-LONGDRESS.jpg","width":411,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2152214,"name":"WOMENS","permalink":"womens","url":"/category/womens"},{"id":4220406,"name":"WOMENS - LONG DRESS","permalink":"womens-long-dress","url":"/category/womens-long-dress"}]},{"id":8556390,"name":"FLY AWAY - WOMEN'S LONG DRESS","permalink":"fly-away-women-s-long-dress","position":121,"price":44.0,"default_price":44.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fly-away-women-s-long-dress","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-14T23:05:25.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

People are talking in clusters throughout the house, lazily holding plates with half eaten appetizers. I have done a great job avoiding most of the attention so far by clearing a table here or reorganizing items on the bathroom sink there. There's always something to be done when you're supposed to be mourning. But now, right now, as I watch the way my sister-in-law has busied herself with enough tasks to last the rest of the month, I grow weary with nostalgia. I see him in her, and I can see that for her he hasn't passed yet, and the more she moves about the kitchen, or socializes with aunts, second cousins, or old neighbors, the more depressed I become. I understand that she has not come to a place of dealing with her husband's death yet, but I have just arrived.\r\n          A southbound breeze is curling around the bend in the lake and moving right through me. I am like a ghost. I cup my hands to my face and struggle with the breeze for a moment until I have my cigarette lit. I shuffle around and lean upon a railing on the dock. I pull cool air deep into my lungs and then release it back into the atmosphere. I feel incredibly small as I look out at the stars. I consider the thought of being squashed by one that falls to the earth. How mindless, how pure to go by sudden and unforeseen death. At least then, I think, this pain would go away. I unfold my speech from my pocket and run through it once more:\r\n          A mother will cry at the funeral of any of her children, good or bad. A father, though, is more likely to share his emotion at the passing of a child he truly respected and loved. My brother would have made my father cry like a baby. In every sense of the word, he was a good man. He loved his wife, adored his children, and ran his business with class. He cared about the poor, calling them those whom Jesus had most compassion for, which I never understood. He also cared about me even when I couldn't have been further from sharing the sentiment. As my older brother, I grew up in his shadow and learned all I could from him. But somewhere along the line I slipped off his path and headed downward really fast. It was my choice, and yet he still lent me his hand time and time again. As a prideful man who just wanted to make it on his own, I hardly accepted him. I have always sort of known that unlike him, I am not a good man. Even still, I have received much from him, and now he's gone. I feel as though in carrying on in this world after his passing I have received his lot. I have received a good man's pay. \r\n","options":[{"id":26879832,"name":"SMALL","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26879835,"name":"MEDIUM","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26879838,"name":"LARGE","price":44.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26879841,"name":"X-LARGE","price":44.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84165534/-/503-SS.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84165534/-/503-SS.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":298791,"name":"MENS","permalink":"mens","url":"/category/mens"},{"id":4219608,"name":"MENS - SWEATSHIRTS","permalink":"mens-sweatshirts","url":"/category/mens-sweatshirts"}]},{"id":8556075,"name":"LIVIN&#x27; ON NOODLES - MEN&#x27;S SWEATSHIRT","permalink":"livin-on-noodles-men-s-sweatshirt","position":132,"price":44.0,"default_price":44.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/livin-on-noodles-men-s-sweatshirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-14T22:37:50.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

Picking up groceries was close to last on the list of things I really wanted to do. I made my turns with careless ease, and browsed through sale items rather half-heartedly. To be honest, I had to reach into my pockets three or four times just to remember what I had come to get. I heard a kid screaming a couple aisles over and it made me laugh inside. I wondered what he wanted but was not getting, probably a cookie, or a balloon. I gazed around and decided simply to get something that would suffice. I really didn’t care what it was so long as it kept me going. What I really wanted to be doing, if I could have ignored the pangs of hunger roaring from below, was dreaming. Maybe that sounds a little funny to you, but its true. \r\nDreams, my friends, are infants armed with potential. With quiet explosions they keep me up at night— No matter the magnitude of my exhaustion. They are ideas, filled with passion and drive. The y invade my thoughts and hold my heart captive. Dreams inspire. Dreams encourage.\r\n\r\nThe screaming kid was still performing on aisle 12, and had I paid to come and listen, I would have already been demanding my refund. I reached for a bag of ten-cent noodles and proceeded to check out. As I walked I thought of what would lie ahead:\r\n\r\nDreams don’t come wrapped in bows and ribbons, you see. Dreams can carry on handbags the size of mountains. The journey is long. The journey is dangerous. And nobody said the risk was easy, or safe. But no adventure is ever safe.\r\n\r\nSo that’s me—just another guy living on dreams and ten-cent noodles.","options":[{"id":26879754,"name":"SMALL","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26879757,"name":"MEDIUM","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26879760,"name":"LARGE","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26879763,"name":"X-LARGE","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84165117/-/419-SS.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84165117/-/419-SS.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":298791,"name":"MENS","permalink":"mens","url":"/category/mens"},{"id":4219608,"name":"MENS - SWEATSHIRTS","permalink":"mens-sweatshirts","url":"/category/mens-sweatshirts"}]},{"id":8555997,"name":"LOS ANGELES, 5TH EDITION - MEN&#x27;S SWEATSHIRT","permalink":"los-angeles-5th-edition-men-s-sweatshirt","position":134,"price":44.0,"default_price":44.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/los-angeles-5th-edition-men-s-sweatshirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-14T22:32:10.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

WASH COLD, TUMBLE DRY LOW. DO NOT BLEACH. DO NOT IRON.\r\n\r\nGLASS HALF FULL\r\n\r\nI remember the day I met Charlie. It was the summer of 1991 in a suburb near Nashville. School had just let out and my family had just moved to town. As we rolled in along the main drag I could see kids flooding the streets everywhere, dipping in and out of cafes, theaters, and toy stores. Boys played catch with tennis balls and girls were in clusters of two's and four's whispering and giggling to each other. I felt my breath begin to quicken as my innards were becoming a nervous orange mixture of excitement and apprehension. Each summer brought a new city. We were lucky to stay put for even ten months with my Dad's line of work. \r\n          A small craftsman with large, white squared pillars and a long front porch was our destination. As my Dad threw our long, beige station wagon into park in our new driveway, the tires teetering back and forth until finally finding a resting place, I hesitated. In the past I'd quickly molded my life around our family's new surroundings. I joined baseball teams, cub scouts, and went to block party barbecues. But it never mattered. Every year the friends I made were swept from beneath me like disposable floor mats, leaving me sore and ever more close to closing myself off completely. The hole in my jeans on the left knee was growing and I stuck my thumb in it. I stared at the inter-woven fabrics for a few seconds, the blues, grays, and whites flooding together, and then I heard a voice. It was a monotoned low whisper, like it was giving directions to a squadron over a radio. \"Hey you, OVER,\" it said. I looked past my left shoulder toward a tall hedge dividing our yard and the neighbor's. It was coming from that direction, but I couldn't make anyone out. My parents were beginning to unload the wagon. I slowly opened my door and emerged, keeping my eyes fixed upon the hedgerow.\r\n          \"Hey you, OVER!\" It came again, this time louder. I then found two beady eyes behind black-rimmed glasses staring at me. The boy was on his hands and knees, trying to keep low and out of sight. I approached slowly. \"It's right there,\" he said. I didn't understand. He pointed through the thick at a small, black walkie-talkie. It was part of a set from Spy Tech, a company that made the best spy gear a kid could ask for. \r\n          \"Get down! What, do you want to get us killed?\" Then the boy jumped up and awkwardly sprinted around the far corner of his house. \"Come in, Eagle, this is Hawk, OVER,\" the walkie-talkie rang. I could hear him huffing and puffing between words. I picked it up slowly and held down the receiver.\r\n          \"I umm…what are we running from exactly?\"\r\n          \"Eagle, get down, they're right behind you!\" I looked back and saw my parents, my Dad smiled as he carried a box, and my mom trying to wave while carrying my sister inside the house. A smile began to emerge across my face and relief seemed to wash over me gently. \r\n          Today, as I look forward to meeting up with Charlie Daniels again for the first time in ages, I can't help but smile in the same way I did that day. He is truly the best friend I've ever had.\r\n","options":[{"id":26878875,"name":"SMALL","price":44.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26878878,"name":"MEDIUM","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26878881,"name":"LARGE","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26878884,"name":"X-LARGE","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84162366/-/511-SS.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84162366/-/511-SS.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":298791,"name":"MENS","permalink":"mens","url":"/category/mens"},{"id":4219608,"name":"MENS - SWEATSHIRTS","permalink":"mens-sweatshirts","url":"/category/mens-sweatshirts"}]},{"id":8555667,"name":"ALPHABET - MEN'S SWEATSHIRT","permalink":"alphabet-men-s-sweatshirt","position":139,"price":44.0,"default_price":44.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/alphabet-men-s-sweatshirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-14T22:06:15.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

Even before words, they are the ultimate marketing mechanism of personal thought. They have been constructed to teach children to read, poetically placed to speak sweet nothings to lovers, fashioned to coax consumers to make purchase, arranged and disarranged to bring entertainment in sport and game, formed to lead masses to rhythmic religious devotion, and crafted to create fervor and action among attendees of spoken speech. They are the ingredients to words and thoughts as water and dough are to bread: not always enough when alone to stand as substantive, but completely necessary in order to make an idea influential. Furthermore, if verbal and written communication are the vehicles by which said influence travels in thought, idea, sentiment, suggestion, exhortation, and lesson, then letters are the nuts and bolts that drive change into being.","options":[{"id":26878386,"name":"DUSTY BLUE SMALL","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26878389,"name":"DUSTY BLUE MEDIUM","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26878392,"name":"DUSTY BLUE LARGE","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26878395,"name":"DUSTY BLUE X-LARGE","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84160719/-/501-SS.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84160719/-/501-SS.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":298791,"name":"MENS","permalink":"mens","url":"/category/mens"},{"id":4219608,"name":"MENS - SWEATSHIRTS","permalink":"mens-sweatshirts","url":"/category/mens-sweatshirts"}]},{"id":8554029,"name":"'MERICA - MEN'S SWEATSHIRT - NATURAL COLOR","permalink":"merica-men-s-sweatshirt","position":140,"price":44.0,"default_price":44.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/merica-men-s-sweatshirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-14T20:10:54.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

It is nestled neatly into leather interior, riding shotgun during early commutes as we treat the noise of world news like a nagging mother-in-law. It is the steps along the corporate ladder, the heavy oak office door and dark red mahogany desk. It is the long-anticipated lunch with the exec's, lobster and wine on the company dime. It drifts drowsily home with us again, passing the hungry and homes made of shopping carts, the litter, the drunken, the helpless, the drug-enslaved, the weeping, the gnashing. It goes perched alongside us under chandelier light, consuming hard-earned sirloins and whiskey neats, reviewing the better parts of the day's events with the Misses. It closes up the blinds and pours another drink and serenly floats away, unconscious upon the arm chair, buried in wall street and warm alcoholic exhalation. \r\n\r\nIt is sweet Liberty ever along for the ride, abused, yet ignored, and so willingly taken for granted. She is the most delectable drink that we could savor, the preciously inherited liquor of the American experience gone tragically guzzled like one glass too many. \r\n\r\nCherish and remember her, you inheritors. Wrap her swimmingly in your arms for your children's sake if not, at least, for God's sake.","options":[{"id":26873106,"name":"NATURAL SMALL","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26873109,"name":"NATURAL MEDIUM","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26873112,"name":"NATURAL LARGE","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26873115,"name":"NATURAL X-LARGE","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26992173,"name":"ANTIQUE WHITE XSMALL","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":38542905,"name":"ANTIQUE WHITE XLARGE","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":38542908,"name":"ANTIQUE WHITE LARGE","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":38542911,"name":"NATURAL XSMALL","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":38542914,"name":"DUSTY BLUE XSMALL","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":38542917,"name":"DUSTY BLUE MEDIUM","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84143205/-/513-SS.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84143205/-/513-SS.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":298791,"name":"MENS","permalink":"mens","url":"/category/mens"},{"id":4219608,"name":"MENS - SWEATSHIRTS","permalink":"mens-sweatshirts","url":"/category/mens-sweatshirts"}]},{"id":8555616,"name":"DREAM IN COLOR: PARADISE - WOMEN'S SWEATSHIRT","permalink":"dream-in-color-paradise-women-s-sweatshirt","position":141,"price":44.0,"default_price":44.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dream-in-color-paradise-women-s-sweatshirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-14T22:02:13.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON. WASH COLD, TUMBLE DRY LOW. DO NOT BLEACH. DO NOT IRON.\r\n\r\nDREAM IN COLOR: PARADISE\r\n\r\n     Jonathan slowed to watch a fleet of birds pass by overhead.  Their outstretched bodies of feathers were a deep, rich crimson that glistened under the sun as they flew in graceful unison.  He dared not make a sound.  Under his bare feet lay a coat of cool moss that he planted his toes into gently.  A Koi pond was to his left that had a strong but smooth water-fall pouring into it, and to his right was a lush orchard of the most vibrantly yellow lemon trees he had ever seen.  \r\n     Incredible, he whispered under his breath.\r\n     Back at the cabin he watched his uncle fast at work before a spread of fixings for dinner.  Candied yams, hand-mashed potatoes, barbecue baked beans, sweet cornbread, slow-cooked ribs.  The smells were intoxicating.  Periodically his uncle would hum a tune to himself that would grow louder at the end of each new line, which always brought a smile to his rich, old face.  Jonathan studied the walls of his uncle's beautiful country cabin and tried to know them.  Soon they would be his.  The walls, the garden, the meadows, the river, the lemon trees; soon he would be handed the keys and responsibilities of caring for everything.  Cows could be seen grazing in the pastures from the kitchen window.  Birds played melodic masterpieces to each other somewhere in the trees above.  Clouds drifted thoughtfully by in the distance.  His uncle peeked over at him.\r\n     \"Paradise, ain't it m'boy?\" He said.  Jonathan turned to his uncle and nodded. \r\n     \"I just can't believe it,\" he said blankly.  \"This place is a dream.\"  His uncle threw back his head and let out a deep laugh that let the meadows know his presence.  \r\n     \"Oh, it's all real, no question about that.  And it's all yours!\"  He washed his hands and began bringing dishes over to the table where Jonathan was.  Steam rose gently into the air and aromatized the dining area.   His uncle slid a plate in front of him and then took a seat across the table.  When he got situated he began to speak in a different tone.  It was calm, earnest, and slightly rhythmic.  His eyes were closed and his hands outstretched.  He spoke about the food, the cabin, the rain, the sunshine, and the land.  He brought them all to the table with him as though to acknowledge everything before he did anything else.  He ended by saying, \"thank you,\" and then opened his eyes and smiled.  \"Dig in!\"  \r\n     Jonathan hesitated.  He had some questions that needed answering first.  \r\n     \"But why me?\"  He motioned all around him. \"I am just a guy, and here I am being handed the most beautiful ranch, your ranch!\"  His uncle nodded and scooped a giant bite of mashed potatoes into his mouth and breathed smoothly through his nostrils.  \r\n     \"You know,\" he started.  \"Some might choose to call a place like this 'home' and some might not.  Some might even call it 'Hell'!\" He roared with laughter, his belly bouncing and eyes forming small tears.  \"But I prefer to call it something sweeter.  I call it, 'Paradise,' 'cuz I can't think of a better place to be in the whole wide world.\"  Jonathan felt the weight of his new responsibility even more as he watched the emotion exude from his uncle's body.  \r\n     The old man's face now became more serious.  \"We always get a choice in life,\" he said, stopping to swallow.  Jonathan listened carefully.  \"As you know, it was my choice to leave this place to you.  It's a land that reflects my craft, my determination, and my hard-work, and when I decided it was time for me to move on and focus on something new, I needed to leave it with someone I knew, and I preferred to give it to someone I loved.  You're my blood, after all.\"\r\n     \"But what if I fail?  What if I can't tend it like you did?\"\r\n     His uncle waved his hands wildly in the air.  \"Nonsense,\" he said.  \"I've written everything out for you.\"  He pointed at the desk in the den that held a neat stack of papers.  \"But always remember that it's not a matter of ability but of choice.  While you are here, you can tend it and give it what it needs, or you can set your sights on something outside of this.  It's yours to enjoy so long as you follow the instructions that I've given you.\"\r\n     Jonathan did not speak for a while.  His uncle was right, his fear did not indicate his inability, after all, he had been tending ranches as a hired-hand from the time he was able to tie his own shoes.  It was the willingness to receive such wealth without compensating for it that he lacked.  He was never taught to receive anything without giving in return, and something about it seemed to deflate his sense of self-worth.  His stomach grew hot with anguish, and in that moment he could almost hear his heart pleading with his head.  He absolutely desired the ranch, but his mind could not help but trip on the bricks of blessing that now stood in front of his own hand-built empire.  \r\n     His uncle wiped his face and sat back in his chair.  His excitement seemed to settle down now for the first time all evening.  He peered out at the pastures and peacefully studied them.  The evening sun illuminated the land with powerful beams of orange, red, and yellow.  Jonathan was still. \r\n     \"Something to remember,\" his uncle broke through the silence.  He looked at his nephew, who was still watching the way the sun was coming to a close.  \"Paradise is a place for us all, son.  Must of us just don't know it yet.\"","options":[{"id":26878245,"name":"X-SMALL","price":44.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26878248,"name":"SMALL","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26878251,"name":"MEDIUM","price":44.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26878254,"name":"LARGE","price":44.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84160233/-/446-WSS.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84160233/-/446-WSS.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2152214,"name":"WOMENS","permalink":"womens","url":"/category/womens"},{"id":4219764,"name":"WOMENS - SWEATSHIRTS","permalink":"womens-sweatshirts","url":"/category/womens-sweatshirts"}]},{"id":8555313,"name":"LOS ANGELES, 5TH EDITION - WOMEN'S SWEATSHIRT","permalink":"los-angeles-5th-edition-women-s-sweatshirt","position":143,"price":44.0,"default_price":44.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/los-angeles-5th-edition-women-s-sweatshirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-14T21:46:45.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

And after all, of course we believe this. How could we not?  Now, regarding our new community pool.  There will be no rules.  It too will be a gratuitous pond of infinite beliefs and ideas. None are denied and all are welcomed. The way I see it, the hours of operation will operate when we like, and we can all sing the same, beautiful songs in unison, whenever we like. It will be like paradise!\r\n     Sir, maybe this is just in my head, but if I may interrupt...\r\n     Yes?\r\n     Well, this ideal of your…uhh ours, which is incomparable to anything of course…\r\n     Of course.\r\n     Well, it actually shows that we believe something.  \r\n     Well, sure we do.  We believe in everything!\r\n     At times I have to wonder if it is not very charitable to do so, as you seem to think it is. \r\n     How do you mean?\r\n     You are implying that a place that is all-accepting, and nothing less, can and ought to exist.  And sure, you'll say, well what is so uncharitable about that?  Let me explain. What, if you will, of those people who think, defiantly of course, that not all should be accepted, and that complete harmony is impractical? Should we deny them access to the pool too?  What if they tell others in the water of their beliefs…err opinions?  What if they start raising hell?  \r\n     Well, we certainly don't want that.  \r\n     But I thought we believed anything was permissible?  \r\n     Perhaps just this one thing, this one small act of defiance will not be tolerated: any who disagrees with complete acceptance of everything should go swim somewhere else.

WASH COLD, TUMBLE DRY LOW. DO NOT BLEACH. DO NOT IRON.\r\n\r\nFLY AWAY\r\n\r\n     The old oak door clicked shut behind her.  The paint-chipped deck creaked below her feet as she stepped out upon the porch.  The sun had long since set and she stared out at the black sky.  Remaining with age was the moon, bright and full, among an array of glittering stars.  On the street a dark sedan appeared and passed and Sarah watched the glow of its tail lights.  It was Mr. Wallace out to pick up his daughter from the train station, an act he made regular since she took a job in the city for extra money after his wife passed.  A yearning ached inside Sarah as the sedan turned the corner at Mayberry Street and rolled out of sight.   She hesitated.  The mystery of the night, the open road, and freedom forged a warm impress upon her heart that stirred up a flurry of fear and excitement within her chest.   She tugged the straps of her neatly packed backpack on her shoulders and felt its weight.  It gave her confidence to know she could still turn around but knew this would be the last opportunity to escape from the force of her father for a long time.  She drew in a deep breath, hoping it would put her fear to rest, and then let it billow outward like smoke from her lungs.  Then, she started across the lawn.  As she watched her tightly tied shoes bend dozens of individual blades of grass she recalled a strange memory.  She remembered a television series about birds, about how, at the right time, mother birds nudge their young from their nests and allow them to free-fall into the open air below.  The mother expected its chicks to instinctively know how to spread their new wings if they would survive.  As a child she watched with an estranged curiosity and wondered about the role of a mother.  The swoosh of her shoes within the grass below ceased as she reached the sidewalk in front of the house.  She turned and peered up at it for a moment and briefly watched her childhood, her bondage, roll through her mind as it had been for as long as she could determine between right and wrong.  Risk is inevitable if we ever expect to live, she whispered to herself, taking courage in the words of a radio preacher she had begun listening to in secret.  She clenched her backpack straps again and turned toward the direction of the moon, leaving a cold, relentless darkness at her back.","options":[{"id":26876877,"name":"X-SMALL","price":44.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26876880,"name":"SMALL","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26876883,"name":"MEDIUM","price":44.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26876886,"name":"LARGE","price":44.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84156321/-/447-WSS.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84156321/-/447-WSS.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2152214,"name":"WOMENS","permalink":"womens","url":"/category/womens"},{"id":4219764,"name":"WOMENS - SWEATSHIRTS","permalink":"womens-sweatshirts","url":"/category/womens-sweatshirts"}]},{"id":8555130,"name":"THIS T-SHIRT EXPLOITS FASHION - WOMEN'S SWEATSHIRT","permalink":"this-t-shirt-exploits-fashion-women-s-sweatshirt","position":149,"price":44.0,"default_price":44.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/this-t-shirt-exploits-fashion-women-s-sweatshirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-14T21:30:53.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

They are the ingredients to words and thoughts as water and dough are to bread: not always enough when alone to stand as substantive, but completely necessary in order to make an idea influential. Furthermore, if verbal and written communication are the vehicles by which said influence travels in thought, idea, sentiment, suggestion, exhortation, and lesson, then letters are the nuts and bolts that drive change into being.","options":[{"id":26875059,"name":"ANTIQUE  WHITE X-SMALL","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26875062,"name":"ANTIQUE  WHITE SMALL","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26875065,"name":"ANTIQUE  WHITE MEDIUM","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26875068,"name":"ANTIQUE  WHITE LARGE","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84148341/-/501-WSS.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84148341/-/501-WSS.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2152214,"name":"WOMENS","permalink":"womens","url":"/category/womens"},{"id":4219764,"name":"WOMENS - SWEATSHIRTS","permalink":"womens-sweatshirts","url":"/category/womens-sweatshirts"}]},{"id":7593683,"name":"EVEN GOOD MEN - MEN&#x27;S TANK","permalink":"even-good-men-men-s-tank","position":160,"price":32.0,"default_price":32.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/even-good-men-men-s-tank","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-19T01:12:12.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

The cold air no longer abrades my lungs like sandpaper, and the snow I once trudged through has become like grass to the bare foot. I am used to the winter now, and I am used to being alone too. I am honest with myself and I don’t pretend to know my surroundings like distant relatives anymore. I am true to my past in all of its hideousness. I have known the life of a con artist in my marriages, stealing from the sweet fidelity of patient women. I am not a good man, but I have received a good man’s pay: I have received graciousness like sunlight, daily meriting favorable rays disproportionate to my past. \r\n\r\nI have brother who is completely unlike me. My brother is a good man, you see. He is successful at his trade, and in his marriage he is content. He does not walk cold streets nor trudge through snow, for his home has been made with honesty and virtue. He gives of himself relentlessly, and without partiality. He is an icon to be imitated, a father to learn from, and a friend to rely upon. \r\n\r\nBut were you to ask him of his grace and benevolence he might answer first with his eyes. For, of him, they speak loudest. They might show that he actually believes he is the bad man. He does not rest in grace-received as I do. The bad man always needs grace, and he receives it eventually. The good man, who always gives grace, tends to disqualify himself from receiving it back. He falls apart, internally, and believes in secret that he is unworthy. Grace is, for the good man, a paradoxical pitfall. \r\n\r\nBut if grace was such a misery it would not be grace at all, for even the good man needs grace.","options":[{"id":23979787,"name":"SMALL","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23979789,"name":"MEDIUM","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23979791,"name":"LARGE","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23979793,"name":"X-LARGE","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74537473/-/GOOD_MEN-MTANK.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74537473/-/GOOD_MEN-MTANK.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":298791,"name":"MENS","permalink":"mens","url":"/category/mens"},{"id":2584885,"name":"MENS - TANKS","permalink":"mens-tanks","url":"/category/mens-tanks"}]},{"id":7583681,"name":"LIVIN&#x27; ON COFFEE - MEN&#x27;S CREW","permalink":"living-on-coffee-men-s-crew","position":161,"price":32.0,"default_price":32.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/living-on-coffee-men-s-crew","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-18T03:37:05.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

WASH COLD, TUMBLE DRY LOW. DO NOT BLEACH. DO NOT IRON.\r\n\r\nMEEK & HUMBLE\r\n\r\n     In many ways I do not know Mal's real story.  I know he was born in Texas and came to California to look for work, only to end up homeless on the streets of downtown Los Angeles.  But that is about it.  He and I are good acquaintances though, who happen to inhabit the same location for a block of time each day.  In the evenings, and for a good part of the day, Mal basically lives on the driveway of the warehouse where I work.  His shopping cart has its own parking space, and his home is made of cardboard and plywood set up to block the wind and rain.  We interact here and there, but never very deeply.  Usually I have work to do and he is busy sorting out the day's findings in his shopping cart.  More than anything else, we are like neighbors, moving here and there throughout the day and interacting when we cross paths.  For example, in the mornings he is the first to greet me.  I ride up on my bike and pull my keys from my pocket to open the warehouse door.  He is usually awake by then, laid out on his back with his feet crossed at the foot of his cardboard and blanket bed.  He'll flash a smile, showing his few good teeth as bright as can be, and offer me one of his many morning thoughts.  Sometimes he talks about about how cold it was the night before, or about how ready for a pile of pancakes he is.  Other times he speaks of a song he woke up singing: Are we in loooooove, or are we just friends? Or, its been a looooong, a long time coming, but I know: change gon' come.  Its hard not to imagine some of his songs being his ancestor's hopeful melodies of God and freedom in the midst of slavery and unjust prejudice.\r\n     Mal may be homeless but despite the naive notions that this conjures, he is one of the most joyful people I know.  He is unhampered by what most middle-to-upper class people would deem a life characterized by tragedy and sheer destitution.  Sometimes he shares stories of how he has known the ugly faces of violence, drug addiction, and alcoholism, and even today he still knows the people that such dependance wrings and dominates right outside of our warehouse walls.  Still, he always has a song to sing that could bring a riot to its knees in surrender.  But more than anything else, Mal is a generous man, and his meekness shows through daily.  Never does he indicate a sense that his needs are higher than the next man's, and never does he acknowledge the belief that monetary status is a deal-breaker in relating with others--he'll say hello to bankers, bus-drivers, and homeless folk alike.  Mal understands his role to play in this life, and it is to offer an honest smile, or a song, or maybe even a treasure from his shopping cart.  Mal does more to break barriers of social unrest, more to halt avalanches of racial tension, and more to love his neighbor than any professor, protestor, or preacher I know.  And the best part is that he has no idea that he is doing any of these.  Mal simply lives his role in this world. \r\n     Some pray for the coming age of Heaven in the hope to see evil eradicated and goodness flowing abundantly.  They believe in earnest that God will listen and usher in his kingdom soon, and bless their little hearts for doing so.  But if more of us believed in a kingdom like Mal's where Heaven is already a place in effect, where goodness already has the opportunity to prevail and meekness the chance to inherit the earth, then the desire to see harmony, justice, and majesty that is so deeply imbedded within and bursting to get out may appear yet.  It is completion that is imminent, not Heaven; love that is awaiting full expression, not just prayer. \r\n","options":[{"id":23977837,"name":"SMALL","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23977839,"name":"MEDIUM","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23977841,"name":"LARGE","price":19.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23977843,"name":"X-LARGE","price":19.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74530255/-/LNT_Meek.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74530255/-/LNT_Meek.jpg","width":1000,"height":874}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":298791,"name":"MENS","permalink":"mens","url":"/category/mens"},{"id":2584883,"name":"MENS - CREWS","permalink":"mens-crews","url":"/category/mens-crews"}]},{"id":7583969,"name":"IN MY HEAD - MEN&#x27;S CREW","permalink":"in-my-head-men-s-crew","position":165,"price":32.0,"default_price":32.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/in-my-head-men-s-crew","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-18T04:04:14.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

And after all, of course we believe this. How could we not?  Now, regarding our new community pool.  There will be no rules.  It too will be a gratuitous pond of infinite beliefs and ideas. None are denied and all are welcomed. The way I see it, the hours of operation will operate when we like, and we can all sing the same, beautiful songs in unison, whenever we like. It will be like paradise!\r\n     Sir, maybe this is just in my head, but if I may interrupt...\r\n     Yes?\r\n     Well, this ideal of your…uhh ours, which is incomparable to anything of course…\r\n     Of course.\r\n     Well, it actually shows that we believe something.  \r\n     Well, sure we do.  We believe in everything!\r\n     At times I have to wonder if it is not very charitable to do so, as you seem to think it is. \r\n     How do you mean?\r\n     You are implying that a place that is all-accepting, and nothing less, can and ought to exist.  And sure, you'll say, well what is so uncharitable about that?  Let me explain. What, if you will, of those people who think, defiantly of course, that not all should be accepted, and that complete harmony is impractical? Should we deny them access to the pool too?  What if they tell others in the water of their beliefs…err opinions?  What if they start raising hell?  \r\n     Well, we certainly don't want that.  \r\n     But I thought we believed anything was permissible?  \r\n     Perhaps just this one thing, this one small act of defiance will not be tolerated: any who disagrees with complete acceptance of everything should go swim somewhere else.  I know it sounds mean, so lets keep quiet about it; lets not let anyone know that, as it turns out, we don't want certain ideals in our pool.","options":[{"id":23954277,"name":"SMALL","price":32.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23954279,"name":"MEDIUM","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23954281,"name":"LARGE","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23954283,"name":"X-LARGE","price":32.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28511582,"name":"X-SMALL","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84518841/-/449-CREW.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84518841/-/449-CREW.jpg","width":666,"height":850},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74442377/-/In_My_Head-CREW.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74442377/-/In_My_Head-CREW.jpg","width":1000,"height":874}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":298791,"name":"MENS","permalink":"mens","url":"/category/mens"},{"id":2584883,"name":"MENS - CREWS","permalink":"mens-crews","url":"/category/mens-crews"}]},{"id":4879701,"name":"HOME - MEN&#x27;S CREW","permalink":"home-mens-crew","position":166,"price":32.0,"default_price":32.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/home-mens-crew","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-19T00:37:00.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

So I slid my jacket from my chair and into my arm, and just stood. Then, I took a deep breath and made toward you. It was then that your gaze fell from mine to the dirty floor as you stepped backward, remember?”\r\n“A drunk was wildly approaching me; yes, of course I stepped backward.”\r\n“Halfway to you, though, my left foot found the corner of a table leg and my face came to meet the floor in a blurred frenzy of surprise and humiliation.”\r\n“Oh honey, you looked a fool, but I loved it.

The paint-chipped deck creaked below her feet as she stepped out upon the porch.  The sun had long since set and she stared out at the black sky.  Remaining with age was the moon, bright and full, among an array of glittering stars.  On the street a dark sedan appeared and passed and Sarah watched the glow of its tail lights.  It was Mr. Wallace out to pick up his daughter from the train station, an act he made regular since she took a job in the city for extra money after his wife passed.  A yearning ached inside Sarah as the sedan turned the corner at Mayberry Street and rolled out of sight.   She hesitated.  The mystery of the night, the open road, and freedom forged a warm impress upon her heart that stirred up a flurry of fear and excitement within her chest.   She tugged the straps of her neatly packed backpack on her shoulders and felt its weight.  It gave her confidence to know she could still turn around but knew this would be the last opportunity to escape from the force of her father for a long time.  She drew in a deep breath, hoping it would put her fear to rest, and then let it billow outward like smoke from her lungs.  Then, she started across the lawn.  As she watched her tightly tied shoes bend dozens of individual blades of grass she recalled a strange memory.  She remembered a television series about birds, about how, at the right time, mother birds nudge their young from their nests and allow them to free-fall into the open air below.  The mother expected its chicks to instinctively know how to spread their new wings if they would survive.  As a child she watched with an estranged curiosity and wondered about the role of a mother.  The swoosh of her shoes within the grass below ceased as she reached the sidewalk in front of the house.  She turned and peered up at it for a moment and briefly watched her childhood, her bondage, roll through her mind as it had been for as long as she could determine between right and wrong.  Risk is inevitable if we ever expect to live, she whispered to herself, taking courage in the words of a radio preacher she had begun listening to in secret.  She clenched her backpack straps again and turned toward the direction of the moon, leaving a cold, relentless darkness at her back.","options":[{"id":23953843,"name":"SMALL","price":32.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23953845,"name":"MEDIUM","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23953847,"name":"LARGE","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23953849,"name":"X-LARGE","price":32.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74440849/-/Fly_Away-CREW.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74440849/-/Fly_Away-CREW.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":298791,"name":"MENS","permalink":"mens","url":"/category/mens"},{"id":2584883,"name":"MENS - CREWS","permalink":"mens-crews","url":"/category/mens-crews"}]},{"id":4914945,"name":"COLD SHOULDERS - MEN&#x27;S CREW","permalink":"cold-shoulders-mens-crew","position":168,"price":32.0,"default_price":32.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cold-shoulders-mens-crew","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-23T12:13:34.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

A young man emerged and threw his door shut thoughtlessly.  The old brass bell above the door sounded as the young man pushed into the rustic fishing shop.  His eyes quickly danced along each wall and studied their few and modest contents.  The old man knew his kind, but he called out to him anyway.\r\n     \"Afternoon there, sir.\"  The young man swung his head toward the old man.\r\n     \"Gill nets,\" he said plainly.  The old man looked him over.  He was wearing a blue cotton sweatshirt, jeans of the same color, a ball cap, and tall rubber boots that were still wet.  The old man shrugged, playing dumb.  \r\n     \"No gill nets?\"\r\n     \"Sorry, son.  Not in this shop.\"  The young man sarcastically cocked his head to the side and stepped closer.\r\n     \"You run a fishing shop.\"\r\n     \"That's right.\"\r\n     \"On the coast of the Pacific northwest.\"\r\n     \"Yep.\"\r\n     \"And you don't sell any gill nets.  And I bet you don't have trawls or seine's neither?\"\r\n     \"I have seine's, just not the kind you're looking for.  I just sell to us old guys, you see,\" he chuckled.\r\n     \"No, I still don't see,\" the young man said, throwing his arms up in defeat and making for the door.  The old man smirked and called after him.\r\n     \"Hold on there.\"  The young man stopped and looked back at him annoyed.  The old man went on.\r\n     \"You know, I'll probably be dead before someone gets around to expanding this shop into something that'll make me an extra buck, and that's alright.\"  As he spoke he placed his weathered hands upon the countertop and gazed down at the floor.  The young man noticed two great scars on the old man's forearms.  \"And you may not have the time for the kind of fishing that I enjoy, and that's alright too.\"  The young man looked at him and then peered around the shop again.  This time he found antique fishing rods, trophies, and old fishing photographs upon the walls.  He spotted a picture of a stout young man holding a four-foot King Salmon.  He walked over to it.\r\n     \"Is that you?\"  The old man nodded.  \"That has to be a sixty pound King Salmon.\"\r\n     \"Sixty-two, actually.\"  The young man thought about the persistence it had to take to wait for and pull in a fish of that size.  He looked at the old man again, now with a curious kind of respect.\r\n     \"Brick by brick,\" the old man said.\r\n     \"Sorry?\"\r\n     \"Patience proves how great a man believes in something.  The greater its value, the more worth your time it is.\"  The young man listened closer now.  The old man leaned back against the wall and stared out the window.  \"Not many buildings get built overnight,\" he smiled and folded his arms.  \"Every building gets put together one brick at a time.\"  The young man nodded in understanding and let a couple moments of silence pass through the room.  \r\n     \"Thank you,\" the young man said finally as he extended his hand.  The old man shook it gladly, and then watched him tip his hat and exit.","options":[{"id":23977655,"name":"WASHED NAVY SMALL","price":32.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23977657,"name":"WASHED NAVY MEDIUM","price":32.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23977659,"name":"WASHED NAVY LARGE","price":32.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23977661,"name":"WASHED NAVY X-LARGE","price":32.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28942496,"name":"VINTAGE BLACK SMALL","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28942499,"name":"VINTAGE BLACK LARGE","price":32.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74529801/-/Brick_by_Brick-CREW.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74529801/-/Brick_by_Brick-CREW.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":298791,"name":"MENS","permalink":"mens","url":"/category/mens"},{"id":2584883,"name":"MENS -

WASH COLD, TUMBLE DRY LOW. DO NOT BLEACH. DO NOT IRON.\r\n\r\nMy head is down and my hands are in my pockets. Picking up groceries was close to last on the list of things I really wanted to do. I made my turns with careless ease, and browsed through sale items rather half-heartedly. To be honest, I had to reach into my pockets three or four times just to remember what I had come to get. I heard a kid screaming a couple aisles over and it made me laugh inside. I wondered what he wanted but was not getting, probably a cookie, or a balloon. I gazed around and decided simply to get something that would suffice. I really didn’t care what it was so long as it kept me going. What I really wanted to be doing, if I could have ignored the pangs of hunger roaring from below, was dreaming. Maybe that sounds a little funny to you, but its true. \r\nDreams, my friends, are infants armed with potential. With quiet explosions they keep me up at night— No matter the magnitude of my exhaustion. They are ideas, filled with passion and drive. The y invade my thoughts and hold my heart captive. Dreams inspire. Dreams encourage.\r\n\r\nThe screaming kid was still performing on aisle 12, and had I paid to come and listen, I would have already been demanding my refund. I reached for a bag of ten-cent noodles and proceeded to check out. As I walked I thought of what would lie ahead:\r\n\r\nDreams don’t come wrapped in bows and ribbons, you see. Dreams can carry on handbags the size of mountains. The journey is long. The journey is dangerous. And nobody said the risk was easy, or safe. But no adventure is ever safe.\r\n\r\nSo that’s me—just another guy living on dreams and ten-cent noodles.","options":[{"id":15991079,"name":"SMALL","price":32.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15991081,"name":"MEDIUM","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15991083,"name":"LARGE","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15991085,"name":"X-LARGE","price":32.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84891105/-/419-TANK.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84891105/-/419-TANK.jpg","width":666,"height":850},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/48239033/-/Noodle_Men_Tank.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/48239033/-/Noodle_Men_Tank.jpg","width":518,"height":647}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":298791,"name":"MENS","permalink":"mens","url":"/category/mens"},{"id":2584885,"name":"MENS - TANKS","permalink":"mens-tanks","url":"/category/mens-tanks"}]},{"id":4915063,"name":"TYPEWRITER KILLS FASCISTS - MEN&#x27;S TANK","permalink":"typewriter-kills-fascists-mens-tank","position":225,"price":19.0,"default_price":19.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/typewriter-kills-fascists-mens-tank","status":"sold-out","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-11-23T12:30:51.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

Picking up groceries was close to last on the list of things I really wanted to do. I made my turns with careless ease, and browsed through sale items rather half-heartedly. To be honest, I had to reach into my pockets three or four times just to remember what I had come to get. I heard a kid screaming a couple aisles over and it made me laugh inside. I wondered what he wanted but was not getting, probably a cookie, or a balloon. I gazed around and decided simply to get something that would suffice. I really didn’t care what it was so long as it kept me going. What I really wanted to be doing, if I could have ignored the pangs of hunger roaring from below, was dreaming. Maybe that sounds a little funny to you, but its true. \r\nDreams, my friends, are infants armed with potential. With quiet explosions they keep me up at night— No matter the magnitude of my exhaustion. They are ideas, filled with passion and drive. The y invade my thoughts and hold my heart captive. Dreams inspire. Dreams encourage.\r\n\r\nThe screaming kid was still performing on aisle 12, and had I paid to come and listen, I would have already been demanding my refund. I reached for a bag of ten-cent noodles and proceeded to check out. As I walked I thought of what would lie ahead:\r\n\r\nDreams don’t come wrapped in bows and ribbons, you see. Dreams can carry on handbags the size of mountains. The journey is long. The journey is dangerous. And nobody said the risk was easy, or safe. But no adventure is ever safe.\r\n\r\nSo that’s me—just another guy living on dreams and ten-cent noodles.","options":[{"id":15991073,"name":"X-SMALL","price":34.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15991067,"name":"SMALL","price":34.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15991069,"name":"MEDIUM","price":34.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15991071,"name":"LARGE","price":34.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/48238999/-/Noodles_Women_Tank.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/48238999/-/Noodles_Women_Tank.jpg","width":518,"height":647}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2152214,"name":"WOMENS","permalink":"womens","url":"/category/womens"},{"id":2068796,"name":"WOMENS - TANKS","permalink":"womens-tanks","url":"/category/womens-tanks"}]},{"id":4915173,"name":"PEOPLE TURN AROUND - WOMEN&#x27;S TANK ","permalink":"people-turn-around-womens-tank","position":236,"price":19.0,"default_price":19.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/people-turn-around-womens-tank","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-11-23T12:46:31.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

Fire lurched toward the sky, triumphantly exploding in dazzling display of color and wonder. Men cheered and shivering women wore warm smiles as history was made in an innocent instant. Into the frozen evening smoke lingered, leaving behind foreshadows of Lady Liberty's cloudy destination.\r\n\r\nCenturies later a man named Adams, seeing both the weight and fortune of that Lady's standing liberty, interpreted with triumph that she had enabled America to grow up as it saw fit. \"It's men and women,\" he said, \"are free to be unhampered by the barriers of their forefathers and unrepressed by their ancient class-driven social order.\" America had become the land of the freedom to dream, and home of the bravery to infinitely attain.\r\n\r\nBut, just as every rule bears an inevitable exception, so too is every act of grace spread wide open for abuse. Gracefully given, our Lady's liberty is the preciously inherited liquor of the American experience. When cherished it is sweet, full, and rich, but when guzzled like one glass too many it coaxes even the most respectable of men into stealing their way into gain. Instead of reflection and gratitude, they slosh along slippery trails toward sex, money, and power while their wives, children, and homes slide like pebbles into canyons of bitter regret. Today, the “American Dream” has become a simple excuse to ignore what matters most.

Across my back and upon my face, mine once lived as bitter childhood reminders. They epitomized my adversity, especially the one below my right eye. It is two inches vertical and a quarter of an inch wide. To this day I am still unable to grow facial hair there, and it remains a gaping conversation piece. But while scars will always remain, their significance has the ability to change. I have come to realize that people are a lot like scars.\r\n\r\nToday, I manage a business just like my father did. The only difference is that I am an educated man, and I am successful. Many have said that if it were not for my upbringings I may never have understood the significance of pain, and furthermore would not have succeeded. “Pain,” they say, “is a paradox, for while it hurts, in the end it makes us better able to understand life.” Scars can stand as symbols of misery, but they can also become emblems of new perspective. People, like scars, can stand for something different; they can stand for something greater.\r\n\r\nAnd so I realize that many have acted to impoverish in naivety, while others have swung with full intent: from the callowness of children to men frothing with malignity. But does not the same wash of darkened sky fall eventually upon every man? Does not the rain inevitably dampen, and does not trust so painfully break in us all? If, then, it is true that poverty is a plague that resides in humanity--if pain is a product of fractured relationship--then bullies are brothers with scars in desperate need of alleviation. Bullies can never win for, like us, bullies are simply broken men.","options":[{"id":15897211,"name":"SMALL","price":19.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15897213,"name":"MEDIUM","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15897215,"name":"LARGE","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15897217,"name":"X-LARGE","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47886633/-/Bullies_Men_Tank.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47886633/-/Bullies_Men_Tank.jpg","width":518,"height":647}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":298791,"name":"MENS","permalink":"mens","url":"/category/mens"},{"id":2584885,"name":"MENS - TANKS","permalink":"mens-tanks","url":"/category/mens-tanks"}]},{"id":4879889,"name":"AMERICAN DREAM - MEN'S TANK","permalink":"american-dream-mens-tank","position":258,"price":19.0,"default_price":19.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/american-dream-mens-tank","status":"sold-out","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-11-19T01:00:09.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES. 100% COTTON.

Into the frozen evening smoke lingered, leaving behind foreshadows of Lady Liberty's cloudy destination.\r\n\r\nCenturies later a man named Adams, seeing both the weight and fortune of that Lady's standing liberty, interpreted with triumph that she had enabled America to grow up as it saw fit. \"It's men and women,\" he said, \"are free to be unhampered by the barriers of their forefathers and unrepressed by their ancient class-driven social order.\" America had become the land of the freedom to dream, and home of the bravery to infinitely attain.\r\n\r\nBut, just as every rule bears an inevitable exception, so too is every act of grace spread wide open for abuse. Gracefully given, our Lady's liberty is the preciously inherited liquor of the American experience. When cherished it is sweet, full, and rich, but when guzzled like one glass too many it coaxes even the most respectable of men into stealing their way into gain. Instead of reflection and gratitude, they slosh along slippery trails toward sex, money, and power while their wives, children, and homes slide like pebbles into canyons of bitter regret.

Into the frozen evening smoke lingered, leaving behind foreshadows of Lady Liberty's cloudy destination.\r\n\r\nCenturies later a man named Adams, seeing both the weight and fortune of that Lady's standing liberty, interpreted with triumph that she had enabled America to grow up as it saw fit. \"It's men and women,\" he said, \"are free to be unhampered by the barriers of their forefathers and unrepressed by their ancient class-driven social order.\" America had become the land of the freedom to dream, and home of the bravery to infinitely attain.\r\n\r\nBut, just as every rule bears an inevitable exception, so too is every act of grace spread wide open for abuse. Gracefully given, our Lady's liberty is the preciously inherited liquor of the American experience. When cherished it is sweet, full, and rich, but when guzzled like one glass too many it coaxes even the most respectable of men into stealing their way into gain. Instead of reflection and gratitude, they slosh along slippery trails toward sex, money, and power while their wives, children, and homes slide like pebbles into canyons of bitter regret. Today, the “American Dream” has become a simple excuse to ignore what matters most. It has become an opportunity to cut the throats of the weaker so that a cold bank account can die alongside the stronger with just one more dollar.","options":[{"id":15580585,"name":"SMALL","price":19.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15580587,"name":"MEDIUM","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15580589,"name":"LARGE","price":19.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15580591,"name":"X-LARGE","price":19.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46735553/-/American_Crew.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46735553/-/American_Crew.jpg","width":518,"height":647}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":298791,"name":"MENS","permalink":"mens","url":"/category/mens"},{"id":2584883,"name":"MENS - CREWS","permalink":"mens-crews","url":"/category/mens-crews"}]},{"id":387643,"name":"CAMERA KILLS FASCISTS - MENS CREW","permalink":"camera-kills-fascists","position":262,"price":19.0,"default_price":19.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/camera-kills-fascists","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-09-04T01:48:11.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES.  100% COTTON.

WASH COLD, TUMBLE DRY LOW. DO NOT BLEACH. DO NOT IRON.\r\n\r\nMy head is down and my hands are in my pockets. Picking up groceries was close to last on the list of things I really wanted to do. I made my turns with careless ease, and browsed through sale items rather half-heartedly. To be honest, I had to reach into my pockets three or four times just to remember what I had come to get. I heard a kid screaming a couple aisles over and it made me laugh inside. I wondered what he wanted but was not getting, probably a cookie, or a balloon. I gazed around and decided simply to get something that would suffice. I really didn’t care what it was so long as it kept me going. What I really wanted to be doing, if I could have ignored the pangs of hunger roaring from below, was dreaming. Maybe that sounds a little funny to you, but its true. \r\nDreams, my friends, are infants armed with potential. With quiet explosions they keep me up at night— No matter the magnitude of my exhaustion. They are ideas, filled with passion and drive. The y invade my thoughts and hold my heart captive. Dreams inspire. Dreams encourage.\r\n\r\nThe screaming kid was still performing on aisle 12, and had I paid to come and listen, I would have already been demanding my refund. I reached for a bag of ten-cent noodles and proceeded to check out. As I walked I thought of what would lie ahead:\r\n\r\nDreams don’t come wrapped in bows and ribbons, you see. Dreams can carry on handbags the size of mountains. The journey is long. The journey is dangerous. And nobody said the risk was easy, or safe. But no adventure is ever safe.\r\n\r\nSo that’s me—just another guy living on dreams and ten-cent noodles.","options":[{"id":28513877,"name":"ANTIQUE WHITE X-SMALL","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12320100,"name":"ANTIQUE WHITE SMALL","price":32.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12320102,"name":"ANTIQUE WHITE MEDIUM","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12320104,"name":"ANTIQUE WHITE LARGE","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12320106,"name":"ANTIQUE WHITE X-LARGE","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84519657/-/419-CREW.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84519657/-/419-CREW.jpg","width":666,"height":850},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35758986/-/MS_06.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35758986/-/MS_06.jpg","width":517,"height":647}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":298791,"name":"MENS","permalink":"mens","url":"/category/mens"},{"id":2584883,"name":"MENS - CREWS","permalink":"mens-crews","url":"/category/mens-crews"}]},{"id":3643126,"name":"EVEN GOOD MEN - MEN&#x27;S CREW","permalink":"even-good-men","position":268,"price":32.0,"default_price":32.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/even-good-men","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-04-23T08:01:07.000Z","description":"WE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD WITH THE STORIES WE TELL.\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES.  100% COTTON. WASH COLD, TUMBLE DRY LOW. DO NOT BLEACH. DO NOT IRON.\r\n\r\n\tI walk the streets alone each night.  The cold air no longer abrades my lungs like sandpaper, and the snow I once trudged through has become like grass to the bare foot.  I am used to the winter now, and I am used to being alone too.  I am honest with myself and I don’t pretend to know my surroundings like distant relatives anymore.  I am true to my past in all of its hideousness.  I have known the life of a con artist in my marriages, stealing from the sweet fidelity of patient women.  I am not a good man, but I have received a good man’s pay: I have received graciousness like sunlight, daily meriting favorable rays disproportionate to my past.\r\n\tI have brother who is completely unlike me.  My brother is a good man, you see.  He is successful at his trade, and in his marriage he is content.  He does not walk cold streets nor trudge through snow, for his home has been made with honesty and virtue.  He gives of himself relentlessly, and without partiality.  He is an icon to be imitated, a father to learn from, and a friend to rely upon. \r\n\tBut were you to ask him of his grace and benevolence he might answer first with his eyes.  For, of him, they speak loudest.  They might show that he actually believes he is the bad man.  He does not rest in grace-received as I do.  The bad man always needs grace, and he receives it eventually.  The good man, who always gives grace, tends to disqualify himself from receiving it back.  He falls apart, internally, and believes in secret that he is unworthy.  Grace is, for the good man, a paradoxical pitfall.\r\n\tBut if grace was such a misery it would not be grace at all, for even the good man needs grace. \r\n\t\r\n","options":[{"id":12170528,"name":"SMALL","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12170530,"name":"MEDIUM","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12170532,"name":"LARGE","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12170534,"name":"X-LARGE","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74441425/-/Good_Men-CREW.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74441425/-/Good_Men-CREW.jpg","width":666,"height":850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":298791,"name":"MENS","permalink":"mens","url":"/category/mens"},{"id":2584883,"name":"MENS -
