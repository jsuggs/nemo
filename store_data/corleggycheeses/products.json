It is edible and very flavoursome. Some experts regard it as the best bit of the cheese.\r\nHard cheese made from goat’s milk is a rare find. This one is particularly special because the production process is very small. Corleggy is perfect as the centrepiece of a cheese board, but we also recommend you try it with fruit such as fresh figs or sweet plums.","options":[{"id":10457021,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53436649/-/DSC_0057-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53436649/-/DSC_0057-1.jpg","width":367,"height":308}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1771603,"name":"Goat Cheese","permalink":"goat-cheese","url":"/category/goat-cheese"}]},{"id":3042761,"name":"Creeny","permalink":"creeny-cheese","position":4,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/creeny-cheese","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-12-18T06:14:35.000Z","description":"Creeny raw milk sheep’s milk cheese is one of the only raw milk cheeses produced in Ireland at the moment.
