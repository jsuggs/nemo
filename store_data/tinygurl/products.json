It will fit a 32-34-inch bust with soft Lycra swimsuit fabric at the bust and cream color muslin skirt. Detail is of leopard print Lycra, with gold trim just under the bust. The back is elasticized, with the halter top connected by snap buttons in the back. It's really cute and the hot pink really calls attention to the boob area, but I guess I'm too shy for that. The regular price was $170.
