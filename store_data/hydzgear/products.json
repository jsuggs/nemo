In my Athabascan culture Medicine people played a huge part in our survival, today it is hardly seen, used, or understood.  The elders say that when the huge influx of European people and their ways came into Alaska in the late 1800s the last Medicine people around said that, “We will lose our medicine”!  Perhaps it is the fact that we no longer struggle, use, and work with the land and the animals, which ensured our survival.  It was a much tougher, but purer way of life in every way and the wise would say, “There is something in the air that takes care of us”!\r\nNow that being said, life’s biggest struggles often times came down to wars between tribes in a fight over land barriers that provided the furs, foods, and tools for survival.  Medicine people would be able to foresee bad times coming and some would use medicine in a bad way to try hurt the enemy.\r\nSome Medicine men abused their powers by hurting others within their own tribes too over jealousy, lust for women, etc.  It is said that when this medicine was used wrong in a bad way, that spirit never really leaves an area and would eventually come back to the family or shaman who created it.  When traveling across the lands today, we still avoid camping or hanging out in known war lands that border our neighboring tribes.\r\n","options":[{"id":36759000,"name":"Small","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":36759003,"name":"Medium","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":36759006,"name":"Large","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":36759009,"name":"XL","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":36759012,"name":"2XL","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":36759015,"name":"3XL","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114662058/-/badmedicine-pink.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114662058/-/badmedicine-pink.jpg","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114662103/-/badmedicine-pink2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114662103/-/badmedicine-pink2.jpg","width":667,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5312643,"name":"Hoodies","permalink":"hoodies","url":"/category/hoodies"}]},{"id":11644722,"name":"Feather / Sweatpants - Black&Red","permalink":"feather-b-r-pants-black","position":9,"price":45.0,"default_price":45.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/feather-b-r-pants-black","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-07T18:19:58.000Z","description":"These sweatpants are made out of 100% cotton providing the coziest feeling, they also feature the Feather design.","options":[{"id":36760383,"name":"Small 4-6","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":36760386,"name":"Medium 8-10","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":36760389,"name":"Large 12-14","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":36760392,"name":"XL 16-18","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114665574/-/feather.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114665574/-/feather.jpg","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114665619/-/featherbrpants-2.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114665619/-/featherbrpants-2.JPG","width":667,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5312646,"name":"Ladies","permalink":"ladies","url":"/category/ladies"}]},{"id":11317824,"name":"Victory / Shirt - Red","permalink":"victory-mens-shirt","position":10,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/victory-mens-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-22T20:08:42.000Z","description":"I put the knife and scalp in this to display the ruthless part of life that is required to bring balance.

The outside of the hood is hand crafted by an Alaskan Native, Selina DeWilde-Alexander, lined with the traditional wolf/wolverine ruff designed to keep you warm and keep the wind chill out. The wolf ruff is the lighter colored fur on the outside; it has longer guard hairs that are meant to block the wind from you while the wolverine ruff, the lighter colored fur closer to the inside is known to be resistant to icing up from your breath in the cold Alaskan winters. The Alaskan Natives call this style of ruff the \"Sunshine Ruff\".\r\n\r\nThe coat can be customized even further with different colors for the embroidery or the garment itself. It can also have a name or word embroidered with your placement of choice. \r\n\r\nFor special order, contact Ricko DeWilde at:\r\nphone. 1-907-687-3930\r\nemail. skinz907@yahoo.com","options":[{"id":36771177,"name":"Default","price":1200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114701178/-/coat.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114701178/-/coat.JPG","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/115750854/-/wolverineruff.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/115750854/-/wolverineruff.jpg","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/115733598/-/warriorcoat3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/115733598/-/warriorcoat3.jpg","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/115733610/-/warriorcoat4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/115733610/-/warriorcoat4.jpg","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/115733574/-/warriorcoat2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/115733574/-/warriorcoat2.jpg","width":667,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5491389,"name":"Coats","permalink":"coats","url":"/category/coats"}]},{"id":11644572,"name":"Butterfly / Yoga Zip-Up - Black","permalink":"butterfly-yoga-zip-up-black","position":17,"price":65.0,"default_price":65.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/butterfly-yoga-zip-up-black","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-07T18:11:42.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":36759753,"name":"XS","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":36759762,"name":"Small","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":36759765,"name":"Medium","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":36759768,"name":"Large","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":36760071,"name":"XL","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114664014/-/butterflyyogazip-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114664014/-/butterflyyogazip-2.jpg","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114664038/-/butterflyzipfront.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114664038/-/butterflyzipfront.jpg","width":667,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5312646,"name":"Ladies","permalink":"ladies","url":"/category/ladies"}]},{"id":11318322,"name":"B-Spear / Shirt - Blue","permalink":"b-spear-mens-shirt","position":18,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/b-spear-mens-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-22T20:26:33.000Z","description":"The bear spear played a crucial role in the survival of the Native Alaskan tribes. Before the introduction of firearms in the 1800s, the bear spear was used for hunting grizzly bears.  It was also the last step in the journey to becoming a warrior.  The grizzly was and still is considered to be a large threat to the survival of many game animals in the Native Alaskan lands.  Moose, caribou, black bear, beaver, etc. are staple foods of my people, and the overpopulation of grizzlies can play a vital role in the survival of the animals.  When a grizzly was around, it was hunted to ensure the survival of the people and the animals.  When encountered, the warrior would provoke the grizzly to attack, if needed, by shooting it with a bow and arrow.

When traveling across the lands today, we still avoid camping or hanging out in known war lands that border our neighboring tribes.\r\n","options":[{"id":36759255,"name":"Small","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":36759258,"name":"Medium","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":36759261,"name":"Large","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":36759264,"name":"XL","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":36759267,"name":"2XL","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":36759270,"name":"3XL","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/115909926/-/badmedicine-black.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/115909926/-/badmedicine-black.jpg","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/115909986/-/badmedicine-black-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/115909986/-/badmedicine-black-2.jpg","width":667,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5312643,"name":"Hoodies","permalink":"hoodies","url":"/category/hoodies"}]},{"id":11175858,"name":"Victory / Hoodie - Black","permalink":"victory-black-hoodie","position":30,"price":55.0,"default_price":55.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/victory-black-hoodie","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-15T19:52:08.000Z","description":"I put the knife and scalp in this to display the ruthless part of life that is required to bring balance.

I have been invited to go in the past, and one day I will most likely go whaling with my northern most Native friends.\r\nI did the cross on the hood, intermingled with the harpoon tips to signify the embrace of Christianity and the old way of religion that is so strong in our Native culture today.  Also, I wanted to symbolize how hunting is one of the key aspects to our Native American religion.  In all tribes, to my knowledge and experience, the animal will give itself to you if you are a good and deserving person.  It is believed that there are many ways that a person can ruin this luck.  For example, a person brags too much, doesn't help others, acts out selfishly, speaks in a manner that they are out to get or kill an animal, brags about the size of an animal they harvested, does not care for the meat properly, etc..  In this aspect of Native religion, one must have a positive influence and effect on, and towards people, and Mother Nature.  This type of religion, one does not imply or speak about how religious they are, they simply walk the walk, and in the end the mother earth and the creator will gift one with great luck when bringing home food and hides to their family and community.\r\n","options":[{"id":35649234,"name":"Small","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35649237,"name":"Medium","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35649240,"name":"Large","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35649243,"name":"XL","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35649246,"name":"2XL","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":37139004,"name":"4XL","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114656274/-/whalingblack.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114656274/-/whalingblack.JPG","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114656358/-/whalingblack-2.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114656358/-/whalingblack-2.JPG","width":667,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5312643,"name":"Hoodies","permalink":"hoodies","url":"/category/hoodies"}]},{"id":11318934,"name":"Polar Bear / Hoodie - Black","permalink":"polar-bear-black-hoodie","position":36,"price":55.0,"default_price":55.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/polar-bear-black-hoodie","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-22T20:50:21.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":35649423,"name":"Small","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35649426,"name":"Medium","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35649429,"name":"Large","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35649432,"name":"XL","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35649435,"name":"2XL","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35649438,"name":"3XL","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114657126/-/polar_bear_frnt_hoodie.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114657126/-/polar_bear_frnt_hoodie.JPG","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/114656922/-/polar_bear_back_hoodie.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/114656922/-/polar_bear_back_hoodie.jpg","width":210,"height":315}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5312643,"name":"Hoodies","permalink":"hoodies","url":"/category/hoodies"}]},{"id":11318724,"name":"Moose Skull / Hoodie - Black","permalink":"wolf-raven-black-hoodie","position":37,"price":55.0,"default_price":55.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wolf-raven-black-hoodie","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-22T20:42:42.000Z","description":"This design was done just simply because the moose has such a huge force in bringing our people together.

Before the introduction of firearms in the 1800s, the bear spear was used for hunting grizzly bears.  It was also the last step in the journey to becoming a warrior.  The grizzly was and still is considered to be a large threat to the survival of many game animals in the Native Alaskan lands.  Moose, caribou, black bear, beaver, etc. are staple foods of my people, and the overpopulation of grizzlies can play a vital role in the survival of the animals.  When a grizzly was around, it was hunted to ensure the survival of the people and the animals.  When encountered, the warrior would provoke the grizzly to attack, if needed, by shooting it with a bow and arrow.

Before the introduction of firearms in the 1800s, the bear spear was used for hunting grizzly bears.  It was also the last step in the journey to becoming a warrior.  The grizzly was and still is considered to be a large threat to the survival of many game animals in the Native Alaskan lands.  Moose, caribou, black bear, beaver, etc. are staple foods of my people, and the overpopulation of grizzlies can play a vital role in the survival of the animals.  When a grizzly was around, it was hunted to ensure the survival of the people and the animals.  When encountered, the warrior would provoke the grizzly to attack, if needed, by shooting it with a bow and arrow.  The hunter would then wait in a kneeling position and let the charging animal come to him.  In the right moment, he would then use his bear spear to impale the bear, ensuring his ability to provide for and protect his tribe.

The raven follows the wolf for food and the wolf follows the raven when searching for game. We still watch the raven while hunting because it uses certain behavior to clue us in to where the game is. In the old stories of the last ice age and dark times, the raven is the bird that tricked the bear into giving back the sun.  This is a debt that all earth’s animals and people owe to the raven and is the reason it eats for free. The raven is also believed to be a messenger used by our past ancestors that can alert us to future hardships. The wolf, like the bear, wolverine and lynx is one of the old animals and it has unique values that apply to it when harvested.
