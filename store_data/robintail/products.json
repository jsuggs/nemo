Closes at the back with pretty covered buttons & loops.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGracie Lou is reminiscent of days gone by when skirts were neither mini nor straight but full gathered affairs that required petticoats to hold them out!\r\n\r\nWith a gorgeous scalloped band at the front and adjustable elastic at the back, the Gracie Lou features a very full gathered skirt that hangs beautifully when tip-toeing around or swishes wonderfully when twirling around. For photos or just to get the authentic 50's look, pair with a pettiskirt - which works like a hoop skirt and holds the skirt out to it's full glory.\r\n\r\nThe back of the waistband also makes this skirt quite adjustable and allows room to grow. Little girls don't change a great deal in size around their waist so this pinny will fit until it's too short. A line of faux buttons down the front form a statement without the hassle of having to worry about coming undone!\r\n\r\nSo now you know it is the perfect skirt!
