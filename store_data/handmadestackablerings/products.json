Gold-filled jewelry, even with daily wear, can last from 5 to 30 years. \r\n<!-- Start of StatCounter Code -->\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\nvar sc_project=5429266; \r\nvar sc_invisible=1; \r\nvar sc_partition=49; \r\nvar sc_click_stat=1; \r\nvar sc_security=\"5b252f5e\"; \r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"\r\nsrc=\"http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js\"></script><noscript><div\r\nclass=\"statcounter\"><a title=\"website statistics\"\r\nhref=\"http://www.statcounter.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img\r\nclass=\"statcounter\"\r\nsrc=\"http://c.statcounter.com/5429266/0/5b252f5e/1/\"\r\nalt=\"website statistics\" ></a></div></noscript>\r\n<!-- End of StatCounter Code -->\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":19463053,"name":"Default","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59865663/-/stackheartring2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59865663/-/stackheartring2.jpg","width":1000,"height":615},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59865695/-/stackheartring4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59865695/-/stackheartring4.jpg","width":1000,"height":708}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":304113,"name":"Handmade Stackable Rings","permalink":"handmade-stackable-rings","url":"/category/handmade-stackable-rings"}]},{"id":6079189,"name":"Bridesmaids Heart Ring, Tiny Heart Ring, Gold Filled Heart Ring, Heart Stacking Ring","permalink":"bridesmaids-heart-ring-tiny-heart-ring-gold-filled-heart-ring-heart-stacking-ring","position":41,"price":53.0,"default_price":53.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bridesmaids-heart-ring-tiny-heart-ring-gold-filled-heart-ring-heart-stacking-ring","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-05-01T19:41:04.000Z","description":"A sweet, tiny yellow gold filled heart has been attached to a hand forged and hand hammered 14k yellow gold filled band.

Whenever possible we replace commonly used chemicals with natural products. We also use recycled/reclaimed precious metals in all of our designs. These metals share the same exquisite beauty of mined precious metals but are recycled and eco-friendly.\r\nSterling silver, like many metals, is in a continuous flux which reflects it's environment. As the metal is exposed to the atmosphere, a reaction occurs which causes darker oxides to develop on it's surface. This process is sometimes called patination. Using a variety of different processes, the metalsmith can hurry this process along. In the case of the spiral earrings above, the background is aged to resemble a primitive artifact. The raised area is then re-polished to highlight the design. \r\n\r\nThe best care for these stackable birthstone rings is 'do nothing'. Think of them as the metallic equivalent of a cactus plant. NEVER use a chemical dip, or treated polishing cloth on them. Just let them stay on their natural continuum- reflecting their environment. You might occasionally 'go crazy' and rub the raised design to enhance the highlighted effect, but that is about all you should allow yourself. Wearing them is sufficient care.\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Start of StatCounter Code -->\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\nvar sc_project=5429266; \r\nvar sc_invisible=1; \r\nvar sc_partition=49; \r\nvar sc_click_stat=1; \r\nvar sc_security=\"5b252f5e\"; \r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"\r\nsrc=\"http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js\"></script><noscript><div\r\nclass=\"statcounter\"><a title=\"website statistics\"\r\nhref=\"http://www.statcounter.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img\r\nclass=\"statcounter\"\r\nsrc=\"http://c.statcounter.com/5429266/0/5b252f5e/1/\"\r\nalt=\"website statistics\" ></a></div></noscript>\r\n<!-- End of StatCounter Code -->","options":[{"id":9619251,"name":"Default","price":90.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26456785/-/_MG_9554IULIAN.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26456785/-/_MG_9554IULIAN.jpg","width":760,"height":760},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26456781/-/_MG_9545IULIAN.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26456781/-/_MG_9545IULIAN.jpg","width":800,"height":539},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26456953/-/_MG_9550IULIAN.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26456953/-/_MG_9550IULIAN.jpg","width":800,"height":551},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26456957/-/_MG_9534iulian.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26456957/-/_MG_9534iulian.jpg","width":800,"height":466},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26456961/-/_MG_9544IULIAN-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26456961/-/_MG_9544IULIAN-1.jpg","width":1000,"height":709}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":304113,"name":"Handmade Stackable Rings","permalink":"handmade-stackable-rings","url":"/category/handmade-stackable-rings"},{"id":1633880,"name":"Handmade stackable birthstone rings","permalink":"handmade-stackable-birthstone-rings","url":"/category/handmade-stackable-birthstone-rings"}]},{"id":2742097,"name":"Rhodolite GARNET in 14k gold filled stackable birthstone rings","permalink":"merlot-garnet-in-14k-gold-filled-stackable-birthstone-rings","position":70,"price":64.99,"default_price":64.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/merlot-garnet-in-14k-gold-filled-stackable-birthstone-rings","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-09-09T17:26:50.000Z","description":"January birthstone: lovely in all lighting, this ring provides you with a bold,  wine color 8 mm rhodolite garnet smooth cabochon mounted in 14k gold filled.

Since we sell untreated garnets, they are safe to clean with warm water and a mild dish soap or even a quick spray with some window cleaner and a warm water rinse. A beautiful red for romantic love.\r\nEvery piece of jewelry in the collection has been created to bring an aura of sensuality and romance to each woman wearing it and each piece is one of a kind even when it is made in limited editions.\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n\"Garnet is the ideal gemstone.   It is plentiful, durable, attractive, and reasonable in price.  Widely known as the red birthstone for January, garnet can be found in any color including the recently discovered blue.  Clarity, color, cut and size can make the ubiquitous garnet a  fine stone for jewelry or as a mineral specimen. \r\n\r\nWhat is not as widely known is the fact that garnet is an industrial mineral with scores of uses  as far reaching as petroleum refining to airplane manufacture.  Garnet  makes a good filtration medium that can be reused and is nontoxic and nonreactive.   It also produces very little dust and is considered eco-friendly.  The first industrial use of garnet was as an abrasive.  Garnet sandpaper is still manufactured in the US.    Industrial uses of garnet far outweigh its importance as a gem, and  the US uses sixteen percent of the world's production.\r\n\r\nThe Bohemians in what is now the Czech Republic were masters of the use garnets to great artistic advantage by placing the fiery bright red stones tightly together to form pictures frames, religious objects and jewelry.   The garnets were used to decorate the interiors of churches and castles  Bohemian garnets were popular during the Victorian era, and long before that.  Garnet beads were found in a grave that dates back to 3000 BC.\r\n    \r\nThe word garnet is from the Latin \"garanatus\" which means seed-like and is in reference to pomegranate seeds.  The pomegranate was a symbol of fertility.  Folklore and legend surround the garnet .  Noah was said to have lit the Ark with a glowing garnet.  The Hebrews listed the garnet as one of the twelve stones in Aaron's breastplate, and Christians said that it represented Christ's blood sacrifice.  In Muslim tradition the garnet illuminates the fourth heaven.\r\n\r\nThe term garnet refers to several related silicate minerals:  almandine, pyrope, spessartine, grossular, andradite, mozambique and uvavorite.  Many intermediate species are also found.\r\n\r\nGarnet is known as the stone of friendship and love.\" - informational article provided by Olivia Hoff.\r\n\r\n<!-- Start of StatCounter Code -->\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\nvar sc_project=5429266; \r\nvar sc_invisible=1; \r\nvar sc_partition=49; \r\nvar sc_click_stat=1; \r\nvar sc_security=\"5b252f5e\"; \r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"\r\nsrc=\"http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js\"></script><noscript><div\r\nclass=\"statcounter\"><a title=\"website statistics\"\r\nhref=\"http://www.statcounter.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img\r\nclass=\"statcounter\"\r\nsrc=\"http://c.statcounter.com/5429266/0/5b252f5e/1/\"\r\nalt=\"website statistics\" ></a></div></noscript>\r\n<!-- End of StatCounter Code -->","options":[{"id":9626277,"name":"Default","price":64.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26479157/-/_MG_9763iulian.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26479157/-/_MG_9763iulian.jpg","width":681,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26479165/-/_MG_9493IULIAN.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26479165/-/_MG_9493IULIAN.jpg","width":750,"height":662},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26479169/-/_MG_9496IULIAN.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26479169/-/_MG_9496IULIAN.jpg","width":750,"height":478},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26479173/-/_MG_9479IULIAN.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26479173/-/_MG_9479IULIAN.jpg","width":800,"height":470},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26479177/-/2504.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26479177/-/2504.jpg","width":200,"height":155}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":304113,"name":"Handmade Stackable Rings","permalink":"handmade-stackable-rings","url":"/category/handmade-stackable-rings"},{"id":1633880,"name":"Handmade stackable birthstone rings","permalink":"handmade-stackable-birthstone-rings","url":"/category/handmade-stackable-birthstone-rings"}]},{"id":3529666,"name":"Sterling Silver Stackable Textured Rings, Set of 4, Hammered shiny bands, Made to order in your size","permalink":"sterling-silver-stackable-textured-rings-set-of-4-hammered-shiny-bands-made-to-order-in-your-size","position":71,"price":39.99,"default_price":39.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sterling-silver-stackable-textured-rings-set-of-4-hammered-shiny-bands-made-to-order-in-your-size","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-04-02T12:53:04.000Z","description":"Sterling silver stackable rings, SET OF 4 hammered shiny bands.\r\nSizes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 \r\n\r\nThis rings set is entirely hand crafted by me  and it will be MADE TO ORDER for you in YOUR requested SIZE.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"><!--\r\ngoogle_ad_client = \"pub-8303064545068960\";\r\n/* 200x200, created 2/21/11 */\r\ngoogle_ad_slot = \"4769938915\";\r\ngoogle_ad_width = 200;\r\ngoogle_ad_height = 200;\r\n//-->\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"\r\nsrc=\"http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js\">\r\n</script><br><br>\r\n\r\nThis set has 4 sterling silver bands.

Still mined in these areas, Persian turquoise is one of the finest qualities in the world.  It started being used artistically in jewelry creations in 5500 B.C.  It was even found in King Tut’s tomb.\r\n\r\nModern times have us associating turquoise with Native American Indians of the southwestern United States and Mexico.  It’s commonly mixed with silver, but that tradition was actually started by a white trader.  Before the 1880’s the southwest Indian tribes used turquoise as solid pieces in bead or pendant form.  Turquoise mined in these areas today is also of very fine quality.\r\n\r\nOne of turquoise’s charms is that there are no two pieces that are exactly alike.  Intricate patterns and inclusions make each stone unique.  Even its color differs from stone to stone.  Usually a beautiful shade of blue, it can range from green to bluish-green to bright blue to robin-egg blue.  The color depends on the chemical reaction that created the stone.  If it is bluer, it contains more copper.  Greener stones have more iron or chromium. \r\n\r\nSpiritually it’s known as a magical stone that prevents illness and heals the sick.  It can bring wealth to the wearer.  It’s often found decorating ancient swards for its protective qualities.  Brides carry it for the same reason.\r\n\r\nQuality turquoise has many veins of gold, black, silver, brown, copper, yellow or light blue.  It is a soft stone making it easy to crack and break during cutting, so you’ll never find it faceted in the jewelry store.  Because of this it’s best to buy turquoise jewelry with protective settings.  It’s prone to scratches and nicks.\r\n\r\nIts softness also raises some flags when caring for your turquoise jewelry.  Don’t use soap or an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner.  Just wipe it will a soft, damp cloth and store it safe from contact with harder objects.\r\n\r\nMany celebrities have been photographed in turquoise and some of the most popular gemstone magazines have featured it.  As always, fine quality jewelry of all types never goes out of style.\r\n<!-- Start of StatCounter Code -->\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\nvar sc_project=5429266; \r\nvar sc_invisible=1; \r\nvar sc_partition=49; \r\nvar sc_click_stat=1; \r\nvar sc_security=\"5b252f5e\"; \r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"\r\nsrc=\"http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js\"></script><noscript><div\r\nclass=\"statcounter\"><a title=\"website statistics\"\r\nhref=\"http://www.statcounter.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img\r\nclass=\"statcounter\"\r\nsrc=\"http://c.statcounter.com/5429266/0/5b252f5e/1/\"\r\nalt=\"website statistics\" ></a></div></noscript>\r\n<!-- End of StatCounter Code -->\r\n","options":[{"id":9650574,"name":"Default","price":90.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26568781/-/_MG_9558IULIAN.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26568781/-/_MG_9558IULIAN.jpg","width":798,"height":644},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26568793/-/_MG_9550IULIAN.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26568793/-/_MG_9550IULIAN.jpg","width":800,"height":551},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26568797/-/_MG_9479IULIAN.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26568797/-/_MG_9479IULIAN.jpg","width":800,"height":470},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26568801/-/2504.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26568801/-/2504.jpg","width":200,"height":155}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1633880,"name":"Handmade stackable birthstone rings","permalink":"handmade-stackable-birthstone-rings","url":"/category/handmade-stackable-birthstone-rings"}]},{"id":3575300,"name":"7 Thin Handmade, Hammered Sterling Silver Stack Bangle Bracelets-Handmade Sterling Silver Artisan Je","permalink":"7-thin-handmade-hammered-sterling-silver-stack-bangle-bracelets-handmade-sterling-silver-artisan-jew","position":76,"price":180.0,"default_price":180.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/7-thin-handmade-hammered-sterling-silver-stack-bangle-bracelets-handmade-sterling-silver-artisan-jew","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-04-11T01:22:34.000Z","description":"7 Thin Hammered Sterling Silver Stack Bangle Bracelets in a set of 7, designed to match the sterling silver stackable rings sets available in my store.

Whether you're looking for something special for yourself or a gift, you're bound to find something you'll love.I design and make unique jewelry for any occasion. I also design bridal and bridesmaids' jewelry to match the bride's and bridesmaids' dress color and style. I love all sorts of jewelry and have a hard time fitting everything I have into jewelry boxes. My personal wardrobe concept is to own a few high-quality basics and dress them up with shoes, purses and jewelry. A few years ago, after being unable to find exactly what I wanted at department stores, I turned to designing my own jewelry. Each piece I made was a reflection of my mood, personality and style. Now I sell my jewelry both here and off-line.\r\n\r\nHow is my jewelry different?\r\n\r\nI don't seek to appeal to the masses. I create one-of-a-kind and limited edition designs that appeal to just one person – you. Everyone has a unique style, and my goal is to help you express yours with my jewelry.\r\n\r\nI love to add a splash of color to my outfits! In addition to the classic blacks, whites and browns, I carefully select a variety of colors such as bright reds, deep purples and lustrous greens that portray a certain feeling and allow you to express how you feel that day.\r\n\r\norig·i·nal {ə-ˈrij-ə-nəl} adj. 1.the source or cause from which something arises. 2. that from which a copy, reproduction, or translation is made. 3. a work composed firsthand. 4. person of fresh initiative or inventive capacity ; a unique or eccentric person.\r\n\r\nI love making jewelry and bridal accessories, and look forward to sharing my passion with you!

If it's not good enough for me to wear, you won't find it in my shop! Dreaming up original jewelry designs and then bringing them to life is my colorful, sparkly and adventurous little escape.
