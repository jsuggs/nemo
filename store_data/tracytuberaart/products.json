Straight from my instagram \"A Sketch a Day for a Year\" Series #ttdoodles.\r\n\r\nThe ROSHE RUN is hands down one of the most COMFORTABLE SHOES I HAVE EVER OWNED! Besides the comfort (It's like walking on Clouds of Marshmallows) the design of the shoe is so simple & clean. Nike Designer Dylan Raasch, took inspiration from his own life of practicing meditation & took that mentality of ZEN & SIMPLICITY & applied them to the shoe. The shoe is even named after the title given to a ZEN MASTER, \"ROSHI\". For legal reasons the spelling had to be changed, but still pronounced the same.\r\n\r\nFor this print I again took the nickname of the shoe, in this case the shoe's ACTUAL name and created an illustration based on the name & ZEN CALLIGRAPHY.

Each print is signed & numbered. LIMITED TO ONLY 24 PRINTS. (Each PRINT is $30.00)\r\n\r\nIn homage to the GREATEST BALLER IN THE WORLD, I created an Illustration celebrating the numerous colorways that came out for his 6th signature shoe. A print to match every HOT colorway that dropped. \r\n\r\nThe GRINCHS- Although they were officially  part of the \"STOP LIGHT SERIES\", the Interweb dubbed them \"THE GRINCHS.\" I had to go with that nick name, because these kicks stole money from my wallet.\r\n\r\nThe DEL SOLS- The standard colorway in the KOBE shoe line, but for the VI's, ones that really show off the BLACK MAMBA theme.\r\n\r\nThe CONCORDS- This colorway has unofficially become KOBE's Home game kicks. A clean looking shoe with the right amount of a pop color. BAM!\r\n\r\nThe EAST LA's-  Once thought to be Kobe's ASG shoe, but in fact they were not. They were the first shoe in a SERIES of LA CITY themed KICKS. 3 Shoes all representing 3 different locales of Southern Cali. EAST LOS represent! ODELAY!\r\n\r\nThe HOLLYWOOD 3Ds- The Second shoe released from the LA CITY SERIES. This shoe is my favorite! The concept behind it is a play off of the Hollywood trend of 3D movies. What better way to celebrate this shoe, but with a 3D PRINT! Yup, the print is 3D & COMES WITH the OLD SCHOOL 3D glasses to enjoy it in all it's tripiness! WHOAAAAAA! KOBE JUMPS OFF THE PRINT!\r\n\r\nThe HOLLYWOOD 3Ds (NORMAL)- Same as the actual 3D print, but not an ANAGLYPH (meaning... NOT 3D)\r\n\r\nThe OC SUNSETS- The Third & final shoe released from the LA CITY SERIES. This shoe celebrates the beautiful Beaches of the OC & where Kobe lives. Luckily you don't have to be OC RICH to purchase this print.\r\n\r\nThe ALL STARS-  The actual ALL STAR SHOES that Kobe wore during the 2011 ALL STAR Game in LA. These bad boys are a sick RED & BLACK color combo. My 2 favorite colors!\r\n\r\nThe GLASS BLUES- These were the most colorful pair of KOBE VI's to drop. They remind me of the NIKE SB SKATE OR DIE's & that's probably the reason why I LOVE'EM! The bright colors, the \"glass\"/ clear bottom soles these kicks have it all! \r\n\r\nThe CHINAS- These are a prime example of how KOBE is a GLOBAL SUPERSTAR. China gets their own colorway of these dope kicks! Sure the only difference between the US release & the Asia release are some lace locks & a crazy box, but c'mon!...There ain't no USA colorway.... At least not yet. China loves them some KOBE BRYANT, & they love them some KOBE SHOES! A billion peeps with great taste.\r\n","options":[{"id":22132037,"name":"THE GRINCHS","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":22132035,"name":"THE DEL SOLS","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":22132209,"name":"THE CONCORDS","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":22132217,"name":"THE EAST LA's","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":22132213,"name":"THE HOLLYWOOD 3D (ANAGLYPH)","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":22132215,"name":"THE HOLLYWOOD 3D (NORMAL)","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":22132211,"name":"THE OC SUNSETS","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10797145,"name":"THE ALL STARS","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":22132221,"name":"THE GLASS BLUES","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":22132219,"name":"THE CHINAS","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":185,"name":"Puerto Rico","code":"PR"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":8.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68563587/-/TT_KBVI_1.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68563587/-/TT_KBVI_1.png","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68563795/-/TT_KBVI_2_SMALL.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68563795/-/TT_KBVI_2_SMALL.png","width":576,"height":576},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68564279/-/KBVI_GROUPSHOT_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68564279/-/KBVI_GROUPSHOT_1.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1822905,"name":"Art Prints","permalink":"art-prints","url":"/category/art-prints"}]}]
