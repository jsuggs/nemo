Compatible with the iPad 1 and 2, this case features a built in stand, two interior pockets, and an elastic pen loop. This stand can be propped up at two different angles making it easy to view your tablet. Your device will stay snug and safe in the case from the elastic and corner pockets.  Constructed from designer fabrics and three stabilizers, this case is durable against bumps while looking chic. \r\n\r\nThe case is constructed impeccably. All seams are carefully stitched to ensure long lasting durability. Three stabilizers including hardboard help prop up your case while protecting your device.  \r\n\r\nTo prop your case up, fold the cover back, tucking the flap into the back loop.\r\n\r\nFinished Case: 8\" x 10\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPattern is from a Sew Spoiled design by Leah Williams.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nI can also customize a case for any tablet computer. Please contact me with what type of device you have so I can create a custom listing for you.
