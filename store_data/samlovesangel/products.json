She hand-painted this with acrylic. The concept is beautiful too! \r\n<br><br>From Sereen: <blockquote><em>\"16 umbrellas to represent September 16th as your wedding day. You both are standing on \"LOVE\" above the clouds to represent that your love is eternal and not of the world. The umbrellas are fun but I was also thinking of protection and floating with the wind. The wind representing the Holy Spirit as you follow his leading for your life! The umbrellas help you to stay afloat and move with the Spirit (wind), but also protect you from the storms. In a marriage solidified in the love of Jesus, no storm will bring you down or mess you up.\"</em></blockquote>\r\n<br><br>\r\nThank you Sereen!","options":[{"id":21493303,"name":"Small (11\" x 13\")","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":22410405,"name":"Medium (16\" x 18.9\")","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":22410407,"name":"Large (24\" x 28.4\")","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":22410409,"name":"Grande (30.5\" x 36\")","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69467315/-/Screen_Shot_2012-08-27_at_10.40.26_PM.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69467315/-/Screen_Shot_2012-08-27_at_10.40.26_PM.png","width":590,"height":698}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3484707,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":6766337,"name":"Love Like Sunset by David Cazso","permalink":"limited-edition-print-3","position":3,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/limited-edition-print-3","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-23T02:03:20.000Z","description":"David is one of our best friends and he also lives in Colima, Mexico.
