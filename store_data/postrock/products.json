Months and months this was announced as a \"soon-to-be-expected-on-vinyl\" release on their label, but it never saw the light of day. We were a little disappointed that it was scrapped from the release schedule, until... we found out that the band released it themselves a few years ago on a limited scale!

Based on the upcoming novel by Sebastian Obermeir, Our Ceasing Voice's new 2011 album pursues the concept established with their 2009 EP Steadied Stars In The Morphium Sky, while the development to a darker, more dynamic sound is clearly noticeable. Beautiful and saddening at the same time, the Austrians draw attention to fragility, passionately making one's flesh creep and thereby portraying a dramatic story full of yearning and desperation.
