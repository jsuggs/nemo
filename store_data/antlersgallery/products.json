As you look through the layers of pencil, charcoal, ink and paint the medium has been allowed to flow, nothing is fixed. Dripping, bleeding and cracking revealing its accidental, volatile nature, a beginning and an end, from darkness to light. The subjects are exposed, unveiling something primal, vulnerable; penetrating a raw truth.\r\n\r\nAbigail received a First class BA Hons in Fine Art from The University Of Wales Institute of Cardiff in 2004 and now works from her Jamaica Street Studio in Bristol. In 2010 Abigail had her first solo exhibition at the Knifesmith Gallery and her solo shows this year include the Folk House Cafe and Urban Outfitters store also in Bristol. Abigail has also recently appeared at No.1 Harbourside, Royal West of England Academy, and JSA Open Studios Weekend.

The character of Punch was often used to voice opinions that would otherwise be prohibited, satirising politicians, for example.  The darker subtext of the material combined with the explicit violence turns this children’s puppet show into something much more sinister. \r\n\r\nTim’s anachronistic style takes especially strong influence from classic literature and mythologies. Although Tim’s background is in illustration he now concentrates on fine art painting and drawing, in which he enjoys greater creative freedom in terms of both style and subject matter. Illustration has however helped to give structure to his love for working directly from his imagination and gives his art its narrative quality. It has also encouraged a passion for drawing, which is at the core of all his work.\r\n\r\nTim graduated from Falmouth College of Arts in 2004 with a first class degree in Illustration.  Notable group exhibitions include Grotesques and Anatomy with Antlers Gallery,  ‘Out of Darkness’ Literary Festival at The Globe at Hay, Hay-on-Wye and ‘Mortal: Life, Death and Memento Mori’ Clifton, Bristol.  Tim has had two solo shows at Knifesmith Gallery in Bristol ‘The Innocents?’ 2009 and ‘Revelations’ 2010.\r\n\r\nOriginal works by Tim are available, to find out more please contact Jack on:\r\n\r\njack@antlersgallery.com or 0778 050 3180","options":[{"id":48921003,"name":"Tim Lane","price":90.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":16.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128140458/-/Punch_and_the_Blinded.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128140458/-/Punch_and_the_Blinded.jpg","width":1000,"height":1300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128140473/-/DSC_6731b.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128140473/-/DSC_6731b.jpg","width":800,"height":1009}],"artists":[{"id":223869,"name":"Tim Lane","permalink":"tim-lane","url":"/artist/tim-lane"}],"categories":[{"id":1620589,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":3688562,"name":"Dark Suits - Playing Cards","permalink":"dark-suits-playing-cards","position":5,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dark-suits-playing-cards","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-05-02T19:55:26.000Z","description":"Artist: Mr Mead\r\n\r\nTitle: Dark Suits Playing Cards\r\n\r\nDate: 2011\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nPrinted by a professional card producer these cards come in a box designed by the artist.

This seems to me a very natural process, the act of picking up a pen and marking out a skyline becomes almost an unconscious one.”\r\n\r\nMax has studied at Falmouth College of Art (Foundation), the University of Brighton (BA Fine Art) and has recently finished a post graduate course at the Prince’s Drawing School, London (2012). Max has been part of numerous group shows including those in Bristol, London, Truro, Brighton and Tuscany.

The term has since come to describe any form of drunken revelry. This series of small-scale works takes as loose inspiration this Classical festival of ultimate decadence and animalistic pleasure.\r\n\r\nHere, the revellers are seen on their way to a modern fancy dress party wearing costumes and carrying attributes reflective of their own inner hopes, dreams and fears on their journey through life\r\n\r\nAs with the ‘Memento Mori’ series, ideas about the eventuality of death recur. However, ‘The Uninvited Guest’ here serves as a reminder to live despite his inescapable arrival at the party. \r\n\r\nTim graduated from Falmouth College of Arts in 2004 with a first class degree in Illustration.  Notable group exhibitions include Grotesques and Anatomy with Antlers Gallery,  ‘Out of Darkness’ Literary Festival at The Globe at Hay, Hay-on-Wye and ‘Mortal: Life, Death and Memento Mori’ Clifton, Bristol.  Tim has had two solo shows at Knifesmith Gallery in Bristol ‘The Innocents?’ 2009 and ‘Revelations’ 2010.\r\n\r\nOriginal works by Tim are available, to find out more please contact Jack on:\r\n\r\njack@antlersgallery.com or 0778 050 3180\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":10460393,"name":"Tim Lane","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":8.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29520513/-/The_Unwelcome_Guest.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29520513/-/The_Unwelcome_Guest.jpg","width":550,"height":550},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/106162005/-/DSC_6762.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/106162005/-/DSC_6762.jpg","width":792,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29674555/-/theunwelcomedetail.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29674555/-/theunwelcomedetail.jpg","width":550,"height":550}],"artists":[{"id":223869,"name":"Tim Lane","permalink":"tim-lane","url":"/artist/tim-lane"}],"categories":[{"id":1620589,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":8552610,"name":"Mug with a pouch of Tea","permalink":"mug-with-a-pouch-of-tea","position":18,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mug-with-a-pouch-of-tea","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-14T18:15:08.000Z","description":"A Tim Lane Mug with a pouch of Attic Tea. \r\n\r\nA fine bone china mug printed in the UK.

The term has since come to describe any form of drunken revelry. This series of small-scale works takes as loose inspiration this classical festival of ultimate decadence and animalistic pleasure. \r\n\r\nHere, the revellers are seen on their way to a modern fancy dress party wearing costumes and carrying attributes reflective of their own inner hopes, dreams and fears on their journey through life. The shy boy making his way to the party in the guise of a ferocious crocodile shows a contrast between the outward projection of confidence and aggression, and an inner fragility.\r\n\r\nTim graduated from Falmouth College of Arts in 2004 with a first class degree in Illustration.  Notable group exhibitions include Grotesques and Anatomy with Antlers Gallery,  ‘Out of Darkness’ Literary Festival at The Globe at Hay, Hay-on-Wye and ‘Mortal: Life, Death and Memento Mori’ Clifton, Bristol.

Trying to balance close detail and planned composition with expressive doodling and instinctive choices.\r\n\r\n“My visual memory is full of landscapes that are an invaluable resource when making work, I sometimes try to accurately represent a remembered view or take component parts to construct an imagined place. This seems to me a very natural process, the act of picking up a pen and marking out a skyline becomes almost an unconscious one.”\r\n\r\nMax has studied at Falmouth College of Art (Foundation), the University of Brighton (BA Fine Art) and has recently finished a post graduate course at the Prince’s Drawing School, London (2012).

These are photos printed onto leaves using only sunlight.\r\n\r\nBy placing a photo printed onto clear acetate over a leaf, then exposing it to the sun for several days, the leaf itself takes on the image. Where the acetate image cast a protective shadow over areas of the leaf, it stays a healthy green or darker brown. Where the sun shines through the clear highlights of the image overlay, it damages the leaf rather in a similar way to our own skin, though drying and bleaching rather than darkening it. The leaf is still alive as the photo develops into its cellular structure; only drying once the process is over and the photo overlay is lifted away. Just as the leaf itself had a lifespan, so does the image now printed onto it. Rachel’s chlorophyll prints are purposely left ‘unfixed’ and chemical free. This means the images continue their slow change whenever they are exposed to sunlight, slowly bleaching and disappearing forever.\r\n\r\nThis Limited Edition Print of the original photograph has been launched by Antlers to coincide with their show - Old Beliefs","options":[{"id":23222333,"name":"Rachel Sokal ","price":90.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":50,"name":"Andorra","code":"AD"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":16.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72002389/-/Living_Echo_II.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72002389/-/Living_Echo_II.jpg","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/106162581/-/DSC_6792.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/106162581/-/DSC_6792.jpg","width":792,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":223887,"name":"Rachel Sokal","permalink":"rachel-sokal","url":"/artist/rachel-sokal"}],"categories":[{"id":1620589,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":6722075,"name":"Freki and Muninn","permalink":"freki-and-muninn","position":47,"price":90.0,"default_price":90.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/freki-and-muninn","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-17T14:39:47.000Z","description":"Artist: Tim Lane\r\n\r\nTitle: Freki and Muninn\r\n\r\nDate: 2012\r\n\r\nDimensions: 41cm x 58.5cm\r\n\r\nMedium: Giclee Print\r\n\r\nEdition Size: 50\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nThis limited edition giclee print on museum grade archival paper is a reproduction of a graphite on paper drawing by Tim Lane.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nTim’s anachronistic style takes especially strong influence from classic literature and mythologies.

He is the king of the hinds, adorned with ribbons and jewels and crowned with a magpies nest, yet he is indifferent to all this finery. \r\n\r\nAmy’s paintings aim to convey the pure essence or souls of the animals they represent, weaving in a subtle narrative of birth, love, death and decay.

Presently, she is also studying the art of taxidermy, which unites both her love of art and anatomy.\r\n\r\nAmy is a Bristol based artist. Originally from Wiltshire, her rural upbringing helped to fuel her fascination for the natural world, principally her interest in the indigenous flora and fauna of the British Isles.

Although Tim’s background is in illustration he now concentrates on fine art painting and drawing, in which he enjoys greater creative freedom in terms of both style and subject matter. Illustration has however helped to give structure to his love for working directly from his imagination and gives his art its narrative quality.

An indigo ribbon binds the heart, restraining its beats.  With its trachea hanging limply to one side, the lungs are dull, dark and constrained, unable to inflate. A heart is a symbol frequently associated with the theme of love, however in this case the concept of love is restrained. The dominance of the heart holds the lungs back, preventing them from having the space to breath.\r\n\r\nWith their wings echoing that of the form of the bow, butterflies swarm over the organs, creating an air of closeness and claustrophobia. This is heightened by the use of a dark colour palette of reds, purples and blacks.\r\n\r\nAmy’s paintings aim to convey the pure essence or souls of the animals that they represent. Working primarily in bold, flat gouache, the interplay between colour and negative space of her neutral backgrounds is key.\r\n\r\nAmy is a Bristol based artist. Originally from Wiltshire, her pastoral upbringing has fuelled her fascination for the natural world. She graduated in 2007 from Falmouth College of Arts with a BA (Hons) degree in Illustration. She has exhibited at Chelsea Flower Show 2007, Grotesques 2010 at Antlers Gallery Bristol and The Royal West of England Academy 2011.

The original drawing measures six foot high and took 45 pens to complete. The reason for the scale used in this drawing was to attempt to overcome the artist’s fear of waking up in the night to be confronted by a Fox-man. Mr Mead hoped that by creating a life-sized replication of his nightmare, and staring directly into its eyes, he could conquer it. \r\n\r\nMr Mead is a Bristol based artist / illustrator who admires the surreal and otherworldly sides of art. Mead hand draws all of his work with fine liner pens and / or dip pen and Indian ink then modifies the work for prints digitally.\r\n\r\nMead’s terror and intrigue for animals dressed as humans stems from his memories of Reginald Mills’ 1976 ballet film, The Tales of Beatrix Potter. Deciding to embrace his fear Mead has recently found a passion for more the traditional artistic techniques and has developed his ink based style to create dark inhuman characters blending the animal, human and mechanic.","options":[{"id":10466783,"name":"Mr Mead","price":90.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":8.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/33525280/-/voxman_print_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/33525280/-/voxman_print_.jpg","width":638,"height":858},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/40946583/-/63.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/40946583/-/63.jpg","width":763,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41851863/-/VOXMAN_DETAIL_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41851863/-/VOXMAN_DETAIL_.jpg","width":800,"height":800}],"artists":[{"id":223872,"name":"Mr Mead","permalink":"mr-mead","url":"/artist/mr-mead"}],"categories":[{"id":1620589,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":3046523,"name":"Diving Bull","permalink":"diving-bull","position":81,"price":90.0,"default_price":90.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/diving-bull","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-12-19T18:52:02.000Z","description":"Artist: Mr Mead\r\n\r\nTitle: Diving Bull\r\n\r\nDate: 2010\r\n\r\nDimensions: 29.7 cm x 42 cm\r\n\r\nMedium: Giclée Print with Ultrachrome Pigment Inks on Hahnemuhle Museum Etching Paper 350gsm.\r\n\r\nEdition Size: 50\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nThis giclee print on museum grade archival paper is a reproduction of a dip pen on card drawing by Mr Mead.

Where some may see ugliness, disgust or distaste, Rose sees beauty and intrigue. \r\n\r\nThe object of death is seen not as a morbid obsession created to shock or offend but as an appreciation of what once was: to honour and celebrate its existence.

He explores ideas about a loss of innocence and a lack of care. The character of Punch was often used to voice opinions that would otherwise be prohibited, satirising politicians, for example.  The darker subtext of the material combined with the explicit violence turns this children’s puppet show into something much more sinister. \r\n\r\nTim’s anachronistic style takes especially strong influence from classic literature and mythologies. Although Tim’s background is in illustration he now concentrates on fine art painting and drawing, in which he enjoys greater creative freedom in terms of both style and subject matter. Illustration has however helped to give structure to his love for working directly from his imagination and gives his art its narrative quality. It has also encouraged a passion for drawing, which is at the core of all his work.\r\n\r\nTim graduated from Falmouth College of Arts in 2004 with a first class degree in Illustration.

According to Greek mythology, Chrysaor was the son of Medusa and Poseidon, conceived in the temple of Athena.

As you look through the layers of pencil, charcoal, ink and paint the medium has been allowed to flow, nothing is fixed. Dripping, bleeding and cracking revealing its accidental, volatile nature, a beginning and an end, from darkness to light. The subjects are exposed, unveiling something primal, vulnerable; penetrating a raw truth.\r\n\r\nAbigail received a First class BA Hons in Fine Art from The University Of Wales Institute of Cardiff in 2004 and now works from her Jamaica Street Studio in Bristol.
