A handwritten card from someone special evokes the deepest of emotions. It makes the receiver feel loved, valued and cherished. A beautiful card from a special person can never be parted with; it becomes a keepsake, often passed down through the generations.\r\n\r\nFor all these very reasons, I love to create beautiful and unique fabric greeting cards. I am always amazed at all the wonderful designs, patterns and colours available and the endless possibilities fabric creates. I am meticulous with my fabric selection. A fabric must “speak to me” before I select it. A beautiful fabric transforms a greeting card into something so unique and worthy of being a keepsake.\r\n\r\nThis particular set contains four (4) blank fabric greeting cards. The fabric is a white fabric with black bicyles, I feel they have both a French and Vintage feel. The cards are a thick white card with rounded corners measuring 12.5 x 12.5 cms. The cards come with quality white (peal and seal) envelopes.\r\n\r\nThe cards are packaged simply and are ready for gift giving, or you might like to keep them all to yourself and send to the special people in your life!! Many people say that they have framed my cards.\r\n\r\nFabric placement will differ slightly from card to card, so you know that no one card is ever the same!\r\n\r\nYour greeting card set will be posted in a rigid, cardboard mailing box. Gift wrapping is also available, just ask!\r\n\r\nAll my cards are designed and made by myself in at my home in Melbourne.\r\n\r\nThank you for looking and please do not hesitate to ask me any questions.\r\n\r\nMelinda.","options":[{"id":20382023,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.3,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/62843415/-/bikes1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/62843415/-/bikes1.jpg","width":897,"height":700}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":864341,"name":"Greeting Card Sets","permalink":"greeting-card-sets","url":"/category/greeting-card-sets"}]},{"id":6399079,"name":"Fabric Greeting Card Set (4) - Eiffel Tower","permalink":"fabric-greeting-card-set-4-eiffel-tower","position":2,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fabric-greeting-card-set-4-eiffel-tower","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-08T15:03:46.000Z","description":"Every card lover knows that a card is so much more than a card.
