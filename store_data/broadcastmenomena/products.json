I should also note that drummer / vocalist / songwriter Danny Seim spent his teenage years living in Honolulu.\r\n\r\nSince its release, Mines has been lauded by critics at music culture observatories from Pitchfork to Paste Magazine (“full-blown insanity finally breaks free of the straightjacket. Mines is Menomena at its best - mentally relentless and physically ruthless.”), NPR to Alternative Press (“meticulously crafted” ««««), The BBC to Filter (“magical”).\r\n\r\nhttp://menomena.com/\r\nhttp://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14463-mines/","options":[{"id":12381026,"name":"Default","price":21.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35947200/-/MENOMENA_2011_Flyer-01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35947200/-/MENOMENA_2011_Flyer-01.jpg","width":667,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":153728,"name":"Concert Tickets","permalink":"concert-tickets","url":"/category/concert-tickets"}]},{"id":202290,"name":"Of Montreal Live in Honolulu at LOFT","permalink":"of-monreal-live-in-honolulu","position":2,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/of-monreal-live-in-honolulu","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-12-12T10:50:19.000Z","description":"- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\nPRE-SALE SOLD OUT\r\nPURCHASE TICKETS AT THE DOOR</B>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Montreal (Polyvinyl Records)\r\nLive in Honolulu at LOFT\r\nSaturday, February 21st \r\n\r\nLOFT | 115 N Hotel Street\r\n18+ Welcome\r\nDoors open at 830PM.

Her love affair with the spotlight began as a young Hip-Hop dancer in the early 90s, armed with a Salt N Pepa cassette tape and a recurring role as the youngest b-girl in the crew. As she grew older and the path of Hip-Hop took a more aggressive turn into Gangster Rap, she struggled to continue her love of music and still find a place for a young woman to be herself.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t until she entered San Francisco State as a journalism undergrad that she began to appreciate Hip Hop again as an active participant, giving up the choreographed dance routines for a microphone and a chance to make up for lost time. She began learning about her culture through ethnic studies classes, organizing with the League of Filipino Students, and reclaiming her identity through her writing. While organizing, she met Irene Faye Duller aka Shorty Rocwell of the 8th Wonder crew, and along with fellow organizers Valerie Francisco (Sho Shock), Natasha Pineda (Sola), and Liezel Rivera (Zelstarrr), they formed the Rhapsodistas in 2004.\r\n\r\nGrowing weary of Hip-Hop’s direction, she decided to fill the void and make music that balanced her city upbringing with social commentary. She’s been featured on the Native Guns Stray Bullets Vol.2 Mixtape, Bambu’s I Scream Bars for the Children, Roscoe Umali’s I Love My DJs street album, and Hopie Spitshard’s “The Diamond Dame”. Her first mixtape, Married to the Hustle, was released on February 14, 2008, and she is now working on her solo debut album, Rocky Rivera, released in 2010. \r\n\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\n\r\n<b>Presale $8\r\n+$5 at the Door for UNDER AGE Patrons\r\n\r\n$10 at the Door </b>\r\n+$5 at the Door for UNDER AGE Patrons\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\n\r\nNOTE .50 IS ADDED TO COVER PAYPAL COSTS","options":[{"id":5778741,"name":"Default","price":8.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36803428/-/Rocky_Rivera_HNL.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36803428/-/Rocky_Rivera_HNL.jpg","width":680,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":153728,"name":"Concert Tickets","permalink":"concert-tickets","url":"/category/concert-tickets"}]}]
