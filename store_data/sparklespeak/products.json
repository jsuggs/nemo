We are able to offer a special introductory price of £29.50 on the resource for orders made before September 31, 2013 - that's a £5.50 discount. \r\nPlease note Take Brittany does not feature Milo and his friends and has a completely different format to the Bonjour Milo! stories. However, we are sure your pupils will love it!\r\n\r\nTake Brittany is designed to be used flexibly and could form the basis of a Breton Culture week. Or the units could be integrated into any scheme of work. \r\nEach unit has a creative piece of work as an end outcome and is supported with step-by-step teaching notes, a PowerPoint slideshow and a video on an aspect of Breton culture featuring the children of Ecole Sanquer, in southern Brittany.","options":[{"id":39862986,"name":"Default","price":29.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121849722/-/Take_Brittany_temporary.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121849722/-/Take_Brittany_temporary.jpg","width":232,"height":224},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121776627/-/Breton_biscuits.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121776627/-/Breton_biscuits.jpg","width":1269,"height":829},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121776630/-/Breton_Doorway.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121776630/-/Breton_Doorway.jpg","width":774,"height":1065}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5803659,"name":"Take Brittany","permalink":"take-brittany","url":"/category/take-brittany"}]},{"id":9969238,"name":"New!
