He eats everything he finds, so you better keep him away from… Well, everything he can fit in his mouth really. Apart from that he´s a really nice guy. Well, I think he´s a guy. If he was a girl, he probably wouldn´t slobber that much. Or at least he´d dry it off.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I hope you´d like to adopt Rob.\r\nHe´s very friendly and rarely bites.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nRob is made of fleece and felt. His measurements are 22cm by 16cm, or 9” by 6”. All details are hand stitched. Guaranteed smoke free.","options":[{"id":1677828,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3476011/-/rob01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3476011/-/rob01.jpg","width":430,"height":573}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":327514,"name":"Softie","permalink":"softie","url":"/category/softie"}]}]
