As the browns, grey, and white of fall and winter near, remind yourself of the colours of summer with one (or more!) of these hand crafted bracelets.\r\n\r\nMade entirely by hand, the ribbons are sewn here in Peterborough by my lovely friend and I then dye the fabric in small batches resulting in variations between each ribbon. Adorned with my hand made glass disc bead \"buttons\", you can be sure that each bracelet is totally unique - just like you! \r\n\r\nFree of any metals, these bracelets are perfect for those with metal sensitivities. And these bracelets truly ARE \"1 size fits all\" as they are fully adjustable; just change where you tie the knot! (video demo on how to put them on is coming soon!).\r\n\r\n** Please be advised that you will receive the same product shown in the photograph, but not the EXACT product shown. Bracelets measure approximately 48in long and wrap around your wrist. To customize the fit for your wrist, simply tie a loop at the end of the ribbon and slip it over the \"button\".**\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/79702539\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/79702539\">SilkWrap Demo</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user22683592\">Annie Scherz</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","options":[{"id":47630415,"name":"asparagus","price":39.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47630418,"name":"beet","price":39.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47630421,"name":"blueberry","price":39.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47630424,"name":"cherry","price":39.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47630427,"name":"raspberry","price":39.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47630430,"name":"squash","price":39.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127205100/-/SLKWRP-Button-Bracelet-Collage-2-wtrmkd.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127205100/-/SLKWRP-Button-Bracelet-Collage-2-wtrmkd.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127205121/-/SLKWRP-Button-Bracelet-Collage-1-wtrmkd.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127205121/-/SLKWRP-Button-Bracelet-Collage-1-wtrmkd.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127576146/-/SLKWRP-Bracelet-Flyer-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127576146/-/SLKWRP-Bracelet-Flyer-1.jpg","width":306,"height":792}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4581554,"name":"Bracelets","permalink":"bracelets","url":"/category/bracelets"},{"id":6154890,"name":"Silk Wrap","permalink":"silk-wrap","url":"/category/silk-wrap"}]},{"id":12438558,"name":"reLuma Silk Donut Necklace","permalink":"reluma-hemp-dina-necklace","position":2,"price":19.0,"default_price":19.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/reluma-hemp-dina-necklace","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-18T12:05:14.000Z","description":"From bottles to beads, this necklace is recycling at its most beautiful form!\r\n\r\nA recycled glass donut is strung delicately on an approximately 18in silk cord.\r\n\r\nActual beads vary depending upon the bottles in stock.
