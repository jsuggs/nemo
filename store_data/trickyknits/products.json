Lace-up corset design allows you to control how much or how little of your tiny subject you want to see. Drawstring opening at the piggies allow them to poke through if you like. \r\n\r\nThe sumptuous color and rich texture of this piece make it a picture-perfect prop for tender newborn photography. The loosely handknit fabric has plenty of stretch. The sweet baby girl in the photos is 3 months old.\r\n\r\nThis style is available in countless colorways - see the Baby Zebra and Raspberries shown in the listing pics.

Due to slight variations in the handspun yarn used as the border, yours may not look exactly like the one above, but it will be equally beautiful! Thank you to talented Amy Columbus for the wonderful photos - http://www.amycolumbusphotography.com/\r\n\r\nFinally! A practical design for photographers looking for a handknit newborn snuggler/pod/egg prop. After hearing numerous complaints from pro photographers that their nifty new Etsy handknit infant pod props they had purchased were stretching out after one use (or wouldn't stay put in the first place), I set out to find a simple solution. The Peek-a-Boo Drawstring Snuggler/Pod features an invisible drawstring tucked under the playful handspun border, allowing you complete control over how much, or how little, of your tiny subject you want to see. No more floppy brims that don't do their job! No more fiddling around with a handknit piece that has no body to it and won't hold its shape! Who has time for fiddling with prop problems during a newborn shoot?\r\n\r\nFor even more versatility, the Peek-a-Boo Drawstring Snuggler/Pod comes with your choice of a 1/2\"-wide satin ribbon in pink, or a matching handspun drawstring (shown). Add a pop of color that suits your needs and wrap up your little angel like a wonderful present. \r\n\r\nHandknit in a soft wool blend and accented with a coordinating texture-rich handspun wool/mohair border. Will fit newborn up to 10 pounds. Twin size also available. Shown in pink, but custom yarn combinations available - convo me and we'll design your signature piece.","options":[{"id":2145821,"name":"Default","price":79.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/4820981/-/peekabooacolumbus2C.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/4820981/-/peekabooacolumbus2C.jpg","width":576,"height":860},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46863081/-/2pic.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46863081/-/2pic.jpg","width":570,"height":855},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46863089/-/2pic2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46863089/-/2pic2.jpg","width":570,"height":398},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46863105/-/2pic3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46863105/-/2pic3.jpg","width":570,"height":713},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46863113/-/2-bookspread.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46863113/-/2-bookspread.jpg","width":570,"height":326}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":405251,"name":"Infant Cocoons/Pods","permalink":"infant-cocoons-pods","url":"/category/infant-cocoons-pods"}]}]
