It's a bold and unusual work that is full of surprises and unexpected twists... even curiously self-effacing - a music of dissolution and dreams. This exquisitely packaged 12\" LP, pressed on clear 180g vinyl, features enigmatic photographs by Elisa Noguera that complement Kinnie The Explorer's uniquely uncanny sound. </i>\r\n\r\n“Impossibly young group who purvey a breezy accomplished shimmer-pop with an ingenious guitar filigree... expansive echo textures... and pleasingly unstable song structures.” <B>The Wire</B>\r\n\r\n“There’s an almost ambient electronica feel to a lot of the more blissful tunes here – but the organic instrumentation approach makes it all the more satisfying to listen to. Plenty to persuade you to get this release...\" <B>Artrocker</B>\r\n\r\n“Kinnie the Explorer demonstrate an admirable lack of interest in contemporary arbiters of cool... An impressively streamlined strain of neo-psych... There is an impressive, starry eyed structural and thematic ambition evident here.” <b>The Skinny</b> \r\n\r\n\"Their mix of atmospheric, layered rhythm and pop sensibilities is catching and impressive.” <b>The 405</b>\r\n\r\n“Something genuinely unusual.” <b>Gilles Peterson's Worldwide Magazine</b>\r\n\r\n\"Veers off in all manner of directions but also has a constant intricate refreshing psychedelic core, that doesn’t keep referring to the past and from which anything is possible.\" <b>DMC World Magazine</b>\r\n\r\n“Possibly the most interesting debut album of the season... manages to sounds like a nightmare and an orgasm at once. There’s a startling fluidity to almost everything here... Reflective, absorbing and endlessly inventive.”  <b>Subbacultcha!</b>\r\n\r\n“A delightful platter of ethereal, psych rock.” <b>The Fly</b>\r\n\r\n\"It’s stuff like this that you just don’t hear often enough... The album simultaneously invites and defeats analysis, but the end result of neo-psychedelic sparkly shoe-gazey grooving just cannot go without commendation; it’s a bloody good effort.\" <b>AAA Music</b>\r\n\r\n\"Sure to get you moving whether it’s in the form of a sway or a head bob. This album is electrically charged... What a trip!\" <b>Indie Shuffle</b>\r\n\r\n\"Fills empty space with fluttering guitar and rhythm, as if it were one unending thought...the cyclical nature of nearly all the tracks leaves you in a meditative state.\" <b>Friends With Both Arms</b>\r\n\r\n\"Fluctuates drastically between cryptic contemplation and simple radiance in matter of moments, managing to hold a consistent thread of gorgeously textured guitarwork and solid basslines throughout... staggeringly good.\" <b>Prefixmag</b>\r\n\r\n“A sound quite unlike any other group in the UK. One of the most atmospheric pop masterpieces you'll hear in 2012.” <b>Crack In The Road</b>\r\n\r\n“Fun, surreal and fantastic.” <b>It's Nice That</b>  \r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1536867&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=false&amp;color=000000\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n </div>","options":[{"id":17467697,"name":"Kinnie The Explorer 12\" Vinyl LP","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16936635,"name":"KTE 12\" Vinyl and Meadow House - Tongue Under A Ton Of Nine Volters","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":17467719,"name":"KTE 12\" Vinyl and Shimmy Rivers And And Canal - Untitled 3 inch CD (3 inch CD)","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":17467701,"name":"KTE 12\" Vinyl and L.

The music is obviously the product of a zero-to-sixty mind with a head full of ideas that are driving him insane (so to speak). In the tradition of other brilliant, uncategorizable home recordists - R. Stevie Moore is an obvious comparison - Wilson, who is still only twenty-one, seems to have listened to and digested every piece of contemporary music in the world, regurgitated it, and somehow incorporated all of it into his work while retaining his own unmistakable style. Like Moore’s work, all of Wilson’s is nominally rock-based, but Wilson is as quintessentially English as Moore is American. (The ghost of Syd Barrett lurks, inevitably, just below the surface on more than one track here, though Meadow House’s music is far more dense and hyperkinetic.) And his oddball-genius pop is about as good as it gets. Wilson, who plays all instruments and sings all vocals, intones his darkly humorous poetry - worth the price of admission alone - over marching metallic percussives, kazoos, unidentifiable ‘Eastern’ stringed instruments, various toys, fake woodwinds, and odd overdubbed voices that cover all bases from Lothar and the Hand People to English music hall to ‘80s disco-pop to surreal antifolk to (of course) Beatles-through-a-shredder. He tackles stream-of-consciousness psychedelia on the lovely ‘Hippy Blankets’ and gleam-in-the-eye, bad-boy mischievousness on the ode to voyeurism, ‘My Window-Cleaning Days Are Over.’ And, inevitably, he breaks down the fourth wall at will, as in ‘Pins and Needles,’ when he interrupts his train of thought to mutter, ‘Let’s get this feedback loop going.’ If there’s any hope at this point of saving rock music from becoming a tiresome, endless nostalgia trip, it’s here. Get it before the hip documentary filmmakers ruin him.\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1539655&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=false&amp;color=000000\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n </div>","options":[{"id":17467919,"name":"Meadow House - Tongue Under A Ton CD - £7.00","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16834099,"name":"Meadow House CD and Kinnie The Explorer 12\" LP","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50969161/-/tongueunder.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50969161/-/tongueunder.jpg","width":350,"height":350}],"artists":[{"id":99545,"name":"Meadow House","permalink":"meadow-house","url":"/artist/meadow-house"}],"categories":[{"id":2732675,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":5230941,"name":"Ron 'Pate's Debonairs feat.

Not only does he wow the listener with his cracked “stripmine” crooning of hoary standards, he baffles you with zany jokes and disarming patter.  The music is uniformly stupendous, ranging from serious composition to puerile industrial din. Lovingly restored with lots of beautiful archival photographs and a text by Craig Nutt (“Ron Pate”). Audibly a work of genius.</i>\r\n\"No other record has ever come as close to realising Alfred Jarry's desire 'to make the soul monstrous' – or even had the vision or invention to try.
