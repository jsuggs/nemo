Balboa follow split releases with Rosetta (Level-Plane) and Aussitot Mort (Forge Again) and bring you their most accomplished chaotic hardcore to date, that would appeal to fans of Majority Rule, Cursed and Young Widows. Plague Sermon have taken half a stride out of their screamo past, and bring forth 15 minutes of at times apocalyptic, and at times frantic, post metal that would appeal to lovers of Boris, Drowning with our Anchors and City of Caterpillar. The vinyl release is beautifully presented with artwork from Richard Forbes-Hamilton, who has taken care of art for ASVA, and limited to 330 copies on Translucent Brown Vinyl.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing\r\n\r\nBoys in the Creeks\r\nMuerto Por Eleccion\r\nBury the Lies\r\nState of Exception\r\nWe are Both Drowning\r\nThe Doves Fly North, The City is Forsaken ","options":[{"id":3938891,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/9828371/-/4x4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/9828371/-/4x4.jpg","width":472,"height":472}],"artists":[{"id":4397,"name":"The Plague Sermon","permalink":"the-plague-sermon","url":"/artist/the-plague-sermon"},{"id":19931,"name":"Balboa","permalink":"balboa","url":"/artist/balboa"}],"categories":[{"id":145553,"name":"12\"s","permalink":"12s","url":"/category/12s"}]},{"id":2705241,"name":"Plague Sermon / Dying in Motion / Heads and Heads / Virginia on Duty - Four Way Split Vinyl","permalink":"plague-sermon-dying-in-motion-heads-and-heads-virginia-on-duty-four-way-split-vinyl","position":2,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/plague-sermon-dying-in-motion-heads-and-heads-virginia-on-duty-four-way-split-vinyl","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-08-17T21:40:23.000Z","description":"A year in the making, here is the horribly overdue split featuring multiple bands from multiple labels in a giant collaborative effort to put out this twelve inch vinyl.

Quite possibly the most important band in the world right now, something that Eugene Robinson, Dan Adams, Greg Davis and Niko Wenner have been Fighting for some 20 years. Veterans of the world they have played all over; Oxbow now bring you 'Lover Ungrateful', a 7\" record containing two of the best songs from the great history of this influential band. From 2002's An Evil Heat (Neurot) is 'Stallkicker' and from 2007's The Narcotic Story (Hydrahead) is 'Frankly Frank', both new recordings, using acoustic instruments only, these are harrowing versions of two classics, that make you feel right next to the band, a place for the brave, but one of the most rewarding on this planet.
