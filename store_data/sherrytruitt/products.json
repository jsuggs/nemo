It began in 1891 as a 1200K race from Paris to Brest and then back to Paris again. \r\n\r\nSince 1931, it's actually been 2 races. The Brevet, which is an individual cycling race held every 4 years, and the audax. This race is held every five years, and cyclists ride in a group. \r\n\r\nTo commmorate this race,I've designed these sterling earrings with vintage travel maps set in sterling bezels, 13mm by 18mm and covered with magnifying doming resin.\r\n\r\nYour earrings will arrive in my signature box shipped worldwide, even if it's not Paris\r\n\r\nThe 3rd photo will show you how the earrings hang.
