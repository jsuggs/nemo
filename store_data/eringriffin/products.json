You got it. This awesome piece measures almost 40\" long. I used brass to build the chain elements and a gorgeous leather for the chain. You can wear it with the larger chain in front or at the nape of your neck, whichever you prefer. You can also double it up with both of the chains in front and it looks stunning. I think it looks best with nothing on but a bathing suit and shades...but that is just me.","options":[{"id":37049232,"name":"Default","price":145.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/115483470/-/IMG_2394.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/115483470/-/IMG_2394.jpg","width":428,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/115483590/-/IMG_2387.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/115483590/-/IMG_2387.jpg","width":638,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/115483710/-/IMG_2391.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/115483710/-/IMG_2391.JPG","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5192391,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]},{"id":11699901,"name":"Nag Champa Chime Earrings","permalink":"nag-champa-chime-earrings","position":22,"price":65.0,"default_price":65.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nag-champa-chime-earrings","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-10T19:56:44.000Z","description":"Making these earrings made me feel transported to yurt in the desert with hand woven afghans on the floor and nag champa smoke filling the room.
