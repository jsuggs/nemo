This means they are pole wrapped which creates both the texture and the dye pattern simultaneously.  The dye and the pleating are steam set. They can be dyed in many wonderful and custom color combinations. On each scarf point I stitch on a crystal bead.\r\n\r\nI call these Chou scarves as they are light and colorful as butterfly wings and a light breeze adds movement as you wear them.  As I was photographing them today they reminded me of octopus swirling in the ocean's current.

The one I have was given to me by a kanoko shibori master which he used to transfer aobana to the cloth through a stencil.  It is handmade and over 100 years old.  \r\n\r\nRecently in Japan I saw some of these brushes being sold in a dye shop and brought back several extras.  They do come in several sizes but this is the size most like the old one I own.  \r\n\r\nSurprisingly, these new ones are very similar to the old ones, even after all these years.  I find them useful when applying dye to arashi poles, in indigo dyeing as well as for transferring aobana to the cloth through a stencil.  The many hairs allow you to work dye into the cloth using a circular motion.  \r\n\r\nPlus, they are just a lovely reminder of the past.\r\n\r\nI was told by one brush seller that you can add some glue to the back (non-working)side of the bristles to keep the hairs from falling out over time.  I notice that some brushes have been treated this way.  Makes sense.  I will try some wood glue on mine.  \r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":37862307,"name":"Default","price":28.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/117907275/-/DSCN0510.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/117907275/-/DSCN0510.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/117907314/-/DSCN0511.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/117907314/-/DSCN0511.jpg","width":1000,"height":666},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/117907350/-/DSCN0512.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/117907350/-/DSCN0512.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4664939,"name":"wonderous objects","permalink":"wonderous-objects","url":"/category/wonderous-objects"}]},{"id":10486024,"name":"more dyeable vintage cloth","permalink":"more-dyeable-vintage-silk","position":13,"price":35.0,"default_price":35.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/more-dyeable-vintage-silk","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-11T16:21:28.000Z","description":"wondering what if? wondering in white?  or maybe even in indigo blue?\r\n\r\ncloth containing texture as a main component, fragments like scattered thoughts across time and place, imperfection seen as perfection.\r\n\r\nthese fabric collections contain an array of all vintage natural fabrics gleaned from here and there and thoughtfully assembled to rework, dye, or simply stitch.

You may wish to alter the texture with a light shot of steam from your iron or remove it completely by ironing flat on a silk steam setting to reveal the lovely shibori dye pattern.\r\n\r\nUse this

is a repeat of the 5 week class that began March 9,2011.\r\n\r\nThis workshop series focuses on shibori techniques for silk using the Colorhue dyes.    That is not to say that you are limited to using silk or this dyeset.  In fact, much of what is covered in this workshop can be applied to other fabrics as well as other dyesets.  It is not about dyes per say but all questions are welcomed.  (My personal experience/expertise is in the areas of acid dyes on silk and indigo on natural fibers so questions using MX or Procion dyes will not be covered-but anything in my area of knowledge is welcome.) I use the Colorhue dyes for demonstration purposes as they are simple, accessible, and non-toxic.  They can be used without the need to set up a whole dye studio but will only work on protein fibers. You can order your materials yourself or use what you have on hand and are comfortable with.  (you can order the colorhue dye at http://www.photoezsilkscreen.com/dyes.htm )\r\n\r\nWe will cover many shibori techniques-itajime, arashi, several stitched techniques, as well as some invented ones! This is a technique class and as such is not project based.  I will be using video that I shot a year ago ( they go with the lesson as it is written and photographed) and have added a few new videos along the way. \r\n\r\nThis class will be hosted on a private blog like forum where you can post your work and interact with other participants. Lessons are pdfs with additional videos. All video links are permanent, you may refer to them any time.\r\n\r\nIn this repeat of this class, all lessons are already posted and you can go in and see what other students created the first time round. You will also have the option of sharing your work online and asking questions on the class blog.   PDF's can be downloaded and printed and the videos can be watched anytime.  This class is internet based so consider your ability to watch internet video and downloading PDF's before signing up. \r\n\r\nSince this is a repeat of this class, no new material will be offered and due to time constraints, I will offer comments and answer questions as I can.  You will receive one email at  the time of signup with your password with instructions and it will be up to you to progress through the lessons on your own.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrerequisites for this class include a sense of wonder and a willingness to get creative and have some fun!","options":[{"id":10949361,"name":"online shibori class","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31196857/-/kumo_forest.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31196857/-/kumo_forest.jpg","width":500,"height":353},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31196745/-/painting_dye.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31196745/-/painting_dye.jpg","width":272,"height":181},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31196945/-/polewrapped_sample.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31196945/-/polewrapped_sample.jpg","width":500,"height":332},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31196777/-/pipe_roller.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31196777/-/pipe_roller.jpg","width":200,"height":132},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31196793/-/kumo_detail-.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31196793/-/kumo_detail-.jpg","width":499,"height":331}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1090881,"name":"online classes","permalink":"online-classes","url":"/category/online-classes"}]},{"id":5195381,"name":"let's dye with indigo!","permalink":"indigo-workshop","position":29,"price":75.0,"default_price":75.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/indigo-workshop","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-01-06T09:02:39.000Z","description":"5 lesson online workshop\r\nongoing...continuing\r\n\r\nReturn to the days of magical thinking, of childlike thinking, of tinkering, wondering, and creating. Together, let's keep a skylike mind and explore the possibilities! Let's dye with indigo!\r\n\r\nThis is a 5 week online exploration of indigo dyeing featuring practical information based on my now 5 year obsession with this blue dyestuff.\r\n\r\nMost of what I know, I know through trial and error and I am still learning. I have kept the same vat going for 5 years now and have experimented  with various other types of vats as well.  I have traveled to Japan to work and learn from an indigo dyer there and took what I learned in that brief time to heart.  If you take this class, be prepared to fall in love...with indigo.\r\n\r\nThe five weeks will look something like this:\r\nweek one\r\n-making and maintaining various types of indigo vats and the differences I have encountered with each. Choosing the type of vat that suits your needs and circumstances. We will start off the class by dyeing a yard of sky fabric- in keeping with my 2012 philosophy of maintaining a \"skylike mind\".\r\nweek two\r\n-itajime patterning with indigo: small and large cloth\r\nweek three\r\nstitched shibori and indigo: tips, design, and learning patience\r\nweek four\r\n-creating cloth for contemporary boro- moons, stars and other techniques\r\nweek five\r\n-ombre dyeing with indigo and combining this with other techniques for stunning and unusual results.\r\n \r\nthere will be some surprises along the way! \r\n\r\nMaterials:\r\n\r\nmaterials will consist of basic ingredients for the type of indigo vat you choose to work with, various natural fabrics you wish to use, as well as basic dye and shibori equipment/materials. Upon signing up for the workshop you will gain access to the blog by registering for a free WordPress username (you may already have one) where Lesson One will discuss and help you choose the type(s) of vats you want to work with and the materials needed.  If needed, help accessing a WordPress username will be provided. \r\n\r\nClass includes audio, video, PDFs, and blog hosted workshop.  Please consider your ability to access these aspects of the class and your internet speed.  (Some who have slower access may need to let video load first before watching.) \r\n\r\nThe workshop  is hosted on a private WordPress blog like with a separate attached student forum where you can post your work and interact with other participants. Lessons include PDFs, videos and audio. All video links are permanent, you may refer to them any time.\r\n\r\nPrerequisites for this class include a sense of wonder and a willingness to get creative and fall in love...with indigo!\r\n\r\nAllow 24 hours from time of purchase to be added to the workshop.\r\n\r\nContinuing posts will be focused on the fermentation vat ans growing and composting indigo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":16847129,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/51017721/-/moon_in_vat.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/51017721/-/moon_in_vat.jpg","width":747,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/51017921/-/DSC_0063.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/51017921/-/DSC_0063.jpg","width":1000,"height":700},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/51017937/-/indigo_dragonflies.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/51017937/-/indigo_dragonflies.jpg","width":996,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/51017905/-/crescent_moon.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/51017905/-/crescent_moon.jpg","width":747,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/51017887/-/a_little_itajime.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/51017887/-/a_little_itajime.jpg","width":665,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2470889,"name":"newly added!","permalink":"newly-added","url":"/category/newly-added"},{"id":1090811,"name":"indigo and other naturally dyed cloth and thread","permalink":"indigo-and-other-naturally-dyed-cloth-and-thread","url":"/category/indigo-and-other-naturally-dyed-cloth-and-thread"},{"id":1090881,"name":"online classes","permalink":"online-classes","url":"/category/online-classes"}]},{"id":8303184,"name":"the daily dyer","permalink":"the-daily-dyer","position":30,"price":95.0,"default_price":95.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-daily-dyer","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-01T01:49:06.000Z","description":"This is a subscription to my new site, the daily dyer-a daily visit into my dye studio.

can talk about it or we can do it. We can mend and repair or we can throw away and buy brand new. \r\n\r\nYou may have bought them new or found them in a second hand shop. They may have been given as a gift or handed down. \r\n\r\nThey have been worn and through the wearing they have become comfortable in all the right places. They still fit. \r\n\r\nBut, they are worn and have a few holes. And, in some places the fabric has thinned. \r\n\r\nThe great abundance of things at our fingertips temps us to forget the value of caring for the things that we do have and the way we can make more of that which we already have in our possession. \r\n\r\nYou might want to send them off (washed first, please) to have them mended in the spirit of the of the Japanese of the Tohoku region who struggled to make ends meet and through that struggle made life more alive by making and using every last bit of the necessities in their lives. \r\nIn doing this, though they could not see into the future, they left us with their beautiful boro-tattered rags. They gave meaning to this mending through the layers of cloth and the stitch work they applied.    In these times, we can be reminded of the precious qualities of life and the necessities of things like clothing and feeding ourselves and taking better care.\r\n\r\nHere is what I offer: one hour of my time to stitch and repair your pair of loveworn jeans using a variety of my own indigo hand dyed scraps and threads and a piece or two of my own boro scraps collected in Japan.  I will decide how and where to stitch, and return them to you via priority mail-insured.  Upon purchasing this service, I will email you the shipping address.  \r\n\r\nIf you want to mend them yourself, you may want to purchase the option “mending kit” which includes 6 various indigo patches and the thread to stitch with plus a needle.  All  you will need is a quiet moment and a pair of scissors.\r\n\r\n(I just added a \"double\" mending kit for an extra $5.  folks were asking for enough to cover their own buttons or do a bit of \"letting out\" on their favorite jeans)\r\nsee last couple of new photos added...\r\n\r\n~all fabrics and threads are recycled and dyed in my own natural fermentation indigo vat. (aside from the Japanese boro scraps). \r\n\r\n(note- if your jeans need two hours worth of mending simply purchase two)\r\n\r\nContinental US only. Please allow 2 weeks for mending.\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":20915499,"name":"mending of loveworn jeans","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":20915501,"name":"indigo mending kit only","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":37564047,"name":"double mending kit","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64627845/-/Image_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64627845/-/Image_2.jpg","width":747,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64627837/-/Image_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64627837/-/Image_1.jpg","width":747,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64634957/-/mending_kit.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64634957/-/mending_kit.JPG","width":1000,"height":747},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116985510/-/buttons.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116985510/-/buttons.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116985582/-/indigo_kit.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116985582/-/indigo_kit.JPG","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1090811,"name":"indigo and other naturally dyed cloth and thread","permalink":"indigo-and-other-naturally-dyed-cloth-and-thread","url":"/category/indigo-and-other-naturally-dyed-cloth-and-thread"},{"id":3399737,"name":"mending","permalink":"mending","url":"/category/mending"}]},{"id":6491913,"name":"Silk Shibori Pocket Square","permalink":"silk-shibori-pocket-square","position":45,"price":48.0,"default_price":48.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/silk-shibori-pocket-square","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-19T21:40:09.000Z","description":"The word charmeuse comes from the French verb \"charmeur\" which means \"charming\".

neighborhood on warm summer nights, the rhythms of the seas and tides, the inky metallic color of a working indigo vat...to name a few.\r\na trip last year to Japan where i had the privilege of working under a master indigo dyer not only taught me patience and respect for the materials and process but also inspired some new thinking about shibori in general.  \r\nthe moons represent the passage of time- i am now 17 blue moons young! i often work in my outdoor studio into the night watching the moon rise overhead.  i look up and wonder if Sato sensei is working under the same moon...\r\n\r\nthere are never any two moons alike. each moon undergoes many dips into the indigo vat-each dip adding a layer of intention. as i wait for the indigo to oxidize, i look and contemplate my next step.\r\nthe moons are dyed on various scrap and vintage cloth collected and given to me from friends-cottons,linens,silks-fine scraps from clothing,table linens, & textile collectors. i love discovering the many varied ways in which the indigo friends each fabric.\r\n\r\nif ordered alone, these will be sent first class mail without tracking-otherwise feel free to add them to any order

cycle. \r\n\r\ni wondered how that might look...\r\n\r\nthe color is due to light refracting from dust in the earth's atmosphere and can vary in intensity.  \r\n\r\ni've used some old kimono silk from

Each scarf is hand dyed by me in my California studio using the arashi (pole wrapped) method. Pleats and dyes are steam set.\r\n\r\nTo wear, first wrap around the neck and tie a loose overhand knot. Next, pick up a pinch of fabric from the edge of each side of scarf and tie a second overhand knot with just that pinch of fabric and pull up snugly against the first knot.  Each time you tie it it will form a unique and beautiful sculptural shape. \r\n\r\nI have added a download to this item that gives you a link to a youtube video I made demonstrating the tying of this piece.
