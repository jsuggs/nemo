The band’s latest and most definitive EP ‘Lights’ hit the UK in June 2011. The record shows a clear progression for the band with relentless hooks and crushing chord progressions yet still retaining the heavy and metallic spine of Our People Versus Yours. ‘Lights’ has received widespread critical claim and in the short time since it has been released, standout track ‘Ariha’ has seen air time on Kerrang and other UK FM radio stations. As the young outfit head into 2012, they will continue the endless touring that has seen the band play almost every corner of the UK. With new material and releases scheduled for early next year, Our People Versus Yours will be hard to miss.\r\n“Kicking, screaming, fuming and flailing straight out of Essex come fresh-faced five-piece, Our People Versus Yours… their stock in trade being pent-up, pissed-off fury set free by guitars and drums being pummelled into submission. There’s a bit of low-slung groove on ‘I’ve had Better Days’ and the occasional technical turn and flourish elsewhere but when this mob really let rip and just rage, it’s hard not to get swept up in all of their power and passion. KKKK” – Kerrang!\r\n“This five piece certainly have fire in their bellies and passion in their hearts. With powerful delivery and a sound that’s as progressive, technical and melody-infused as it is straight-out rage, there’s a lot more to these guys than you might at first expect. This EP is full of pleasing twists and turns that will grab you by the throat then shimmy away. The highlights include blistering ‘In Utiny’ and the thundering title track. 4/5” - Big Cheese\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x2F_Proecc\r\nhttp://ourpeopleversusyours.bandcamp.com\r\nLOCAL SUPPORT FROM.\r\n\r\nDISGUISE YOUR BEAUTY  - http://disguiseyourbeauty.bandcamp.com/\r\n\r\n\r\nI SAID GOOD DAY - http://www.reverbnation.com/isaidgoodday?page_view_source=facebook_app\r\n\r\nCOLD FACT - http://coldfact.bandcamp.com/album/demo-2013\r\n\r\nVENUE- 13TH Note Café\r\nDATE – FRIDAY  7TH February\r\nDOORS – 8.30PM\r\nTICKETS - £5 from supports and ticket link\r\nAGE RESTRICTION – Over 18s\r\n","options":[{"id":50868837,"name":"Default","price":3.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129587163/-/OPVY_copy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129587163/-/OPVY_copy.jpg","width":3508,"height":4961}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3821117,"name":"Tickets","permalink":"tickets","url":"/category/tickets"}]}]
