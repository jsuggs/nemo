But this beauty certainly isn't ordinary. Very striking vegetable for your plot. Nice flavour, a bit nutty. Fractal-icious!\r\n\r\nHeavy-feeder so have your beds well-prepared, but this plant doesn't like an oversupply of nitrogen. Start seeds in trays and plant mature seedlings at 45cm intervals. Do harvest before the heads start flowering.\r\n\r\n<b>Seed type:</b> Heirloom \r\n<b>Seeds per packet:</b> approx 200 \r\n<b>Days to germination:</b> 7-10 days \r\n<b>Days to harvest:</b> 90 days","options":[{"id":18116021,"name":"Default","price":3.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.7,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55377603/-/BroccoliDSC04681.resized.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55377603/-/BroccoliDSC04681.resized.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55377587/-/BrocDSC02799.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55377587/-/BrocDSC02799.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55377619/-/BroccDSC02550.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55377619/-/BroccDSC02550.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2977755,"name":"Vegetables","permalink":"vegetables","url":"/category/vegetables"}]},{"id":5634477,"name":"Beetroot – Bull's blood ","permalink":"beetroot-bull-s-blood","position":50,"price":3.5,"default_price":3.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/beetroot-bull-s-blood","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-03-07T05:51:28.000Z","description":"<i>Beta vulgaris var crassa</i>\r\n\r\nAn old variety that dates back to before 1900, the beautiful bull's blood beetroot brings everything alive. There are just so many wonderful things to say about this plant – we could talk about the striking good looks (metallic, burgundy leaves give a great contrast to your winter greens), or the sweet tasty leaves (that you can eat as microgreens), or the tasty candy-striped root. One might even mention how great it is as a natural food colourant. But all of this just really means one thing – you need this in your garden!\r\n\r\nSoak your seeds overnight before sowing directly where you want them to grow, as they transplant badly. Full sun to partial shade.

The darling of Italian cooking, and one of the oldest borlotti bean varieites, the 'lingua di fuoco' (tongue of fire) bean is multi-purpose – stringless snap or a delicious shelling bean. The real beauty lies in keeping these lovelies for shelling. 14 cm long dangling jewels of red and yellow splashed pods contain 4-6 red flecked beans with a delicious creamy flavour. Give shelled beans a quick boil and lick of olive oil. Make an excellent dried bean if you have any leftover. Height 50-60cm. \r\n\r\nThese beans thrive in warmth. They love plenty of organic matter dug in and you will be rewarded with heavy cropping after several feeds once the flowers appear. Borlottis will be drought tolerant, but good watering after flowering will ensure best pod development.\r\n\r\n<b>Seed type:</b> Heirloom \r\n<b>Seeds per packet:</b> 50 \r\n<b>Days to germination:</b> 6-9 days \r\n<b>Days to harvest:</b> From 60 days","options":[{"id":18115909,"name":"Default","price":3.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55378939/-/BeanDSC01861.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55378939/-/BeanDSC01861.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55378961/-/Beandsc03487.resized.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55378961/-/Beandsc03487.resized.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55378971/-/Beandsc03483.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55378971/-/Beandsc03483.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2977755,"name":"Vegetables","permalink":"vegetables","url":"/category/vegetables"}]}]
