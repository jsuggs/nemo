He was influential in the field of post-colonial studies and was perhaps the pre-eminent thinker of the 20th century on the issue of decolonization and the psychopathology of colonization. His works have inspired anti-colonial liberation movements for more than four decades.\r\n\r\nFrantz Fanon was born on the Caribbean island of Martinique, which was then a French colony and is now a French departement. He was born into a mixed family background: his father was the descendant of African slaves, and his mother was said to be an illegitimate child of mixed race, whose white ancestors came from Strasbourg in Alsace. Fanon's family was socioeconomically middle-class, and they could afford the fees for the Lycée Schoelcher, then the most prestigious high school in Martinique, where famed poet Aimé Césaire was one of his teachers.\r\n\r\nAfter France fell to the Nazis in 1940, Vichy French naval troops were blockaded on Martinique.  Many accusations of harassment and sexual misconduct arose. The abuse of the Martiniquan people by the French Army was a major influence on Fanon, as it reinforced his feelings of alienation and his disgust at the realities of colonial racism. At the age of eighteen, Fanon fled the island as a \"dissident\" (the coined word for French West Indians joining the gaullist forces) and traveled to then-British colony Dominica to join the Free French Forces. He later enlisted in the French army and joined an Allied convoy that arrived in Casablanca. He was later transferred to an army base at Bejaia on the Kabyle coast of Algeria. Fanon left Algeria from Oran and saw service in France, notably in the battles of Alsace. In 1944 he was wounded at Colmar and received the Croix de Guerre medal. When the Nazis were defeated and Allied forces crossed the Rhine into Germany, along with photo journalists, Fanon's regiment was \"bleached\" of all non-white soldiers and Fanon and his fellow Caribbean soldiers were sent to Toulon (Provence) instead.[citation needed] Later, they were transferred to Normandy to await repatriation home.\r\n\r\nIn 1945 Fanon returned to Martinique. His return lasted only a short time. While there, he worked for the parliamentary campaign of his friend and mentor Aimé Césaire, who would be the greatest influence in his life. Although Fanon never professed to be a communist[citation needed], Césaire ran on the communist ticket as a parliamentary delegate from Martinique to the first National Assembly of the Fourth Republic. Fanon stayed long enough to complete his Baccalaureate and then went to France where he studied medicine and psychiatry. He was educated in Lyon where he also studied literature, drama and philosophy, sometimes attending Merleau-Ponty's lectures. During this period he wrote three plays, whose manuscripts are now lost. After qualifying as a psychiatrist in 1951, Fanon did a residency in psychiatry at Saint-Alban under the radical Catalan psychiatrist Francois Tosquelles, who invigorated Fanon's thinking by emphasizing the important yet often overlooked role of culture in psychopathology. After his residency, Fanon practiced psychiatry at Pontorson, near Mont St Michel, for another year and then (from 1953) in Algeria. He was chef de service at the Blida-Joinville Psychiatric Hospital in Algeria, where he stayed until his deportation in January 1957.\r\n\r\nHis service in France's army (and his experiences in Martinique) fueled Black Skin, White Masks. For Fanon, being colonized by a language had larger implications for one's political consciousness: \"To speak . . . means above all to assume a culture, to support the weight of a civilization\" (BSWM 17-18). Speaking French means that one accepts, or is coerced into accepting, the collective consciousness of the French.","options":[{"id":47962131,"name":"17 Inch x11 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47962134,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/10584981/-/Frantz_Fanon_original.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/10584981/-/Frantz_Fanon_original.png","width":600,"height":927},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50319067/-/Black_Franz_Fanon_Street_poster_Tano_Design_.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50319067/-/Black_Franz_Fanon_Street_poster_Tano_Design_.png","width":705,"height":460},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50308099/-/Frantz_Fanon_Design_Street_Poster.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50308099/-/Frantz_Fanon_Design_Street_Poster.png","width":700,"height":504}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":1016221,"name":"Limited Edition Tribute Nelson Mandela Poster","permalink":"mandela","position":2,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mandela","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-12-20T14:37:50.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n\r\nFirst Mandela TV Interview\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/fPofm50MHW8?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/fPofm50MHW8?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n\r\nAll TANO Design posters are printed on high-gloss satin finish 10 mil paper. \r\n\r\nNelson Rolihlahla Mandela (Xhosa pronunciation: [xoˈliɬaɬa manˈdeːla]; born 18 July 1918) is a former President of South Africa, the first to be elected in a fully representative democratic election, who held office from 1994 to 1999. Before his presidency, Mandela was an anti-apartheid activist, and the leader of the African National Congress's armed wing Umkhonto we Sizwe. The South African courts convicted him on charges of sabotage, as well as other crimes committed while he led the movement against apartheid. In accordance with his conviction, Mandela served 27 years in prison, spending many of these years on Robben Island. Following his release from prison on 11 February 1990, Mandela supported reconciliation and negotiation, and helped lead the transition towards multi-racial democracy in South Africa.\r\n\r\nSince the end of apartheid, many have frequently praised Mandela, including former opponents. In South Africa he is often known as Madiba, an honorary title adopted by elders of Mandela's clan. The title has come to be synonymous with Nelson Mandela.","options":[{"id":3800941,"name":"Red Yellow Blue 17 Inch x11 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48374835,"name":"Red Yellow Green Mandela 17 Inch x11 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16647069,"name":"Red Yellow Blue 20 Inch x 30 Inch","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":48374838,"name":"Red Yellow Green Mandela 20 Inch x 30 Inch","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50361675/-/Tano_Blue_Nelson_Mandela_Poster_Tano_Design__copy.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50361675/-/Tano_Blue_Nelson_Mandela_Poster_Tano_Design__copy.png","width":600,"height":943},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127773879/-/web_Nelson_Mandela_Poster_Tano_Design_2014.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127773879/-/web_Nelson_Mandela_Poster_Tano_Design_2014.png","width":700,"height":1100},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50361715/-/Mandela_Poster_Tano_Design_Wall.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50361715/-/Mandela_Poster_Tano_Design_Wall.png","width":700,"height":462},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50361691/-/Mandela_Poster_Tano_Design_Wall3.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50361691/-/Mandela_Poster_Tano_Design_Wall3.png","width":700,"height":504}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":6228029,"name":"Tribute to Ray Charles Poster","permalink":"tribute-to-ray-charles-poster","position":3,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tribute-to-ray-charles-poster","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-05-19T02:59:25.000Z","description":"<iframe width=\"300\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/gOWKbPDRdKw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\nThe name Ray Charles is on a Star on Hollywood Boulevard’s Walk of Fame. The name Ray Charles designates a superstar worldwide. His bronze bust is enshrined in the Playboy Jazz Hall of Fame. There is the bronze medallion that was cast and presented to him by the French Republic on behalf of the French people. In just about every Hall of Fame that has anything to do with music, be it Rhythm & Blues, Jazz, Rock & Roll, Gospel or Country & Western, Ray’s name is very prominently displayed. There are many awards given to him in the foregoing categories as proof.\r\n\r\nProbably the strongest element in Ray Charles’ life, and the most concentrated driving force, was music. Ray often said, “I was born with music inside me. That’s the only explanation I know.”\r\n\r\nRay Charles was not born blind. In fact, it took almost seven years for him to lose his sight in its entirety, which means he had seven years to see the joy and sadness of this big wonderful world – a world he would never see again. As a seven year old child, in searching for light, he stared at the sun continuously, thereby eliminating all chances of the modern-day miracle, cornea transplants – a surgery unheard of in 1937.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reason that Ray Charles made music his mistress and fell madly in love with the lady is that music was a natural to him. Ray sat at a piano and the music began; he opened his mouth and the lyrics began. He was in absolute control.\r\n\r\nBut the rest of his life was not quite so simple. Ray was born at the very beginning of the Great Depression – a depression that affected every civilized country in the world. Ray was born in 1930 in Albany, Georgia, the same year that another Georgia native by the name of Hoagy Carmichael, was already making his mark on the world. In 1930, the year of Ray’s birth, Hoagy recorded a song that became an all-time classic and remains so to this day; a song titled “Stardust.” It’s ironic that these two Georgia natives would someday cross paths again, as they did 30 years later when Ray Charles was asked by the State of Georgia to perform, in the Georgia Legislative Chambers, the song they had selected as their state song. That song was Ray’s version of “Georgia,” written by Hoagy Carmichael. Hoagy, who unfortunately was too ill to attend the event, was listening via telephone/satellite tie-up.\r\n\r\nRay’s mother and father, Aretha and Bailey, were “no-nonsense” parents. Even after Ray lost his sight, his mother continued to give him chores at home, in the rural area in which they lived, such as chopping wood for the wood burning stove in the kitchen in order for them to prepare their meals. Chores such as this often brought complaints from the neighbors, which were met with stern words from Mrs. Robinson. She told them her son was blind, not stupid, and he must continue to learn to do things, not only for himself, but for others as well. Unfortunately, Ray lost the guidance of his mother and the counseling of his father at a very young age. At 15 years old, Ray Charles was an orphan, but he still managed to make his way in this world under very trying conditions; living in the South and being of African-American heritage, plus being blind and an orphan.\r\n\r\nRay refused to roll over and play dead. Instead he continued his education in St. Augustine, at Florida’s State School for the Deaf and Blind. A few years later, Ray decided to move. His choice was Seattle, Washington. It was in Seattle that Ray recorded his first record. It was also in Seattle that the seed was planted for a lifelong friendship with Quincy Jones.\r\n\r\nIn the decades since Seattle, Ray Charles made his contributions to the many facets of music in which he excelled. His awards are too numerous to mention all of them, but we would like to acknowledge eight honorary doctoral degrees, seventeen Grammys, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, President’s Merit Award and his Playboy Jazz Awards. He has been recognized repeatedly by Heads of State, Presidents, Premieres, Political Dignitaries and members of Royal families. He was chosen, by the King and Queen of Sweden, to receive the Polar Music Award, which is that country’s most prestigious award and is, recognized the world over. Rolling Stone Magazine ranked him #10 on their list of the “100 Greatest Artists of All Time” and #2 on their list of the “100 Greatest Singers of All Time.”\r\n\r\nRay Charles died at 73 years old on June 10, 2004, two months before the release of his final album “Genius Loves Company”, which sold over 5 million copies earning 8 Grammys, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year and 4 months before the release of his Academy Award winning feature film Ray, portraying his life and career. Not only was the film critically acclaimed, but it earned more than $125 million worldwide and landed Jamie Foxx an Academy Award for Best Actor.  Ray remains the most critically acclaimed musical bio-pic because of the manner in which it told the story of one of America’s greatest entertainers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, Mr. Charles created what is now known as The Ray Charles Foundation which is dedicated to providing support in the area of hearing disorders and the empowerment of young people through education by offering support to educational institutions and non-profit education programs. The vision of The Ray Charles Foundation is to instill in the youth of America that “there is no challenge too great one cannot overcome.”\r\n\r\nOn the 80th Birthday of Ray Charles the Memorial Library was opened to share his legacy and to encourage and inspire are youth to embrace their creativity and stimulate their imagination.","options":[{"id":47961393,"name":"17 Inch x11 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47961396,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61151821/-/Store_Ray_Charles_tano_design_Pink_Poster.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61151821/-/Store_Ray_Charles_tano_design_Pink_Poster.png","width":525,"height":825},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61195261/-/Ray_Charles_poster_tano_design.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61195261/-/Ray_Charles_poster_tano_design.png","width":701,"height":446}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":4730745,"name":"Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Tribute Poster","permalink":"dr-martin-luther-king-jr-tribute-poster","position":4,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dr-martin-luther-king-jr-tribute-poster","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-10-28T23:46:34.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"300\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/aL4FOvIf7G8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968) was an American clergyman, activist, and prominent leader in the African-American Civil Rights Movement. He is best known for being an iconic figure in the advancement of civil rights in the United States and around the world, using nonviolent methods following the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi. King has become a national icon in the history of modern American liberalism.\r\n\r\nA Baptist minister, King became a civil rights activist early in his career. He led the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott and helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 1957, serving as its first president. King's efforts led to the 1963 March on Washington, where King delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech. There, he expanded American values to include the vision of a color blind society, and established his reputation as one of the greatest orators in American history.\r\n\r\nIn 1964, King became the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his work to end racial segregation and racial discrimination through civil disobedience and other nonviolent means. By the time of his death in 1968, he had refocused his efforts on ending poverty and stopping the Vietnam War.\r\n\r\nKing was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. He was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and Congressional Gold Medal in 2004; Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was established as a U.S. federal holiday in 1986.","options":[{"id":47962209,"name":"17 Inch x11 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47962212,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47191615/-/Tano_Martin_Luther_King_MLK_poster.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47191615/-/Tano_Martin_Luther_King_MLK_poster.png","width":460,"height":711},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50306067/-/MLK_Street_poster_Tano_Design_.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50306067/-/MLK_Street_poster_Tano_Design_.png","width":705,"height":460}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":2798358,"name":"Tribute Barack Obama Poster","permalink":"obama-tribute-poster","position":5,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/obama-tribute-poster","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-10-13T06:21:11.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBarack Hussein Obama born August 4, 1961,is the 44th and current President of the United States. He is the first African American to hold the office. Obama previously served as a United States Senator from Illinois, from January 2005 until he resigned after his election to the presidency in November 2008.\r\n\r\nA native of Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he was the president of the Harvard Law Review. He was a community organizer in Chicago before earning his law degree. He worked as a civil rights attorney in Chicago and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004.\r\n\r\nObama served three terms in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004. Following an unsuccessful bid against a Democratic incumbent for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000, he ran for United States Senate in 2004. Several events brought him to national attention during the campaign, including his victory in the March 2004 Democratic primary and his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in July 2004. He won election to the U.S. Senate in November 2004. His presidential campaign began in February 2007, and after a close campaign in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries against Hillary Rodham Clinton, he won his party's nomination. In the 2008 general election, he defeated Republican nominee John McCain and was inaugurated as president on January 20, 2009.\r\n\r\nAs president, Obama signed economic stimulus legislation in the form of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in February 2009. Other domestic policy initiatives include the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a major piece of health care reform legislation which he signed into law in March 2010, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which forms part of his financial regulatory reform efforts, which he signed in July 2010. In foreign policy, Obama gradually withdrew combat troops from Iraq, increased troop levels in Afghanistan, and signed an arms control treaty with Russia.

His death in police detention in 1977 led to his being hailed as a martyr of the anti-Apartheid struggle.\r\n\r\nDate of birth: 18 December 1946, King William's Town, Eastern Cape, South Africa\r\nDate of death: 12 September 1977, Pretoria prison cell, South Africa\r\n\r\nAn Early Life\r\nFrom an early age Steve Biko showed an interest in anti-Apartheid politics. After being expelled from his first school, Lovedale, in the Eastern Cape for 'anti-establishment' behavior, he was transferred to a Roman Catholic boarding school in Natal. From there he enrolled as a student at the University of Natal Medical School (in the university's Black Section). Whilst at medical school Biko became involved with the National Union of South African Students (NUSAS). But the union was dominated by white liberals and failed to represent the needs of black students, so Biko resigned in 1969 and founded the South African Students' Organisation (SASO). SASO was involved in providing legal aid and medical clinics, as well as helping to develop cottage industries for disadvantaged black communities.\r\n\r\nBiko and Black Consciousness\r\nIn 1972 Biko was one of the founders of the Black Peoples Convention (BPC) working on social upliftment projects around Durban. The BPC effectively brought together roughly 70 different black consciousness groups and associations, such as the South African Student's Movement (SASM), which played a significant role in the 1976 uprisings, the National Association of Youth Organisations, and the Black Workers Project which supported black workers whose unions were not recognized under the Apartheid regime. Biko was elected as the first president of the BPC and was promptly expelled from medical school. He started working full time for the Black Community Programme (BCP) in Durban which he also helped found.\r\n\r\nBanned by the Apartheid Regime\r\nIn 1973 Steve Biko was 'banned' by the Apartheid government. Under the 'ban' Biko was restricted to his home town of Kings William's Town in the Eastern Cape – he could no longer support the BCP in Durban, but was able to continue working for the BPC – he helped set up the Zimele Trust Fund which assisted political prisoners and their families. (Biko was elected Honorary President of the BPC in January 1977.)\r\n\r\nBiko Dies in Detention\r\nBiko was detained and interrogated four times between August 1975 and September 1977 under Apartheid era anti-terrorism legislation. On 21 August 1977 Biko was detained by the Eastern Cape security police and held in Port Elizabeth. From the Walmer police cells he was taken for interrogation at the security police headquarters. On 7 September \"Biko sustained a head injury during interrogation, after which he acted strangely and was uncooperative. The doctors who examined him (naked, lying on a mat and manacled to a metal grille) initially disregarded overt signs of neurological injury.\"1\r\n\r\nBy 11 September Biko had slipped into a continual, semi-conscious state and the police physician recommended a transfer to hospital. Biko was, however, transported 1,200 km to Pretoria – a 12-hour journey which he made lying naked in the back of a Land Rover. A few hours later, on 12 September, alone and still naked, lying on the floor of a cell in the Pretoria Central Prison, Biko died from brain damage.\r\n\r\nThe Apartheid Government's Response\r\nThe South African Minister of Justice, James (Jimmy) Kruger initially suggested Biko had died of a hunger-strike and said that his death \"left him cold\". The hunger strike story was dropped after local and international media pressure, especially from Donald Woods, the editor of the East London Daily Dispatch. It was revealed in the inquest that Biko had died of brain damage, but the magistrate failed to find anyone responsible, ruling that Biko had died as a result of injuries sustained during a scuffle with security police whilst in detention.\r\n\r\nAn Anti-Apartheid Martyr\r\nThe brutal circumstances of Biko's death caused a worldwide outcry and he became a martyr and symbol of black resistance to the oppressive Apartheid regime. As a result, the South African government banned a number of individuals (including Donald Woods) and organizations, especially those Black Consciousness groups closely associated with Biko. The United Nations Security Council responded by finally imposing an arms embargo against South Africa.\r\n\r\nBiko's family sued the state for damages in 1979 and settled out of court for R65,000 (then equivalent to $25,000).\r\n\r\nThe three doctors connected with Biko's case were initially exonerated by the South African Medical Disciplinary Committee. It was not until a second enquiry in 1985, eight years after Biko's death, that any action was taken against them. The police officers responsible for Biko's death applied for amnesty during the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings which sat in Port Elizabeth in 1997. The Biko family did not ask the Commission to make a finding on his death.\r\n\r\n\"The Commission finds that the death in detention of Mr Stephen Bantu Biko on 12 September 1977 was a gross human rights violation. Magistrate Marthinus Prins found that the members of the SAP were not implicated in his death. The magistrate's finding contributed to the creation of a culture of impunity in the SAP. Despite the inquest finding no person responsible for his death, the Commission finds that, in view of the fact that Biko died in the custody of law enforcement officials, the probabilities are that he died as a result of injuries sustained during his detention.\"1\r\n\r\n1.

The heir to a dynasty that traced its origins to the 13th century, and from there by tradition back to King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, Haile Selassie is a defining figure in both Ethiopian and African history.\r\n\r\nAt the League of Nations in 1936, the Emperor condemned the use of chemical weapons by Italy against his people. His internationalist views led to Ethiopia becoming a charter member of the United Nations, and his political thought and experience in promoting multilateralism and collective security have proved seminal and enduring. His suppression of rebellions among the nobles (mekwannint), as well as what some perceived to be Ethiopia's failure to modernize adequately, earned him criticism among some contemporaries and historians.\r\n\r\nHaile Selassie is revered as the religious symbol for God incarnate among the Rastafari movement, the number of followers is estimated between 200,000 and 800,000. Begun in Jamaica in the 1930s, the Rastafarian movement perceives Haile Selassie as a messianic figure who will lead the peoples of Africa and the African diaspora to a golden age of peace, righteousness, and prosperity.\r\n","options":[{"id":14583005,"name":"17 Inch x11 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14583007,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50435281/-/Web_haile_Selassie_Tano_Design_Poster.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50435281/-/Web_haile_Selassie_Tano_Design_Poster.png","width":300,"height":472},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50434433/-/Haile_Selassie_Poster_by_Tano_Design.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50434433/-/Haile_Selassie_Poster_by_Tano_Design.png","width":705,"height":471},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50434625/-/Haile_Selassie_Poster_1_by_Tano_Design_copy.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50434625/-/Haile_Selassie_Poster_1_by_Tano_Design_copy.png","width":504,"height":329},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50434425/-/Haile_Selassie_Poster_3_by_Tano_Design.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50434425/-/Haile_Selassie_Poster_3_by_Tano_Design.png","width":697,"height":461}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":6247277,"name":"Tribute Miles Davis Poster - Master of Cool","permalink":"tribute-miles-davis-poster","position":8,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tribute-miles-davis-poster","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-05-21T23:00:30.000Z","description":"<iframe width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/pBpLKm8vw4M\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\nMiles Davis, (May 26, 1926 – September 28, 1991) was an American jazz musician, trumpeter, bandleader, and composer. Widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century.Miles Davis was, with his musical groups, at the forefront of several major developments in jazz music, including bebop, cool jazz, hard bop, modal jazz, and jazz fusion.\r\n\r\nMiles Dewey Davis was born on May 26, 1926, to an affluent African American family in Alton, Illinois. His father, Dr. Miles Henry Davis, was a dentist. In 1927 the family moved to East St. Louis, Illinois. They also owned a substantial ranch in northern Arkansas, where Davis learned to ride horses as a boy.\r\n\r\nDavis' mother, Cleota Mae (Henry) Davis, wanted her son to learn the piano; she was a capable blues pianist but kept this fact hidden from her son. His musical studies began at 13, when his father gave him a trumpet and arranged lessons with local musician Elwood Buchanan. Davis later suggested that his father's instrument choice was made largely to irk his wife, who disliked the trumpet's sound. Against the fashion of the time, Buchanan stressed the importance of playing without vibrato; he was reported to have slapped Davis' knuckles every time he started using heavy vibrato. Davis would carry his clear signature tone throughout his career. He once remarked on its importance to him, saying, \"I prefer a round sound with no attitude in it, like a round voice with not too much tremolo and not too much bass. Just right in the middle. If I can’t get that sound I can’t play anything.\r\n\r\nFor nearly six decades, Miles Davis has embodied all that is cool – in his music (and most especially jazz), in his art, fashion, romance, and in his international, if not intergalactic, presence that looms strong as ever today.  2006 – The year in which Miles Davis was inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame on March 13th – is a land­mark year, commemorating the 80th anniversary of his birth on May 26, 1926, and the 15th anniversary of his death on September 28, 1991.  In between those two markers is more than a half-century of brilliance – often exasperating, brutally honest with himself and to others, uncompromising in a way that transcended mere intuition. \r\n\r\n            In carrying out what always seemed like a mission, Miles Dewey Davis III – musician, composer, arranger, producer, and band leader – was always in the right place at the right time, another defining aspect of cool.  Born in Alton, Illinois, and raised in East St. Louis, where his father was a dentist, Miles was given his first trumpet at age 13.  A child prodigy, his mastery of the instrument accelerated as he came under the spell of older jazzmen Clark Terry, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Billy Eckstine, and others who passed through.  He accepted admission to the Juilliard School in 1944, but it was a ruse to get to New York and hook up with Bird and Diz.  Miles was 18.  Cool.\r\n\r\n            Within a year, he accomplished his goal.  He can be heard on sessions led by Parker that were released on Savoy in 1945 (with Max Roach), ’46 (with Bud Powell), ’47 (with Duke Jordan and J.J. Johnson), and ’48 (with John Lewis).  In 1947, the Miles Davis All-Stars (with Bird, Roach, Lewis, and Nelson Boyd) debuted on Savoy.  His years on 52nd Street during the last half of the 1940s brought him into the bop orbit of musicians whose legends he would share before he was 25 years old. \r\n\r\n            At the turn of the decade into 1950, as Miles led his first small groups, an asso­ci­a­tion with Gerry Mulligan and arranger Gil Evans ushered in The Birth of the Cool (Capitol), a movement that challenged the dominance of bebop and hard-bop.  Miles’ subsequent record dates as leader in the early ’50s (on Blue Note, then Prestige) helped introduce Sonny Rollins, Jackie McLean, Horace Silver, and Percy Heath, among many others, establishing Miles’ role as the premier jazz talent scout for the rest of his career. \r\n\r\n  An historic set at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1955 resulted in George Avakian signing Miles to Columbia Records, and led to the form­a­tion of his so-called “first great quintet,” featuring John Coltrane, Red Garland, Paul Chambers, and Philly Joe Jones (the ’Round About Midnight sessions).  Miles’ 30 years at Columbia was one of the longest exclusive signings in the history of jazz, and one that spanned at least a half-dozen distinct generations of changes in the music – virtually all of which were anticipated or led by Miles or his former sidemen.","options":[{"id":19920899,"name":"11 Inch x 17 Inch Blue","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19920901,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch Blue","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61340951/-/store_Miles_Davis_bule_Tano_Design_Poster.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61340951/-/store_Miles_Davis_bule_Tano_Design_Poster.png","width":636,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":1031501,"name":"Tribute Dedan Kimathi Limited Edition Poster","permalink":"dedan-kimathi","position":9,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dedan-kimathi","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-12-22T18:01:59.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n\r\nAll TANO Design posters are printed on high-gloss satin finish 10 mil paper\r\n\r\n\r\nDedan Kimathi Waciuri ( Kimathi wa Waciuri), (31 October 1920 – 18 February 1957) was a Kenyan rebel leader who fought against British colonization in Kenya in the 1950s.

The family moved to Bagnolo Mella in the province of Brescia, Lombardy, shortly after he was born. As an infant, he had life-threatening complications with his intestines which led to a series of operations, although his condition had improved by 1992. Mario's health problems and the family's cramped living conditions meant the Barwuahs decided to ask for the help of social services who recommended that he be fostered.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, the Barwuah family agreed to entrust the three-year-old boy to an Italian foster family, the Balotellis. At first, he stayed at the Balotellis during the weekdays, and returned to his biological parents on weekends, but after a while it was arranged for him to be permanently fostered by the Balotellis. His foster parents Francesco and Silvia Balotelli, who have Italian Jewish heritage, lived in a large house in the affluent village of Concesio, Brescia. When Mario Balotelli became famous, his biological parents asked for his return. He later accused them of \"glory hunting\", stating that they only wanted him back because of the prominence he had gained. According to Law 91 of 5 February 1992, Balotelli had to wait until his 18th birthday to request Italian citizenship, as the Balotellis had not adopted him. Balotelli officially gained citizenship in Concesio on 13 August 2008.\r\n\r\nMario has three biological siblings: Abigail, Enoch and Angel Barwuah. Enoch Barwuah, two years his junior, had a trial at English Premier League side Stoke City in December 2011.","options":[{"id":21080569,"name":"Blue 11x17 Inch Poster","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21080571,"name":" Blue 20x30 Inch Poster","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65080445/-/Tano_Design_MARIO_BALOTELLI_poster.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65080445/-/Tano_Design_MARIO_BALOTELLI_poster.png","width":636,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65080469/-/MCU_Tano_design_Mario_Balotelli_Poster.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65080469/-/MCU_Tano_design_Mario_Balotelli_Poster.png","width":633,"height":421}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":2774597,"name":"Thomas Sankara - \"Africa's Che\" Poster","permalink":"thomas-sankara-poster","position":11,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/thomas-sankara-poster","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-09-29T11:55:33.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Isidore Noël Sankara (December 21, 1949 – October 15, 1987) was a Burkinabé military captain, Marxist revolutionary, Pan-Africanist theorist, and communist President  of Burkina Faso from 1983 to 1987.  Viewed as a charismatic, and iconic figure of revolution, he is commonly referred to as \"Africa's Che Guevara.\"\r\n\r\nSankara seized power in a 1983 popularly supported coup at the age of 33, with the goal of eliminating corruption and the dominance of the former French colonial power.He immediately launched \"the most ambitious program for social and economic change ever attempted on the African continent.\" To symbolize this new autonomy and rebirth, he even renamed the country from the French colonial Upper Volta to Burkina Faso (\"Land of Upright Men\"). His foreign policies were centered around anti-imperialism, with his government eschewing all foreign aid, pushing for odious debt reduction, nationalizing all land and mineral wealth, and averting the power and influence of the IMF and World Bank. His domestic policies were focused on preventing famine with agrarian self-sufficiency and land reform, prioritizing education with a nation-wide literacy campaign, and promoting public health by vaccinating 2.5 million children against meningitis, yellow fever and measles. Other components of his national agenda included planting over ten million trees to halt the growing desertification of the Sahel, doubling wheat production by redistributing land from feudal landlords to peasants, suspending rural poll taxes and domestic rents, and establishing an ambitious road and rail construction program to \"tie the nation together.\" Moreover, his commitment to women's rights led him to outlaw female genital mutilation, forced marriages and polygamy; while appointing females to high governmental positions and encouraging them to work outside the home and stay in school even if pregnant.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve this radical transformation of society, he increasingly exerted authoritarian control over the nation, eventually banning unions and a free press, which he believed could stand in the way of his plans and be manipulated by powerful outside influences To counter his opposition in towns and workplaces around the country, he also tried corrupt officials, counter-revolutionaries (and) \"lazy workers\" in peoples revolutionary tribunals. Additionally, as an admirer of Fidel Castro's Cuban Revolution, Sankara set up Cuban-style Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR's).\r\n\r\nHis revolutionary programs for African self-reliance as a defiant alternative to the neo-liberal development strategies imposed by the West, made him an icon to many of Africa's poor,[6] and despite his excesses, Sankara remained popular with most of his country's impoverished citizens. However his policies alienated and antagonised the vested interests of an array of groups, which included the small but powerful Burkinabé middle class, the tribal leaders whom he stripped of the long-held traditional right to forced labour and tribute payments, and the foreign financial interests in France and their ally the Ivory Coast. As a result, he was overthrown and assassinated in a coup d'état led by the French-backed Blaise Compaoré on October 15, 1987. A week before his execution he declared that, \"While revolutionaries as individuals can be murdered, you cannot kill ideas.","options":[{"id":12381284,"name":"11 Inch x 17 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12381286,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch ","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26835362/-/Thomas_Sankara_Tano_Design.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26835362/-/Thomas_Sankara_Tano_Design.png","width":300,"height":464},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50310179/-/THomas_Sankara_Poster_Tano_Design.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50310179/-/THomas_Sankara_Poster_Tano_Design.png","width":700,"height":462}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":2991305,"name":"Tribute Angela Davis Poster","permalink":"angela-davis-poster","position":12,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/angela-davis-poster","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-12-07T19:08:41.000Z","description":"<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/AI4U-q2o2cg?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/AI4U-q2o2cg?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n\r\nAngela Yvonne Davis (born January 26, 1944) is an American political activist and retired professor with the History of Consciousness Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

He was raised in a very poor family in Tres Coracos, Brazil and his parents, Dondinho and Celeste Nascimento called Edson \"Dico,\" growing up.\r\n\r\nHe first learned the game of soccer from his father, Dondinho, who was a decent center forward until his career was halted by a fractured leg. \r\n\r\nPelé began playing soccer for a local minor-league club when he was a teenager. When he wasn't playing soccer he shined shoes for pennies. He was discovered at the age of 11 by one of the country's premier players, Waldemar de Brito. When Brito brought Pelé to Sao Paulo he declared to the disbelieving directors of the professional team in Santos, \"This boy will be the greatest soccer player in the world.\" \r\n\r\nHe was right! Pelé's impact was immediate! On his first appearance for the team, against Corinthians F.C., he scored a goal right away. He was only 16.\r\n\r\nPelé went on to play in four World Cups with Brazil's National Team. At the 1958 World Cup in Sweden -- one he nearly missed because of a knee injury -- Pelé stunned the world scoring six goals, including two in the championship game to help Brazil win its first World Cup 5-2 over Sweden. He was only 17 years-old, but a legend was born.\r\n\r\nAn average-sized man, he was blessed with speed, great balance, tremendous vision, the ability to control the ball superbly, and the ability to shoot powerfully and accurately with either foot and with his head.\r\n\r\nFour years later he played on Brazil's World Cup team at in the finals in Chile, but an injury suffered in the first game of the tournament prevented him from helping Brazil win its second title. \r\n\r\nWealthy European clubs offered massive fees to sign the young player, but the government of Brazil declared Pelé an official national treasure to prevent him from being transferred out of the country. \r\n\r\nAt the 1966 World Cup in England, Pelé was the victim of some brutal tackles from Bulgarian and Portuguese defenders and left the finals injured and in tears. But the best of Pelé was still to come. \r\n\r\nAt the 1970 finals in Mexico, the 29-year-old Pelé, led one of the greatest teams ever assembled to win Brazil's third World Cup. In the 4-1 title triumph over Italy, Pelé, scored a glorious goal. It was Brazil's 100th World Cup goal, and the one he remembers the most.\r\n\r\n\"I have a special feeling for that goal because I scored it with my head,\" he said. \"My father was a soccer player and once scored five goals in a game, all with his head. That was one record I was never able to break.\" \r\n\r\nPelé's statistics are staggering. During his career he scored 1,280 goals in 1,360 games, second only to another Brazilian, Arthur Friedenreich, who recorded 1,329 goals. He scored an average of a goal in every international game he played--the equivalent of a baseball player's hitting a home run in every World Series game over 15 years. \r\n\r\nAt the club level he shattered records in Brazil. He scored 127 goals for Santos F.C. in 1959, 110 in 1961 and 101 goals in 1965, and led the club to two World Club championships. \r\n\r\nPelé also holds the world record for hat tricks (92) and the number of goals scored on the international level (97). His statistics are all the more amazing when compared to today's top players who can barely score more that 30 goals in a season. \r\n\r\nHe retired from the game in 1974, but came out of retirement the following year to play in the North American Soccer League for the New York Cosmos for just over two seasons. A reported 7-million-dollar contract for three years made him the highest paid soccer player of the North American Soccer League.\r\n\r\nHis appearance in the NASL gave the American League instant credibility and made millions of Americans aware of the sport, he dubbed the \"beautiful game.\" He said he came out of retirement, not for the money, but to \"make soccer truly popular in the United States.\"\r\n\r\nDuring his career he played in 93 full internationals for Brazil and in all first class matches scored a remarkable 1,280 goals, second only to Artur Friedenreich, another Brazilian, who holds the world record with 1,329. \r\n\r\nIn many ways, Pelé was the complete athlete. With his skill and agility, he could have played in any position on the field, but he chose on wearing the number-10 shirt as an inside-left forward. He had great balance, which enabled him to dribble effortlessly around defenders, and his heading ability was remarkable. \r\n\r\nOn Oct. 1, 1977, Pelé's mission in the NASL ended. His last match, an exhibition game between the Cosmos and Santos, was sold out six weeks beforehand, covered by 650 journalists and broadcast in 38 nations.\r\nMuhammad Ali embraced him in the locker room before the match and said, \"Now there are two of the greatest.\" In a speech to dignitaries, celebrities and more than 75,000 fans, Pelé urged his audience to pay attention to the children of the world. At his request, the assemblage shouted, \"Love! Love! Love!\"\r\nThen he went out and played the first half for the Cosmos -- scoring a goal on a rocket from 30 yards out -- and the second half for Santos.\r\n\r\nOn Pelé's retirement, J.B. Pinheiro, Brazil's ambassador to the U.N., said Pelé had \"spent 22 years playing soccer, and in that time he has done more for goodwill and friendship than all of the ambassadors ever appointed.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to his great accomplishments in soccer, he published several best-selling autobiographies, starred in several documentary and semi-documentary films, and composed numerous musical pieces, including the entire sound track for the film 'Pelé' (1977). He was the 1978 recipient of the International Peace Award, and in 1980 he was named athlete of the century.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, Pelé was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame and is the former ambassador of sports in Brazil. He has also done extensive work for children's causes through UNICEF.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Pelé was named second for the \"Sportsman of the Century\" award. The legendary Muhammad Ali got the honors. \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":19659169,"name":"11 Inch x 17 Inch Yellow","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19659171,"name":"11 Inch x 17 Inch Green","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19659173,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch Yellow","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":19659175,"name":"20 Inch x 30  Inch Green","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60548343/-/Store_Pele_Tano_Design_Yellow_Poster_.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60548343/-/Store_Pele_Tano_Design_Yellow_Poster_.png","width":636,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60559973/-/Pele_Tano_Design_Poster_.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60559973/-/Pele_Tano_Design_Poster_.png","width":705,"height":471}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":1846741,"name":"Stevie Wonder Poster","permalink":"stevie-wonderful-poster","position":14,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/stevie-wonderful-poster","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-03-06T01:36:05.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nTANO Design posters are printed on high-gloss satin finish 10 mil paper.\r\n Stevie Wonder (born Stevland Hardaway Judkins on May 13, 1950; name later changed to Stevland Hardaway Morris) is an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and record producer.

On December 1, 2009, he was named a UN Messenger of Peace.\r\n\r\nStevie Wonder was born in Saginaw, Michigan in 1950; being the third of six children to Calvin Judkins and Lula Mae Hardaway. \r\n\r\nWhen Stevie Wonder was four, his mother left his father and moved herself and her children to Detroit. She changed her name back to Lula Hardaway and later changed her son's surname to Morris, partly because of relatives. Morris has remained Stevie Wonder's legal name ever since. He began playing instruments at an early age, including piano, harmonica, drums and bass. During childhood he was active in his church choir.\r\n\r\nRonnie White of The Miracles gives credit to his brother Gerald White for persistently nagging him to come to his friend's house in 1961 to check out Stevie Wonder. Afterward, White brought Wonder and his mother to Motown Records. Impressed by the young musician, Motown CEO Berry Gordy signed Wonder to Motown's Tamla label with the name Little Stevie Wonder. Before signing, producer Clarence Paul gave Wonder his trademark name after stating \"we can't keep calling him the eighth wonder of the world\".

Her work has been celebrated in Mexico as emblematic of national and indigenous tradition, and by feminists for its uncompromising depiction of the female experience and form.\r\n\r\nMexican culture and Amerindian cultural tradition figure prominently in her work, which has sometimes been characterized as Naïve art or folk art. Her work has also been described as \"surrealist\", and in 1938 one surrealist described Kahlo herself as a \"ribbon around a bomb\".\r\n\r\nKahlo had a stormy but passionate marriage with the prominent Mexican artist Diego Rivera. She suffered lifelong health problems, many of which stemmed from a traffic accident in her teenage years. These issues are reflected in her works, more than half of which are self-portraits of one sort or another.

James Brown cited him as one of the originators of funk.\r\n\r\nFela was born Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti in Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria, to a middle-class family. His mother Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti was a feminist activist in the anti-colonial movement and his father, Reverend Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, a Protestant minister and school principal, was the first president of the Nigerian Union of Teachers. His brothers, Dr. Beko Ransome-Kuti and Olikoye Ransome-Kuti both medical doctors, are well known in Nigeria.\r\n\r\nFela was sent to London in 1958 to study medicine but decided to study music instead at the Trinity College of Music. While there he formed the band Koola Lobitos, playing a style of music that he would later call afrobeat. The style was a fusion of African jazz and funk with West African highlife. In 1960, Fela married his first wife, Remilekun (Remi) Taylor, with whom he would have three children (Femi, Yeni, and Sola). In 1963, Fela moved back to Nigeria, re-formed Koola Lobitos and trained as a radio producer for the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation. He played for some time with Dr. Victor Olaiya and his All Stars. In 1969, Fela took the band to the United States. While there, Fela discovered the Black Power movement through Sandra Smith (now Izsadore)—a partisan of the Black Panther Party—which would heavily influence his music and political views and renamed the band Nigeria ’70. Soon, the Immigration and Naturalization Service was tipped off by a promoter that Fela and his band were in the US without work permits. The band then performed a quick recording session in Los Angeles that would later be released as The ’69 Los Angeles Sessions.\r\n\r\nFela and his band, renamed Africa '70', returned to Nigeria. He then formed the Kalakuta Republic, a commune, a recording studio, and a home for many connected to the band that he later declared independent from the Nigerian state. Fela set up a nightclub in the Empire Hotel, named the Afro-Spot and then the Afrika Shrine, where he performed regularly. Fela also changed his middle name to Anikulapo (meaning \"he who carries death in his pouch\").\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":14952325,"name":"Blue11Inch x 17Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14952329,"name":"Green 11Inch x 17Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14952333,"name":"Grey 11Inch x 17 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14952327,"name":"Blue 20Inch x 30 Inch","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":14952335,"name":"Grey 20Inch x 30 Inch","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":14952331,"name":"Green 20Inch x 30 Inch","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50472801/-/Web_Grey_Fela_Kuti_Poster_Tano_Design.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50472801/-/Web_Grey_Fela_Kuti_Poster_Tano_Design.png","width":360,"height":556},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50472785/-/Web_Green_Fela_Kuti_Poster_Tano_Design_copy.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50472785/-/Web_Green_Fela_Kuti_Poster_Tano_Design_copy.png","width":360,"height":556},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50472769/-/Web_Blue_Fela_Kuti_Poster_Tano_Design_copy.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50472769/-/Web_Blue_Fela_Kuti_Poster_Tano_Design_copy.png","width":360,"height":556},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50472817/-/Tano_Design_Fela_Kuti_Poster2.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50472817/-/Tano_Design_Fela_Kuti_Poster2.png","width":706,"height":469},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50486253/-/Tano_Design_Fela_Kuti_Poster4.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50486253/-/Tano_Design_Fela_Kuti_Poster4.png","width":705,"height":471}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":4837959,"name":"W.E.B.

DuBois was born on February 23, 1868 in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. At that time Great Barrington had perhaps 25, but not more than 50, Black people out of a population of about 5,000. Consequently, there were little signs of overt racism there. Nevertheless, its venom was distributed through a constant barrage of suggestive innuendoes and vindictive attitudes of its residents. This mutated the personality of young William from good natured and outgoing to sullen and withdrawn. This was later reinforced and strengthened by inner withdrawals in the face of real discriminations. His demeanor of introspection haunted him throughout his life.\r\n\r\nWhile in high school DuBois showed a keen concern for the development of his race. At age fifteen he became the local correspondent for the New York Globe. And in this position he conceived it his duty to push his race forward by lectures and editorials reflecting upon the need of Black people to politicized themselves.\r\n\r\nDuBois was naturally gifted intellectually and took pleasurable pride in surpassing his fellow students in academic and other pursuits. Upon graduation from high school, he, like many other New England students of his caliber, desired to attend Harvard. However, he lacked the financial resources to go to that institution. But with the aid of friends and family, and a scholarship he received to Fisk College (now University), he eagerly headed to Nashville, Tennessee to further his education.\r\n\r\nThis was DuBois' first trip south. And in those three years at Fisk (1885–1888) his knowledge of the race problem became more definite. He saw discrimination in ways he never dreamed of, and developed a determination to expedite the emancipation of his people. Consequently, he became a writer, editor, and an impassioned orator. And in the process acquired a belligerent attitude toward the color bar.\r\n\r\nAlso, while at Fisk, DuBois spent two summers teaching at a county school in order to learn more about the South and his people. There he learned first hand of poverty, poor land, ignorance, and prejudice. But most importantly, he learned that his people had a deep desire for knowledge.\r\n\r\nAfter graduation from Fisk, DuBois entered Harvard (via scholarships) classified as a junior. As a student his education focused on philosophy, centered in history. It then gradually began to turn toward economics and social problems. As determined as he was to attend and graduate from Harvard, he never felt himself a part of it. Later in life he remarked \"I was in Harvard but not of it.\" He received his bachelor's degree in 1890 and immediately began working toward his master's and doctor's degree.\r\n\r\nDuBois completed his master's degree in the spring of 1891. However, shortly before that, ex-president Rutherford B. Hayes, the current head of a fund to educate Negroes, was quoted in the Boston Herald as claiming that they could not find one worthy to enough for advanced study abroad. DuBois' anger inspired him to apply directly to Hayes. His credentials and references were impeccable. He not only received a grant, but a letter from Hayes saying that he was misquoted. DuBois chose to study at the University of Berlin in Germany. It was considered to be one of the world's finest institutions of higher learning. And DuBois felt that a doctor's degree from there would infer unquestionable preparation for ones life's work.\r\n\r\nDuring the two years DuBois spent in Berlin, he began to see the race problems in the Americas, Africa, and Asia, and the political development of Europe as one. This was the period of his life that united his studies of history, economics, and politics into a scientific approach of social research.\r\n\r\nDuBois had completed a draft of his dissertation and needed another semester or so to finish his degree. But the men over his funding sources decided that the education he was receiving there was unsuitable for the type of work needed to help Negroes. They refused to extend him any more funds and encouraged him to obtain his degree from Harvard. Which of course he was obliged to do. His doctoral thesis, The Suppression of the African Slave Trade in America, remains the authoritative work on that subject, and is the first volume in Harvard's Historical Series.\r\n\r\nEasing On Down The Road\r\nAt the age of twenty-six, with twenty years of schooling behind him, DuBois felt that he was ready to begin his life's work. He accepted a teaching job at Wilberforce in Ohio at the going rate of $800.00 per year. (He also had offers from Lincoln in Missouri and Tuskegee in Alabama.)\r\n\r\nThe year 1896 was the dawn of a new era for DuBois. With his doctorate degree and two undistinguished years at Wilberforce behind him, he readily accepted a special fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania to conduct a research project in Philadelphia's seventh ward slums. This responsibility afforded him the opportunity to study Blacks as a social system.\r\n\r\nDuBois plunged eagerly into his research. He was certain that the race problem was one of ignorance. And he was determined to unearth as much knowledge as he could, thereby providing the \"cure\" for color prejudice. His relentless studies led into historical investigation, statistical and anthropological measurement, and sociological interpretation. The outcome of this exhaustive endeavor was published as The Philadelphia Negro. \"It revealed the Negro group as a symptom, not a cause; as a striving, palpitating group, and not an inert, sick body of crime; as a long historic development and not a transient occurrence.\" This was the first time such a scientific approach to studying social phenomena was undertaken, and as a consequence DuBois is acknowledged as the father of Social Science.\r\n\r\nAfter the completion of the study, DuBois accepted a position at Atlanta University to further his teachings in sociology. For thirteen years there he wrote and studied Negro morality, urbanization, Negroes in business, college-bred Negroes, the Negro church, and Negro crime. He also repudiated the widely held view of Africa as a vast cultural cipher by presenting a historical version of complex, cultural development throughout Africa. His studies left no stone unturned in his efforts to encourage and help social reform.. It is said that because of his outpouring of information \"there was no study made of the race problem in America which did not depend in some degree upon the investigations made at Atlanta University.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this period an ideological controversy grew between DuBois and Booker T. Washington, which later grew into a bitter personal battle. Washington from 1895, when he made his famous \"Atlanta Compromise\" speech, to 1910 was the most powerful black man in the America. Whatever grant, job placement or any endeavor concerning Blacks that influential whites received was sent to Washington for endorsement or rejection. Hence, the \"Tuskegee Machine\" became the focal point for Black input/output. DuBois was not opposed to Washington's power, but rather, he was against his ideology/methodology of handling the power. On one hand Washington decried political activities among Negroes, and on the other hand dictated Negro political objectives from Tuskegee.\r\n\r\nWashington argued the Black people should temporarily forego \"political power, insistence on civil rights, and higher education of Negro youth. They should concentrate all their energies on industrial education.\" DuBois believed in the higher education of a \"Talented Tenth\" who through their knowledge of modern culture could guide the American Negro into a higher civilization. (See Chapter 4, \"Science and Empire\" in DuBois' Dusk of Dawn.)\r\n\r\nThe culmination of the conflict came in 1903 when DuBois published his now famous book, The Souls of Black Folks. The chapter entitled \"Of Booker T. Washington and Others\" contains an analytical discourse on the general philosophy of Washington. DuBois edited the chapter himself to keep the most controversial and bitter remarks out of it. Nevertheless, it still was more than enough to incur Washington's continued contempt for him.\r\n\r\nIn the early summer of 1905 Washington went to Boston to address a rally. While speaking he was verbally assaulted by William Monroe Trotter ( a Harvard college friend of DuBois). The subsequent jailing of Trotter on trumped-up charges, apparently by Washingtonites, raised the wrath of DuBois. This incident caused DuBois to solicit help from others \"for organized determination and aggressive action on the part of men who believe in Negro freedom and growth. (Emphasis mine)\r\n\r\nTwenty-nine men from fourteen states answered the call in Buffalo, New York. Five months later in January of 1906 the \"Niagara Movement\" was formed. So called after the cite of the meeting place–the Canadian side of Niagara falls. (They were prevented from meeting on the U.S. side.) Its objectives were to advocate civil justice and abolish caste discrimination. The downfall of the group was attributed to public accusations of fraud and deceit instigated and engineered presumably by Washington advocates, and DuBois' inexperience with organizations and the internal strain from the dynamic personality of Trotter. In 1909 all members of the Niagara Movement save one (Trotter, who despised and distrusted whites and their objectives) merged with some white liberals and thus the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was born. DuBois was not altogether pleased with the group but agreed to stay on as Director of Publications and Research.\r\n\r\nThe main artery for distributing NAACP policy and news concerning Blacks was the Crisis magazine, which DuBois autocratically governed as its editor-in-chief for some twenty-five years. He was of no mind to follow pedantically the Associations views, and therefore wrote only that which he felt could lift the coffin lid off his people.\r\n\r\nHis hot, raking editorials oftentimes lead to battles within the ranks of the Association. Besides this, the NAACP was, at that time, under the leadership of whites, to which DuBois objected. He always felt that Blacks should lead and that if whites were to be included at all, it should be in a supportive role. The meteoric and sustained rise in the circulation of the Crisis, making it self-supporting, tranquilized the moderates within the Association. This afforded DuBois the ability to continue his assault on the injustices heaped upon the Blacks.\r\n\r\nWorld War I had dramatic affects on the lives of Black folks. Firstly, the Armed Forces refused Black inductees, but finally relinquished and put the \"colored folks\" in subservient roles. Secondly, while the war was raging, Blacks in the southern states were moving North where industry was desperately looking for workers. Ignorant, frightened whites, led by capitalist instigators, were fearful that Blacks would totally consume the job market. Thus, lynching ran rampant. Finally, after the war, Black veterans returned home to the same racist country they had fought so heroically to defend.\r\n\r\nDr. DuBois, using the Crisis as his vehicle, hurled thunderbolts of searing script, scorching the \"dusty veil,\" and revealing the innards of a country whose quivering heart beat bigotry. So vitriolic and eloquent was his pen, that subsequent reaction from his followers caused congressional action to:\r\n\r\n   1. Inaugurate the opening of Black officer training schools.\r\n   2. Bring forth legal action against lynchers.\r\n   3. Set up a federal work plan for returning veterans. \r\n\r\nHis articles never quit. The countryside was inundated with DuBoisian unmitigated protest. This period marked the height of DuBois' popularity. The Crisis magazine subscription rate had grown from 1000 in 1909 to over 10,000 in May of 1919. His \"Returning Soldier\" editorial climaxed the period.\r\n\r\n\"By the God of Heaven, we are cowards and jackasses if now that the war is over, we do not marshal every ounce of our brain and brawn to fight the forces of hell in our own land.\r\n\r\n    We return.\r\n    We return from fighting.\r\n    We return fighting!\r\n    Make way for Democracy! We saved it in France, and by the great Jehovah, we will save it in the United Stated of America, or know the reason why.\" \r\n\r\nShortly after the Armistice was signed, DuBois, sailed for France in 1919 to represent the NAACP as an observer at the Peace Conference. While there he decided it was an opportune time to organize a Pan-African conference to bring attention to the problems of Africans around the world. While this was not the first Pan-African Congress (the first one was held in 1900), he had long been interested in the movement.\r\n\r\nWhile the concept was lauded by a few revolutionaries, it failed because of lack of interest by the more influential Black organizations.\r\n\r\nDuBois realized that for Africans could be free anywhere, they must be free everywhere. He therefore decided to hold another Pan-African meeting in 1921. While this one was better organized, he was dealt double trouble. First, following the war, \"a political and social revolution, economic upheaval and depression, national and racial hatred made a setting in which any such movement was entirely out of the Question.\" More importantly, however, was the encounter with the astonishing Marcus Garvey.\r\n\r\n\"Unlike DuBois, Garvey was able to gain mass support and had tremendous appeal.\" He established the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) for the purpose of uniting Africa and her descendants. He instituted the visionary concept of buying ships for overseas trade and travel; he issued forth uncompromising orations on race relations and inspiration (\"Up you mighty people. You can accomplish what you will!\"); and held pageants and parades through \"Harlems\" with red, black, and green liberation flags flying (The colors symbolizes the skin, the blood, and the hopes and growth potential of Black people. The green is also symbolic of the earth.). His methodology was refreshing and inspiring. And it was in direct contrast to the intellectual style of DuBois.\r\n\r\nDuBois' first efforts were to explain away the Garvey movement and ignore it . But it was a mass movement and could not be ignored.\r\n\r\nLater, when Garvey began to collect money for his steamship line, DuBois characterized him as \"a hard-working idealist, but his methods are bombastic, wasteful, illogical and almost illegal.\" Marcus Garvey, choosing to ignore the critiques of DuBois, continued with his undertakings until charges of fraud were brought forth against him. He was imprisoned and upon his release, he was exiled from the United States. He died in 1941.\r\n\r\nThe conflict between the two men was amplified by the white press. It also served to debilitate the progress of the future planned Pan-African Congress. Nevertheless, DuBois held his conference in 1923, and as expected the turnout was small.\r\n\r\nWhen the conference was concluded, he set sail for Africa for the first time. During the trip through \"the eternal world of Black folk\" he made a characteristic observation–\"The world brightens as it darkens.\" His racial romanticism was given free reign as he wrote–\"The spell of Africa is upon me ...\"\r\n\r\nIdeology Change\r\nReturning home from his African experience, DuBois had a chance to reflect upon his past. DuBois noted how America tactically side-stepped the issues of color, and how his approach of \"educate and agitate\" appeared to fall on deaf ears. He felt that his ideological approach to the \"problem of the twentieth century\" had to be revised.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Revolution of 1917 illuminated and made clear the change in his basic thought. The revolution concerned itself with the problem of poverty. \"Russia was trying to put into the hands of those people who do the world's work the power to guide and rule the state for the best welfare of the masses.\" DuBois' trip to Russia in 1927, his learning about Marx and Engles, his seeing the beginning of a new nation form with regard to class, prompted him to say–\"My day in Russia was the day of communist beginnings.\"\r\n\r\n\"He could no longer support integration as present tactics and relegated it to a long range goal. Unable to trust white politicians, white capitalists of white workers he invested everything in the segregated socialized economy.\" (Shades of Washingtonianism?) His ideology carried over to his editorials in the Crisis magazine.\r\n\r\nBy 1930 he had become thoroughly convinced that the basic policies and ideals of the NAACP must be modified and/or discarded. There were two alternatives:\r\n\r\n   1. Change the board of directors of the NAACP (who were mostly white) so as to substitute a group which agreed with his program.\r\n   2. LEAVE THE ORGANIZATION. \r\n\r\nBy 1933 DuBois decided his financial, organizational and ideological battles with the NAACP were unendurable, and he recommended that the Crisis suspend its operation. (The Crisis magazine, however, is still in existence today.)\r\n\r\nHe resumed his duties at Atlanta University and there upon completed two major works. His book Black Reconstruction dealt with the socio-economic development of the nation after the Civil War. This masterpiece portrayed the contributions of the Black people to this period, whereas before, the Blacks were always portrayed as disorganized and chaotic. His second book of this period, Dusk of Dawn, was completed in 1940 and expounded his concepts and views on both the African's and African American's quest for freedom.\r\n\r\nAs in years past, DuBois never relented in attacks upon imperialism, especially in Africa. (His book entitled The World and Africa was written as a contradiction to the pseudo-historians who consistently omitted Africa from world history.) In 1945 he served as an associate consultant to the American delegation at the founding conference of the United Nations in San Francisco. He charged the world organization with planning to be dominated by imperialist nations and not intending to intervene on the behalf of colonized countries. He announced that the fifth Pan-African Congress would convene to determine what pressure could be applied to the world powers.\r\n\r\nThis conference was dotted with an all-star cast:\r\n\r\n   1. Kwame Nkruma–dedicated revolutionary, father of Ghanian independence, and first president of Ghana.\r\n   2. George Padmore–an international revolutionary, often called the \"Father of African Emancipation,\" who later became Kwame Nkrumah's advisor on African Affairs.\r\n   3. Jomo Kenyatta–called the \"burning Spear,\" reputed leader of the Mau Mau uprising, and first president of independent Kenya. \r\n\r\nThe congress elected DuBois International President and cast him a \"Father of Pan-Africanism.\"\r\n\r\nThus, \"W.E.B. DuBois entered into his last phase as a protest propagandist, committed beyond a single social group to a world conception of proletarian liberation.\"\r\n\r\nAlienation\r\nAlways antagonizing and making guilty groups feel extremely uncomfortable, he wrote in 1949: \"We want to rule Russia and cannot rule Alabama.\" As s member of the left-wing American Labor Party he wrote: \"Drunk with power, we (the U.S.) are leading the world to hell in a new colonialism with the same old human slavery, which once ruined us, to a third world war, which will ruin the world.\"\r\n\r\nAs the chairman of the Peace Information Center, he demanded the outlawing of atomic weapons. The Secretary of State denounced it as Soviet propaganda. Jumping at the chance to quiet \"that old man,\" the U.S. Department of Justice ordered DuBois and others to register as agents of a \"foreign principal.\" DuBois refused and was immediately indicted under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Sufficient evidence was lacking, therefore DuBois was acquitted. The subversive activity initiated by the U.S. government acted as a catalyst in the alienation DuBois already felt for the present system. His feelings were heard around the world in 1959. While in Peking he told a large audience–\"In my own country for nearly a century I have been nothing but a NIGGER.\" By the time the U.S. press published the account, he was residing in Ghana; an expatriate from the United States. President Nkruma welcomed DuBois and asked him to direct the government-sponsored Encyclopedia Africana. The offer was accepted graciously and a year later, in the final months of his life, DuBois became a Ghanian citizen and an official member of the Communist party.\r\n\r\nFree At Last\r\nOn August 27,1963, on the eve of the March On Washington, DuBois died in Accra, Ghana.\r\n\r\nHis role as a pioneering Pan-Africanist was memorialized by the few who understood the genius of the man and neglected by the many who were afraid that his loquacious espousals would unite the oppressed throughout the world into revolution.","options":[{"id":15782523,"name":"11 Inch x 17 Inch Yellow","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15782525,"name":"11 Inch x 17 Inch Red","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15782527,"name":"11 Inch x 17 Inch Green","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15782529,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch Yellow","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":15782531,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch Red","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":15782533,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch Green","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47472389/-/Tano_Yellow_WEB_Du_Boise_Tano_Design_Poster_copy.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47472389/-/Tano_Yellow_WEB_Du_Boise_Tano_Design_Poster_copy.png","width":390,"height":603},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47472429/-/Green_WEB_Du_Boise_Tano_Design_Poster_copy.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47472429/-/Green_WEB_Du_Boise_Tano_Design_Poster_copy.png","width":390,"height":603},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47472373/-/Tano_Red_WEB_Du_Boise_Tano_Design_Poster_copy.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47472373/-/Tano_Red_WEB_Du_Boise_Tano_Design_Poster_copy.png","width":390,"height":603},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47631903/-/Posters_WEB_DuBois_Amsterdam.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47631903/-/Posters_WEB_DuBois_Amsterdam.png","width":876,"height":584}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":2170111,"name":"Corruption Kills Limited Editon T-shirt","permalink":"corruption-kills-limited-editon-t-shirt","position":18,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/corruption-kills-limited-editon-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-03-31T05:45:50.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n\"The softest, smoothest, best-looking T-shirt available anywhere.\" \r\n100% Fine Jersey cotton construction\r\n\r\n\r\nCorruption is a complex social, political and economic phenomenon that affects all countries. The United Nations Convention against Corruption is the first legally binding international anti-corruption instrument. The Convention provides a unique opportunity for mounting a global response to a global problem.\r\n\r\nCorruption undermines democratic institutions, slows economic development and contributes to governmental instability. Corruption attacks the foundation of democratic institutions by distorting electoral processes, perverting the rule of law and creating bureaucratic quagmires whose only reason for existing is the soliciting of bribes. Economic development is stunted because foreign direct investment is discouraged and small businesses within the country often find it impossible to overcome the \"start-up costs\" required because of corruption.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations Convention against Corruption provides an opportunity to develop a global language about corruption and a coherent  implementation strategy. Although a multitude of international anti-corruption agreements exist, their implementation has been uneven and only moderately successful. This Convention gives the global community the opportunity to address both of those weaknesses and begin establishing an effective set of benchmarks for effective anti-corruption strategies. The Global Programme against Corruption of UNODC is a catalyst and a resource to help States effectively implement the provisions of the Convention.\r\n\r\nA rapidly growing number of States have become parties to the Convention. The primary goal of the anti-corruption work done by UNODC is to provide States with practical assistance and build the technical capacity needed to implement the Convention. Efforts will concentrate on supporting Member States in the development of anti-corruption policies and institutions, including preventive anti-corruption frameworks.\r\n\r\n

Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, that revolutionized European painting and sculpture, and inspired related movements in music, literature and architecture. The first branch of cubism, known as Analytic Cubism, was both radical and influential as a short but highly significant art movement between 1907 and 1911 in France. In its second phase, Synthetic Cubism, the movement spread and remained vital until around 1919, when the Surrealist movement gained popularity.\r\n\r\nEnglish art historian Douglas Cooper describes three phases of Cubism in his seminal book, The Cubist Epoch. According to Cooper there was \"Early Cubism\", (from 1906 to 1908) when the movement was initially developed in the studios of Picasso and Braque; the second phase being called \"High Cubism\", (from 1909 to 1914) during which time Juan Gris emerged as an important exponent; and finally Cooper referred to \"Late Cubism\" (from 1914 to 1921) as the last phase of Cubism as a radical avant-garde movement.[1]\r\n\r\nIn cubist artworks, objects are broken up, analyzed, and re-assembled in an abstracted form—instead of depicting objects from one viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context. Often the surfaces intersect at seemingly random angles, removing a coherent sense of depth. The background and object planes interpenetrate one another to create the shallow ambiguous space, one of cubism's distinct characteristics.\r\n","options":[{"id":12158216,"name":"Men Blue

His mother, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti was a feminist activist in the anti-colonial movement and his father, Reverend Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, a Protestant minister and school principal, was the first president of the Nigerian Union of Teachers. His brothers, Dr. Beko Ransome-Kuti and Olikoye Ransome-Kuti both medical doctors, are well known in Nigeria.\r\n\r\nFela was sent to London in 1958 to study medicine but decided to study music instead at the Trinity College of Music. While there he formed the band Koola Lobitos, playing a style of music that he would later call afrobeat. The style was a fusion of African jazz and funk with West African highlife. In 1960, Fela married his first wife, Remilekun (Remi) Taylor, with whom he would have three children (Femi, Yeni, and Sola). In 1963, Fela moved back to Nigeria, re-formed Koola Lobitos and trained as a radio producer for the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation. He played for some time with Dr. Victor Olaiya and his All Stars. In 1969, Fela took the band to the United States. While there, Fela discovered the Black Power movement through Sandra Smith (now Izsadore)—a partisan of the Black Panther Party—which would heavily influence his music and political views and renamed the band Nigeria ’70. Soon, the Immigration and Naturalization Service was tipped off by a promoter that Fela and his band were in the US without work permits. The band then performed a quick recording session in Los Angeles that would later be released as The ’69 Los Angeles Sessions.\r\n\r\nFela and his band, renamed Africa '70', returned to Nigeria. He then formed the Kalakuta Republic, a commune, a recording studio, and a home for many connected to the band that he later declared independent from the Nigerian state. Fela set up a nightclub in the Empire Hotel, named the Afro-Spot and then the Afrika Shrine, where he performed regularly. Fela also changed his middle name to Anikulapo (meaning \"he who carries death in his pouch\").\r\n","options":[{"id":9717579,"name":"Men Red

Africa is the 2nd largest continent after Asia with a population of approximately 1 billion people. \r\n\r\nIn the late nineteenth century, the European imperial  powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent, creating many colonial territories, and leaving only two fully independent states: Ethiopia (then known as \"Abyssinia\"), and Liberia. Egypt and Sudan  were never incorporated into any European colonial empire, however, after the British occupation of 1882, the country was effectively under British administration until 1922. Imperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II, when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence.\r\n\r\nIndependence movements in Africa gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, Libya, a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, Tunisia and Morocco won their independence from France. Ghana followed suit the next year.  Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade, most often through relatively peaceful means, though in some countries, notably Algeria, it came only after a violent struggle. Portugal's overseas presence in Africa (most notably in Angola, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Guinea and São Tomé and Príncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the Estado Novo regime was overthrown in a military coup in Lisbon. Though South Africa was one of the first African countries to gain independence, it remained under the rule of its white settler population, in a policy known as Apartheid, until 1994.\r\n","options":[{"id":10003261,"name":"Men Green S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10003263,"name":"Men Green

bandleader, and composer. Widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century.Miles Davis was, with his musical groups, at the forefront of several major developments in jazz music, including bebop, cool jazz, hard bop, modal jazz, and jazz fusion.\r\n\r\nMiles Dewey Davis was born on May 26, 1926, to an affluent African American family in Alton, Illinois. His father, Dr. Miles Henry Davis, was a dentist. In 1927 the family moved to East St. Louis, Illinois. They also owned a substantial ranch in northern Arkansas, where Davis learned to ride horses as a boy.\r\n\r\nDavis' mother, Cleota Mae (Henry) Davis, wanted her son to learn the piano; she was a capable blues pianist but kept this fact hidden from her son. His musical studies began at 13, when his father gave him a trumpet and arranged lessons with local musician Elwood Buchanan. Davis later suggested that his father's instrument choice was made largely to irk his wife, who disliked the trumpet's sound. Against the fashion of the time, Buchanan stressed the importance of playing without vibrato; he was reported to have slapped Davis' knuckles every time he started using heavy vibrato. Davis would carry his clear signature tone throughout his career. He once remarked on its importance to him, saying, \"I prefer a round sound with no attitude in it, like a round voice with not too much tremolo and not too much bass. Just right in the middle. If I can’t get that sound I can’t play anything.\r\n\r\nFor nearly six decades, Miles Davis has embodied all that is cool – in his music (and most especially jazz), in his art, fashion, romance, and in his international, if not intergalactic, presence that looms strong as ever today.  2006 – The year in which Miles Davis was inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame on March 13th – is a land­mark year, commemorating the 80th anniversary of his birth on May 26, 1926, and the 15th anniversary of his death on September 28, 1991.  In between those two markers is more than a half-century of brilliance – often exasperating, brutally honest with himself and to others, uncompromising in a way that transcended mere intuition. \r\n\r\n            In carrying out what always seemed like a mission, Miles Dewey Davis III – musician, composer, arranger, producer, and band leader – was always in the right place at the right time, another defining aspect of cool.  Born in Alton, Illinois, and raised in East St. Louis, where his father was a dentist, Miles was given his first trumpet at age 13.  A child prodigy, his mastery of the instrument accelerated as he came under the spell of older jazzmen Clark Terry, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Billy Eckstine, and others who passed through.  He accepted admission to the Juilliard School in 1944, but it was a ruse to get to New York and hook up with Bird and Diz.  Miles was 18.  Cool.\r\n\r\n            Within a year, he accomplished his goal.  He can be heard on sessions led by Parker that were released on Savoy in 1945 (with Max Roach), ’46 (with Bud Powell), ’47 (with Duke Jordan and J.J. Johnson), and ’48 (with John Lewis).  In 1947, the Miles Davis All-Stars (with Bird, Roach, Lewis, and Nelson Boyd) debuted on Savoy.  His years on 52nd Street during the last half of the 1940s brought him into the bop orbit of musicians whose legends he would share before he was 25 years old. \r\n\r\n            At the turn of the decade into 1950, as Miles led his first small groups, an asso­ci­a­tion with Gerry Mulligan and arranger Gil Evans ushered in The Birth of the Cool (Capitol), a movement that challenged the dominance of bebop and hard-bop.  Miles’ subsequent record dates as leader in the early ’50s (on Blue Note, then Prestige) helped introduce Sonny Rollins, Jackie McLean, Horace Silver, and Percy Heath, among many others, establishing Miles’ role as the premier jazz talent scout for the rest of his career. \r\n\r\n  An historic set at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1955 resulted in George Avakian signing Miles to Columbia Records, and led to the form­a­tion of his so-called “first great quintet,” featuring John Coltrane, Red Garland, Paul Chambers, and Philly Joe Jones (the ’Round About Midnight sessions).  Miles’ 30 years at Columbia was one of the longest exclusive signings in the history of jazz, and one that spanned at least a half-dozen distinct generations of changes in the music – virtually all of which were anticipated or led by Miles or his former sidemen.","options":[{"id":19923413,"name":"Men Blue S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19923415,"name":"Men Blue M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19923417,"name":"Men Blue L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19923419,"name":"Men Blue XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19923421,"name":"Men Blue XXL","price":25.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":19923423,"name":"Women Blue S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19923425,"name":"Women Blue M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19923427,"name":"Women Blue L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19923429,"name":"Women Blue XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63405845/-/Miles_Davis_Dark_Blue_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63405845/-/Miles_Davis_Dark_Blue_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61349439/-/store_Miles_Davis_bule_Tano_Design_Poster.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61349439/-/store_Miles_Davis_bule_Tano_Design_Poster.png","width":636,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":4223001,"name":"Africolor Limited Edition t-shirt","permalink":"africolor-limited-edition-t-shirt","position":23,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/africolor-limited-edition-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-08-08T20:27:09.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n\"The softest, smoothest, best-looking T-shirt available anywhere.\" \r\n100% Fine Jersey cotton construction\r\n\r\nAfrica is one continent comprising of 54 states. Africa is the 2nd largest continent after Asia with a population of approximately 1 billion people. \r\n\r\nIn the late nineteenth century, the European imperial  powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent, creating many colonial territories, and leaving only two fully independent states: Ethiopia (then known as \"Abyssinia\"), and Liberia. Egypt and Sudan  were never incorporated into any European colonial empire, however, after the British occupation of 1882, the country was effectively under British administration until 1922. Imperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II, when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence.\r\n\r\nIndependence movements in Africa gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, Libya, a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, Tunisia and Morocco won their independence from France. Ghana followed suit the next year.  Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade, most often through relatively peaceful means, though in some countries, notably Algeria, it came only after a violent struggle. Portugal's overseas presence in Africa (most notably in Angola, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Guinea and São Tomé and Príncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the Estado Novo regime was overthrown in a military coup in Lisbon. Though South Africa was one of the first African countries to gain independence, it remained under the rule of its white settler population, in a policy known as Apartheid, until 1994.","options":[{"id":13928351,"name":"Men Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13928353,"name":"Men Black

He is the first African American to hold the office. Obama previously served as a United States Senator from Illinois, from January 2005 until he resigned after his election to the presidency in November 2008.\r\n\r\nA native of Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he was the president of the Harvard Law Review. He was a community organizer in Chicago before earning his law degree. He worked as a civil rights attorney in Chicago and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004.\r\n\r\nObama served three terms in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004. Following an unsuccessful bid against a Democratic incumbent for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000, he ran for United States Senate in 2004. Several events brought him to national attention during the campaign, including his victory in the March 2004 Democratic primary and his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in July 2004. He won election to the U.S. Senate in November 2004. His presidential campaign began in February 2007, and after a close campaign in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries against Hillary Rodham Clinton, he won his party's nomination. In the 2008 general election, he defeated Republican nominee John McCain and was inaugurated as president on January 20, 2009.\r\n\r\nAs president, Obama signed economic stimulus legislation in the form of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in February 2009. Other domestic policy initiatives include the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a major piece of health care reform legislation which he signed into law in March 2010, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which forms part of his financial regulatory reform efforts, which he signed in July 2010. In foreign policy, Obama gradually withdrew combat troops from Iraq, increased troop levels in Afghanistan, and signed an arms control treaty with Russia.

born 18 July 1918) is a former President of South Africa, the first to be elected in a fully representative democratic election, who held office from 1994 to 1999. Before his presidency, Mandela was an anti-apartheid activist, and the leader of the African National Congress's armed wing Umkhonto we Sizwe. The South African courts convicted him on charges of sabotage, as well as other crimes committed while he led the movement against apartheid. In accordance with his conviction, Mandela served 27 years in prison, spending many of these years on Robben Island. Following his release from prison on 11 February 1990, Mandela supported reconciliation and negotiation, and helped lead the transition towards multi-racial democracy in South Africa.\r\n\r\nSince the end of apartheid, many have frequently praised Mandela, including former opponents. In South Africa he is often known as Madiba, an honorary title adopted by elders of Mandela's clan. The title has come to be synonymous with Nelson Mandela.","options":[{"id":5061011,"name":"Men Black  M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5061021,"name":"Men Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5061031,"name":"Men Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5061041,"name":"Men Black  XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":38370963,"name":"Men Black XXXL","price":25.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":5061051,"name":"Women Black S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5061061,"name":"Women Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5061071,"name":"Women Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5061081,"name":"Women Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13230491,"name":"Men Grey S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13230493,"name":"Men Grey M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13230507,"name":"Men Grey L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13230505,"name":"Men Grey XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13230503,"name":"Men Grey XXL","price":25.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":13230501,"name":"Women Grey S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13230499,"name":"Women Grey M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13230497,"name":"Women Grey L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13230495,"name":"Women Grey XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14785215,"name":"Men Blue S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14785213,"name":"Men Blue M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14785211,"name":"Men Blue L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14785209,"name":"Men Blue XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14785207,"name":"Men Blue XXL","price":25.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":14785205,"name":"Women Blue S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14785203,"name":"Women Blue M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14785201,"name":"Women Blue L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14785199,"name":"Women Blue XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50362763/-/Grey_Mandela_t-shirt_tano_design.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50362763/-/Grey_Mandela_t-shirt_tano_design.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50362755/-/Blue_Mandela_t-shirt_tano_design.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50362755/-/Blue_Mandela_t-shirt_tano_design.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50362731/-/Black_Mandela_t-shirt_tano_design.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50362731/-/Black_Mandela_t-shirt_tano_design.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50362707/-/Tano_Blue_Nelson_Mandela_Poster_Tano_Design__copy.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50362707/-/Tano_Blue_Nelson_Mandela_Poster_Tano_Design__copy.png","width":600,"height":943}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":1055261,"name":"Tribute to Muhammad Ali Poster","permalink":"muhammad-ali","position":28,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/muhammad-ali","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-12-27T04:43:02.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nMuhammad Ali (born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.; January 17, 1942) is a retired American boxer and three-time World Heavyweight Champion, who is widely considered one of the greatest heavyweight championship boxers of all time. As an amateur, he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. After turning professional, he went on to become the first boxer to win the lineal heavyweight championship three times.\r\n\r\nOriginally known as Cassius Clay, Ali changed his name after joining the Nation of Islam in 1964, subsequently converting to Sunni Islam in 1975. In 1967, Ali refused to be inducted into the U.S. military based on his religious beliefs and opposition to the Vietnam War. He was arrested and found guilty on draft evasion charges, stripped of his boxing title, and his boxing license was suspended. He was not imprisoned, but did not fight again for nearly four years while his appeal worked its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, where it was successful.\r\n\r\nNicknamed 'The Greatest', Ali was involved in several historic boxing matches. Notable among these are three with rival Joe Frazier and one with George Foreman, whom he beat by knockout to win the world heavyweight title for the second time. He suffered only five losses (four decisions and one TKO by retirement from the bout) with no draws in his career, while amassing 56 wins (37 knockouts and 19 decisions). Ali was well known for his unorthodox fighting style, which he described as \"float like a butterfly, sting like a bee\", and employing techniques such as the rope-a-dope. He was also known for his pre-match hype, where he would 'trash talk' opponents on television and in person some time before the match, often with rhymes. These personality quips, idioms along with an unorthodox fighting technique made him a cultural icon. In later life, Ali developed Parkinson's disease due to the injuries he sustained throughout his career. In 1999, Ali was crowned \"Sportsman of the Century\" by Sports Illustrated and \"Sports Personality of the Century\" by the BBC","options":[{"id":17048907,"name":"17 Inch x11 Inch Yellow","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9171537,"name":"17 Inch x11 Inch Purple","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9171535,"name":"17 Inch x11 Inch Blue","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":3931791,"name":"17 Inch x11 Inch Green","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":17048909,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch Yellow","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":14312689,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch  Purple","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":14312691,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch  Green","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":14312693,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch Blue","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/52898769/-/tano_design_Ali_bday_70.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/52898769/-/tano_design_Ali_bday_70.png","width":390,"height":613},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/24924216/-/Ali_II.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/24924216/-/Ali_II.png","width":647,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27028954/-/ALI_TANO.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27028954/-/ALI_TANO.png","width":480,"height":742},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/24926712/-/Ali_Purple_II.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/24926712/-/Ali_Purple_II.png","width":647,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":1016151,"name":"Patrice Emery Lumumba","permalink":"lumumba","position":29,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lumumba","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-12-20T14:27:33.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved\r\n\r\n\r\nPatrice Emery Lumumba\r\nb. July 2, 1925, Onalua, Belgian Congo [now Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)\r\nd. January 1961, Katanga province\r\n\r\nAfrican nationalist leader, the first prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (June-September 1960). Forced out of office during a political crisis, he was assassinated a short time later.\r\n\r\nLumumba was born in the village of Onalua in Kasai province, Belgian Congo. He was a member of the small Batetela tribe, a fact that was to become significant in his later political life. His two principal rivals, Moise Tshombe, who led the breakaway of the Katanga province, and Joseph Kasavubu, who later became the nation's president, both came from large, powerful tribes from which they derived their major support, giving their political movements a regional character. In contrast, Lumumba's movement emphasized its all-Congolese nature.\r\n\r\nAfter attending a Protestant mission school, Lumumba went to work in Kindu-Port-Empain, where he became active in the club of the évolués (educated Africans). He began to write essays and poems for Congolese journals. Lumumba next moved to Léopoldville (now Kinshasa) to become a postal clerk and went on to become an accountant in the post office in Stanleyville (now Kisangani). There he continued to contribute to the Congolese press.\r\n\r\nIn 1955 Lumumba became regional president of a purely Congolese trade union of government employees that was not affiliated, as were other unions, to either of the two Belgian trade-union federations (socialist and Roman Catholic). He also became active in the Belgian Liberal Party in the Congo. Although conservative in many ways, the party was not linked to either of the trade-union federations, which were hostile to it. In 1956 Lumumba was invited with others to make a study tour of Belgium under the auspices of the Minister of Colonies. On his return he was arrested on a charge of embezzlement from the post office. He was convicted and condemned one year later, after various reductions of sentence, to 12 months' imprisonment and a fine.\r\n\r\nWhen Lumumba got out of prison, he grew even more active in politics. In October 1958 he founded the Congolese National Movement (Mouvement National Congolais; MNC), the first nationwide Congolese political party. In December he attended the first All-African People's Conference in Accra, Ghana, where he met nationalists from across the African continent and was made a member of the permanent organization set up by the conference. His outlook and terminology, inspired by pan-African goals, now took on the tenor of militant nationalism.\r\n\r\nIn 1959 the Belgian government announced a program intended to lead in five years to independence, starting with local elections in December 1959. The nationalists regarded this program as a scheme to install puppets before independence and announced a boycott of the elections. The Belgian authorities responded with repression. On October 30 there was a clash in Stanleyville that resulted in 30 deaths. Lumumba was imprisoned on a charge of inciting to riot.\r\n\r\nThe MNC decided to shift tactics, entered the elections, and won a sweeping victory in Stanleyville (90 percent of the votes). In January 1960 the Belgian government convened a Round Table Conference in Brussels of all Congolese parties to discuss political change, but the MNC refused to participate without Lumumba. Lumumba was thereupon released from prison and flown to Brussels. The conference agreed on a date for independence, June 30, with national elections in May. Although there was a multiplicity of parties, the MNC came out far ahead in the elections, and Lumumba emerged as the leading nationalist politician of the Congo. Maneuvers to prevent his assumption of authority failed, and he was asked to form the first government, which he succeeded in doing on June 23, 1960.\r\n\r\nA few days after independence, some units of the army rebelled, largely because of objections to their Belgian commander. In the confusion, the mineral-rich province of Katanga proclaimed secession. Belgium sent in troops, ostensibly to protect Belgian nationals in the disorder. But the Belgian troops landed principally in Katanga, where they sustained the secessionist regime of Moise Tshombe.\r\n\r\nThe Congo appealed to the United Nations to expel the Belgians and help them restore internal order. As prime minister, Lumumba did what little he could to redress the situation. His army was an uncertain instrument of power, his civilian administration untrained and untried; the United Nations forces (whose presence he had requested) were condescending and assertive, and the political alliances underlying his regime very shaky. The Belgian troops did not evacuate, and the Katanga secession continued.\r\n\r\nSince the United Nations forces refused to help suppress the Katangese revolt, Lumumba appealed to the Soviet Union for planes to assist in transporting his troops to Katanga. He asked the independent African states to meet in Léopoldville in August to unite their efforts behind him. His moves alarmed many, particularly the Western powers and the supporters of President Kasavubu, who pursued a moderate course in the coalition government and favoured some local autonomy in the provinces.\r\n\r\nOn September 5 President Kasavubu dismissed Lumumba. The legalities of the move were immediately contested by Lumumba. There were thus two groups now claiming to be the legal central government. On September 14 power was seized by the Congolese army leader Colonel Joseph Mobutu (president of Zaire as Mobutu Sese Seko), who later reached a working agreement with Kasavubu. In October the General Assembly of the United Nations recognized the credentials of Kasavubu's government. The independent African states split sharply over the issue.\r\n\r\nIn November Lumumba sought to travel from Leopoldville, where the United Nations had provided him with provisory protection, to Stanleyville, where his supporters had control. With the active complicity of foreign intelligence sources, Joseph Mobutu sent his soldiers after Lumumba. He was caught after several days of pursuit and spent three months in prison, while his adversaries were trying in vain to consolidate their power. Finally, aware that an imprisoned Lumumba was more dangerous than a dead Prime Minister, he was delivered on January 17, 1961, to the Katanga secessionist regime, where he was executed the same night of his arrival, along with his comrades Mpolo and Okito. His death caused a national scandal throughout the world, and, retrospectively, Mobutu proclaimed him a \"national hero.\"\r\n\r\nLumumba was a man of strong character who intended to pursue his policies, regardless of the enemies he made within his country or abroad. The Congo, furthermore, was a key area in terms of the geopolitics of Africa, and because of its wealth, its size, and its contiguity to white-dominated southern Africa, Lumumba's opponents had reason to fear the consequences of a radical or radicalized Congo regime. Moreover, in the context of the Cold War, the Soviet Union's support for Lumumba appeared at the time as a threat to many in the West.","options":[{"id":14583001,"name":"17 Inch x11 Inch Yellow","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19796157,"name":"17 Inch x11 Inch Blue","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14583003,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch Blue","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":19796159,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch Yellow","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/13439061/-/Original_lumumba.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/13439061/-/Original_lumumba.png","width":647,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60958351/-/blue_PATRICE_LUMUMBA_POSTER_.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60958351/-/blue_PATRICE_LUMUMBA_POSTER_.png","width":560,"height":880}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":6630365,"name":"Mario Balotelli t-shirt","permalink":"mario-balotelli-t-shirt","position":30,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mario-balotelli-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-06T16:01:48.000Z","description":"<iframe width=\"300\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/W4emZZK1hfk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n\r\nMario Barwuah Balotelli (Super Mario)\r\n\r\nBalotelli, who is of Ghanaian descent, earned his first cap for the Italian national team on 10 August 2010 in a friendly match against the Côte d'Ivoire.\r\n\r\nMario Balotelli was born in Palermo, Sicily, to Christian Ghanaian immigrants Thomas and Rose Barwuah. The family moved to Bagnolo Mella in the province of Brescia, Lombardy, shortly after he was born. As an infant, he had life-threatening complications with his intestines which led to a series of operations, although his condition had improved by 1992. Mario's health problems and the family's cramped living conditions meant the Barwuahs decided to ask for the help of social services who recommended that he be fostered.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, the Barwuah family agreed to entrust the three-year-old boy to an Italian foster family, the Balotellis. At first, he stayed at the Balotellis during the weekdays, and returned to his biological parents on weekends, but after a while it was arranged for him to be permanently fostered by the Balotellis. His foster parents Francesco and Silvia Balotelli, who have Italian Jewish heritage, lived in a large house in the affluent village of Concesio, Brescia. When Mario Balotelli became famous, his biological parents asked for his return. He later accused them of \"glory hunting\", stating that they only wanted him back because of the prominence he had gained. According to Law 91 of 5 February 1992, Balotelli had to wait until his 18th birthday to request Italian citizenship, as the Balotellis had not adopted him. Balotelli officially gained citizenship in Concesio on 13 August 2008.\r\n\r\nMario has three biological siblings: Abigail, Enoch and Angel Barwuah. Enoch Barwuah, two years his junior, had a trial at English Premier League side Stoke City in December 2011.","options":[{"id":21088599,"name":"Men Black S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088601,"name":"Men Black  M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088603,"name":"Men Black  L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088605,"name":"Men Black  XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088607,"name":"Men Black  XXL","price":25.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21088609,"name":"Women Black  S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088611,"name":"Women Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088613,"name":"Women Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088615,"name":"Women Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088617,"name":"Men White S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088619,"name":"Women Red XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088621,"name":"Women Red L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088623,"name":"Women Red M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088625,"name":"Women Red S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088627,"name":"Men Blue XXL","price":25.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21088629,"name":"Men Blue XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088631,"name":"Men Blue L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088633,"name":"Men Blue M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088635,"name":"Men Blue S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088637,"name":"Men White M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088639,"name":"Men White L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088641,"name":"Men White XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088643,"name":"Men White XXL","price":25.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21088645,"name":"Women White S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088647,"name":"Women White M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088649,"name":"Women White L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21088651,"name":"Women White XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65108149/-/Mario_Balotelli_t-shirt_Blue.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65108149/-/Mario_Balotelli_t-shirt_Blue.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65107989/-/Mario_Balotelli_t-shirt_white.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65107989/-/Mario_Balotelli_t-shirt_white.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65107981/-/Mario_Balotelli_t-shirt_black.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65107981/-/Mario_Balotelli_t-shirt_black.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65108157/-/Mario_Balotelli_t-shirt_Red.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65108157/-/Mario_Balotelli_t-shirt_Red.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65108165/-/Tano_Design_MARIO_BALOTELLI_poster.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65108165/-/Tano_Design_MARIO_BALOTELLI_poster.png","width":636,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":5434477,"name":"Limited Edition Tribute Billie Holiday Poster","permalink":"limited-edition-tribute-billie-holiday-poster","position":31,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/limited-edition-tribute-billie-holiday-poster","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-09T18:07:56.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none;

Her soulful, unique singing voice and her ability to boldly turn any material that she confronted into her own music made her a superstar of her time. Today, Holiday is remembered for her masterpieces, creativity and vivacity, as many of Holiday's songs are as well known today as they were decades ago. Holiday's poignant voice is still considered to be one of the greatest jazz voices of all time.\r\n\r\nHoliday (born Eleanora Fagan) grew up in jazz talent-rich Baltimore in the 1920s. As a young teenager, Holiday served the beginning part of her so-called \"apprenticeship\" by singing along with records by Bessie Smith or Louis Armstrong in after-hours jazz clubs. When Holiday's mother, Sadie Fagan, moved to New York in search of a better job, Billie eventually went with her. She made her true singing debut in obscure Harlem nightclubs and borrowed her professional name - Billie Holiday - from screen star Billie Dove. Although she never underwent any technical training and never even so much as learned how to read music, Holiday quickly became an active participant in what was then one of the most vibrant jazz scenes in the country. She would move from one club to another, working for tips. She would sometimes sing with the accompaniment of a house piano player while other times she would work as part of a group of performers.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 18 and after gaining more experience than most adult musicians can claim, Holiday was spotted by John Hammond and cut her first record as part of a studio group led by Benny Goodman, who was then just on the verge of public prominence. In 1935 Holiday's career got a big push when she recorded four sides that went on to become hits, including \"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\" and \"Miss Brown to You.\" This landed her a recording contract of her own, and then, until 1942, she recorded a number of master tracks that would ultimately become an important building block of early American jazz music. \r\n\r\nHoliday began working with Lester Young in 1936, who pegged her with her now-famous nickname of \"Lady Day.\" When Holiday joined Count Basie in 1937 and then Artie Shaw in 1938, she became one of the very first black women to work with a white orchestra, an impressive accomplishment of her time.\r\n\r\nIn the 1930s, when Holiday was working with Columbia Records, she was first introduced to the poem \"Strange Fruit,\" an emotional piece about the lynching of a black man. Though Columbia would not allow her to record the piece due to subject matter, Holiday went on to record the song with an alternate label, Commodore, and the song eventually became one of Holiday's classics. It was \"Strange Fruit\" that eventually prompted Lady Day to continue more of her signature, moving ballads.\r\n\r\nHoliday recorded about 100 new recordings on another label, Verve, from 1952 to 1959. Her voice became more rugged and vulnerable on these tracks than earlier in her career. During this period, she toured Europe, and made her final studio recordings for the MGM label in March of 1959.\r\n\r\nDespite her lack of technical training, Holiday's unique diction, inimitable phrasing and acute dramatic intensity made her the outstanding jazz singer of her day. White gardenias, worn in her hair, became her trademark. \"Singing songs like the 'The Man I Love' or 'Porgy' is no more work than sitting down and eating Chinese roast duck, and I love roast duck,\" she wrote in her autobiography. \"I've lived songs like that.\"\r\n\r\nBillie Holiday, a musical legend still popular today, died an untimely death at the age of 44. Her emotive voice, innovative techniques and touching songs will forever be remembered and enjoyed. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.billieholiday.com/about/biography2.htm","options":[{"id":17541929,"name":"11 Inch x 17 Inch Blue Poster","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":17541925,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch Blue Poster","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53367041/-/Web_Blue_Billie_Holiday_Tano_Design_poster_copy.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53367041/-/Web_Blue_Billie_Holiday_Tano_Design_poster_copy.png","width":432,"height":679},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53375057/-/Billie_Holiday_Tano_Design_Poster.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53375057/-/Billie_Holiday_Tano_Design_Poster.png","width":698,"height":468}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":3755784,"name":"Limited Edition Africa Rising T-shirt","permalink":"afrique-limited-edition-hexagon-design","position":33,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/afrique-limited-edition-hexagon-design","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-05-15T21:14:41.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n\"The softest, smoothest, best-looking T-shirt available anywhere.\" \r\n100% Fine Jersey cotton construction\r\n\r\nAfrica is one continent comprising of 54 states. Africa is the 2nd largest continent after Asia with a population of approximately 1 billion people. \r\n\r\nIn the late nineteenth century, the European imperial  powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent, creating many colonial territories, and leaving only two fully independent states: Ethiopia (then known as \"Abyssinia\"), and Liberia. Egypt and Sudan  were never incorporated into any European colonial empire, however, after the British occupation of 1882, the country was effectively under British administration until 1922. Imperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II, when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence.\r\n\r\nIndependence movements in Africa gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, Libya, a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, Tunisia and Morocco won their independence from France. Ghana followed suit the next year.  Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade, most often through relatively peaceful means, though in some countries, notably Algeria, it came only after a violent struggle. Portugal's overseas presence in Africa (most notably in Angola, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Guinea and São Tomé and Príncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the Estado Novo regime was overthrown in a military coup in Lisbon. Though South Africa was one of the first African countries to gain independence, it remained under the rule of its white settler population, in a policy known as Apartheid, until 1994.\r\n","options":[{"id":12571132,"name":"Men Black S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12571134,"name":"Men Black

finish 10 mil paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nAkinwande Oluwole \"Wole\" Soyinka (born 13 July 1934) is a Nigerian writer, poet and playwright. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1986, the first African to be so honoured. In 1994, he was designated United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Goodwill Ambassador for the promotion of African culture, human rights, freedom of expression, media and communication.\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent members of the eminent Ransome-Kuti family, his mother Grace Eniola, was the daughter of Rev. Cannon JJ Ransome-Kuti, sister to Olusegun Azariah Ransome-Kuti and Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, making Soyinka cousins to the late Fela Kuti, the late Beko Ransome-Kuti, the late Olikoye Ransome-Kuti and Yemisi Ransome-Kuti.\r\n\r\nSoyinka was born into a Yoruba family, specifically, a Remo family in Isara-Remo on July 13, 1934. His father was Christian Clergy, Canon SA Soyinka (aka \"Teacher pupa\" (light skinned teacher). He received a primary school education in Abeokuta and attended secondary school at Government College, Ibadan. He then studied at the University College, Ibadan (1952-1954) where he founded the pyrates confraternity (an anti-corruption and justice seeking student organization) and the University of Leeds (1954-1957) from which he received an First class honours degree in English Literature. He worked as a play reader at the Royal Court Theatre in London before returning to Nigeria to study African drama. He taught in the Universities of Lagos, Ibadan, and Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife). He became a Professor of Comparative Literature at the then University of Ife in 1975). He is currently an Emeritus Professor at the same university.\r\n\r\nSoyinka has played an active role in Nigeria's political history. In 1965, he made a broadcast demanding the cancellation of the rigged Western Nigeria Regional Elections following his seizure of the Western Nigeria Broadcasting Service studio. He was arrested, arraigned but freed on a technicality by Justice Esho. In 1967, during the Nigerian Civil War he was arrested by the Federal Government of General Yakubu Gowon and put in solitary confinement for his attempts at brokering a peace between the warring Nigerian and Biafran parties. While in prison he wrote poetry on tissue paper which was published in a collection titled Poems from Prison. He was released 22 months later after international attention was drawn to his unwarranted imprisonment. His experiences in prison are recounted in his book The Man Died: Prison Notes of Wole Soyinka (1972).\r\n\r\nHe has been an implacable, consistent and outspoken critic of many Nigerian military dictators, and of political tyrannies worldwide, including the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe. A great deal of his writing has been concerned with \"the oppressive boot and the irrelevance of the colour of the foot that wears it\". This activism has often exposed him to great personal risk, most notable during the government of General Sani Abacha (1993-1998), which pronounced a death sentence on him \"in absentia\". During Abacha's regime, Soyinka escaped from Nigeria via the \"Nadeco Route\" on motorcycle. While abroad, he visited parliaments and conferred with world leaders to impose a regime of sanctions against the brutal Abacha regime. These actions and his setting up of the Radio Kudirat helped immensely in securing Nigeria's return to civilian democratic governance. While living abroad (mainly in the United States, he was a professor at Emory University in Atlanta). When civilian rule returned in 1999, Soyinka returned to a hero's welcome back in Lagos, Nigeria. He accepted an Emeritus Professorship at Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) on the condition that the university bar all former military officers from the position of chancellor. Soyinka is currently the Elias Ghanem Professor of Creative Writing at the English department of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and the President's Marymount Institute Professor in Residence at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California, US.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, he became one of the spearheads of an alternative National conference - PRONACO. Wole Soyinka is a connoisseur of wine and loves outdoor sports such as hunting.","options":[{"id":3856081,"name":"17Inch x11 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14582863,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/10422431/-/TANO__Wole_Soyinka_.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/10422431/-/TANO__Wole_Soyinka_.png","width":647,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60564719/-/wole_Soyinka_Tano_Design_Poster.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60564719/-/wole_Soyinka_Tano_Design_Poster.png","width":705,"height":471}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":1504251,"name":"El Che - Che Guevara Poster","permalink":"che-guevara","position":36,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/che-guevara","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-02-07T14:25:10.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/kMHDXRordYQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/kMHDXRordYQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\nErnesto \"Che\" Guevara (pronounced /tʃɛɪ gəˈværə/; Spanish pronunciation: [tʃe geˈβaɾa]; June 14, 1928 – October 9, 1967), commonly known as El Che or simply Che, was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, intellectual, guerrilla leader, diplomat, military theorist, and major figure of the Cuban Revolution. Since his death, his stylized visage has become a ubiquitous countercultural symbol and global insignia within popular culture.\r\n\r\nAs a young medical student, Guevara traveled throughout Latin America and was transformed by the endemic poverty he witnessed. His experiences and observations during these trips led him to conclude that the region's ingrained economic inequalities were an intrinsic result of monopoly capitalism, neocolonialism, and imperialism, with the only remedy being world revolution. This belief prompted his involvement in Guatemala's social reforms under President Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán, whose eventual CIA-assisted overthrow solidified Guevara's radical ideology. Later, while living in Mexico City, he met Raúl and Fidel Castro, joined their 26th of July Movement, and invaded Cuba aboard the Granma with the intention of overthrowing U.S.-backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. Guevara soon rose to prominence among the insurgents, was promoted to second-in-command, and played a pivotal role in the successful two year guerrilla campaign that deposed the Batista regime.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Cuban Revolution, Guevara performed a number of key roles in the new government. These included reviewing the appeals and firing squads for those convicted as war criminals during the revolutionary tribunals, instituting agrarian reform as minister of industries, serving as both national bank president and instructional director for Cuba’s armed forces, and traversing the globe as a diplomat on behalf of Cuban socialism. Such positions allowed him to play a central role in training the militia forces who repelled the Bay of Pigs Invasion and bringing to Cuba the Soviet nuclear-armed ballistic missiles which precipitated the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Additionally, he was a prolific writer and diarist, composing a seminal manual on guerrilla warfare, along with a best-selling memoir about his youthful motorcycle journey across South America. Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to incite revolutions, first unsuccessfully in Congo-Kinshasa and later in Bolivia, where he was captured by Central Intelligence Agency-assisted Bolivian forces and executed.\r\n\r\nGuevara remains both a revered and reviled historical figure, polarized in the collective imagination in a multitude of biographies, memoirs, essays, documentaries, songs, and films. Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century,while an Alberto Korda photograph of him entitled Guerrillero Heroico (shown), was declared \"the most famous photograph in the world.\"","options":[{"id":12381238,"name":"11 Inch x 17 Inch Blue","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12381244,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch  Blue","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/42901467/-/CHE_GUEVARA_red_blue.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/42901467/-/CHE_GUEVARA_red_blue.png","width":647,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/45406533/-/Che_poster_tano_design_.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/45406533/-/Che_poster_tano_design_.png","width":876,"height":584}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":5015247,"name":"Tribute Gil Scott-Heron t-shirt","permalink":"tribute-gil-scott-heron-t-shirt","position":37,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tribute-gil-scott-heron-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-12-06T04:55:42.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<object width=\"300\" height=\"180\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/eV_astp3BjM&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&version=3\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/eV_astp3BjM&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&version=3\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nGilbert \"Gil\" Scott-Heron (April 1, 1949 – May 27, 2011) was an American soul and jazz poet, musician, and author known primarily for his work as a spoken word performer in the 1970s and '80s. His collaborative efforts with musician Brian Jackson featured a musical fusion of jazz, blues, and soul, as well as lyrical content concerning social and political issues of the time, delivered in both rapping and melismatic vocal styles by Scott-Heron. His own term for himself was \"bluesologist\", which he defined as \"a scientist who is concerned with the origin of the blues.\" His music, most notably on Pieces of a Man and Winter in America in the early 1970s, influenced and helped engender later African-American music genres such as hip hop and neo soul.\r\n\r\nScott-Heron's recording work has received much critical acclaim, especially for one of his best-known compositions \"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised\". His poetic style has been influential upon every generation of hip hop since his popularity began. In addition to being widely considered an influence in today's music, Scott-Heron remained active until his death, and in 2010 released his first new album in 16 years, entitled I'm New Here.\r\n\r\nGil Scott-Heron was born in Chicago, Illinois. His mother, Bobbie Scott-Heron, was an opera singer who performed with the New York Oratorio Society. Scott-Heron's father, Gil Heron, nicknamed \"The Black Arrow,\" was a Jamaican soccer player in the 1950s who became the first black athlete to play for the Scottish Glasgow Celtic Football Club. Gil's parents separated in his early childhood and he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother, Lillie Scott, in Jackson, Tennessee. When Scott-Heron was 12 years old, his grandmother died and he returned to live with his mother in the Bronx, New York City. He enrolled at DeWitt Clinton High School, but later transferred to The Fieldston School after impressing the head of the English department with one of his writings and earning a full scholarship. As one of five black students at the prestigious school, Scott-Heron was faced with alienation and a significant socioeconomic gap. During his admissions interview at Fieldston, an administrator asked him, “'How would you feel if you see one of your classmates go by in a limousine while you're walking up the hill from the subway?' And I said, 'Same way as you. Y'all can't afford no limousine. How do you feel?'\" This type of intractable boldness would become a hallmark of Scott-Heron’s later recordings.\r\n\r\nScott-Heron attended Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, as it was the college chosen by his biggest influence Langston Hughes. It was here that Scott-Heron met Brian Jackson with whom he formed the band Black & Blues. After about two years at Lincoln, Scott-Heron took a year off to write the novels The Vulture and The Nigger Factory. The Last Poets performed at Lincoln in 1969 and Abiodun Oyewole of that Harlem group said Scott-Heron asked him after the performance, \"Listen, can I start a group like you guys?\" Scott-Heron returned to New York City, settling in Chelsea, Manhattan. The Vulture was published in 1970 and well received. Although Scott-Heron never received his undergraduate degree, he received a Master's degree in Creative Writing in 1972 from Johns Hopkins University. His 1972 masters thesis was titled Circle of Stone.","options":[{"id":16292555,"name":"Men Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16292557,"name":"Men Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16292559,"name":"Men Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16292561,"name":"Men Black XXL","price":25.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":16292563,"name":"Men Grey S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16292565,"name":"Men Grey M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16292567,"name":"Men Grey L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16292569,"name":"Men Grey XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16292571,"name":"Men Grey XXL","price":25.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":16292573,"name":"Women Black S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16292575,"name":"Women Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16292577,"name":"Women Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16292579,"name":"Women Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16292581,"name":"Women Grey S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16292583,"name":"Women Grey M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16292585,"name":"Women Grey L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16292587,"name":"Women Grey XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16292589,"name":"Men Blue S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16292591,"name":"Men Blue M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16292593,"name":"Men Blue L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16292595,"name":"Men Blue XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16292597,"name":"Men Blue XXl","price":25.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":16292599,"name":"Women Blue S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16292601,"name":"Women Blue M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16292603,"name":"Women Blue L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16292605,"name":"Women Blue XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49238669/-/Black_GIl_Scott-Heron_T-shirt_.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49238669/-/Black_GIl_Scott-Heron_T-shirt_.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49238701/-/Grey_GIl_Scott-Heron_T-shirt_.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49238701/-/Grey_GIl_Scott-Heron_T-shirt_.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49238693/-/Blue_GIl_Scott-Heron_T-shirt_.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49238693/-/Blue_GIl_Scott-Heron_T-shirt_.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49238637/-/Gil_Scott-Heron_Poster_II_.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49238637/-/Gil_Scott-Heron_Poster_II_.png","width":360,"height":566}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":1782501,"name":"Tribute to Nina Simone Poster","permalink":"tribute-to-nina-simone-poster","position":38,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tribute-to-nina-simone-poster","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-03-01T12:07:21.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/PipX3l1tEeU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\nTANO Design posters are printed on high-gloss satin finish 10 mil paper.\r\n \r\nEunice Kathleen Waymon (February 21, 1933–April 21, 2003), better known by her stage name Nina Simone (/ˈniːnə sɨˈmoʊn/), was an American singer, songwriter, pianist, arranger, and civil rights activist. Although she disliked being categorized, Simone is most associated with jazz music. Simone originally aspired to become a classical pianist, but her work covers an eclectic variety of musical styles that include classical, jazz, blues, soul, folk, R&B, gospel, and pop. Her vocal style is characterized by intense passion, a loose vibrato, and a slightly androgynous timbre, in part due to her unusually low vocal range which veered between the alto and tenor ranges (occasionally even reaching baritone lows). Also known as The High Priestess of Soul, she paid great attention to the musical expression of emotions. Within one album or concert she could fluctuate between exuberant happiness and tragic melancholy. These fluctuations also characterized her own personality and personal life, amplified by bipolar disorder with which she was diagnosed in the mid-1960s, but kept secret until after her death in 2003. According to Nadine Cohodas, Simone's biographer, Ms. Simone was first diagnosed with multiple personality disorder and later with schizophrenia.\r\n\r\nSimone recorded over 40 live and studio albums, the greatest body of her work released between 1958 (when she made her debut with Little Girl Blue) and 1974. Her most well known songs include \"My Baby Just Cares for Me\", \"I Put a Spell on You\", \"Four Women\", \"I Loves You Porgy\", \"Feeling Good\", \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\", \"Sinnerman\", \"To Be Young, Gifted and Black\", \"Mississippi Goddam\", \"Ain't Got No, I Got Life\" and \"I Want a Little Sugar in My Bowl\".\r\n\r\nHer music and message made a strong and lasting impact on culture, illustrated by the numerous contemporary artists who cite her as an important influence (see Legacy and influence). Several hip hop musicians and other modern artists sample and remix Simone's rhythms and beats on their tracks. In particular, Talib Kweli and Mos Def routinely pay tribute to her outstanding and soulful musical style. Many of her songs are featured on motion picture soundtracks, as well as in video games, commercials, and TV series.\r\n\r\nCivil rights era (1964–1974)\r\n\r\nDuring 1964, she changed record distributors, from the American Colpix to the Dutch Philips, which also meant a change in the contents of her recordings. Simone had always included songs in her repertoire that hinted about her African-American origins (such as \"Brown Baby\" and \"Zungo\" on Nina at the Village Gate during 1962). But on her debut album for Philips, Nina Simone In Concert (live recording, 1964), Simone for the first time openly addresses the racial inequality that was prevalent in the United States with the song \"Mississippi Goddam\". It was her response to the murder of Medgar Evers and the bombing of a church in Birmingham, Alabama that killed four black children. The song was released as a single, being boycotted in certain southern states. With \"Old Jim Crow\" on the same album she reacts to the Jim Crow Laws.\r\n\r\nFrom then onwards, a civil rights message was standard in Simone's recording repertoire, where it had already become a part of her live performances. Simone performed and spoke at many civil rights meetings, such as at the Selma to Montgomery marches. Simone advocated violent revolution during the civil rights period as opposed to Martin Luther King's non-violent approach, and hoped that African Americans could, by armed combat, form a separate state (Simone was not, however, a racist, and wrote in her autobiography that her family and indeed herself regarded all races as equal). She covered Billie Holiday's \"Strange Fruit\" (on Pastel Blues (1965), a song about the lynching of black men in the South, and sang the W. Cuney poem \"Images\" on Let It All Out (1966), about the absence of pride in the African-American woman. Simone wrote \"Four Women\", a song about four different stereotypes of African-American women. \r\n\r\nSimone moved from Philips to RCA Victor during 1967. She sang \"Backlash Blues\", written by her friend Langston Hughes on her first RCA album, Nina Simone Sings The Blues (1967). On Silk & Soul (1967) she recorded Billy Taylor's \"I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free\" and \"Turning Point\". The album Nuff Said (1968) contains live recordings from the Westbury Music Fair, April 7, 1968, three days after the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr. She dedicated the whole performance to him and sang \"Why? (The King Of Love Is Dead)\", a song written by her bass player directly after the news of King's death had reached them.\r\n\r\nTogether with Weldon Irvine, Simone turned the late Lorraine Hansberry's unfinished play \"To Be Young, Gifted and Black\" into a civil rights song. She performed it live on the album Black Gold (1970). A studio recording was released as a single, and the song has been covered by Aretha Franklin (on 1972s Young, Gifted and Black) and Donny Hathaway.","options":[{"id":6489771,"name":"Red 11 Inch x17 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7770651,"name":"Blue 11 Inch x17 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14312569,"name":"Red 20 Inch x 30 Inch ","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":14312571,"name":"Blue 20 Inch x 30 Inch ","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/17037941/-/Nina_Simone_Original.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/17037941/-/Nina_Simone_Original.png","width":480,"height":742},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/20621891/-/Nina_Simone_Red.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/20621891/-/Nina_Simone_Red.png","width":647,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50309459/-/Nina_Simone_Poster_Cafe_NYC_Tano_Design.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50309459/-/Nina_Simone_Poster_Cafe_NYC_Tano_Design.png","width":700,"height":471},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50366283/-/Blue_Nina_Simone_Poster_Cafe_NYC_Tano_Design.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50366283/-/Blue_Nina_Simone_Poster_Cafe_NYC_Tano_Design.png","width":421,"height":508}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":2169971,"name":"Corruption Kills Poster","permalink":"corruption-kills","position":39,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/corruption-kills","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-03-31T05:39:14.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n\r\nAll TANO Design posters are printed on high-gloss satin finish 10 mil premium photo paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorruption is a complex social, political and economic phenomenon that affects all countries. The United Nations Convention against Corruption is the first legally binding international anti-corruption instrument. The Convention provides a unique opportunity for mounting a global response to a global problem.\r\n\r\nCorruption undermines democratic institutions, slows economic development and contributes to governmental instability. Corruption attacks the foundation of democratic institutions by distorting electoral processes, perverting the rule of law and creating bureaucratic quagmires whose only reason for existing is the soliciting of bribes. Economic development is stunted because foreign direct investment is discouraged and small businesses within the country often find it impossible to overcome the \"start-up costs\" required because of corruption.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations Convention against Corruption provides an opportunity to develop a global language about corruption and a coherent  implementation strategy. Although a multitude of international anti-corruption agreements exist, their implementation has been uneven and only moderately successful. This Convention gives the global community the opportunity to address both of those weaknesses and begin establishing an effective set of benchmarks for effective anti-corruption strategies. The Global Programme against Corruption of UNODC is a catalyst and a resource to help States effectively implement the provisions of the Convention.\r\n\r\nA rapidly growing number of States have become parties to the Convention. The primary goal of the anti-corruption work done by UNODC is to provide States with practical assistance and build the technical capacity needed to implement the Convention. Efforts will concentrate on supporting Member States in the development of anti-corruption policies and institutions, including preventive anti-corruption frameworks.\r\n\r\n ","options":[{"id":16569347,"name":"Black 11 Inch x17 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16569349,"name":"Blue 11 Inch x17 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16569351,"name":"Purple 11 Inch x17 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16569353,"name":"Black 20 Inch x 30 Inch ","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16569355,"name":"Blue 20 Inch x 30 Inch ","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16569357,"name":"Purple 20 Inch x 30 Inch ","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7821861,"name":"Multicolor 11 Inch x17 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14312597,"name":"Multicolor 20 Inch x 30 Inch ","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/20797531/-/Corruption_Kills_TANO_.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/20797531/-/Corruption_Kills_TANO_.png","width":450,"height":695},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50306291/-/Corruption_KIlls_Poster_Tano_Design.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50306291/-/Corruption_KIlls_Poster_Tano_Design.png","width":697,"height":461}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":1053121,"name":"Rigoberta Menchu","permalink":"rigoberta-menchu","position":40,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rigoberta-menchu","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-12-26T19:57:58.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\nAll Rights Reserved © \r\n\r\nRigoberta Menchú was born on January 9, 1959 to a poor Indian peasant family and raised in the Quiche branch of the Mayan culture. In her early years she helped with the family farm work, either in the northern highlands where her family lived, or on the Pacific coast, where both adults and children went to pick coffee on the big plantations.\r\n\r\nRigoberta Menchú soon became involved in social reform activities through the Catholic Church, and became prominent in the women's rights movement when still only a teenager. Such reform work aroused considerable opposition in influential circles, especially after a guerilla organization established itself in the area. The Menchú family was accused of taking part in guerrilla activities and Rigoberta's father, Vicente, was imprisoned and tortured for allegedly having participated in the execution of a local plantation owner. After his release, he joined the recently founded Committee of the Peasant Union (CUC).\r\n\r\nIn 1979, Rigoberta, too, joined the CUC. That year her brother was arrested, tortured and killed by the army. The following year, her father was killed when security forces in the capital stormed the Spanish Embassy where he and some other peasants were staying. Shortly afterwards, her mother also died after having been arrested, tortured and raped. Rigoberta became increasingly active in the CUC, and taught herself Spanish as well as other Mayan languages than her native Quiche. In 1980, she figured prominently in a strike the CUC organized for better conditions for farm workers on the Pacific coast, and on May 1, 1981, she was active in large demonstrations in the capital. She joined the radical 31st of January Popular Front, in which her contribution chiefly consisted of educating the Indian peasant population in resistance to massive military oppression.\r\n\r\nIn 1981, Rigoberta Menchú had to go into hiding in Guatemala, and then flee to Mexico. That marked the beginning of a new phase in her life: as the organizer abroad of resistance to oppression in Guatemala and the struggle for Indian peasant peoples' rights. In 1982, she took part in the founding of the joint opposition body, The United Representation of the Guatemalan Opposition (RUOG). In 1983, she told her life story to Elisabeth Burgos Debray. The resulting book, called in English, I, Rigoberta Menchú, is a gripping human document which attracted considerable international attention. In 1986, Rigoberta Menchú became a member of the National Coordinating Committee of the CUC, and the following year she performed as the narrator in a powerful film called When the Mountains Tremble, about the struggles and sufferings of the Maya people. On at least three occasions, Rigoberta Menchú has returned to Guatemala to plead the cause of the Indian peasants, but death threats have forced her to return into exile.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Rigoberta Menchú has become widely known as a leading advocate of Indian rights and ethno-cultural reconciliation, not only in Guatemala but in the Western Hemisphere generally, and her work has earned her several international awards.\r\n\r\nFrom Les Prix Nobel.

His collaborative efforts with musician Brian Jackson featured a musical fusion of jazz, blues, and soul, as well as lyrical content concerning social and political issues of the time, delivered in both rapping and melismatic vocal styles by Scott-Heron. His own term for himself was \"bluesologist\", which he defined as \"a scientist who is concerned with the origin of the blues.\" His music, most notably on Pieces of a Man and Winter in America in the early 1970s, influenced and helped engender later African-American music genres such as hip hop and neo soul.\r\n\r\nScott-Heron's recording work has received much critical acclaim, especially for one of his best-known compositions \"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised\". His poetic style has been influential upon every generation of hip hop since his popularity began. In addition to being widely considered an influence in today's music, Scott-Heron remained active until his death, and in 2010 released his first new album in 16 years, entitled I'm New Here.\r\n\r\nGil Scott-Heron was born in Chicago, Illinois. His mother, Bobbie Scott-Heron, was an opera singer who performed with the New York Oratorio Society. Scott-Heron's father, Gil Heron, nicknamed \"The Black Arrow,\" was a Jamaican soccer player in the 1950s who became the first black athlete to play for the Scottish Glasgow Celtic Football Club. Gil's parents separated in his early childhood and he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother, Lillie Scott, in Jackson, Tennessee. When Scott-Heron was 12 years old, his grandmother died and he returned to live with his mother in the Bronx, New York City. He enrolled at DeWitt Clinton High School, but later transferred to The Fieldston School after impressing the head of the English department with one of his writings and earning a full scholarship. As one of five black students at the prestigious school, Scott-Heron was faced with alienation and a significant socioeconomic gap. During his admissions interview at Fieldston, an administrator asked him, “'How would you feel if you see one of your classmates go by in a limousine while you're walking up the hill from the subway?' And I said, 'Same way as you. Y'all can't afford no limousine. How do you feel?'\" This type of intractable boldness would become a hallmark of Scott-Heron’s later recordings.\r\n\r\nScott-Heron attended Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, as it was the college chosen by his biggest influence Langston Hughes. It was here that Scott-Heron met Brian Jackson with whom he formed the band Black & Blues. After about two years at Lincoln, Scott-Heron took a year off to write the novels The Vulture and The Nigger Factory. The Last Poets performed at Lincoln in 1969 and Abiodun Oyewole of that Harlem group said Scott-Heron asked him after the performance, \"Listen, can I start a group like you guys?\" Scott-Heron returned to New York City, settling in Chelsea, Manhattan. The Vulture was published in 1970 and well received. Although Scott-Heron never received his undergraduate degree, he received a Master's degree in Creative Writing in 1972 from Johns Hopkins University.

Viewed as a charismatic, and iconic figure of revolution, he is commonly referred to as \"...Africa's Che Guevara.\"\r\n\r\nSankara seized power in a 1983 popularly supported coup at the age of 33, with the goal of eliminating corruption and the dominance of the former French colonial power.He immediately launched \"the most ambitious program for social and economic change ever attempted on the African continent.\" To symbolize this new autonomy and rebirth, he even renamed the country from the French colonial Upper Volta to Burkina Faso (\"Land of Upright Men\"). His foreign policies were centered around anti-imperialism, with his government eschewing all foreign aid, pushing for odious debt reduction, nationalizing all land and mineral wealth, and averting the power and influence of the IMF and World Bank. His domestic policies were focused on preventing famine with agrarian self-sufficiency and land reform, prioritizing education with a nation-wide literacy campaign, and promoting public health by vaccinating 2.5 million children against meningitis, yellow fever and measles. Other components of his national agenda included planting over ten million trees to halt the growing desertification of the Sahel, doubling wheat production by redistributing land from feudal landlords to peasants, suspending rural poll taxes and domestic rents, and establishing an ambitious road and rail construction program to \"tie the nation together.\" Moreover, his commitment to women's rights led him to outlaw female genital mutilation, forced marriages and polygamy; while appointing females to high governmental positions and encouraging them to work outside the home and stay in school even if pregnant.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve this radical transformation of society, he increasingly exerted authoritarian control over the nation, eventually banning unions and a free press, which he believed could stand in the way of his plans and be manipulated by powerful outside influences To counter his opposition in towns and workplaces around the country, he also tried corrupt officials, counter-revolutionaries (and) \"lazy workers\" in peoples revolutionary tribunals. Additionally, as an admirer of Fidel Castro's Cuban Revolution, Sankara set up Cuban-style Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR's).\r\n\r\nHis revolutionary programs for African self-reliance as a defiant alternative to the neo-liberal development strategies imposed by the West, made him an icon to many of Africa's poor, and despite his excesses, Sankara remained popular with most of his country's impoverished citizens. However his policies alienated and antagonised the vested interests of an array of groups, which included the small but powerful Burkinabé middle class, the tribal leaders whom he stripped of the long-held traditional right to forced labour and tribute payments, and the foreign financial interests in France and their ally the Ivory Coast. As a result, he was overthrown and assassinated in a coup d'état led by the French-backed Blaise Compaoré on October 15, 1987. A week before his execution he declared that, \"While revolutionaries as individuals can be murdered, you cannot kill ideas\".","options":[{"id":9719122,"name":"Men Red S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9719123,"name":"Men Red M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9719124,"name":"Men Red L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9719125,"name":"Men Red XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9719126,"name":"Men Red XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9719127,"name":"Men Black S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9719128,"name":"Men Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9719129,"name":"Men Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9719130,"name":"Men Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9719131,"name":"Men Black XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9719132,"name":"Women Red S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9719133,"name":"Women Red M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9719134,"name":"Women Red L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9719135,"name":"Women Red XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9719136,"name":"Women Black S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9719137,"name":"Women Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9719138,"name":"Women Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9719139,"name":"Women Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12113754,"name":"Men Blue S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12113752,"name":"Men Blue M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12113750,"name":"Men Blue L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12113748,"name":"Men Blue XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12113746,"name":"Men Blue XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12113744,"name":"Women Blue S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12113742,"name":"Women Blue M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12113740,"name":"Women Blue L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12113738,"name":"Women Blue XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35240238/-/Blue_Thomas_Sankara_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35240238/-/Blue_Thomas_Sankara_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30020861/-/Thomas_Sankara_Black_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30020861/-/Thomas_Sankara_Black_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30020877/-/Thomas_Sankara_Red_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30020877/-/Thomas_Sankara_Red_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26819085/-/Thomas_Sankara_Tano_Design.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26819085/-/Thomas_Sankara_Tano_Design.png","width":300,"height":464}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":1480671,"name":"Tribute Wangari Maathai T-shirt","permalink":"tribute-wangari-maathai-t-shirt","position":47,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tribute-wangari-maathai-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-02-05T06:32:17.000Z","description":"All Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n100% Fine Jersey cotton construction\r\n<iframe width=\"300\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/IGMW6YWjMxw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n   \t <a href=\"http://www.americanapparel.net\" target=\"new\"><img src=\"http://www.americanapparel.net/wholesaleresources/images/weuse.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"We Use American Apparel - Click to learn more\" width=\"135\" height=\"42\"></a>\r\n\r\nWangari Muta Maathai was born in Nyeri, Kenya in 1940. She was the first woman in East and Central Africa to earn a doctorate degree. Wangari Maathai obtained a degree in Biological Sciences from Mount St. Scholastica College in Atchison, Kansas (1964). She subsequently earned a Master of Science degree from the University of Pittsburgh (1966). She pursued doctoral studies in Germany and the University of Nairobi, obtaining a Ph.D. (1971) from the University of Nairobi where she also taught veterinary anatomy. She became chair of the Department of Veterinary Anatomy and an associate professor in 1976 and 1977 respectively. In both cases, she was the first woman to attain those positions in the region. Wangari Maathai was active in the National Council of Women of Kenya in 1976-87 and was its chairman in 1981-87. It was while she served in the National Council of Women that she introduced the idea of planting trees with the people in 1976 and continued to develop it into a broad-based, grassroots organization whose main focus is the planting of trees with women groups in order to conserve the environment and improve their quality of life. However, through the Green Belt Movement she has assisted women in planting more than 20 million trees on their farms and on schools and church compounds.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, the Movement established a Pan African Green Belt Network and has exposed over 40 individuals from other African countries to the approach. Some of these individuals have established similar tree planting initiatives in their own countries or they use some of the Green Belt Movement methods to improve their efforts. So far some countries have successfully launched such initiatives in Africa (Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Lesotho, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, etc). In September 1998, she launched a campaign of the Jubilee 2000 Coalition. She has embarked on new challenges, playing a leading global role as a co-chair of the Jubilee 2000 Africa Campaign, which seeks cancellation of the unpayable backlog debts of the poor countries in Africa by the year 2000. Her campaign against land grabbing and rapacious allocation of forests land has caught the limelight in the recent past.\r\n\r\nWangari Maathai is internationally recognized for her persistent struggle for democracy, human rights and environmental conservation. She has addressed the UN on several occasions and spoke on behalf of women at special sessions of the General Assembly for the five-year review of the earth summit. She served on the commission for Global Governance and Commission on the Future. She and the Green Belt Movement have received numerous awards, most notably The 2004 Nobel Peace Prize. Others include The Sophie Prize (2004), The Petra Kelly Prize for Environment (2004), The Conservation Scientist Award (2004), J. Sterling Morton Award (2004), WANGO Environment Award (2003), Outstanding Vision and Commitment Award (2002), Excellence Award from the Kenyan Community Abroad (2001), Golden Ark Award (1994), Juliet Hollister Award (2001), Jane Adams Leadership Award (1993), Edinburgh Medal (1993), The Hunger Project's Africa Prize for Leadership (1991), Goldman Environmental Prize (1991), the Woman of the World (1989), Windstar Award for the Environment (1988), Better World Society Award (1986), Right Livelihood Award (1984) and the Woman of the Year Award (1983). Professor Maathai was also listed on UNEP's Global 500 Hall of Fame and named one of the 100 heroines of the world. In June 1997, Wangari was elected by Earth Times as one of 100 persons in the world who have made a difference in the environmental arena. Professor Maathai has also received honorary doctoral degrees from several institutions around the world: William's College, MA, USA (1990), Hobart & William Smith Colleges (1994), University of Norway (1997) and Yale University (2004).\r\n\r\nThe Green Belt Movement and Professor Wangari Maathai are featured in several publications including The Green Belt Movement: Sharing the Approach (by Professor Wangari Maathai, 2002), Speak Truth to Power (Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, 2000), Women Pioneers for the Environment (Mary Joy Breton, 1998), Hopes Edge: The Next Diet for a Small Planet (Frances Moore Lappé and Anna Lappé, 2002), Una Sola Terra: Donna I Medi Ambient Despres de Rio (Brice Lalonde et al., 1998), Land Ist Leben (Bedrohte Volker, 1993).\r\n\r\nProfessor Maathai serves on the boards of several organizations including the UN Secretary General's Advisory Board on Disarmament, The Jane Goodall Institute, Women and Environment Development Organization (WEDO), World Learning for International Development, Green Cross International, Environment Liaison Center International, the WorldWIDE Network of Women in Environmental Work and National Council of Women of Kenya.\r\n\r\nIn December 2002, Professor Maathai was elected to parliament with an overwhelming 98% of the vote. She was subsequently appointed by the president, as Assistant Minister for Environment, Natural Resources and Wildlife in Kenya's ninth parliament.","options":[{"id":5476561,"name":"Women Green S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5476571,"name":"Women Green M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5476581,"name":"Women Green L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5476591,"name":"Women Green XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14772745,"name":"Men Green S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14772747,"name":"Men Green M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14772749,"name":"Men Green L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14772751,"name":"Men Green XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14772753,"name":"Men Green XXL","price":25.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":14772755,"name":"Women Black S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14772769,"name":"Women Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14772767,"name":"Women Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14772765,"name":"Women Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14772763,"name":"Men Black S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14772761,"name":"Men Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14772759,"name":"Men Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14772757,"name":"Men Black XXL","price":25.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/44159435/-/Wangari_Maathai_Green_t-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/44159435/-/Wangari_Maathai_Green_t-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30025061/-/Wangari_Maathai_Black_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30025061/-/Wangari_Maathai_Black_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/14041671/-/TANO_Wangari_Maathai_Original.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/14041671/-/TANO_Wangari_Maathai_Original.png","width":400,"height":618}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":1020111,"name":"Tribute Bob Marley T- Shirt","permalink":"africanism-t-shirt","position":48,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/africanism-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-12-21T04:01:50.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/51pxEO1HX3A?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/51pxEO1HX3A?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\"></embed></object>\r\n100% Fine Jersey cotton construction\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\nSinger, musician, songwriter. Born on February 6, 1945, in Jamaica. Bob Marley helped introduce reggae music to the world and remains one of its most beloved artists to this day. The son of a black teenage mother and much older, later absent white father, he spent his early years in the rural village known as Nine Miles in the parish of St. Ann.\r\n\r\nOne of his childhood friends in St. Ann was Neville \"Bunny\" O'Riley Livingston. Attending the same school, the two shared a love of music. Bunny inspired Bob to learn to play the guitar. Later Livingston's father and Marley's mother became involved, and they all lived together for a time in Kingston, according to Christopher John Farley's Before the Legend: The Rise of Bob Marley.\r\n\r\nArriving in Kingston in the late 1950s, Marley lived in Trench Town, one of the city's poorest neighborhoods. He struggled in poverty, but he found inspiration in the music around him. Trench Town had a number of successful local performers and was considered the Motown of Jamaica. Sounds from the United States also drifted in over the radio and through jukeboxes. Marley liked such artists as Ray Charles, Elvis Presley, Fats Domino, and the Drifters.\r\n\r\nMarley and Livingston devoted much of their time to music. Under the guidance of Joe Higgs, Marley worked on improving his singing abilities. He met another student of Higgs, Peter McIntosh (later Peter Tosh) who would play an important role in Marley's career.\r\n","options":[{"id":5480321,"name":"Men Black S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5480331,"name":"Men Black  M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5480341,"name":"Men Black  L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5480351,"name":"Men Black  XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5480361,"name":"Men Black  XXL","price":25.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":5480371,"name":"Women Black  S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5480381,"name":"Women Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5480391,"name":"Women Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5480401,"name":"Women Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14807711,"name":"Men Blue S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14807727,"name":"Men Blue M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14807725,"name":"Men Blue L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14807723,"name":"Men Blue XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14807721,"name":"Men Blue XXL","price":25.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":14807719,"name":"Women Blue S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14807717,"name":"Women Blue M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14807715,"name":"Women Blue L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14807713,"name":"Women Blue XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/44289645/-/Blue_bob_marley_t-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/44289645/-/Blue_bob_marley_t-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30047077/-/Bob_Marley_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30047077/-/Bob_Marley_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/12971551/-/Bob_Marley_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/12971551/-/Bob_Marley_.jpg","width":647,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":1030311,"name":"Samora Machel Tribute Poster","permalink":"samora-machel","position":49,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/samora-machel","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-12-22T11:17:43.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\nSamora Moisés Machel (September 29, 1933 – October 19, 1986) was a Mozambican military commander, revolutionary socialist leader and eventual President of Mozambique. Machel led the country to independence in 1975 until his death in 1986, when his presidential aircraft crashed in mountainous terrain where the borders of Mozambique, Swaziland and South Africa converge.\r\n\r\nSamora Machel was born in the village of Madragoa (today's Chilembene), Gaza Province, Portuguese East Africa (Mozambique), to a family of farmers. He was a member of the Shangana ethnic group and his grandfather had been an active collaborator of Gungunhana. Under Portuguese rule, his father, a native, was forced to accept lower prices for his crops than white farmers; compelled to grow labor-intensive cotton, which took time away from the food crops needed for his family; and forbidden to brand his mark on his cattle to prevent thievery. However, Machel's father was a successful farmer: he owned four plows and 400 head of cattle by 1940. Machel grew up in this farming village and attended mission elementary school. In 1942, he was sent to school in the town of zonguene in Gaza Province. The school was run by Catholic missionaries who educated the children in Portuguese language and culture. Although having completed the fourth grade, Machel never completed his secondary education. However, he had the prerequisite certificate to train as a nurse anywhere in Portugal at the time, since the nursing schools were not degree-conferring institutions. Machel started to study nursing in the capital city of Lourenço Marques (today Maputo), beginning in 1954. In the 1950s, he saw some of the fertile lands around his farming community on the Limpopo river appropriated by the provincial government and worked by white settlers who developed a wide range of new infrastructure for the region. Like many other Mozambicans near the southern border of Mozambique, some of his relatives went to work in the South African mines where additional job opportunities were found. Shortly afterwards, one of his brothers was killed in a mining accident. Unable to complete formal training at the Miguel Bombarda Hospital in Lourenço Marques, he got a job working as an aide in the same hospital and earned enough to continue his education at night school. He worked at the hospital until he left the country to join the Mozambican nationalist struggle in neighbouring Tanzania.\r\n\r\nMachel was attracted to Marxist ideals and began his political activities in the Lourenço Marques hospital where he protested against the fact that black nurses were paid less than whites doing the same job. He later told a reporter how bad medical treatment was for Mozambique's poor: \"The rich man's dog gets more in the way of vaccination, medicine and medical care than do the workers upon whom the rich man's wealth is built.\" His grandparents and great grandparents had fought against Portuguese colonial rule in the 19th century, so it was not surprising that in 1962 Machel joined the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO) which was dedicated to creating an independent Mozambique. He left his first wife and four children behind. He received military training in 1963 elsewhere in Africa, and returned in 1964 to lead FRELIMO's first guerrilla attack against the Portuguese in northern Mozambique. Machel married his second wife, Josina (née Mutemba), in 1969, who gave him a child later that same year. By 1969, Machel had become commander-in-chief of the FRELIMO army which had already established itself among Mozambique's peasantry. His most important goal, he said, was to get the people \"to understand how to turn the armed struggle into a revolution\" and to realize how essential it was \"to create a new mentality to build a new society\". Two months after the assassination of FRELIMO's president, Eduardo Mondlane, in February 1969, a ruling triumvirate comprising Samora Machel, Marcelino dos Santos and Frelimo's vice-president Uria Simango assumed the leadership. Simango was expelled from the party in 1970, and Machel assumed the presidency of the movement.","options":[{"id":3841831,"name":"17 Inch x11 Inch Red","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14405673,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch Red","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":16666931,"name":"17 Inch x11 Inch Yellow","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":16666933,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch Yellow","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50418357/-/Printable_11x17_Samora_Yellow.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50418357/-/Printable_11x17_Samora_Yellow.png","width":643,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/9558291/-/Samora_Red.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/9558291/-/Samora_Red.jpg","width":420,"height":649}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":2175091,"name":"I Protect Trees Poster","permalink":"i-protect-trees-poster","position":51,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/i-protect-trees-poster","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-03-31T12:37:04.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\nTANO Design posters are printed on high-gloss satin finish 10 mil paper.\r\n\r\nDamage to forest ecosystems is affecting everyone in the world through climate change, water scarcity and the loss of biological diversity.

Marcus Garvey was founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL).\r\n\r\nPrior to the twentieth century, leaders such as Prince Hall, Martin Delany, Edward Wilmot Blyden, and Henry Highland Garnet advocated the involvement of the African diaspora in African affairs. Garvey was unique in advancing a Pan-African philosophy to inspire a global mass movement focusing on Africa known as Garveyism. Promoted by the UNIA as a movement of African Redemption, Garveyism would eventually inspire others, ranging from the Nation of Islam, to the Rastafari movement. The intention of the movement was for those of African ancestry to \"redeem\" Africa and for the European colonial powers to leave it. His essential ideas about Africa were stated in an editorial in the Negro World titled “African Fundamentalism” where he wrote:\r\n“ \tOur union must know no clime, boundary, or nationality… let us hold together under all climes and in every country…\"","options":[{"id":12941012,"name":"11 Inch x 17 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12941014,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch ","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27823683/-/Marcus_Garvey_Tano.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27823683/-/Marcus_Garvey_Tano.png","width":420,"height":649},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50306147/-/Marcus_Garvey_Poster_Tano_Design.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50306147/-/Marcus_Garvey_Poster_Tano_Design.png","width":697,"height":461}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":1599381,"name":"Optimist Limited Edition T-shirt","permalink":"optimist-limited-edition-t-shirt","position":54,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/optimist-limited-edition-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-02-15T06:16:52.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none;

She was the first woman in East and Central Africa to earn a doctorate degree. Wangari Maathai obtained a degree in Biological Sciences from Mount St. Scholastica College in Atchison, Kansas (1964). She subsequently earned a Master of Science degree from the University of Pittsburgh (1966). She pursued doctoral studies in Germany and the University of Nairobi, obtaining a Ph.D. (1971) from the University of Nairobi where she also taught veterinary anatomy. She became chair of the Department of Veterinary Anatomy and an associate professor in 1976 and 1977 respectively. In both cases, she was the first woman to attain those positions in the region. Wangari Maathai was active in the National Council of Women of Kenya in 1976-87 and was its chairman in 1981-87. It was while she served in the National Council of Women that she introduced the idea of planting trees with the people in 1976 and continued to develop it into a broad-based, grassroots organization whose main focus is the planting of trees with women groups in order to conserve the environment and improve their quality of life. However, through the Green Belt Movement she has assisted women in planting more than 20 million trees on their farms and on schools and church compounds.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, the Movement established a Pan African Green Belt Network and has exposed over 40 individuals from other African countries to the approach. Some of these individuals have established similar tree planting initiatives in their own countries or they use some of the Green Belt Movement methods to improve their efforts. So far some countries have successfully launched such initiatives in Africa (Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Lesotho, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, etc). In September 1998, she launched a campaign of the Jubilee 2000 Coalition. She has embarked on new challenges, playing a leading global role as a co-chair of the Jubilee 2000 Africa Campaign, which seeks cancellation of the unpayable backlog debts of the poor countries in Africa by the year 2000. Her campaign against land grabbing and rapacious allocation of forests land has caught the limelight in the recent past.\r\n\r\nWangari Maathai is internationally recognized for her persistent struggle for democracy, human rights and environmental conservation. She has addressed the UN on several occasions and spoke on behalf of women at special sessions of the General Assembly for the five-year review of the earth summit. She served on the commission for Global Governance and Commission on the Future. She and the Green Belt Movement have received numerous awards, most notably The 2004 Nobel Peace Prize. Others include The Sophie Prize (2004), The Petra Kelly Prize for Environment (2004), The Conservation Scientist Award (2004), J. Sterling Morton Award (2004), WANGO Environment Award (2003), Outstanding Vision and Commitment Award (2002), Excellence Award from the Kenyan Community Abroad (2001), Golden Ark Award (1994), Juliet Hollister Award (2001), Jane Adams Leadership Award (1993), Edinburgh Medal (1993), The Hunger Project's Africa Prize for Leadership (1991), Goldman Environmental Prize (1991), the Woman of the World (1989), Windstar Award for the Environment (1988), Better World Society Award (1986), Right Livelihood Award (1984) and the Woman of the Year Award (1983). Professor Maathai was also listed on UNEP's Global 500 Hall of Fame and named one of the 100 heroines of the world. In June 1997, Wangari was elected by Earth Times as one of 100 persons in the world who have made a difference in the environmental arena. Professor Maathai has also received honorary doctoral degrees from several institutions around the world: William's College, MA, USA (1990), Hobart & William Smith Colleges (1994), University of Norway (1997) and Yale University (2004).\r\n\r\nThe Green Belt Movement and Professor Wangari Maathai are featured in several publications including The Green Belt Movement: Sharing the Approach (by Professor Wangari Maathai, 2002), Speak Truth to Power (Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, 2000), Women Pioneers for the Environment (Mary Joy Breton, 1998), Hopes Edge: The Next Diet for a Small Planet (Frances Moore Lappé and Anna Lappé, 2002), Una Sola Terra: Donna I Medi Ambient Despres de Rio (Brice Lalonde et al., 1998), Land Ist Leben (Bedrohte Volker, 1993).\r\n\r\nProfessor Maathai served on the boards of several organizations including the UN Secretary General's Advisory Board on Disarmament, The Jane Goodall Institute, Women and Environment Development Organization (WEDO), World Learning for International Development, Green Cross International, Environment Liaison Center International, the WorldWIDE Network of Women in Environmental Work and National Council of Women of Kenya.\r\n\r\nIn December 2002, Professor Maathai was elected to parliament with an overwhelming 98% of the vote. She was subsequently appointed by the president, as Assistant Minister for Environment, Natural Resources and Wildlife in Kenya's ninth parliament.","options":[{"id":14582995,"name":"17 Inch x11 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14582997,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/44242269/-/Wangari_Maathai_October.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/44242269/-/Wangari_Maathai_October.png","width":647,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":1504331,"name":"Tribute Che Guevara T-shirt","permalink":"tribute-che-guevara-t-shirt","position":56,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tribute-che-guevara-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-02-07T14:50:02.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/kMHDXRordYQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/kMHDXRordYQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n\"The softest, smoothest, best-looking T-shirt available anywhere.\" \r\n100% Fine Jersey cotton construction\r\n\r\nErnesto \"Che\" Guevara (pronounced /tʃɛɪ gəˈværə/; Spanish pronunciation: [tʃe geˈβaɾa]; June 14, 1928 – October 9, 1967), commonly known as El Che or simply Che, was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, intellectual, guerrilla leader, diplomat, military theorist, and major figure of the Cuban Revolution. Since his death, his stylized visage has become a ubiquitous countercultural symbol and global insignia within popular culture.\r\n\r\nAs a young medical student, Guevara traveled throughout Latin America and was transformed by the endemic poverty he witnessed. His experiences and observations during these trips led him to conclude that the region's ingrained economic inequalities were an intrinsic result of monopoly capitalism, neocolonialism, and imperialism, with the only remedy being world revolution. This belief prompted his involvement in Guatemala's social reforms under President Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán, whose eventual CIA-assisted overthrow solidified Guevara's radical ideology. Later, while living in Mexico City, he met Raúl and Fidel Castro, joined their 26th of July Movement, and invaded Cuba aboard the Granma with the intention of overthrowing U.S.-backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. Guevara soon rose to prominence among the insurgents, was promoted to second-in-command, and played a pivotal role in the successful two year guerrilla campaign that deposed the Batista regime.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Cuban Revolution, Guevara performed a number of key roles in the new government. These included reviewing the appeals and firing squads for those convicted as war criminals during the revolutionary tribunals, instituting agrarian reform as minister of industries, serving as both national bank president and instructional director for Cuba’s armed forces, and traversing the globe as a diplomat on behalf of Cuban socialism. Such positions allowed him to play a central role in training the militia forces who repelled the Bay of Pigs Invasion and bringing to Cuba the Soviet nuclear-armed ballistic missiles which precipitated the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Additionally, he was a prolific writer and diarist, composing a seminal manual on guerrilla warfare, along with a best-selling memoir about his youthful motorcycle journey across South America. Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to incite revolutions, first unsuccessfully in Congo-Kinshasa and later in Bolivia, where he was captured by Central Intelligence Agency-assisted Bolivian forces and executed.\r\n\r\nGuevara remains both a revered and reviled historical figure, polarized in the collective imagination in a multitude of biographies, memoirs, essays, documentaries, songs, and films. Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century,while an Alberto Korda photograph of him entitled Guerrillero Heroico (shown), was declared \"the most famous photograph in the world.\"","options":[{"id":7557811,"name":"Men Red  S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7557821,"name":"Men Red

in the American Football League. \r\n\r\nAt the 1968 Summer Olympics, Smith won the 200-meter dash finals in 19.83s, the first time the 20 second barrier was broken. During the historic 19th Olympiad held in Mexico City, in the summer of 1968, Tommie Smith broke the world and Olympic records with a time of 19.83 seconds and became the 200-meter Olympic champion.  As the Star Spangled Banner echoed in the wind, at the Mexico City Summer Olympic Games, Tommie Smith and John Carlos stood on the victory podium, draped with their Olympic medals, each raised a clinched fist, covered in a black leather glove in a historic stand for human rights, liberation and solidarity.  This courageous, unexpected worldwide event propelled Tommie Smith into the spotlight as a human rights spokesman, activist, and symbol of African American pride at home and abroad.  Cheered by some, jeered by others, and ignored by many more, Tommie Smith made a commitment to dedicate his life, even at great personal risk, to champion the cause of oppressed people.  The story of the \"silent gesture\" is captured for all time in the 1999 HBO TV documentary, \"Fists of Freedom\".\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tommiesmith.com/bio.html","options":[{"id":14583551,"name":"11 Inch x 17 Inch Green","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14583553,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch Green","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":14583063,"name":"17 Inch x11 Inch Blue","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14583065,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch Blue","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43557227/-/Tano_Tommie_Smith_1968_Mexico_Green.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43557227/-/Tano_Tommie_Smith_1968_Mexico_Green.png","width":520,"height":817},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/10283051/-/Tommie_Smith_1968_Mexico.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/10283051/-/Tommie_Smith_1968_Mexico.png","width":647,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":1046281,"name":"Tribute Malcolm X Poster","permalink":"malcolm-x","position":58,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/malcolm-x","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-12-24T18:27:13.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n<object id=\"flashObj\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,47,0\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&isUI=1\" /><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\" /><param name=\"flashVars\" value=\"videoId=1092845696001&linkBaseURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.biography.com%2Fpeople%2Fmalcolm-x-9396195&playerID=1027481032001&playerKey=AQ~~,AAAA6PL_xMk~,jGNyX3KKlXNx4Jta3h7dYb9BpOaBZDAD&domain=embed&dynamicStreaming=true\" /><param name=\"base\" value=\"http://admin.brightcove.com\" /><param name=\"seamlesstabbing\" value=\"false\" /><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"swLiveConnect\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><embed src=\"http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&isUI=1\" bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" flashVars=\"videoId=1092845696001&linkBaseURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.biography.com%2Fpeople%2Fmalcolm-x-9396195&playerID=1027481032001&playerKey=AQ~~,AAAA6PL_xMk~,jGNyX3KKlXNx4Jta3h7dYb9BpOaBZDAD&domain=embed&dynamicStreaming=true\" base=\"http://admin.brightcove.com\" name=\"flashObj\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" seamlesstabbing=\"false\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" swLiveConnect=\"true\" pluginspage=\"http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash\"></embed></object>\r\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/ENHP89mLWOY?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/ENHP89mLWOY?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n\r\nAll TANO Design posters are printed on high-gloss satin finish 10 mil paper\r\n\r\n\r\nMalcolm X (pronounced /ˈmælkəm ˈɛks/) (born Malcolm Little; May 19, 1925 – February 21, 1965), also known as El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz (Arabic: الحاجّ مالك الشباز‎), was an African-American Muslim minister, public speaker, and human rights activist.To his admirers, he was a courageous advocate for the rights of African Americans, a man who indicted white America in the harshest terms for its crimes against black Americans. His detractors accused him of preaching racism, black supremacy, and violence. He has been described as one of the greatest and most influential African Americans in history.\r\n\r\nMalcolm X was born in Omaha, Nebraska. By the time he was thirteen, his father had died and his mother had been committed to a mental hospital. His childhood, including his father's lessons concerning black pride and self-reliance and his own experiences concerning race, played a significant role in Malcolm X's adult life. After living in a series of foster homes, Malcolm X became involved in hustling and other criminal activities in Boston and New York. In 1946, Malcolm X was sentenced to eight to ten years in prison.\r\n\r\nWhile in prison, Malcolm X became a member of the Nation of Islam. After his parole in 1952, he became one of the Nation's leaders and chief spokesmen. For nearly a dozen years, he was the public face of the Nation of Islam. Tension between Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad, head of the Nation of Islam, led to Malcolm X's departure from the organization in March 1964.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X became a Sunni Muslim and made a pilgrimage to Mecca, after which he disavowed racism. He traveled extensively throughout Africa and the Middle East. He founded Muslim Mosque, Inc., a religious organization, and the secular, black nationalist Organization of Afro-American Unity. Less than a year after he left the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X was assassinated while giving a speech in New York.","options":[{"id":12941048,"name":"11 Inch x 17 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12941050,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch ","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26402156/-/malcolm_X_tano_design_.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26402156/-/malcolm_X_tano_design_.png","width":300,"height":464}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":1077391,"name":"Jomo Kenyatta Poster","permalink":"jomo-kenyatta","position":59,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/jomo-kenyatta","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-12-30T17:06:17.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"300\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/MaeUMjGTuuA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n\r\nAll TANO Design posters are printed on high-gloss satin finish 10 mil paper\r\n\r\n\r\nQuote on Poster Reads: \"You and I must work together to develop our country, to get education for our children, to have doctors, to build roads, to improve or provide all day-to-day essentials.\"\r\nJomo Kenyatta, first president of Kenya, from an Independence Day message to the people, as quoted in Sanford Ungar's Africa, the People and Politics of an Emerging Continent, New York, 1985.\r\n\r\n(born 1894, Ichaweri, —passed August 22, 1978, Mombasa, Kenya) African statesman and nationalist, the first prime minister (1963–64) and then the first president (1964–78) of independent Kenya.\r\n\r\nEarly life\r\n\r\nKenyatta was born as Kamau, son of Ngengi, at Ichaweri, southwest of Mount Kenya in the East African highlands. His father was a leader of a small Kikuyu agricultural settlement. About age 10 Kamau became seriously ill with jigger infections in his feet and one leg, and he underwent successful surgery at a newly established Church of Scotland mission. This was his initial contact with Europeans. Fascinated with what he had seen during his recuperation, Kamau ran away from home to become a resident pupil at the mission. He studied the Bible, English, mathematics, and carpentry and paid his fees by working as a houseboy and cook for a European settler. In August 1914 he was baptized with the name Johnstone Kamau. He was one of the earliest of the Kikuyu to leave the confines of his own culture. And, like many others, Kamau soon left the mission life for the urban attractions of Nairobi.\r\n\r\nThere he secured a job as a clerk in the Public Works Department, and he also adopted the name Kenyatta, the Kikuyu term for a fancy belt that he wore. After serving briefly as an interpreter in the High Court, Kenyatta transferred to a post with the Nairobi Town Council. About this time he married and began to raise a family.\r\n\r\nThe first African political protest movement in Kenya against a white-settler-dominated government began in 1921—the East Africa Association (EAA), led by an educated young Kikuyu named Harry Thuku. Kenyatta joined the following year. One of the EAA's main purposes was to recover Kikuyu lands lost when Kenya became a British crown colony (1920). The Africans were dispossessed, leaseholds of land were restricted to white settlers, and native reservations were established. In 1925 the EAA disbanded as a result of government pressures, and its members re-formed as the Kikuyu Central Association (KCA). Three years later Kenyatta became this organization's general secretary, though he had to give up his municipal job as a consequence.\r\n\r\nRead More: \r\nhttp://www.biography.com/articles/Jomo-Kenyatta-9363416","options":[{"id":4005071,"name":"17Inch x11 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14312551,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch ","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/10011041/-/TANO__Jomo_Kenyatta_.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/10011041/-/TANO__Jomo_Kenyatta_.png","width":360,"height":556}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":1558561,"name":"Tribute Marcus Garvey T-shirt","permalink":"tribute-marcus-garvey-t-shirt","position":60,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tribute-marcus-garvey-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-02-11T12:20:32.000Z","description":"All Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n\"The softest, smoothest, best-looking T-shirt available anywhere.\" \r\n100% Fine Jersey cotton construction by Puma and American Apparel\r\n\r\n\r\nMarcus Mosiah Garvey, Jr., ONH (17 August 1887 – 10 June 1940) was a publisher, journalist, entrepreneur, Black Nationalist, Pan-Africanist, and orator. Marcus Garvey was founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL).\r\n\r\nPrior to the twentieth century, leaders such as Prince Hall, Martin Delany, Edward Wilmot Blyden, and Henry Highland Garnet advocated the involvement of the African diaspora in African affairs. Garvey was unique in advancing a Pan-African philosophy to inspire a global mass movement focusing on Africa known as Garveyism. Promoted by the UNIA as a movement of African Redemption, Garveyism would eventually inspire others, ranging from the Nation of Islam, to the Rastafari movement. The intention of the movement was for those of African ancestry to \"redeem\" Africa and for the European colonial powers to leave it. His essential ideas about Africa were stated in an editorial in the Negro World titled “African Fundamentalism” where he wrote:\r\n“ Our union must know no clime, boundary, or nationality… let us hold together under all climes and in every country…\"\r\n","options":[{"id":10615963,"name":"Men S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10615965,"name":"Men M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10615967,"name":"Men L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10615969,"name":"Men XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10615971,"name":"Men XXL","price":25.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":10615973,"name":"Women S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10615975,"name":"Women M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10615977,"name":"Women L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10615979,"name":"Women XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10615981,"name":"Men Red S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10615983,"name":"Men Red M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10615985,"name":"Men Red L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10615987,"name":"Men Red XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10615989,"name":"Men Red XXL","price":25.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":10615991,"name":"Women Red S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10615993,"name":"Women Red M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10615995,"name":"Women Red L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10615997,"name":"Women Red XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30050421/-/Men_Black_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30050421/-/Men_Black_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30050433/-/Men_Red_Marcus_Garvey_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30050433/-/Men_Red_Marcus_Garvey_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/14776371/-/TANO_Marcus_Garvey.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/14776371/-/TANO_Marcus_Garvey.png","width":420,"height":649}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":1348561,"name":"Tribute Frantz Fanon T-shirt","permalink":"frantz-fanon-t-shirt","position":61,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/frantz-fanon-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-01-25T21:58:13.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n100% Fine Jersey cotton construction\r\n \t\r\n\"The softest, smoothest, best-looking T-shirt available anywhere.\" \r\n100% Fine Jersey cotton construction by Puma and American Apparel\r\n\r\nFrantz Fanon (July 20, 1925 – December 6, 1961) was a psychiatrist, philosopher, revolutionary, and author from Martinique. He was influential in the field of post-colonial studies and was perhaps the pre-eminent thinker of the 20th century on the issue of decolonization and the psychopathology of colonization. His works have inspired anti-colonial liberation movements for more than four decades.\r\n\r\nFrantz Fanon was born on the Caribbean island of Martinique, which was then a French colony and is now a French departement. He was born into a mixed family background: his father was the descendant of African slaves, and his mother was said to be an illegitimate child of mixed race, whose white ancestors came from Strasbourg in Alsace. Fanon's family was socioeconomically middle-class, and they could afford the fees for the Lycée Schoelcher, then the most prestigious high school in Martinique, where famed poet Aimé Césaire was one of his teachers.\r\n\r\nAfter France fell to the Nazis in 1940, Vichy French naval troops were blockaded on Martinique. Many accusations of harassment and sexual misconduct arose. The abuse of the Martiniquan people by the French Army was a major influence on Fanon, as it reinforced his feelings of alienation and his disgust at the realities of colonial racism. At the age of eighteen, Fanon fled the island as a \"dissident\" (the coined word for French West Indians joining the gaullist forces) and traveled to then-British colony Dominica to join the Free French Forces. He later enlisted in the French army and joined an Allied convoy that arrived in Casablanca. He was later transferred to an army base at Bejaia on the Kabyle coast of Algeria. Fanon left Algeria from Oran and saw service in France, notably in the battles of Alsace. In 1944 he was wounded at Colmar and received the Croix de Guerre medal. When the Nazis were defeated and Allied forces crossed the Rhine into Germany, along with photo journalists, Fanon's regiment was \"bleached\" of all non-white soldiers and Fanon and his fellow Caribbean soldiers were sent to Toulon (Provence) instead.[citation needed] Later, they were transferred to Normandy to await repatriation home.\r\n\r\nIn 1945 Fanon returned to Martinique. His return lasted only a short time. While there, he worked for the parliamentary campaign of his friend and mentor Aimé Césaire, who would be the greatest influence in his life. Although Fanon never professed to be a communist[citation needed], Césaire ran on the communist ticket as a parliamentary delegate from Martinique to the first National Assembly of the Fourth Republic. Fanon stayed long enough to complete his Baccalaureate and then went to France where he studied medicine and psychiatry. He was educated in Lyon where he also studied literature, drama and philosophy, sometimes attending Merleau-Ponty's lectures. During this period he wrote three plays, whose manuscripts are now lost. After qualifying as a psychiatrist in 1951, Fanon did a residency in psychiatry at Saint-Alban under the radical Catalan psychiatrist Francois Tosquelles, who invigorated Fanon's thinking by emphasizing the important yet often overlooked role of culture in psychopathology. After his residency, Fanon practiced psychiatry at Pontorson, near Mont St Michel, for another year and then (from 1953) in Algeria. He was chef de service at the Blida-Joinville Psychiatric Hospital in Algeria, where he stayed until his deportation in January 1957.\r\n\r\nHis service in France's army (and his experiences in Martinique) fueled Black Skin, White Masks. For Fanon, being colonized by a language had larger implications for one's political consciousness: \"To speak . . . means above all to assume a culture, to support the weight of a civilization\" (BSWM 17-18). Speaking French means that one accepts, or is coerced into accepting, the collective consciousness of the French.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":4949941,"name":"Men S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4949951,"name":"Men M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4949961,"name":"Men L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4949971,"name":"Men XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4949981,"name":"Men XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4949991,"name":"Women S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4950001,"name":"Women M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5346081,"name":"Women L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5346101,"name":"Women XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30021405/-/Fanon_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30021405/-/Fanon_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/12970871/-/Frantz_Fanon_original.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/12970871/-/Frantz_Fanon_original.png","width":600,"height":927}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":1359511,"name":"Tribute Steve Biko T-shirt","permalink":"steve-biko-77-t-shirt","position":62,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/steve-biko-77-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-01-26T19:42:43.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n100% Fine Jersey cotton construction\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen Bantu Biko (18 December 1946 – 12 September 1977) was a noted anti-apartheid activist in South Africa in the 1960s and 1970s.

Africa is the 2nd largest continent after Asia with a population of approximately 1 billion people. \r\n\r\nIn the late nineteenth century, the European imperial  powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent, creating many colonial territories, and leaving only two fully independent states: Ethiopia (then known as \"Abyssinia\"), and Liberia. Egypt and Sudan  were never incorporated into any European colonial empire, however, after the British occupation of 1882, the country was effectively under British administration until 1922. Imperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II, when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence.\r\n\r\nIndependence movements in Africa gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, Libya, a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, Tunisia and Morocco won their independence from France. Ghana followed suit the next year.

The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. The current champions are Spain, who won the 2010 tournament, and will defend their title, subject to qualification, at the next tournament, to be held in Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe current format of the tournament involves 32 teams competing for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about a month – this phase is often called the World Cup Finals. A qualification phase, which currently takes place over the preceding three years, is used to determine which teams qualify for the tournament together with the host nation(s).\r\n\r\nThe 19 tournaments that have been contested have been won by eight different national teams. Brazil have won the World Cup a record five times, and they are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other teams which have won the World Cup are: Italy, with four titles; Germany, with three titles; Uruguay, winners of the inaugural tournament, and Argentina, with two titles each; and England, France, and Spain, with one title each.\r\n\r\nThe World Cup is the world's most widely viewed sporting event; an estimated 715.1 million people watched the final match of the 2006 FIFA World Cup held in Germany.

The groove usually starts near the periphery and ends near the centre of the disc. Phonograph records are generally described by their size (\"12-inch\", \"10-inch\", \"7-inch\", etc.), the rotational speed they are played at (\"33\", \"45\", \"78\", etc.), their time capacity (\"Long Playing\"), their reproductive accuracy, or \"fidelity\", or the number of channels of audio provided (\"Mono\", \"Stereo\", \"Quadraphonic\", etc.) \r\n\r\nGramophone records were the primary medium used for commercial music reproduction for most of the 20th century, replacing the phonograph cylinder, with which they had co-existed, by the 1920s. By the late 1980s, digital media had gained a larger market share, and the vinyl record left the mainstream in 1991. However, they continue to be manufactured and sold in the 21st century. The vinyl record regained popularity by 2008, with nearly 2.9 million units shipped that year, the most in any year since 1998. They are used predominantly by young adults, as well as DJs and audiophiles for many types of music. As of 2009, vinyl records continue to be used for distribution of independent and alternative music artists.

Africa is the 2nd largest continent after Asia with a population of approximately 1 billion people. \r\n\r\nIn the late nineteenth century, the European imperial  powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent, creating many colonial territories, and leaving only two fully independent states: Ethiopia (then known as \"Abyssinia\"), and Liberia. Egypt and Sudan  were never incorporated into any European colonial empire, however, after the British occupation of 1882, the country was effectively under British administration until 1922. Imperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II, when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence.\r\n\r\nIndependence movements in Africa gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, Libya, a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, Tunisia and Morocco won their independence from France. Ghana followed suit the next year.  Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade, most often through relatively peaceful means, though in some countries, notably Algeria, it came only after a violent struggle.

She had, however, already been detained under house arrest before the elections. She has remained under house arrest in Myanmar for almost 14 out of the past 20 years.\r\n\r\nSuu Kyi was the recipient of the Rafto Prize and the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 1990 and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. In 1992 she was awarded the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding by the Government of India.\r\n\r\nAung San Suu Kyi was born on 19 June 1945 in Rangoon.  Her father, Aung San, founded the modern Burmese army and negotiated Burma's independence from the United Kingdom in 1947; he was assassinated by his rivals in the same year. She grew up with her mother, Khin Kyi, and two brothers, Aung San Lin and Aung San Oo in Rangoon. Her favourite brother Aung San Lin died at age eight, when he drowned in an ornamental lake in the grounds of the house. Her elder brother emigrated to San Diego, California, becoming a United States citizen.[ After Lin's death, the family moved to a house by Inya Lake where she met people of very different backgrounds, political views and religions. Suu Kyi was educated in English Catholic schools for much of her childhood in Burma where she was noted as having a talent for learning languages. She is a Theravada Buddhist.\r\n\r\nSuu Kyi's mother, Daw Khin Kyi, gained prominence as a political figure in the newly formed Burmese government. She was appointed Burmese ambassador to India and Nepal in 1960, and Aung San Suu Kyi followed her there, graduating from Lady Shri Ram College with a degree in politics in New Delhi in 1964. Suu Kyi continued her education at St Hugh's College, Oxford, obtaining a B.A. degree in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics in 1969. After graduating, she lived in New York City with a family friend and worked at the United Nations for three years, primarily on budget matters, writing daily to her future husband Dr. Michael Aris. In 1972, Aung San Suu Kyi married Aris, a scholar of Tibetan culture, living abroad in Bhutan. The following year she gave birth to their first son, Alexander Aris, in London; their second son, Kim, was born in 1977. Following this, she earned a Ph.D. at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London in 1985. She was elected an Honorary Fellow in 1990. For two years she was a Fellow at the Indian Institute of Advanced Studies (IIAS)in Shimla, India. She also worked for the government of the Union of Burma.\r\n\r\nIn 1988 Suu Kyi returned to Burma at first to tend for her ailing mother but later to lead the pro-democracy movement. Aris’s visit in Christmas 1995 turned out to be the last time that he and Suu Kyi met, as Suu Kyi remained in Burma and the Burmese dictatorship denied him any further entry visas.Aris was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997 which was later found to be terminal. Despite appeals from prominent figures and organizations, including the United States, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and Pope John Paul II, the Burmese government would not grant Aris a visa, saying that they did not have the facilities to care for him, and instead urged Aung San Suu Kyi to leave the country to visit him. She was at that time temporarily free from house arrest but was unwilling to depart, fearing that she would be refused re-entry if she left, as she did not trust the junta's assurance that she could return.\r\n\r\nAris died on his 53rd birthday on 27 March 1999. Since 1989, when his wife was first placed under house arrest, he had seen her only five times, the last of which was for Christmas in 1995. She also remains separated from her children, who live in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nOn 2 May 2008, after Cyclone Nargis hit Burma, Suu Kyi lost her roof and was living in virtual darkness after losing electricity in her dilapidated lakeside residence. She used candles at night as she was not provided any generator set. Plans to renovate and repair the house were announced in August 2009.","options":[{"id":4492011,"name":"17Inch x11 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14312649,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch ","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25263140/-/A3_PRINT_Aung_San_Suu_Kyi_Original.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25263140/-/A3_PRINT_Aung_San_Suu_Kyi_Original.png","width":390,"height":603}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":1048291,"name":"Tribute Maya Angelou Poster","permalink":"maya-angelou","position":69,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/maya-angelou","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-12-25T06:16:20.000Z","description":"All Rights Reserved ©\r\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/LyHqafC740Q?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/LyHqafC740Q?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n\r\nAll TANO Design posters are printed on high-gloss satin finish 10 mil paper\r\n\r\nDr. Maya Angelou is one of the most renowned and influential voices of our time. Hailed as a global renaissance woman, Dr. Angelou is a celebrated poet, memoirist, novelist, educator, dramatist, producer, actress, historian, filmmaker, and civil rights activist.\r\n\r\nBorn on April 4th, 1928, in St. Louis, Missouri, Dr. Angelou was raised in St. Louis and Stamps, Arkansas. In Stamps, Dr. Angelou experienced the brutality of racial discrimination, but she also absorbed the unshakable faith and values of traditional African-American family, community, and culture.\r\n\r\nAs a teenager, Dr. Angelou’s love for the arts won her a scholarship to study dance and drama at San Francisco’s Labor School. At 14, she dropped out to become San Francisco’s first African-American female cable car conductor. She later finished high school, giving birth to her son, Guy, a few weeks after graduation. As a young single mother, she supported her son by working as a waitress and cook, however her passion for music, dance, performance, and poetry would soon take center stage.\r\n\r\nIn 1954 and 1955, Dr. Angelou toured Europe with a production of the opera Porgy and Bess. She studied modern dance with Martha Graham, danced with Alvin Ailey on television variety shows and, in 1957, recorded her first album, Calypso Lady. In 1958, she moved to New York, where she joined the Harlem Writers Guild, acted in the historic Off-Broadway production of Jean Genet's The Blacks and wrote and performed Cabaret for Freedom.\r\n\r\nIn 1960, Dr. Angelou moved to Cairo, Egypt where she served as editor of the English language weekly The Arab Observer. The next year, she moved to Ghana where she taught at the University of Ghana's School of Music and Drama, worked as feature editor for The African Review and wrote for The Ghanaian Times.\r\n\r\nDuring her years abroad, Dr. Angelou read and studied voraciously, mastering French, Spanish, Italian, Arabic and the West African language Fanti. While in Ghana, she met with Malcolm X and, in 1964, returned to America to help him build his new Organization of African American Unity.\r\n\r\nShortly after her arrival in the United States, Malcolm X was assassinated, and the organization dissolved. Soon after X's assassination, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. asked Dr. Angelou to serve as Northern Coordinator for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. King's assassination, falling on her birthday in 1968, left her devastated.\r\n\r\nWith the guidance of her friend, the novelist James Baldwin, she began work on the book that would become I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. Published in 1970, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings was published to international acclaim and enormous popular success. The list of her published verse, non-fiction, and fiction now includes more than 30 bestselling titles.\r\n\r\nA trailblazer in film and television, Dr. Angelou wrote the screenplay and composed the score for the 1972 film Georgia, Georgia. Her script, the first by an African American woman ever to be filmed, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.\r\n\r\nShe continues to appear on television and in films including the landmark television adaptation of Alex Haley's Roots (1977) and John Singleton's Poetic Justice (1993). In 1996, she directed her first feature film, Down in the Delta. In 2008, she composed poetry for and narrated the award-winning documentary The Black Candle, directed by M.K. Asante, Jr.\r\n\r\nDr. Angelou has served on two presidential committees, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Arts in 2000, the Lincoln Medal in 2008, and has received 3 Grammy Awards. President Clinton requested that she compose a poem to read at his inauguration in 1993. Dr. Angelou's reading of her poem \"On the Pulse of the Morning\" was broadcast live around the world.\r\n\r\nDr. Angelou has received over 30 honorary degrees and is Reynolds Professor of American Studies at Wake Forest University.\r\n\r\nDr. Angelou’s words and actions continue to stir our souls, energize our bodies, liberate our minds, and heal our hearts.","options":[{"id":12941026,"name":"11 Inch x 17 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12941028,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch ","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/13784691/-/A3_MAYA_ORIGINAL_11x17.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/13784691/-/A3_MAYA_ORIGINAL_11x17.png","width":625,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":2191071,"name":"I Love Indie Film T-shirt","permalink":"i-love-indie-film-t-shirt","position":70,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/i-love-indie-film-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-04-01T15:05:03.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n\"The softest, smoothest, best-looking T-shirt available anywhere.\" \r\n100% Fine Jersey cotton construction\r\n\r\n   \t <a href=\"http://www.americanapparel.net\" target=\"new\"><img src=\"http://www.americanapparel.net/wholesaleresources/images/weuse.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"We Use American Apparel - Click to learn more\" width=\"135\" height=\"42\"></a\r\n\r\nAn independent film, or indie film, is a film  that is produced mostly outside of a major film studio. The term also refers to art films which differ markedly from most mass marketed films. In addition to being produced by independent production companies, independent films are often produced and/or distributed by subsidiaries of major studios. In order to be considered independent, less than half of a film's financing should come from a major studio. Independent films are sometimes distinguishable by their content and style and the way in which the filmmakers' personal artistic vision is realized. Usually, but not always, independent films are made with considerably lower budgets than major studio films. Generally, the marketing of independent films is characterized by limited release designed to build word-of-mouth or to reach small specialty audiences.\r\n","options":[{"id":7888531,"name":"Men S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7888541,"name":"Men M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7888551,"name":"Men L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7888561,"name":"Men XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7888571,"name":"Men XXL","price":25.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":7888581,"name":"Women S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7888591,"name":"Women M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7888601,"name":"Women L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7888611,"name":"Women XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30023589/-/Black_Indie_Film_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30023589/-/Black_Indie_Film_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/21011731/-/I_love_Indie_Film_RBG.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/21011731/-/I_love_Indie_Film_RBG.jpg","width":480,"height":742}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":2950803,"name":"Tribute John Coltrane","permalink":"tribute-john-coltrane","position":71,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tribute-john-coltrane","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-11-30T03:09:37.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/olOYynQ-_Hw?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/olOYynQ-_Hw?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nJohn William Coltrane (sometimes abbreviated \"Trane\"; September 23, 1926 – July 17, 1967, was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes in jazz and later was at the forefront of free jazz. He was prolific, organizing at least fifty recording sessions as a leader during his recording career, and appeared as a sideman on many other albums, notably with trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk.\r\n\r\nAs his career progressed, Coltrane and his music took on an increasingly spiritual dimension. His second wife was pianist Alice Coltrane, and their son Ravi Coltrane is also a saxophonist. Coltrane influenced innumerable musicians, and remains one of the most significant tenor saxophonists in jazz history. He received many posthumous awards and recognition, including a beatification by the African Orthodox Church. In 2007, Coltrane was awarded the Pulitzer Prize Special Citation for his \"masterful improvisation, supreme musicianship and iconic centrality to the history of jazz.","options":[{"id":10206403,"name":"17 Inch x 11 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14312663,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch ","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/28615979/-/JOHN_COLltrane_copy.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/28615979/-/JOHN_COLltrane_copy.png","width":480,"height":754}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":1348451,"name":"Tribute Wole Soyinka T-shirt","permalink":"wole-soyinka-t-shirt","position":72,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wole-soyinka-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-01-25T21:48:20.000Z","description":"All Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n100% Fine Jersey cotton construction\r\n\r\n   \t <a href=\"http://www.americanapparel.net\" target=\"new\"><img src=\"http://www.americanapparel.net/wholesaleresources/images/weuse2.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"We Use American Apparel - Click to learn more\" width=\"135\" height=\"30\"></a> \r\n\r\nAkinwande Oluwole \"Wole\" Soyinka (born 13 July 1934) is a Nigerian writer, poet and playwright. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1986, the first African to be so honoured. In 1994, he was designated United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Goodwill Ambassador for the promotion of African culture, human rights, freedom of expression, media and communication.\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent members of the eminent Ransome-Kuti family, his mother Grace Eniola, was the daughter of Rev. Cannon JJ Ransome-Kuti, sister to Olusegun Azariah Ransome-Kuti and Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, making Soyinka cousins to the late Fela Kuti, the late Beko Ransome-Kuti, the late Olikoye Ransome-Kuti and Yemisi Ransome-Kuti.\r\n\r\nSoyinka was born into a Yoruba family, specifically, a Remo family in Isara-Remo on July 13, 1934. His father was Christian Clergy, Canon SA Soyinka (aka \"Teacher pupa\" (light skinned teacher). He received a primary school education in Abeokuta and attended secondary school at Government College, Ibadan. He then studied at the University College, Ibadan (1952-1954) where he founded the pyrates confraternity (an anti-corruption and justice seeking student organization) and the University of Leeds (1954-1957) from which he received an First class honours degree in English Literature. He worked as a play reader at the Royal Court Theatre in London before returning to Nigeria to study African drama. He taught in the Universities of Lagos, Ibadan, and Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife). He became a Professor of Comparative Literature at the then University of Ife in 1975). He is currently an Emeritus Professor at the same university.\r\n\r\nSoyinka has played an active role in Nigeria's political history. In 1965, he made a broadcast demanding the cancellation of the rigged Western Nigeria Regional Elections following his seizure of the Western Nigeria Broadcasting Service studio. He was arrested, arraigned but freed on a technicality by Justice Esho. In 1967, during the Nigerian Civil War he was arrested by the Federal Government of General Yakubu Gowon and put in solitary confinement for his attempts at brokering a peace between the warring Nigerian and Biafran parties. While in prison he wrote poetry on tissue paper which was published in a collection titled Poems from Prison. He was released 22 months later after international attention was drawn to his unwarranted imprisonment. His experiences in prison are recounted in his book The Man Died: Prison Notes of Wole Soyinka (1972).\r\n\r\nHe has been an implacable, consistent and outspoken critic of many Nigerian military dictators, and of political tyrannies worldwide, including the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe. A great deal of his writing has been concerned with \"the oppressive boot and the irrelevance of the colour of the foot that wears it\". This activism has often exposed him to great personal risk, most notable during the government of General Sani Abacha (1993-1998), which pronounced a death sentence on him \"in absentia\". During Abacha's regime, Soyinka escaped from Nigeria via the \"Nadeco Route\" on motorcycle. While abroad, he visited parliaments and conferred with world leaders to impose a regime of sanctions against the brutal Abacha regime. These actions and his setting up of the Radio Kudirat helped immensely in securing Nigeria's return to civilian democratic governance. While living abroad (mainly in the United States, he was a professor at Emory University in Atlanta). When civilian rule returned in 1999, Soyinka returned to a hero's welcome back in Lagos, Nigeria. He accepted an Emeritus Professorship at Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) on the condition that the university bar all former military officers from the position of chancellor.

In these early stages, it is impossible to predict what \"green technology\" may eventually encompass.\r\n\r\nThe goals that inform developments in this rapidly growing field include:\r\n\r\nSustainability - meeting the needs of society in ways that can continue indefinitely into the future without damaging or depleting natural resources. In short, meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\r\n\r\n\"Cradle to cradle\" design - ending the \"cradle to grave\" cycle of manufactured products, by creating products that can be fully reclaimed or re-used.\r\n\r\nSource reduction - reducing waste and pollution by changing patterns of production and consumption.\r\n\r\nInnovation - developing alternatives to technologies - whether fossil fuel or chemical intensive agriculture - that have been demonstrated to damage health and the environment.\r\n\r\nViability - creating a center of economic activity around technologies and products that benefit the environment, speeding their implementation and creating new careers that truly protect the planet.\r\n\r\nExamples of green technology subject areas\r\n\r\nEnergy\r\nPerhaps the most urgent issue for green technology, this includes the development of alternative fuels, new means of generating energy and energy efficiency.\r\n\r\nGreen building\r\nGreen building encompasses everything from the choice of building materials to where a building is located.\r\n\r\nEnvironmentally preferred purchasing\r\nThis government innovation involves the search for products whose contents and methods of production have the smallest possible impact on the environment, and mandates that these be the preferred products for government purchasing.\r\n\r\nGreen chemistry\r\nThe invention, design and application of chemical products and processes to reduce or to eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances.\r\n\r\nGreen nanotechnology\r\nNanotechnology involves the manipulation of materials at the scale of the nanometer, one billionth of a meter. Some scientists believe that mastery of this subject is forthcoming that will transform the way that everything in the world is manufactured. \"Green nanotechnology\" is the application of green chemistry and green engineering principles to this field.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.green-technology.org/\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":8418671,"name":"Men Black S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8418681,"name":"Men Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8418691,"name":"Men Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8418701,"name":"Men Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8418711,"name":"Men Black XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8418721,"name":"Women Black S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8418731,"name":"Women Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8418741,"name":"Women Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8418751,"name":"Women Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8418761,"name":"Men Red  S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8418771,"name":"Men Red M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8418781,"name":"Men Red L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8418791,"name":"Men Red XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8418801,"name":"Men Red XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8418811,"name":"Women Red S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8418821,"name":"Women Red M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8418831,"name":"Women Red L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8418841,"name":"Women Red XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30022997/-/Black_Carbon_Zero_t-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30022997/-/Black_Carbon_Zero_t-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30023013/-/Red_Carbon_Zero_t-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30023013/-/Red_Carbon_Zero_t-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30023021/-/CARBON_ZERO.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30023021/-/CARBON_ZERO.png","width":647,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":2271051,"name":"Tribute Paul Robeson T-shirt","permalink":"tribute-paul-robeson-t-shirt","position":75,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tribute-paul-robeson-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-04-08T03:45:26.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/eh9WayN7R-s?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/eh9WayN7R-s?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nQuote on Shirt: “As an artist I come to sing, but as a citizen, I will always speak for peace, and no one can silence me.\"\r\n\r\nPaul Robeson was the epitome of the 20th-century Renaissance man. He was an exceptional athlete, actor, singer, cultural scholar, author, and political activist. His talents made him a revered man of his time, yet his radical political beliefs all but erased him from popular history. Today, more than one hundred years after his birth, Robeson is just beginning to receive the credit he is due.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1898, Paul Robeson grew up in Princeton, New Jersey. His father had escaped slavery and become a Presbyterian minister, while his mother was from a distinguished Philadelphia family. At seventeen, he was given a scholarship to Rutgers University, where he received an unprecedented twelve major letters in four years and was his class valedictorian. After graduating he went on to Columbia University Law School, and, in the early 1920s, took a job with a New York law firm. Racial strife at the firm ended Robeson’s career as a lawyer early, but he was soon to find an appreciative home for his talents.\r\n\r\nReturning to his love of public speaking, Robeson began to find work as an actor. In the mid-1920s he played the lead in Eugene O’Neill’s “All God’s Chillun Got Wings” (1924) and “The Emperor Jones” (1925). Throughout the late 1920s and 1930s, he was a widely acclaimed actor and singer. With songs such as his trademark “Ol’ Man River,” he became one of the most popular concert singers of his time. His “Othello” was the longest-running Shakespeare play in Broadway history, running for nearly three hundred performances. It is still considered one of the great-American Shakespeare productions. While his fame grew in the United States, he became equally well-loved internationally. He spoke fifteen languages, and performed benefits throughout the world for causes of social justice. More than any other performer of his time, he believed that the famous have a responsibility to fight for justice and peace.\r\n\r\nAs an actor, Robeson was one of the first black men to play serious roles in the primarily white American theater. He performed in a number of films as well, including a re-make of “The Emperor Jones” (1933) and “Song of Freedom” (1936). In a time of deeply entrenched racism, he continually struggled for further understanding of cultural difference. At the height of his popularity, Robeson was a national symbol and a cultural leader in the war against fascism abroad and racism at home. He was admired and befriended by both the general public and prominent personalities, including Eleanor Roosevelt, W.E.B. Du Bois, Joe Louis, Pablo Neruda, Lena Horne, and Harry Truman. While his varied talents and his outspoken defense of civil liberties brought him many admirers, it also made him enemies among conservatives trying to maintain the status quo.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1940s, Robeson’s black nationalist and anti-colonialist activities brought him to the attention of Senator Joseph McCarthy. Despite his contributions as an entertainer to the Allied forces during World War II, Robeson was singled out as a major threat to American democracy. Every attempt was made to silence and discredit him, and in 1950 the persecution reached a climax when his passport was revoked. He could no longer travel abroad to perform, and his career was stifled. Of this time, Lloyd Brown, a writer and long-time colleague of Robeson, states: “Paul Robeson was the most persecuted, the most ostracized, the most condemned black man in America, then or ever.”\r\n\r\nIt was eight years before his passport was reinstated. A weary and triumphant Robeson began again to travel and give concerts in England and Australia. But the years of hardship had taken their toll. After several bouts of depression, he was admitted to a hospital in London, where he was administered continued shock treatments. When Robeson returned to the United States in 1963, he was misdiagnosed several times and treated for a variety of physical and psychological problems. Realizing that he was no longer the powerful singer or agile orator of his prime, he decided to step out of the public eye. He retired to Philadelphia and lived in self-imposed seclusion until his death in 1976.\r\n\r\nTo this day, Paul Robeson’s many accomplishments remain obscured by the propaganda of those who tirelessly dogged him throughout his life. His role in the history of civil rights and as a spokesperson for the oppressed of other nations remains relatively unknown. In 1995, more than seventy-five years after graduating from Rutgers, his athletic achievements were finally recognized with his posthumous entry into the College Football Hall of Fame. Though a handful of movies and recordings are still available, they are a sad testament to one of the greatest Americans of the twentieth century. If we are to remember Paul Robeson for anything, it should be for the courage and the dignity with which he struggled for his own personal voice and for the rights of all people.\r\n\r\nAlex La Guma on Paul Robeson(Paper delivered at a symposium on \"Paul Robeson and the Afro-American Struggle\", held at the Academy of Arts, Berlin, in the German Democratic Republic, on April 13-14, 1971. From African Communist, No. 46, Third Quarter 1971)\r\n\r\nI think that his outlook as an artist is significantly illustrated by a speech made in the Albert Hall London at a rally in support of the Spanish republic, and reported in the South African anti-imperialist magazine, The Liberator, in 1937. Paul Robeson said then:\r\n\r\n\"Every artist, every scientist, must decide now where he stands. He has no alternative. There is no standing above the conflict on Olympian heights. .. The battlefield is everywhere, there is no sheltered rear..... Fascism fights to destroy the culture which Society has created; created through pain and suffering, through desperate toil, but with unconquerable will and lofty vision . . - What matters a man's profession or vocation? Fascism is no respector of persons. It makes no distinction between combatants and non-combatants... The artist must take sides; he must elect to fight for freedom or for slavery. I have made my choice. I have no alternative. The history of the capitalist era is characterized by the degradation of my people; despoiled of their lands, their women ravished, their culture destroyed... I say the true artist cannot hold himself aloof. The legacy of culture from our predecessors is in danger. It is the foundation upon which we build a still more lofty edifice. It belongs not only to us, not only to the present generation it belongs to posterity and must be defended to the death.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/solidarity/robeson-laguma.html","options":[{"id":8155051,"name":"Men S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8155061,"name":"Men M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8155071,"name":"Men L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8155081,"name":"Men XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8155091,"name":"Men XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8155101,"name":"Women S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8155111,"name":"Women M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8155121,"name":"Women L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8155131,"name":"Women XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30023325/-/Men_Brown_Robeson_T_Shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30023325/-/Men_Brown_Robeson_T_Shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/21830231/-/TANO_Paul_Robeson_Original.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/21830231/-/TANO_Paul_Robeson_Original.png","width":600,"height":927}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":2635490,"name":"Asamoah Gyan T-shirt","permalink":"asamoah-gyan-t-shirt","position":76,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/asamoah-gyan-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-06-29T18:56:13.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n\r\nAsamoah Gyan, born 22 November 1985 in Accra, is a Ghanaian International football player who plays as a striker for Stade Rennais in the French Ligue 1. He had his high school education at Accra Academy where he played in the school's soccer team.\r\n\r\nIn November 2003 Gyan scored his first international goal at the age of seventeen against Somalia making him the youngest ever player to score for Ghana. Gyan also scored the fastest goal of the 2006 FIFA World Cup; a 68-seconds goal, which also happened to be Ghana's first ever goal in the world cup finals, in the World Cup game against the Czech Republic on 17 June 2006 at the RheinEnergieStadion in Cologne, Germany, which set the Black Stars on their way to a thrilling 2–0 victory. He missed a penalty later in the game, and received a yellow card  (ruling him out of the final group game) for trying to take the penalty too early. In Ghana's defeat  to Brazil in the Round of 16, he was sent off in the 81st minute after collecting his second booking of the match (for diving).\r\n\r\nHe was part of the 2004 Ghana Olympic football squad, who exited in the first round, having finished in third place in Group B after Ghana was tied on 4 points, 0 goal difference and 2–2 Head-to-Head with eventual bronze medalists Italy. Ghana had scored 4 and conceded 4.\r\n\r\nGyan scored on his senior International debut for Ghana against Somalia on 19 November 2003 in the 90th minute, after coming on for Isaac Boakye in the 62nd minute in a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifier, 3 days before he turned 18 years; helping Ghana to win that game. He went on to score four times in seven matches during that successful World Cup qualifying campaign. He has scored 20 times in 32 appearances for Ghana.\r\n\r\nOn January 24, 2008 during the 2008 African Cup of Nations Gyan and his brother Baffour decided to walk out on the Black Stars following criticism after their unconvincing 1–0 win over Namibia. The media learnt the brothers had packed their bags and were ready to leave the team hotel but were persuaded to stay by team-mates[14]. In the 2010 African Cup of Nations, Asamoah Gyan helped a Ghana team, ravaged by injuries to the finals. Gyan scored three out of the four Ghana goals during the tournament.\r\n\r\nGyan scored with a penalty in the 85th minute of Ghana's first match of the 2010 FIFA World Cup against Serbia, which proved to be the deciding goal in a 1–0 win. He went on to hit the post in the 92nd minute before being substituted to a standing ovation just before the final whistle. In Ghana's second game, he scored a penalty in the 26th minute to level the scores and earn his team a 1–1 draw against Australia.\r\n\r\nIn the round of 16 match against the U.S.A., he scored a goal in extra time allowing Ghana to win by a score of 2-1 and hence become the third African team in history to qualify to the tournament's quarter final, after Cameroon and Senegal.","options":[{"id":9317188,"name":"Men Red S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9317189,"name":"Men Red M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9317190,"name":"Men Red L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9317191,"name":"Men Red XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9317192,"name":"Men Red XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9317197,"name":"Women Red S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9317198,"name":"Women Red M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9317199,"name":"Women Red L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9317200,"name":"Women Red XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9440890,"name":"Men Black S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9440898,"name":"Men Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9440897,"name":"Men Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9440896,"name":"Men Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9440895,"name":"Men Black XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9440894,"name":"Women Black S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9440893,"name":"Women Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9440892,"name":"Women Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9440891,"name":"Women Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30022829/-/Red_Gyan_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30022829/-/Red_Gyan_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30022821/-/Black_Gyan_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30022821/-/Black_Gyan_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25396519/-/Asamoah_Gyan_Yellow_Tano_Design_.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25396519/-/Asamoah_Gyan_Yellow_Tano_Design_.png","width":450,"height":695}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":1016181,"name":"Miriam Makeba - Mama Africa Poster","permalink":"makeba","position":77,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/makeba","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-12-20T14:30:09.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/lExbPP8zmUg?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/lExbPP8zmUg?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\nAll TANO Design posters are printed on high-gloss satin finish 10 mil paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiriam Makeba was born in Johannesburg. As a young girl of thirteen, she entered a talent show at a missionary school and walked off with the first prize. She was often invited to sing at weddings, and her popularity grew in leaps and bounds as more and more people became dazzled by her talent. In 1952 she was chosen to sing for The Manhattan Brothers and toured South Africa with them. In 1956, she wrote and released the song \"Pata Pata\".\r\n\r\nShe received invitations to visit Europe and America, where she came to the attention of Harry Belafonte and Steve Allen and was catapulted to stardom. 1959 saw her becoming the first South African to win a Grammy award for the album 'An Evening with Harry Belafonte & Miriam Makeba'.\r\n\r\nMiriam became an exile in 1960 when South Africa banned her from returning to her birth country - she was deemed to be too dangerous and revolutionary - this was after she had appeared in an anti-apartheid documentary, entitled \"Come Back Africa\", and this upset the then white apartheid government of South Africa. Miriam only returned to South Africa thirty years later.\r\n\r\nIn 1967, more than ten years after she wrote the song, \"Pata Pata\" was released in the United States and became a hit worldwide. It has since been re-recorded by numerous international artists. Miriam was a darling of the American public, but they turned against her when she married the radical black activist, Stokely Carmichael, in 1968. Once again, she was at the receiving end of a dissatisfied and disgruntled country. Although the United States never banned her, her US concerts and recording contracts were suddenly cancelled.\r\n\r\nShe moved back to Africa, this time to Guinea where she was welcomed with open arms. Miriam continued to record songs and toured intensively. She was well respected by the government of Guinea and was asked to address the United Nations General Assembly as a Guinean delegate. She twice addressed the General Assembly, speaking out against the evils of apartheid.\r\n\r\nAlthough always regarding herself as a singer and not as a politician, Miriam's fearless humanitarianism has earned her many International awards, including the 1986 Dag Hammerskjold Peace Prize and the UNESCO Grand Prix du Conseil International de la Musique. Makeba is also known for having inspired an enduring fashion in the 60's when the slogan \"black is beautiful\" was launched:\r\n\r\n\"I see other black women imitate my style, which is no style at all, but just letting our hair be itself. They call it the Afro Look.\"\r\n\r\nMakeba BiographyShe was received by such world leaders as Hailé Selassie, Fidel Castro, John F. Kennedy and François Mitterrand. She has toured with singers such as Paul Simon, Nina Simone, Hugh Masekela and Dizzy Gillepsie. The ban on her records was lifted in South Africa in 1988 and she returned to her homeland in December 1990. Four years later she started a charity project to raise funds to protect women in South Africa. Her first concert in South Africa (1991) was a huge success and this was a prelude for a world-wide tour which included the USA and Europe.\r\n\r\nShe has released over thirty albums over the years, and her powerful and distinctive voice retains the clarity and range that enable it to be both forceful as a protest march and as poignant as an African lullaby.\r\n\r\nMiriam was MamaAfrica, a lady with a special touch. She has weathered many storms in her life, including several car accidents, a plane crash and even cancer. She remained as active in her latter years as she did as a young girl with stars in her eyes.\r\n\r\nOn 9 November 2008, she became ill while taking part in a concert being held in Castel Volturno, Italy. Miriam suffered a heart attack after singing her most famous song \"Pata Pata\", and was rushed to a clinic where doctors were unable to revive her.\r\n\r\nHer exceptional personal and artistic achievements were part of the history of the 20th century, and the dramatic elements of her extraordinary life made Miriam Makeba a living legend.","options":[{"id":3800911,"name":"17\"x11\"","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14312721,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch ","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/42585401/-/Tano_MAKEBA_ORIGINAL.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/42585401/-/Tano_MAKEBA_ORIGINAL.png","width":270,"height":417}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":1210221,"name":"Tribute to Paul Robeson","permalink":"paul-robeson","position":78,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/paul-robeson","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-01-13T15:55:09.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/eh9WayN7R-s?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/eh9WayN7R-s?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\nAll TANO Design posters are printed on high-gloss satin finish 10 mil paper.\r\n\r\nQuote on Poster: “As an artist I come to sing, but as a citizen, I will always speak for peace, and no one can silence me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPaul Robeson was the epitome of the 20th-century Renaissance man. He was an exceptional athlete, actor, singer, cultural scholar, author, and political activist. His talents made him a revered man of his time, yet his radical political beliefs all but erased him from popular history. Today, more than one hundred years after his birth, Robeson is just beginning to receive the credit he is due.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1898, Paul Robeson grew up in Princeton, New Jersey. His father had escaped slavery and become a Presbyterian minister, while his mother was from a distinguished Philadelphia family. At seventeen, he was given a scholarship to Rutgers University, where he received an unprecedented twelve major letters in four years and was his class valedictorian. After graduating he went on to Columbia University Law School, and, in the early 1920s, took a job with a New York law firm. Racial strife at the firm ended Robeson’s career as a lawyer early, but he was soon to find an appreciative home for his talents.\r\n\r\nReturning to his love of public speaking, Robeson began to find work as an actor. In the mid-1920s he played the lead in Eugene O’Neill’s “All God’s Chillun Got Wings” (1924) and “The Emperor Jones” (1925). Throughout the late 1920s and 1930s, he was a widely acclaimed actor and singer. With songs such as his trademark “Ol’ Man River,” he became one of the most popular concert singers of his time. His “Othello” was the longest-running Shakespeare play in Broadway history, running for nearly three hundred performances. It is still considered one of the great-American Shakespeare productions. While his fame grew in the United States, he became equally well-loved internationally. He spoke fifteen languages, and performed benefits throughout the world for causes of social justice. More than any other performer of his time, he believed that the famous have a responsibility to fight for justice and peace.\r\n\r\nAs an actor, Robeson was one of the first black men to play serious roles in the primarily white American theater. He performed in a number of films as well, including a re-make of “The Emperor Jones” (1933) and “Song of Freedom” (1936). In a time of deeply entrenched racism, he continually struggled for further understanding of cultural difference. At the height of his popularity, Robeson was a national symbol and a cultural leader in the war against fascism abroad and racism at home. He was admired and befriended by both the general public and prominent personalities, including Eleanor Roosevelt, W.E.B. Du Bois, Joe Louis, Pablo Neruda, Lena Horne, and Harry Truman. While his varied talents and his outspoken defense of civil liberties brought him many admirers, it also made him enemies among conservatives trying to maintain the status quo.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1940s, Robeson’s black nationalist and anti-colonialist activities brought him to the attention of Senator Joseph McCarthy. Despite his contributions as an entertainer to the Allied forces during World War II, Robeson was singled out as a major threat to American democracy. Every attempt was made to silence and discredit him, and in 1950 the persecution reached a climax when his passport was revoked. He could no longer travel abroad to perform, and his career was stifled. Of this time, Lloyd Brown, a writer and long-time colleague of Robeson, states: “Paul Robeson was the most persecuted, the most ostracized, the most condemned black man in America, then or ever.”\r\n\r\nIt was eight years before his passport was reinstated. A weary and triumphant Robeson began again to travel and give concerts in England and Australia. But the years of hardship had taken their toll. After several bouts of depression, he was admitted to a hospital in London, where he was administered continued shock treatments. When Robeson returned to the United States in 1963, he was misdiagnosed several times and treated for a variety of physical and psychological problems. Realizing that he was no longer the powerful singer or agile orator of his prime, he decided to step out of the public eye. He retired to Philadelphia and lived in self-imposed seclusion until his death in 1976.\r\n\r\nTo this day, Paul Robeson’s many accomplishments remain obscured by the propaganda of those who tirelessly dogged him throughout his life. His role in the history of civil rights and as a spokesperson for the oppressed of other nations remains relatively unknown. In 1995, more than seventy-five years after graduating from Rutgers, his athletic achievements were finally recognized with his posthumous entry into the College Football Hall of Fame. Though a handful of movies and recordings are still available, they are a sad testament to one of the greatest Americans of the twentieth century. If we are to remember Paul Robeson for anything, it should be for the courage and the dignity with which he struggled for his own personal voice and for the rights of all people.\r\n\r\nAlex La Guma on Paul Robeson(Paper delivered at a symposium on \"Paul Robeson and the Afro-American Struggle\", held at the Academy of Arts, Berlin, in the German Democratic Republic, on April 13-14, 1971. From African Communist, No. 46, Third Quarter 1971)\r\n\r\nI think that his outlook as an artist is significantly illustrated by a speech made in the Albert Hall London at a rally in support of the Spanish republic, and reported in the South African anti-imperialist magazine, The Liberator, in 1937. Paul Robeson said then:\r\n\r\n    \"Every artist, every scientist, must decide now where he stands. He has no alternative. There is no standing above the conflict on Olympian heights. .. The battlefield is everywhere, there is no sheltered rear..... Fascism fights to destroy the culture which Society has created; created through pain and suffering, through desperate toil, but with unconquerable will and lofty vision . . - What matters a man's profession or vocation? Fascism is no respector of persons. It makes no distinction between combatants and non-combatants... The artist must take sides; he must elect to fight for freedom or for slavery. I have made my choice. I have no alternative. The history of the capitalist era is characterized by the degradation of my people; despoiled of their lands, their women ravished, their culture destroyed... I say the true artist cannot hold himself aloof. The legacy of culture from our predecessors is in danger. It is the foundation upon which we build a still more lofty edifice. It belongs not only to us, not only to the present generation  it belongs to posterity and must be defended to the death.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/solidarity/robeson-laguma.html","options":[{"id":9173450,"name":"17 Inch x11 Inch Red Yellow Blue","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4488741,"name":"17 Inch x11 Inch Orange Brown","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14582895,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch Red Yellow Bule","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":14582903,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch Orange Brown","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/24931801/-/Paul_Robeson_Red_Blue.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/24931801/-/Paul_Robeson_Red_Blue.png","width":600,"height":927},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/18865301/-/TANO_Paul_Robeson_Original.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/18865301/-/TANO_Paul_Robeson_Original.png","width":600,"height":927}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":2563577,"name":"Soweto Uprising 76 Limited Edition t-shirt","permalink":"soweto-uprising-76-limited-edition-t-shirt","position":79,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/soweto-uprising-76-limited-edition-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-05-07T08:15:20.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n\"The softest, smoothest, best-looking T-shirt available anywhere.\" \r\n100% Fine Jersey cotton construction\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Soweto uprising or Soweto riots were a series of clashes in Soweto, South Africa on June 16, 1976 between black youths and the South African authorities.  June 16 is now celebrated in South Africa as Youth Day.\r\n\r\nBlack students in Soweto protested against the Afrikaans Medium Decree of 1974 which forced all black schools to use Afrikaans  and English in a 50-50 mix as languages of instruction. The Regional Director of Bantu Education (Northern Transvaal Region), J.G. Erasmus, told Circuit Inspectors and Principals of Schools that from January 1, 1975, Afrikaans had to be used for mathematics, arithmetic, and social studies from standard five (7th grade), according to the Afrikaans Medium Decree; English would be the medium of instruction for general science and practical subjects (homecraft, needlework, woodwork, metalwork, art, agricultural science). Indigenous languages would be used for religion instruction, music, and physical culture.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of June 16, 1976, thousands of black students walked from their schools to Orlando Stadium for a rally to protest against having to learn through Afrikaans in school. Many students who later participated in the protest arrived at school that morning without prior knowledge of the protest, yet agreed to become involved. The protest was intended to be peaceful and had been carefully planned by the Soweto Students’ Representative Council’s (SSRC) Action Committee[5], with support from the wider Black Consciousness Movement. Teachers in Soweto also supported the march after the Action Committee emphasized good discipline and peaceful action.\r\n\r\nTsietsi Mashininini led students from Morris Isaacson High School to join up with others who walked from Naledi High School. The students began the march only to find out that police had barricaded the road along their intended route. The leader of the action committee asked the crowd not to provoke the police and the march continued on another route, eventually ending up near Orlando High School.

It was created in Brazil by slaves from Africa, especially from Angola, Mozambique  and Congo  sometime after the sixteenth century.  It was developed in the region of Quilombo dos Palmares, located in the Brazilian state of Alagoas, which was the state of Pernambuco  before dismemberment,[2]  and has had great influence on Afro-Brazilian generations, with strong presence in the states of Bahia, Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Participants form a roda, or circle, and take turns either playing musical instruments (such as the Berimbau), singing, or ritually sparring  in pairs in the center of the circle. The sparring is marked by fluid acrobatic  play, feints, takedowns, and with extensive use of leg sweeps, kicks, and headbutts. Less frequently used techniques include elbow strikes, slaps, punches, and body throws. Its origins and purpose are a matter of debate, with theories ranging from views of Capoeira as a uniquely Brazilian folk dance with improvised fighting movements to claims that it is a battle-ready fighting form directly descended from ancient African techniques.\r\n\r\nSome interpretations emphasize capoeira as a fighting style designed for rebellion, but disguised by a façade of dance. Supporting the martial interpretation are renderings in the 1835 Voyage Pittoresque dans le Brésil (Picturesque Voyage to Brazil), where ethnographic artist Johann Moritz Rugendas depicts Capoeira or the Dance of War, lending historical credence to the idea that Capoeira is a combative art form with many dance elements.\r\n\r\nOther Pan African-American combative traditions parallel capoeira. According to Dr. Morton Marks, the island of Martinique is famous for danymé, also known as ladja. As with capoeira, \"there is a ring of spectators into which each contestant enters, moving in a counter-clockwise direction and dancing toward drummers. This move, known as Kouwi Lawon (or ‘Circular Run’ in Creole), is an exact parallel to the capoeira interlude called dá volta ao mundo or ‘take a turn around the world.’\"[4] Marks stated that in Cuba, a mock-combat dance called Mani was performed to yuka drums. \"A dancer (manisero) would stand in the middle of a ring of spectator-participants and, moving to the sound of the songs and drums, would pick someone from the circle and attempt to knock them down.\" Some of the manisero's moves and kicks were similar to those of Afro-Brazilian capoeira including its basic leg-sweep (rasteira).","options":[{"id":9243821,"name":"Men Brown  S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9243822,"name":"Men Brown M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9243823,"name":"Men Brown  L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9243824,"name":"Men Brown  XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9243825,"name":"Men Brown  XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9243826,"name":"Women Brown  S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9243827,"name":"Women browm M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9243828,"name":"Women Brown L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9243829,"name":"Women Brown XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9243812,"name":"Men Red  S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9243813,"name":"Men Red  M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9243814,"name":"Men Red L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9243815,"name":"Men Red XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9243816,"name":"Men Red XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9243817,"name":"Women Red S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9243818,"name":"Women Red M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9243819,"name":"Women Red L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9243820,"name":"Women Red XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30024413/-/Brown_Capoeira_T_Shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30024413/-/Brown_Capoeira_T_Shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30024501/-/Red_Capoeira_T_Shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30024501/-/Red_Capoeira_T_Shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25145328/-/Jogo_do_Capoiera_blue.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25145328/-/Jogo_do_Capoiera_blue.png","width":480,"height":742}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":1180931,"name":"Tribute Kwame Nkrumah Poster","permalink":"kwame-nkrumah","position":81,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kwame-nkrumah","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-01-11T01:04:55.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/nHYie91wRs4?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/nHYie91wRs4?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved © \r\n\r\nQuote on poster reads: “Africa is a paradox which illustrates and highlights neo-colonialism. Her earth is rich, yet the products that come from above and below the soil continue to enrich, not Africans predominantly, but groups and individuals who operate to Africa’s impoverishment.”\r\n\r\n(born Sept. 1909, Nkroful, Gold Coast [now Ghana]—died April 27, 1972, Bucharest, Rom.) Ghanaian nationalist leader who led the Gold Coast's drive for independence from Britain and presided over its emergence as the new nation of Ghana. He headed the country from independence in 1957 until he was overthrown by a coup in 1966.\r\n\r\nEarly years\r\n\r\nKwame Nkrumah's father was a goldsmith and his mother a retail trader. Baptized a Roman Catholic, Nkrumah spent nine years at the Roman Catholic elementary school in nearby Half Assini. After graduation from Achimota College in 1930, he started his career as a teacher at Roman Catholic junior schools in Elmina and Axim and at a seminary.\r\n\r\nIncreasingly drawn to politics, Nkrumah decided to pursue further studies in the United States. He entered Lincoln University in Pennsylvania in 1935 and, after graduating in 1939, obtained master's degrees from Lincoln and from the University of Pennsylvania. He studied the literature of socialism, notably Karl Marx and Vladimir I. Lenin, and of nationalism, especially Marcus Garvey, the black American leader of the 1920s. Eventually, Nkrumah came to describe himself as a “nondenominational Christian and a Marxist socialist.” He also immersed himself in political work, reorganizing and becoming president of the African Students' Organization of the United States and Canada. He left the United States in May 1945 and went to England, where he organized the 5th Pan-African Congress in Manchester.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the Gold Coast, J.B. Danquah had formed the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) to work for self-government by constitutional means. Invited to serve as the UGCC's general secretary, Nkrumah returned home in late 1947. As general secretary, he addressed meetings throughout the Gold Coast and began to create a mass base for the new movement. When extensive riots occurred in February 1948, the British briefly arrested Nkrumah and other leaders of the UGCC.\r\n\r\nWhen a split developed between the middle-class leaders of the UGCC and the more radical supporters of Nkrumah, he formed in June 1949 the new Convention Peoples' Party (CPP), a mass-based party that was committed to a program of immediate self-government. In January 1950, Nkrumah initiated a campaign of “positive action,” involving nonviolent protests, strikes, and noncooperation with the British colonial authorities.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.biography.com/articles/Kwame-Nkrumah-9424127","options":[{"id":4397441,"name":"17Inch x11 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14582907,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/11017051/-/TANO_Kwame_Nkrumah.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/11017051/-/TANO_Kwame_Nkrumah.png","width":647,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":1046371,"name":"Tribute Muhammad Ali  T-Shirt","permalink":"dedan-kimathi-t-shirt","position":82,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dedan-kimathi-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-12-24T19:12:45.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n<iframe width=\"300\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/55AasOJZzDE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n100% Fine Jersey cotton construction\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\nMuhammad Ali (born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.; January 17, 1942) is a retired American boxer and three-time World Heavyweight Champion, who is widely considered one of the greatest heavyweight championship boxers of all time. As an amateur, he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. After turning professional, he went on to become the first boxer to win the lineal heavyweight championship three times.\r\n\r\nOriginally known as Cassius Clay, Ali changed his name after joining the Nation of Islam in 1964, subsequently converting to Sunni Islam in 1975. In 1967, Ali refused to be inducted into the U.S. military based on his religious beliefs and opposition to the Vietnam War. He was arrested and found guilty on draft evasion charges, stripped of his boxing title, and his boxing license was suspended. He was not imprisoned, but did not fight again for nearly four years while his appeal worked its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, where it was successful.\r\n\r\nNicknamed 'The Greatest', Ali was involved in several historic boxing matches. Notable among these are three with rival Joe Frazier and one with George Foreman, whom he beat by knockout to win the world heavyweight title for the second time. He suffered only five losses (four decisions and one TKO by retirement from the bout) with no draws in his career, while amassing 56 wins (37 knockouts and 19 decisions). Ali was well known for his unorthodox fighting style, which he described as \"float like a butterfly, sting like a bee\", and employing techniques such as the rope-a-dope. He was also known for his pre-match hype, where he would 'trash talk' opponents on television and in person some time before the match, often with rhymes. These personality quips, idioms along with an unorthodox fighting technique made him a cultural icon. In later life, Ali developed Parkinson's disease due to the injuries he sustained throughout his career. In 1999, Ali was crowned \"Sportsman of the Century\" by Sports Illustrated and \"Sports Personality of the Century\" by the BBC\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":9171230,"name":"Men Black S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9171231,"name":"Men Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9171232,"name":"Men Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9171233,"name":"Men Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9171234,"name":"Men Black XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9171221,"name":"Men Army Green S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9171222,"name":"Men Army Green M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9171223,"name":"Men Army Green L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9171224,"name":"Men Army Green XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9171225,"name":"Men Army Green XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":38370078,"name":"Men Army Green XXXL","price":25.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":9171226,"name":"Women Army Green S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9171227,"name":"Women Army Green M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9171228,"name":"Women Army Green L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9171229,"name":"Women Army Green XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9171235,"name":"Women Black S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9171236,"name":"Women Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9171237,"name":"Women Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9171238,"name":"Women Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30024733/-/Ali_Black_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30024733/-/Ali_Black_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30024749/-/Ali_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30024749/-/Ali_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/24925928/-/Ali_II.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/24925928/-/Ali_II.png","width":647,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27028950/-/ALI_TANO.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27028950/-/ALI_TANO.png","width":480,"height":742}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":1351051,"name":"Tribute Jomo Kenyatta T-shirt","permalink":"jomo-kenyatta-t-shirt","position":83,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/jomo-kenyatta-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-01-26T02:10:10.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none;

His father was a leader of a small Kikuyu agricultural settlement. About age 10 Kamau became seriously ill with jigger infections in his feet and one leg, and he underwent successful surgery at a newly established Church of Scotland mission. This was his initial contact with Europeans. Fascinated with what he had seen during his recuperation, Kamau ran away from home to become a resident pupil at the mission. He studied the Bible, English, mathematics, and carpentry and paid his fees by working as a houseboy and cook for a European settler. In August 1914 he was baptized with the name Johnstone Kamau. He was one of the earliest of the Kikuyu to leave the confines of his own culture. And, like many others, Kamau soon left the mission life for the urban attractions of Nairobi.\r\n\r\nThere he secured a job as a clerk in the Public Works Department, and he also adopted the name Kenyatta, the Kikuyu term for a fancy belt that he wore. After serving briefly as an interpreter in the High Court, Kenyatta transferred to a post with the Nairobi Town Council. About this time he married and began to raise a family.\r\n\r\nThe first African political protest movement in Kenya against a white-settler-dominated government began in 1921—the East Africa Association (EAA), led by an educated young Kikuyu named Harry Thuku. Kenyatta joined the following year. One of the EAA's main purposes was to recover Kikuyu lands lost when Kenya became a British crown colony (1920). The Africans were dispossessed, leaseholds of land were restricted to white settlers, and native reservations were established. In 1925 the EAA disbanded as a result of government pressures, and its members re-formed as the Kikuyu Central Association (KCA). Three years later Kenyatta became this organization's general secretary, though he had to give up his municipal job as a consequence.\r\n\r\nRead More: \r\nhttp://www.biography.com/articles/Jomo-Kenyatta-9363416","options":[{"id":4954321,"name":"Men Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4954331,"name":"Men Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4954341,"name":"Men Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4954351,"name":"Men Black XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4954361,"name":"Women Red S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4954371,"name":"Women Red M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4954381,"name":"Women Red L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4976871,"name":"Women Black S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4976881,"name":"Women Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4976891,"name":"Women Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5019261,"name":"Men Red S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5019271,"name":"Men Red M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5019281,"name":"Men Red L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5019291,"name":"Men Red XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5345671,"name":"Men Red XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30024765/-/Jomo_Kenyatta_Red_t-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30024765/-/Jomo_Kenyatta_Red_t-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30024757/-/Jomo_Kenyatta_Black_t-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30024757/-/Jomo_Kenyatta_Black_t-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/12970751/-/T-shirt_Original_Jomo_Kenyatta_.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/12970751/-/T-shirt_Original_Jomo_Kenyatta_.png","width":709,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":1060291,"name":"Tribute James Baldwin Poster","permalink":"james-baldwin","position":84,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/james-baldwin","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-12-28T06:00:55.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/1wxyQpV57Hk?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/1wxyQpV57Hk?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nJames Arthur Baldwin (August 2, 1924 – November 30, 1987) was an American novelist, writer, playwright, poet, essayist and civil rights activist.\r\n\r\nMost of Baldwin's work deals with racial and sexual issues in the mid-20th century in the United States. His novels are notable for the personal way in which they explore questions of identity as well as the way in which they mine complex social and psychological pressures related to being black and homosexual well before the social, cultural or political equality of these groups was improved.\r\n\r\nWhen Baldwin was an infant, his mother, Emma Berdis Joynes, moved to Harlem, NY where she married a preacher, David Baldwin, who adopted James. The family was poor; and James and his adoptive father had a tumultuous relationship. James Baldwin attended the prestigious DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, where he worked on the school magazine together with Richard Avedon. At the age of 14, he joined the Pentecostal Church and became a Pentecostal preacher.\r\n\r\nWhen he was 17 years old, Baldwin turned away from his religion and moved to Greenwich Village, a New York City neighborhood, famous for its artists and writers. Here, he studied at The New School, finding an intellectual community within the university. Supporting himself with odd jobs, he began to write short stories, essays, and book reviews, many of which were later collected in the volume Notes of a Native Son (1955).\r\n\r\nDuring this time Baldwin began to recognize his own homosexuality. In 1948, disillusioned by American prejudice against blacks and homosexuals, Baldwin left the United States and departed to Paris, France, where he would live as an expatriate for most of his later life.","options":[{"id":14582965,"name":"17 Inch x11 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14582967,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/9847811/-/Tano_James_Baldwin_Original_11x17.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/9847811/-/Tano_James_Baldwin_Original_11x17.png","width":647,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":2351981,"name":"Tribute Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi Poster","permalink":"mohandas-karamchand-gandhi-poster","position":85,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mohandas-karamchand-gandhi-poster","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-04-14T10:00:26.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\nAll TANO Design posters are printed on high-gloss satin finish 10 mil premium photo paper.\r\n\r\nQuote on poster: \"I am prepared to die, but there is no cause for which I am prepared to kill.\" - Gandhi\r\n\r\nMohandas Karamchand Gandhi (Hindi: मोहनदास करमचंद गाँधी, Gujarati: મોહનદાસ કરમચંદ ગાંધી, (October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was the pre-eminent political and spiritual leader of India  during the Indian independence movement. He was the pioneer of satyagraha—resistance to tyranny through mass civil disobedience, a philosophy firmly founded upon ahimsa  or total nonviolence—which led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. Gandhi is commonly known around the world as Mahatma Gandhi ([məɦaːt̪maː]; Sanskrit: महात्मा mahātmā or \"Great Soul\", an honorific  first applied to him by Rabindranath Tagore),  and in India also as Bapu (Gujarati: બાપુ, bāpu  or \"Father\"). He is officially honoured in India as the Father of the Nation; his birthday, 2 October, is commemorated there as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the International Day of Non-Violence.\r\n\r\nGandhi first employed non-violent civil disobedience while an expatriate lawyer in South Africa, during the resident Indian community's struggle for civil rights. After his return to India in 1915, he organized protests by peasants, farmers, and urban labourers concerning excessive land-tax and discrimination. After assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns to ease poverty, expand women's rights, build religious and ethnic amity, end untouchability, and increase economic self-reliance. Above all, he aimed to achieve Swaraj or the independence of India from foreign domination. Gandhi famously led his followers in the Non-cooperation movement that protested the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (240 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930. Later, in 1942, he launched the Quit India civil disobedience movement demanding immediate independence for India. Gandhi spent a number of years in jail in both South Africa and India.\r\n\r\nAs a practitioner of ahimsa, he swore to speak the truth and advocated that others do the same. Gandhi lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community and wore the traditional Indian dhoti and shawl, woven with yarn he had hand spun himself. He ate simple vegetarian food, eventually adopting a fruitarian diet, and also undertook long fasts as a means of both self-purification and social protest.","options":[{"id":8430481,"name":"17 Inch x11 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14582913,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/22639161/-/Ghandi.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/22639161/-/Ghandi.png","width":647,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":1656521,"name":"Africanism II T-shirt","permalink":"africanism-ii-t-shirt","position":86,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/africanism-ii-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-02-19T16:16:13.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n\"The softest, smoothest, best-looking T-shirt available anywhere.\" \r\n100% Fine Jersey cotton construction\r\n\r\nPan-Africanism represents the aggregation of the historical, cultural, spiritual, artistic, scientific and philosophical legacies of Africans from past times to the present.

Blind from birth, Wonder signed with Tamla Records at the age of eleven and continues to perform and record for the label. He has recorded more than thirty U.S. top ten hits and won twenty-two Grammy Awards, the most ever won by a male solo artist. On December 1, 2009, he was named a UN Messenger of Peace.\r\n\r\nStevie Wonder was born in Saginaw, Michigan in 1950; being the third of six children to Calvin Judkins and Lula Mae Hardaway.\r\n\r\nWhen Stevie Wonder was four, his mother left his father and moved herself and her children to Detroit. She changed her name back to Lula Hardaway and later changed her son's surname to Morris, partly because of relatives. Morris has remained Stevie Wonder's legal name ever since. He began playing instruments at an early age, including piano, harmonica, drums and bass. During childhood he was active in his church choir.\r\n\r\nRonnie White of The Miracles gives credit to his brother Gerald White for persistently nagging him to come to his friend's house in 1961 to check out Stevie Wonder. Afterward, White brought Wonder and his mother to Motown Records. Impressed by the young musician, Motown CEO Berry Gordy signed Wonder to Motown's Tamla label with the name Little Stevie Wonder. Before signing, producer Clarence Paul gave Wonder his trademark name after stating \"we can't keep calling him the eighth wonder of the world\".\r\n","options":[{"id":7825511,"name":"Men S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7825521,"name":"Men M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7825531,"name":"Men L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7825541,"name":"Men XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7825551,"name":"Men XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7825561,"name":"Women S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7825571,"name":"Women M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7825581,"name":"Women L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7825591,"name":"Women XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7825601,"name":"Men Red  S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7825611,"name":"Men Red M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7825621,"name":"Men Red L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7825631,"name":"Men Red XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7825641,"name":"Men Red XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7825651,"name":"Women Red S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7825661,"name":"Women Red M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7825671,"name":"Women Red L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7825681,"name":"Women Red XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30032421/-/Stevie_Wonderful_Red_t-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30032421/-/Stevie_Wonderful_Red_t-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30032429/-/Stevie_Wonder_Black_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30032429/-/Stevie_Wonder_Black_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/17678151/-/Stevie_Wonder_Original.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/17678151/-/Stevie_Wonder_Original.png","width":520,"height":804}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":2395001,"name":"Activist by Nature T-shirt","permalink":"activist-by-nature-t-shirt","position":88,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/activist-by-nature-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-04-17T20:42:51.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n\"The softest, smoothest, best-looking T-shirt available anywhere.\" \r\n100% Fine Jersey cotton construction\r\n\r\n\r\nActivism, in a general sense, can be described as intentional action to bring about social, political, economic, or environmental change.

He was the pioneer of satyagraha—resistance to tyranny through mass civil disobedience, a philosophy firmly founded upon ahimsa  or total nonviolence—which led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. Gandhi is commonly known around the world as Mahatma Gandhi ([məɦaːt̪maː]; Sanskrit: महात्मा mahātmā or \"Great Soul\", an honorific  first applied to him by Rabindranath Tagore),  and in India also as Bapu (Gujarati: બાપુ, bāpu  or \"Father\"). He is officially honored in India as the Father of the Nation; his birthday, 2 October, is commemorated there as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the International Day of Non-Violence.\r\n\r\nGandhi first employed non-violent civil disobedience while an expatriate lawyer in South Africa, during the resident Indian community's struggle for civil rights. After his return to India in 1915, he organized protests by peasants, farmers, and urban labourers concerning excessive land-tax and discrimination. After assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns to ease poverty, expand women's rights, build religious and ethnic amity, end untouchability, and increase economic self-reliance. Above all, he aimed to achieve Swaraj or the independence of India from foreign domination. Gandhi famously led his followers in the Non-cooperation movement that protested the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (240 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930. Later, in 1942, he launched the Quit India civil disobedience movement demanding immediate independence for India. Gandhi spent a number of years in jail in both South Africa and India.\r\n\r\nAs a practitioner of ahimsa, he swore to speak the truth and advocated that others do the same. Gandhi lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community and wore the traditional Indian dhoti and shawl, woven with yarn he had hand spun himself. He ate simple vegetarian food, eventually adopting a fruitarian diet, and also undertook long fasts as a means of both self-purification and social protest.","options":[{"id":8431161,"name":"Men Red  S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8431171,"name":"Men Red M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8431181,"name":"Men Red L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8431191,"name":"Men Red XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8431201,"name":"Men Red XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8431071,"name":"Men Black S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8431081,"name":"Men Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8431091,"name":"Men Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8431101,"name":"Men Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8431111,"name":"Men Black XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8431121,"name":"Women Black S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8431131,"name":"Women Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8431141,"name":"Women Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8431151,"name":"Women Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8431211,"name":"Women Red S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8431221,"name":"Women Red M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8431231,"name":"Women Red L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":8431241,"name":"Women Red XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30033453/-/Red_Ghandi_t-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30033453/-/Red_Ghandi_t-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30033437/-/Black_Ghandi_t-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30033437/-/Black_Ghandi_t-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/22642081/-/Ghandi.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/22642081/-/Ghandi.png","width":647,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":2390871,"name":"Vinyl Limited Edition Poster","permalink":"vinyl-limited-edition-poster","position":90,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/vinyl-limited-edition-poster","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-04-17T07:43:44.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\nAll TANO Design posters are printed on high-gloss satin finish 10 mil premium photo paper.\r\n\r\nVinyl record (when made of polyvinyl chloride), or simply record, is an analog  sound storage medium consisting of a flat disc with an inscribed, modulated spiral groove. The groove usually starts near the periphery and ends near the centre of the disc. Phonograph records are generally described by their size (\"12-inch\", \"10-inch\", \"7-inch\", etc.), the rotational speed they are played at (\"33\", \"45\", \"78\", etc.), their time capacity (\"Long Playing\"), their reproductive accuracy, or \"fidelity\", or the number of channels of audio provided (\"Mono\", \"Stereo\", \"Quadraphonic\", etc.) (See below)\r\n\r\nGramophone records were the primary medium used for commercial music reproduction for most of the 20th century, replacing the phonograph cylinder, with which they had co-existed, by the 1920s. By the late 1980s, digital media had gained a larger market share, and the vinyl record left the mainstream in 1991.[1][2] However, they continue to be manufactured and sold in the 21st century. The vinyl record regained popularity by 2008, with nearly 2.9 million units shipped that year, the most in any year since 1998.[3] They are used predominantly by young adults, as well as DJs and audiophiles for many types of music. As of 2009, vinyl records continue to be used for distribution of independent and alternative music artists. More mainstream pop releases tend to be mostly sold in compact disc or other digital formats, but have still been released in vinyl in certain instances.\r\n","options":[{"id":14582977,"name":"17 Inch x11 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14582979,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/23047091/-/Vinyl_TANO.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/23047091/-/Vinyl_TANO.png","width":647,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":1482321,"name":"Tribute Malcolm X T-shirt","permalink":"tribute-malcolm-x-t-shirt","position":91,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tribute-malcolm-x-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-02-05T09:52:33.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TanoDesign\"><img src=\"http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-c.png\" alt=\"Follow TanoDesign on Twitter\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<object id=\"flashObj\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,47,0\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&isUI=1\" /><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\" /><param name=\"flashVars\" value=\"videoId=1092845696001&linkBaseURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.biography.com%2Fpeople%2Fmalcolm-x-9396195&playerID=1027481032001&playerKey=AQ~~,AAAA6PL_xMk~,jGNyX3KKlXNx4Jta3h7dYb9BpOaBZDAD&domain=embed&dynamicStreaming=true\" /><param name=\"base\" value=\"http://admin.brightcove.com\" /><param name=\"seamlesstabbing\" value=\"false\" /><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"swLiveConnect\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><embed src=\"http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&isUI=1\" bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" flashVars=\"videoId=1092845696001&linkBaseURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.biography.com%2Fpeople%2Fmalcolm-x-9396195&playerID=1027481032001&playerKey=AQ~~,AAAA6PL_xMk~,jGNyX3KKlXNx4Jta3h7dYb9BpOaBZDAD&domain=embed&dynamicStreaming=true\" base=\"http://admin.brightcove.com\" name=\"flashObj\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" seamlesstabbing=\"false\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" swLiveConnect=\"true\" pluginspage=\"http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash\"></embed></object>\r\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/ENHP89mLWOY?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/ENHP89mLWOY?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nMalcolm X (pronounced /ˈmælkəm ˈɛks/) (born Malcolm Little; May 19, 1925 – February 21, 1965), also known as El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz[1] (Arabic: الحاجّ مالك الشباز‎), was an African-American Muslim minister, public speaker, and human rights activist.To his admirers, he was a courageous advocate for the rights of African Americans, a man who indicted white America in the harshest terms for its crimes against black Americans.[6] His detractors accused him of preaching racism, black supremacy, and violence. He has been described as one of the greatest and most influential African Americans in history.\r\n\r\nMalcolm X was born in Omaha, Nebraska. By the time he was thirteen, his father had died and his mother had been committed to a mental hospital. His childhood, including his father's lessons concerning black pride and self-reliance and his own experiences concerning race, played a significant role in Malcolm X's adult life. After living in a series of foster homes, Malcolm X became involved in hustling and other criminal activities in Boston and New York. In 1946, Malcolm X was sentenced to eight to ten years in prison.\r\n\r\nWhile in prison, Malcolm X became a member of the Nation of Islam. After his parole in 1952, he became one of the Nation's leaders and chief spokesmen. For nearly a dozen years, he was the public face of the Nation of Islam. Tension between Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad, head of the Nation of Islam, led to Malcolm X's departure from the organization in March 1964.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X became a Sunni Muslim and made a pilgrimage to Mecca, after which he disavowed racism. He traveled extensively throughout Africa and the Middle East. He founded Muslim Mosque, Inc., a religious organization, and the secular, black nationalist Organization of Afro-American Unity. Less than a year after he left the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X was assassinated while giving a speech in New York.\r\n","options":[{"id":5481001,"name":"Men S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5481011,"name":"Men M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5481021,"name":"Men L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5481031,"name":"Men XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5481041,"name":"Men XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5481051,"name":"Women S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5481061,"name":"Women M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5481071,"name":"Women L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5481081,"name":"Women XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30032749/-/Malcolm_X__Black_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30032749/-/Malcolm_X__Black_T-shirt.png","width":456,"height":608},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30032781/-/malcolm_X_tano_design_.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30032781/-/malcolm_X_tano_design_.png","width":300,"height":464}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":1351631,"name":"Tribute Dedan Kimathi Tshirt","permalink":"dedan-kimathi-tshirt","position":92,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dedan-kimathi-tshirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-01-26T03:11:43.000Z","description":"All Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n100% Fine Jersey cotton construction\r\n\r\n\r\nDedan Kimathi Waciuri ( Kimathi wa Waciuri), (31 October 1920 – 18 February 1957) was a Kenyan rebel leader who fought against British colonization in Kenya in the 1950s.

He led the bloodless coup which toppled the monarchy of King Farouk and heralded a new period of modernization and socialist reform in Egypt together with a profound advancement of pan-Arab nationalism.\r\n\r\nNasser is seen as one of the most important political figures in both modern Arab history and Third World politics in the 20th century. Although he was originally met with suspicion after putting the country's new president, Muhammad Naguib, under house arrest in 1954, he soon gained immense popularity in Egypt and the Arab world when he nationalized the Suez Canal from its British and French stockholders two years later. The consequent British, French, and Israeli invasion of and withdrawal from the canal zone installed Nasser as the decisive victor in the eyes of his people. Meanwhile, he had commenced work on the major projects of the Aswan High Dam in Upper Egypt and the Helwan steelworks. Through his actions and the charisma of his speeches, Nasser's version of pan-Arabism, also referred to as Nasserism, won a great following in the Arab world. By 1958, he united his country with Syria, forming the short-lived United Arab Republic (UAR). At the same time, he inspired successful and unsuccessful revolutions in several Arab countries.\r\n\r\nThis period of glory for Nasser had eroded roughly as soon it came about and three years after the founding of the union, Syria split from the UAR. Afterward, he concentrated on pursuing increased socialist and modernizing measures in Egypt which included the nationalization of more companies, reforming the al-Azhar Mosque, providing housing and universal health care, as well as other liberalization schemes. His commanding position among the Arab leaders was also re-established in the wake of Nasserist-led coups and revolutions in Algeria, Iraq, Syria, and North Yemen. The latter dragged him into war in North Yemen as he sent thousands of Egyptian troops to defend the new anti-royalist government. Nasser's status as \"leader of the Arabs\" was severely tarnished as a result of the Israeli victory over the Arab armies in the Six Day War of 1967, yet many in the general Arab populace still viewed him as a symbol of their dignity and freedom; when he declared his resignation soon after, tens of thousands of Egyptians immediately protested, prompting him to retract his decision. After 1967, Nasser commenced the War of Attrition with Israel and his strategy of playing the world superpowers — the US and the USSR — against each other ceased as he developed closer relations with the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn September 28, 1970, Nasser died of a heart attack following the conclusion of an emergency Arab League summit he organized to end the civil war between Palestinian paramilitaries and the Jordanian Army. His funeral procession in Cairo drew in five million mourners while numerous others mourned throughout the Arab world. His mixed legacy is debated until the present day. TIME magazine wrote that, despite the mistakes and setbacks of his career, the elevation of dignity and pride Nasser instilled in Egyptians and Arabs everywhere \"may have been enough to balance his flaws and failures.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser","options":[{"id":14583017,"name":"17 Inch x11 Inch","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":14583019,"name":"20 Inch x 30 Inch","price":39.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/9777811/-/Tano__GAMEL_ABDEL_NASSER.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/9777811/-/Tano__GAMEL_ABDEL_NASSER.png","width":647,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639331,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":2153241,"name":"Tribute Nina Simone T-shirt","permalink":"tribute-nina-simone-t-shirt","position":94,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tribute-nina-simone-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-03-30T05:24:37.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/PipX3l1tEeU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n100% Fine Jersey cotton construction\r\n\r\n\r\nEunice Kathleen Waymon (February 21, 1933–April 21, 2003), better known by her stage name Nina Simone (/ˈniːnə sɨˈmoʊn/), was an American singer, songwriter, pianist, arranger, and civil rights activist. Although she disliked being categorized, Simone is most associated with jazz music. Simone originally aspired to become a classical pianist, but her work covers an eclectic variety of musical styles that include classical, jazz, blues, soul, folk, R&B, gospel, and pop. Her vocal style is characterized by intense passion, a loose vibrato, and a slightly androgynous timbre, in part due to her unusually low vocal range which veered between the alto and tenor ranges (occasionally even reaching baritone lows). Also known as The High Priestess of Soul, she paid great attention to the musical expression of emotions. Within one album or concert she could fluctuate between exuberant happiness and tragic melancholy. These fluctuations also characterized her own personality and personal life, amplified by bipolar disorder with which she was diagnosed in the mid-1960s, but kept secret until after her death in 2003. According to Nadine Cohodas, Simone's biographer, Ms. Simone was first diagnosed with multiple personality disorder and later with schizophrenia.\r\n\r\nSimone recorded over 40 live and studio albums, the greatest body of her work released between 1958 (when she made her debut with Little Girl Blue) and 1974. Her most well known songs include \"My Baby Just Cares for Me\", \"I Put a Spell on You\", \"Four Women\", \"I Loves You Porgy\", \"Feeling Good\", \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\", \"Sinnerman\", \"To Be Young, Gifted and Black\", \"Mississippi Goddam\", \"Ain't Got No, I Got Life\" and \"I Want a Little Sugar in My Bowl\".\r\n\r\nHer music and message made a strong and lasting impact on culture, illustrated by the numerous contemporary artists who cite her as an important influence (see Legacy and influence). Several hip hop musicians and other modern artists sample and remix Simone's rhythms and beats on their tracks. In particular, Talib Kweli and Mos Def routinely pay tribute to her outstanding and soulful musical style. Many of her songs are featured on motion picture soundtracks, as well as in video games, commercials, and TV series.\r\n\r\nCivil rights era (1964–1974)\r\n\r\nDuring 1964, she changed record distributors, from the American Colpix to the Dutch Philips, which also meant a change in the contents of her recordings. Simone had always included songs in her repertoire that hinted about her African-American origins (such as \"Brown Baby\" and \"Zungo\" on Nina at the Village Gate during 1962). But on her debut album for Philips, Nina Simone In Concert (live recording, 1964), Simone for the first time openly addresses the racial inequality that was prevalent in the United States with the song \"Mississippi Goddam\". It was her response to the murder of Medgar Evers and the bombing of a church in Birmingham, Alabama that killed four black children. The song was released as a single, being boycotted in certain southern states. With \"Old Jim Crow\" on the same album she reacts to the Jim Crow Laws.\r\n\r\nFrom then onwards, a civil rights message was standard in Simone's recording repertoire, where it had already become a part of her live performances. Simone performed and spoke at many civil rights meetings, such as at the Selma to Montgomery marches. Simone advocated violent revolution during the civil rights period as opposed to Martin Luther King's non-violent approach, and hoped that African Americans could, by armed combat, form a separate state (Simone was not, however, a racist, and wrote in her autobiography that her family and indeed herself regarded all races as equal). She covered Billie Holiday's \"Strange Fruit\" (on Pastel Blues (1965), a song about the lynching of black men in the South, and sang the W. Cuney poem \"Images\" on Let It All Out (1966), about the absence of pride in the African-American woman. Simone wrote \"Four Women\", a song about four different stereotypes of African-American women. \r\n\r\nSimone moved from Philips to RCA Victor during 1967. She sang \"Backlash Blues\", written by her friend Langston Hughes on her first RCA album, Nina Simone Sings The Blues (1967). On Silk & Soul (1967) she recorded Billy Taylor's \"I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free\" and \"Turning Point\". The album Nuff Said (1968) contains live recordings from the Westbury Music Fair, April 7, 1968, three days after the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr. She dedicated the whole performance to him and sang \"Why? (The King Of Love Is Dead)\", a song written by her bass player directly after the news of King's death had reached them.\r\n\r\nTogether with Weldon Irvine, Simone turned the late Lorraine Hansberry's unfinished play \"To Be Young, Gifted and Black\" into a civil rights song. She performed it live on the album Black Gold (1970). A studio recording was released as a single, and the song has been covered by Aretha Franklin (on 1972s Young, Gifted and Black) and Donny Hathaway.","options":[{"id":7773861,"name":"Women Black S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7773871,"name":"Women Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7773881,"name":"Women Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":7773891,"name":"Women Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13364125,"name":"Men Red S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13364127,"name":"Men Red M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13364129,"name":"Men Red L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13364131,"name":"Men Red XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13364133,"name":"Men Red XXL","price":25.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":13364135,"name":"Men Black S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13364143,"name":"Men Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13364141,"name":"Men Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13364139,"name":"Men Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13364137,"name":"Men Black XXL","price":25.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/39549571/-/Men_Black_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/39549571/-/Men_Black_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30033637/-/Nina_Simone_Red_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30033637/-/Nina_Simone_Red_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/20625331/-/Nina_Simone_Red.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/20625331/-/Nina_Simone_Red.png","width":647,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/39549579/-/Nina_Simone_Red_Original.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/39549579/-/Nina_Simone_Red_Original.png","width":540,"height":834}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":1599491,"name":"Afro -

Hailed as a global renaissance woman, Dr. Angelou is a celebrated poet, memoirist, novelist, educator, dramatist, producer, actress, historian, filmmaker, and civil rights activist.\r\n\r\nBorn on April 4th, 1928, in St. Louis, Missouri, Dr. Angelou was raised in St. Louis and Stamps, Arkansas. In Stamps, Dr. Angelou experienced the brutality of racial discrimination, but she also absorbed the unshakable faith and values of traditional African-American family, community, and culture.\r\n\r\nAs a teenager, Dr. Angelou’s love for the arts won her a scholarship to study dance and drama at San Francisco’s Labor School. At 14, she dropped out to become San Francisco’s first African-American female cable car conductor. She later finished high school, giving birth to her son, Guy, a few weeks after graduation. As a young single mother, she supported her son by working as a waitress and cook, however her passion for music, dance, performance, and poetry would soon take center stage.\r\n\r\nIn 1954 and 1955, Dr. Angelou toured Europe with a production of the opera Porgy and Bess. She studied modern dance with Martha Graham, danced with Alvin Ailey on television variety shows and, in 1957, recorded her first album, Calypso Lady. In 1958, she moved to New York, where she joined the Harlem Writers Guild, acted in the historic Off-Broadway production of Jean Genet's The Blacks and wrote and performed Cabaret for Freedom.\r\n\r\nIn 1960, Dr. Angelou moved to Cairo, Egypt where she served as editor of the English language weekly The Arab Observer. The next year, she moved to Ghana where she taught at the University of Ghana's School of Music and Drama, worked as feature editor for The African Review and wrote for The Ghanaian Times.\r\n\r\nDuring her years abroad, Dr. Angelou read and studied voraciously, mastering French, Spanish, Italian, Arabic and the West African language Fanti. While in Ghana, she met with Malcolm X and, in 1964, returned to America to help him build his new Organization of African American Unity.\r\n\r\nShortly after her arrival in the United States, Malcolm X was assassinated, and the organization dissolved. Soon after X's assassination, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. asked Dr. Angelou to serve as Northern Coordinator for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. King's assassination, falling on her birthday in 1968, left her devastated.\r\n\r\nWith the guidance of her friend, the novelist James Baldwin, she began work on the book that would become I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. Published in 1970, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings was published to international acclaim and enormous popular success. The list of her published verse, non-fiction, and fiction now includes more than 30 bestselling titles.\r\n\r\nA trailblazer in film and television, Dr. Angelou wrote the screenplay and composed the score for the 1972 film Georgia, Georgia. Her script, the first by an African American woman ever to be filmed, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.\r\n\r\nShe continues to appear on television and in films including the landmark television adaptation of Alex Haley's Roots (1977) and John Singleton's Poetic Justice (1993). In 1996, she directed her first feature film, Down in the Delta. In 2008, she composed poetry for and narrated the award-winning documentary The Black Candle, directed by M.K. Asante, Jr.\r\n\r\nDr. Angelou has served on two presidential committees, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Arts in 2000, the Lincoln Medal in 2008, and has received 3 Grammy Awards. President Clinton requested that she compose a poem to read at his inauguration in 1993. Dr. Angelou's reading of her poem \"On the Pulse of the Morning\" was broadcast live around the world.\r\n\r\nDr. Angelou has received over 30 honorary degrees and is Reynolds Professor of American Studies at Wake Forest University.\r\n\r\nDr. Angelou’s words and actions continue to stir our souls, energize our bodies, liberate our minds, and heal our hearts.","options":[{"id":4950521,"name":"Men S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4950531,"name":"Men M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4950541,"name":"Men L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4950551,"name":"Men XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4950561,"name":"Women S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4950571,"name":"Women M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":4950581,"name":"Women L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30045101/-/Maya_Angelou__Black_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30045101/-/Maya_Angelou__Black_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/12970631/-/MAYA_Angelou_Tee_.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/12970631/-/MAYA_Angelou_Tee_.png","width":400,"height":640}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":1663851,"name":"Tribute Julius Nyerere T-shirt","permalink":"julius-kambarage-nyerere-t-shirt","position":98,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/julius-kambarage-nyerere-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-02-20T02:08:05.000Z","description":"All Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n\"The softest, smoothest, best-looking T-shirt available anywhere.\" \r\n100% Fine Jersey cotton construction\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJulius Kambarage Nyerere (April 13, 1922 - October 14, 1999) served as the first President of Tanzania and previously Tanganyika, from the country's founding in 1961 until his retirement in 1985.\r\n\r\nBorn in Tanganyika to Nyerere Burito (1860-1942), Chief of the Zanaki, Nyerere is known by the Swahili name Mwalimu or 'teacher', his profession prior to politics. He was also referred to as Baba wa Taifa (Father of the Nation). In October of 2009, Nyerere was named \"World Hero of Social Justice\" by the United Nations General Assembly.\r\n\r\nKambarage Nyerere was born on April 13, 1922. He began attending Government Primary School in Musoma at the age of 12 where he completed the 4 year programme in 3 years and went on to Tabora Government School in 1937. He received a scholarship to attend Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda where he obtained a teaching Diploma. He returned to Tanganyika and worked for 3 years at St. Mary’s Secondary School in Tabora, where he taught Biology and English. In 1949 he got a scholarship to attend the University of Edinburgh (he was the first Tanganyikan to study at a British university and only the second to gain a university degree outside Africa where he obtained his Masters of Arts degree on Economics and History in 1952. In Edinburgh, partly through his encounter with Fabian thinking, Nyerere began to develop his particular vision of connecting socialism with African communal living.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Tanganyika, Nyerere took a position teaching History, English and Kiswahili, at St. Francis' College, near Dar es Salaam. In 1953 he was elected president of Tanganyika African Association (TAA), a civic organisation dominated by civil servants, that he had helped found while a student at Makerere University. In 1954 he transformed TAA into the politically oriented Tanganyika African National Union (TANU). TANU's main objective was to achieve national sovereignty for Tanganyika. A campaign to register new members was launched, and within a year TANU had become the leading political organisation in the country.\r\n\r\nNyerere's activities attracted the attention of the Colonial authorities and he was forced to make a choice between his political activities and his teaching. He was reported as saying that he was a schoolmaster by choice and a politician by accident. He resigned from teaching and traveled throughout the country speaking to common people and tribal chiefs, trying to garner support for movement towards independence. He also spoke on behalf of TANU to the Trusteeship Council and Fourth Committee of the United Nations in New York. His oratory skills and integrity helped Nyerere achieve TANU goal for an independent country without war or bloodshed. The cooperative British governor Sir Richard Turnbull was also a factor in the struggle for independence. Nyerere entered the Colonial Legislative council in 1958 and was elected chief minister in 1960. In 1961 Tanganyika was granted self governance and Nyerere became its first Prime Minister on December 9, 1961. A year later Nyerere was elected President of Tanganyika when it became a Republic. Nyerere was instrumental in the union between the islands of Zanzibar and the mainland Tanganyika to form Tanzania.\r\n","options":[{"id":6071001,"name":"Men Black S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":6071011,"name":"Men Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":6071021,"name":"Men Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":6071031,"name":"Men Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":6071041,"name":"Men Black XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":38370189,"name":"Men XXXL","price":22.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":6071051,"name":"Women Black S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":6071061,"name":"Women Black M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":6071071,"name":"Women Black L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":6071081,"name":"Women Black XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":6141211,"name":"Men Red S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":6141221,"name":"Men Red M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":6141231,"name":"Men Red L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":6141241,"name":"Men Red XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":6141251,"name":"Men Red XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":6141261,"name":"Women Red S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":6141271,"name":"Women Red M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":6141281,"name":"Women Red L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":6141291,"name":"Women Red XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30047413/-/Julius_Nyerere_Red_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30047413/-/Julius_Nyerere_Red_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30047405/-/Julius_Nyerere_Black_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30047405/-/Julius_Nyerere_Black_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/15847641/-/Julius_Nyerere_Poster_Original.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/15847641/-/Julius_Nyerere_Poster_Original.png","width":600,"height":927}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":1428521,"name":"Tribute Lumumba T-shirt ","permalink":"lumumba-tshirt","position":99,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lumumba-tshirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-02-01T09:23:46.000Z","description":"All Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n100% Fine Jersey cotton construction\r\n\r\nPatrice Emery Lumumba\r\nb. July 2, 1925, Onalua, Belgian Congo [now Congo (Kinshasa)]\r\nd. January 1961, Katanga province\r\n\r\nAfrican nationalist leader, the first prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (June-September 1960). Forced out of office during a political crisis, he was assassinated a short time later.\r\n\r\nLumumba was born in the village of Onalua in Kasai province, Belgian Congo. He was a member of the small Batetela tribe, a fact that was to become significant in his later political life. His two principal rivals, Moise Tshombe, who led the breakaway of the Katanga province, and Joseph Kasavubu, who later became the nation's president, both came from large, powerful tribes from which they derived their major support, giving their political movements a regional character. In contrast, Lumumba's movement emphasized its all-Congolese nature.\r\n\r\nAfter attending a Protestant mission school, Lumumba went to work in Kindu-Port-Empain, where he became active in the club of the évolués (educated Africans). He began to write essays and poems for Congolese journals. Lumumba next moved to Léopoldville (now Kinshasa) to become a postal clerk and went on to become an accountant in the post office in Stanleyville (now Kisangani). There he continued to contribute to the Congolese press.\r\n\r\nIn 1955 Lumumba became regional president of a purely Congolese trade union of government employees that was not affiliated, as were other unions, to either of the two Belgian trade-union federations (socialist and Roman Catholic). He also became active in the Belgian Liberal Party in the Congo. Although conservative in many ways, the party was not linked to either of the trade-union federations, which were hostile to it. In 1956 Lumumba was invited with others to make a study tour of Belgium under the auspices of the Minister of Colonies. On his return he was arrested on a charge of embezzlement from the post office. He was convicted and condemned one year later, after various reductions of sentence, to 12 months' imprisonment and a fine.\r\n\r\nWhen Lumumba got out of prison, he grew even more active in politics. In October 1958 he founded the Congolese National Movement (Mouvement National Congolais; MNC), the first nationwide Congolese political party. In December he attended the first All-African People's Conference in Accra, Ghana, where he met nationalists from across the African continent and was made a member of the permanent organization set up by the conference. His outlook and terminology, inspired by pan-African goals, now took on the tenor of militant nationalism.\r\n\r\nIn 1959 the Belgian government announced a program intended to lead in five years to independence, starting with local elections in December 1959. The nationalists regarded this program as a scheme to install puppets before independence and announced a boycott of the elections. The Belgian authorities responded with repression. On October 30 there was a clash in Stanleyville that resulted in 30 deaths. Lumumba was imprisoned on a charge of inciting to riot.\r\n\r\nThe MNC decided to shift tactics, entered the elections, and won a sweeping victory in Stanleyville (90 percent of the votes). In January 1960 the Belgian government convened a Round Table Conference in Brussels of all Congolese parties to discuss political change, but the MNC refused to participate without Lumumba. Lumumba was thereupon released from prison and flown to Brussels. The conference agreed on a date for independence, June 30, with national elections in May. Although there was a multiplicity of parties, the MNC came out far ahead in the elections, and Lumumba emerged as the leading nationalist politician of the Congo. Maneuvers to prevent his assumption of authority failed, and he was asked to form the first government, which he succeeded in doing on June 23, 1960.\r\n\r\nA few days after independence, some units of the army rebelled, largely because of objections to their Belgian commander. In the confusion, the mineral-rich province of Katanga proclaimed secession. Belgium sent in troops, ostensibly to protect Belgian nationals in the disorder. But the Belgian troops landed principally in Katanga, where they sustained the secessionist regime of Moise Tshombe.\r\n\r\nThe Congo appealed to the United Nations to expel the Belgians and help them restore internal order. As prime minister, Lumumba did what little he could to redress the situation. His army was an uncertain instrument of power, his civilian administration untrained and untried; the United Nations forces (whose presence he had requested) were condescending and assertive, and the political alliances underlying his regime very shaky. The Belgian troops did not evacuate, and the Katanga secession continued.\r\n\r\nSince the United Nations forces refused to help suppress the Katangese revolt, Lumumba appealed to the Soviet Union for planes to assist in transporting his troops to Katanga. He asked the independent African states to meet in Léopoldville in August to unite their efforts behind him. His moves alarmed many, particularly the Western powers and the supporters of President Kasavubu, who pursued a moderate course in the coalition government and favoured some local autonomy in the provinces.\r\n\r\nOn September 5 President Kasavubu dismissed Lumumba. The legalities of the move were immediately contested by Lumumba. There were thus two groups now claiming to be the legal central government. On September 14 power was seized by the Congolese army leader Colonel Joseph Mobutu (president of Zaire as Mobutu Sese Seko), who later reached a working agreement with Kasavubu. In October the General Assembly of the United Nations recognized the credentials of Kasavubu's government. The independent African states split sharply over the issue.\r\n\r\nIn November Lumumba sought to travel from Leopoldville, where the United Nations had provided him with provisory protection, to Stanleyville, where his supporters had control. With the active complicity of foreign intelligence sources, Joseph Mobutu sent his soldiers after Lumumba. He was caught after several days of pursuit and spent three months in prison, while his adversaries were trying in vain to consolidate their power. Finally, aware that an imprisoned Lumumba was more dangerous than a dead Prime Minister, he was delivered on January 17, 1961, to the Katanga secessionist regime, where he was executed the same night of his arrival, along with his comrades Mpolo and Okito. His death caused a national scandal throughout the world, and, retrospectively, Mobutu proclaimed him a \"national hero.\"\r\n\r\nLumumba was a man of strong character who intended to pursue his policies, regardless of the enemies he made within his country or abroad. The Congo, furthermore, was a key area in terms of the geopolitics of Africa, and because of its wealth, its size, and its contiguity to white-dominated southern Africa, Lumumba's opponents had reason to fear the consequences of a radical or radicalized Congo regime. Moreover, in the context of the Cold War, the Soviet Union's support for Lumumba appeared at the time as a threat to many in the West.","options":[{"id":5251061,"name":"Men S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5251071,"name":"Men M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5251081,"name":"Men L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5251091,"name":"Men XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":38370798,"name":"Men XXL","price":25.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":38370801,"name":"Men XXXL","price":25.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":5251101,"name":"Women S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5251111,"name":"Women M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5251121,"name":"Women L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5251131,"name":"Women XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30049333/-/Lumumba_Black_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30049333/-/Lumumba_Black_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30049325/-/Lumumba__Red_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30049325/-/Lumumba__Red_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/13499111/-/Original_lumumba.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/13499111/-/Original_lumumba.png","width":647,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":1411781,"name":"Tribute Miriam Makeba T-shirt","permalink":"tribute-miriam-makeba-t-shirt","position":100,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tribute-miriam-makeba-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-01-30T19:56:18.000Z","description":"<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=www.tanodesign.com&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\nAll Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/lExbPP8zmUg?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/lExbPP8zmUg?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\"></embed></object>\r\n100% Fine Jersey cotton construction\r\n\r\n\r\nMiriam Makeba (4 March 1932 - 10 November 2008) was a South African singer and civil rights activist.

He led the bloodless coup which toppled the monarchy of King Farouk and heralded a new period of modernization and socialist reform in Egypt together with a profound advancement of pan-Arab nationalism.\r\n\r\nNasser is seen as one of the most important political figures in both modern Arab history and Third World politics in the 20th century. Although he was originally met with suspicion after putting the country's new president, Muhammad Naguib, under house arrest in 1954, he soon gained immense popularity in Egypt and the Arab world when he nationalized the Suez Canal from its British and French stockholders two years later. The consequent British, French, and Israeli invasion of and withdrawal from the canal zone installed Nasser as the decisive victor in the eyes of his people. Meanwhile, he had commenced work on the major projects of the Aswan High Dam in Upper Egypt and the Helwan steelworks. Through his actions and the charisma of his speeches, Nasser's version of pan-Arabism, also referred to as Nasserism, won a great following in the Arab world. By 1958, he united his country with Syria, forming the short-lived United Arab Republic (UAR). At the same time, he inspired successful and unsuccessful revolutions in several Arab countries.\r\n\r\nThis period of glory for Nasser had eroded roughly as soon it came about and three years after the founding of the union, Syria split from the UAR. Afterward, he concentrated on pursuing increased socialist and modernizing measures in Egypt which included the nationalization of more companies, reforming the al-Azhar Mosque, providing housing and universal health care, as well as other liberalization schemes. His commanding position among the Arab leaders was also re-established in the wake of Nasserist-led coups and revolutions in Algeria, Iraq, Syria, and North Yemen. The latter dragged him into war in North Yemen as he sent thousands of Egyptian troops to defend the new anti-royalist government. Nasser's status as \"leader of the Arabs\" was severely tarnished as a result of the Israeli victory over the Arab armies in the Six Day War of 1967, yet many in the general Arab populace still viewed him as a symbol of their dignity and freedom; when he declared his resignation soon after, tens of thousands of Egyptians immediately protested, prompting him to retract his decision. After 1967, Nasser commenced the War of Attrition with Israel and his strategy of playing the world superpowers — the US and the USSR — against each other ceased as he developed closer relations with the latter.\r\n\r\nOn September 28, 1970, Nasser died of a heart attack following the conclusion of an emergency Arab League summit he organized to end the civil war between Palestinian paramilitaries and the Jordanian Army. His funeral procession in Cairo drew in five million mourners while numerous others mourned throughout the Arab world. His mixed legacy is debated until the present day. TIME magazine wrote that, despite the mistakes and setbacks of his career, the elevation of dignity and pride Nasser instilled in Egyptians and Arabs everywhere \"may have been enough to balance his flaws and failures.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser","options":[{"id":5484631,"name":"Men S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5484641,"name":"Men M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5484651,"name":"Men L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5484661,"name":"Men XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5484671,"name":"Men XXL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5484681,"name":"Women S","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5484691,"name":"Women M","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5484701,"name":"Women L","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5484711,"name":"Women XL","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30051519/-/Gamal_Nasser_T-shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30051519/-/Gamal_Nasser_T-shirt.png","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/12971031/-/Printable_A3_L_GAMEL_ABDEL_NASSER.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/12971031/-/Printable_A3_L_GAMEL_ABDEL_NASSER.png","width":625,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":639341,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":1046421,"name":"Tribute Haile Selassie T-Shirt","permalink":"africanism-t-shirt-ii","position":102,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/africanism-t-shirt-ii","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-12-24T19:25:59.000Z","description":"All Rights Reserved ©\r\n\r\n100% Fine Jersey cotton construction\r\n \r\nHis Imperial Majesty Emperor Haile Selassie I (Ge'ez: \"Power of the Trinity\"; (23 July 1892 – 27 August 1975), born Tafari Makonnen, was Ethiopia's regent from 1916 to 1930 and Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974. The heir to a dynasty that traced its origins to the 13th century, and from there by tradition back to King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, Haile Selassie is a defining figure in both Ethiopian and African history.\r\n\r\nAt the League of Nations in 1936, the Emperor condemned the use of chemical weapons by Italy against his people. His internationalist views led to Ethiopia becoming a charter member of the United Nations, and his political thought and experience in promoting multilateralism and collective security have proved seminal and enduring. His suppression of rebellions among the nobles (mekwannint), as well as what some perceived to be Ethiopia's failure to modernize adequately, earned him criticism among some contemporaries and historians.\r\n\r\nHaile Selassie is revered as the religious symbol for God incarnate among the Rastafari movement, the number of followers is estimated between 200,000 and 800,000.
