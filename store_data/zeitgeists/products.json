HALLOW is both the name and soundtrack that accompanied Mark McCoy's debut drawing exhibition at LA's HOPE Gallery in 2009. The content from the exhibition was designed to unfurl like a broken seal of revelations along a horizon of decay and abandonment. Sonically speaking, looming perilously under a wash of malformation and debris are nine musical compositions to correspond with each of the drawings featured in the show.\r\n\r\nThe sensual packaging of this CD is intricately handmade and crafted in a luxurious uncoated archival carton and sealed with a wax-stamp. The artwork on the cover is entirely embossed and no ink is used. The exterior is heavy virgin acid-free paper. To enter one must break the seals to open a folio containing nine reproduction prints of each drawing.\r\n\r\nStanding on its own as an object of beauty, this project raises the bar of packaging and presentation like never before seen. All in all, an monumental effort on our part.\r\n\r\nWords by the almighty Mark McCoy\r\n\r\n<b>Limited to 222.</b>\r\n\r\nMore products of my other label Totalvernichtung / Todesstunde can be found: <a href=\"http://www.totalvernichtung.bigcartel.com\">here</a>\r\n\r\n<u> ----> If your country isn't listed for shipping, please contact me so that I can include it your country to give you the right rates.
