I could produce a monthly comic at that speed, but it'd probably only be four pages long. That's impressive. </b>\r\n\r\n<em> MF: I remember when making one page a week was monumental. Yeah, that schedule breaks down to drawing 4 pages a day. Inking 4 a day. Maybe 5 if the backgrounds can be colored in. It all overlaps. You know what helps? Not going online. That's something I had to struggle with, because as a self publisher, I still have to sell the work. I have to be on the ball in that regard, too. </em>\r\n\r\n<b> SF: Yeah, I think one thing a lot of people I know have had to try to make peace or come to terms with how they interact with the internet. On the one hand, it's great because a lot of the comics community is on twitter or facebook or whatever and right there to reach out to with technical questions, advice or like, instant validation for whatever new page or drawing you want to share. But there's the definite downside of having only so many hours in the day and the prospect of losing two hours to the void every night terrifies me a lot. And it happens all the time. </b>\r\n\r\n<em> MF: Right. So my schedule is a big mess of to-do lists. I'm also the person who processes the orders, stuffs the envelopes, makes sure I'm covering the costs, then it's back to drawing. Chuck Forsman does it, I'm sure he's developed a way to make it all move along, but it's a pretty intense routine. It had to be done, though.
