I've <a href=\"http://www.iamthelab.com/project-icandoit365/project-icandoit365-success-story-rori-harrington/\" target=\"_blank\">shown you stats</a> of artists who've watched their web traffic explode because of blogging, bringing fresh fans to their handmade shops. I've also showcased some <a href=\"http://www.iamthelab.com/create-inspire-handmade/blogging-inspiration-from-50-fresh-design-lifestyle-blogs/\" target=\"_blank\">pretty amazing blogs</a> along the way, in the hopes that they will inspire you to make blogging a part of your <a href=\"http://www.iamthelab.com/category/handmade-trifecta-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Handmade Trifecta</a>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yet, I know that some of you really want to add a blog to your handmade strategy, but you can't seem to figure out how. You know you want something attractive, functional and easy to maintain, but getting there is the challenge. Well, that's all about to change. Introducing the LAB Blog Build. Let the LAB build you the perfect <a href=\"http://wordpress.org\" target=\"_blank\">Wordpress.org</a> blog for your Handmade Trifecta.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">What do you get with a LAB Blog Build? I'm glad you asked. Here's what you'll receive:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Basic Theme Modification</strong>: Starting with your self-hosted Wordpress.org installation, I will find a theme and modify it to fit your blogging needs. I have a list of great templates that I prefer to use from some very talented designers including <a href=\"http://wpshower.com\" target=\"_blank\">Wpshower</a>, <a href=\"http://www.elmastudio.de\" target=\"_blank\">Elmastudio</a>, <a href=\"http://www.blogmilkshop.com\" target=\"_blank\">Blog Milk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wpexplorer.com\" target=\"_blank\">Wpexplorer</a> and <a href=\"http://dessign.net\" target=\"_blank\">Dessign</a>, to name a few. However, I'll be more than glad to use a template of your choice.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Plugins Selection</strong>: There are a billion Wordpress plugins out there and it can be really challenging to find the perfect set for your blog. Let me do the dirty work for you. I'll find them, install them and show you how they work.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Branding &amp; Graphic Design</strong>: You'll want your blog to coordinate with your online shop and social media, so I'll design the right graphics to pull your Handmade Trifecta all together.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Etsy Shop Integration</strong>: With some simple modifications and a plugin or two, we'll give your Etsy shop a new source of exposure by integrating it into your blog.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Post Layout Options</strong>: One of the biggest obstacles to regular blogging is trying to figure out what to blog about and how. I'll help you with some layout options that will give your posts a touch of razzamatazz and pizzazz.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Social Media Management</strong>: Integrating your social media is absolutely essential. I'll make sure that you are all connected and that your blog posts automatically find their way to Twitter, Facebook and beyond.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Free Ad</strong>: Just to make sure that folks know you've joined the world of blogging, I've tossed in 3 free months of advertising on the LAB.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Support</strong>: The build also comes with 2 months of email and phone support.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your LAB Blog Build should take 5 weeks or less to complete. Looking for a web host? I have a great recommendation for you. Let's talk!</p>\r\n\r\n<strong>December Special: Get a LAB Blog Build for only $350.
