Basil Hall and his printers have travelled many thousands of kilometres to work on the plates, screens or blocks with the artists, before returning to the Darwin studio of BHE to proof and edition the prints by hand.\r\n\r\nOnce the prints have dried, they are carefully numbered out of 100 and have the studio stamp applied to the bottom corner. They are sent to the artists for their approval and signature and return to the studio for packing in their specially designed folios.\r\n\r\nThis co-publication between the Art Centres, artists and BHE means that the artists are paid up front for their work, while the prints are wholesaled by the Art Centres themselves and BHE.\r\n\r\n1.

Mina Mina and the associated land is far to the west of Yuendumu in the sandhill country. Napanangka and Napangardi women are shown here collecting Jintiparnta (Edible fungus) at Kantakarlangu, an area that is also called Mina Mina. Ancestral women travelled from here to the north through Janyinki and other places then to the east to Alcoota country. There are a number of Mulju (water soakages) and a clay pan at Mina Mina and it is here that the women danced and performed various ceremonies. As a result Karla-ngu (digging sticks) rose up out of the ground and it is these implements that the women carried with them on their long journey east. \r\n\r\nARTIST: Judy Napangardi Watson \r\nTITLE: Kurrkara Jukurrpa\t\r\nMEDIUM: Etching & aquatint\r\nPLATE DRAWN & ETCHED:\t Darwin, July 2008\r\nEDITION: 100\r\nHAND PRINTED BY: Sean Smith & Nena Zanos\r\nAT: Basil Hall Editions, Darwin\r\nDATE COMPLETED: January 2009\r\n\r\nThe 2009 team at Basil Hall Editions (BHE) and six talented indigenous artists from northern and central Australia are proud to present Series IV of BHE’s Collectors’ Folios.\r\n\r\nOver the last four years we have now presented you with four series of superb etchings, silkscreens and relief prints; twenty four perfect excuses to start an art collection, gather inexpensive works by major Australian artists or give a unique gift.\r\n\r\nThese prints have been made in collaboration with Indigenous people from remote communities in the Northern Territory, Queensland, Western and South Australia.

Basil Hall and his printers have travelled many thousands of kilometres to work on the plates, screens or blocks with the artists, before returning to the Darwin studio of BHE to proof and edition the prints by hand.\r\n\r\nOnce the prints have dried, they are carefully numbered out of 100 and have the studio stamp applied to the bottom corner. They are sent to the artists for their approval and signature and return to the studio for packing in their specially designed folios.\r\n\r\nThis co-publication between the Art Centres, artists and BHE means that the artists are paid up front for their work, while the prints are wholesaled by the Art Centres themselves and BHE. If you need to find out stockists in your state or territory, call Basil Hall on 08 89417445 or enquire at the Art Centres above if you are visiting the Top End or Central Australia.","options":[{"id":1141680,"name":"Unframed","price":195.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2013057/-/bats.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2013057/-/bats.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2013053/-/bats-collectors.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2013053/-/bats-collectors.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":211659,"name":"Etchings, Drypoints & Monoprints","permalink":"etchings-drypoints-monoprints","url":"/category/etchings-drypoints-monoprints"}]},{"id":241816,"name":"Garry Shead – Tango IV","permalink":"garry-shead-–-tango-iv","position":29,"price":2000.0,"default_price":2000.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/garry-shead-–-tango-iv","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-02-22T11:27:24.000Z","description":"ARTIST: Garry Shead\r\nTITLE: Tango IV\r\nDOMICILE: Sydney\r\nMEDIUM: Multi-plate colour etching\r\nSIZE: 30 x 24.5cms\r\nEDITION SIZE: 100\r\nCOLLABORATOR / PRINTERS: Basil Hall / Monique Auricchio\r\nDATE COMPLETED: 2008\r\nSTUDIO: Basil Hall Editions","options":[{"id":1035690,"name":"Unframed","price":2000.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":36.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1745799/-/Shead-Tango-IV.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1745799/-/Shead-Tango-IV.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":211659,"name":"Etchings, Drypoints & Monoprints","permalink":"etchings-drypoints-monoprints","url":"/category/etchings-drypoints-monoprints"}]},{"id":241794,"name":"Bardayal Lofty Nadjamerrek -
