Our best guy Bean was just 8 months old when he posed for this photo in our basement.\r\n\r\nThis two tone green hat is made from an ultra thick and soft acrylic/wool mix yarn. Kelly green edging frames the face and a two tone blue crocheted rosette tops it off. Two curly green leaves sit on either side of the flower on top of the hat. This piece is thick, high-quality and durable. Blossom pictured is blue with aqua center. Please note, the string tie hats do not stay on as well during activities as our button strap hats. These are best for photos and, like all of our apparel and accessories, should not be left on your pet when unattended.\r\n\r\nIf you would like a hat with a more traditional pom pom instead of a flower on top, please see our other listing for our string tie hat with pom pom. We are not able to fill orders for custom colors in this hat during the holiday season, but will list other colors as we have them available.\r\n\r\nOur best guy Bean the Boston Terrier is wearing a size small. His neck is 11\" and he weighs 20lbs. The necks on these hats are very adjustable, so we recommend ordering down if your dog is on the edge of two sizes so that the head will be a better fit.\r\nXXSmall Neck 7-8\", fits very tiny dogs and cats (smaller head size)\r\nXSmall Neck 8-10\", fits most dogs up to 15 lbs\r\nSmall Neck 11-14\", fits most dogs up to 30lbs\r\nMedium Neck 15-18\", fits most dogs up to 45lbs\r\n\r\nThis item will be assembled to order and will ship 4-7 days after purchase.\r\n\r\n*Third image is an adorable customer photo of a Boston also named \"Beans\" in Salt Lake City","options":[{"id":10957061,"name":"XSmall Neck 8-11\"","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10957063,"name":"Small Neck 11-14\"","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10957065,"name":"Medium Neck 15-18\"","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":10957067,"name":"Large Neck 19-22\"","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":25394769,"name":"XXSmall Neck 7-8\"","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.25,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.25,"amount_with_others":1.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38400056/-/blueblossnewwm.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38400056/-/blueblossnewwm.jpg","width":488,"height":649}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1717570,"name":"Hats","permalink":"hats","url":"/category/hats"}]}]
