This recording also features vocals by James R. of Swamp Witch and Your Enemy.\r\n\r\nCircle of Eyes was conceived in 2008 for the love of resonance and embracing the realization of decay in the intent to record/release records and perform the occasional live performance. The creative core-duo of Kevin Gan Yuen (Sutekh Hexen, Fermentæ, OGHAM) along with Thrull (Black Fucking Cancer and Necrite) proceed with Circle of Eyes as an on-going project in the practice of unraveling and challenging the conventional notions of the loud, slow and down-tuned metal traditions of the Bay Area's rich sonic tapestry. Joined by vocalist/collaborator James R. (Swamp Witch and Your Enemy) this entity's uncompromising collective vision is to present an exclusive aural documentation of the unquestionable decay of black metal, drone, and experimental music genres.\r\n\r\nWith three mammoth tracks that spread over 37 minutes, this recording is mastered by James Plotkin specifically for the vinyl and digital formats. The artwork and design was executed by Kevin Gan Yuen with help from Stephen Wilson for an 18” x 24” fold-out poster and Icelandic (by way of Sweden) artist and musician Jóhannes Gunnar Þorsteinsson (Ziz) for the insert photography. The jackets are a tip-on style, single sleeve jacket printed from Stoughton Printing Company, black dust sleeves, a three button set that’s housed in a black zip lock bag, and a download card printed on 32 lb. metallic stock to redeem the entire recording which also includes the re-mastered 2009 demo as an an added bonus.

Featuring monolithic emissions from <b>Mournful Congregation, Loss, Orthodox, and Otesanek,</b> this four-track album reeks of desolation, the gnashing of teeth and virulent decay. “Heavy” does not begin to do these songs justice; the riffs stumble and crawl through an acid bath of feedback and distortion, dragging themselves along on broken knees. Funereal horde Mournful Congregation hail from Australia, and recently released a much-hailed compilation album via 20 Buck Spin, as well as news of a brand-new full-length and virgin US tour. With “Despond” (Profound Lore), Nashville’s Loss released one of the most painfully beautiful and critically-acclaimed albums of 2010, entombing listeners with a richly melodic, flowing shroud of depression. Orthodox’s ultra-minimal, droning, ambient take on the traditional rites of doom bleeds forth from Spain and belies the myth that sun breeds contentment. Otesanek, now-defunct and much-missed, crawled out of the filth and desperation of Philadelphia; their sludgy, crusty, unbearably brutal sound remains unmatched today. The quartet of compositions on Fo(ur) Burials are all very different, yet drawn together by a shared atmosphere of longing, sadness, and disgust for that which we call life. The cult of death is calling.
