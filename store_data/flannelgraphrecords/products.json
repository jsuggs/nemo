Rock, funk, synth-pop, disco, ambient, space-age: nothing suffices. It's funny, it's solemn, it's light, it's shady, it's sly, it's earnest, and it's none and all of the above. Enjoy it ironically and suddenly it gets sublime; take it seriously and soon enough it's having fun at your expense. I dare you to try to file this one away - chances are it'll keep poking its head out of your\r\ncollection, challenging you to figure it all out before it even attracts a speck of dust.\"\r\n- Marc Masters (Pitchfork, The Wire)\r\n\r\nOriginally self-released in 1977, synthesizer pioneer Don Muro’s It’s Time is the singular work of one man combining his skills as a trained musician with a truly creative spirit and the somewhat unmarketable insistence that all of these different styles of music would make up his debut album. While this kind of genre hopping can often take away from an album’s coherence, “It’s Time” works as a whole because these are such well-crafted and interesting songs. At times playfully fun, at times beautifully earnest, It’s Time is consistently engaging for its\r\nentire 42 minutes. Muro’s sincere love of what he is creating shines through whether it’s a catchy,\r\ntriumphant rock anthem, a subtly emotive instrumental synthesizer piece or an intense fusion dance jam.\r\n\r\n“This album was released 36 years ago. Listening to it now brings fond memories of an intensely\r\ncreative period in my life. There was time to explore many styles of music, and there was time to\r\nexperiment with new instruments and equipment. No computers, no MIDI - only a room crammed with guitars, drums, keyboards, and an 8-track tape recorder.  I didn’t have a specific audience for the album, hence the\r\nvariety of styles. Back then people would actually sit and listen to albums as a total experience. I started\r\nand ended the album with aggressive synthesizer music, but in between those songs I was inviting\r\nlisteners to go for a ride. Looking back, I would say that the variety of styles is both the strongest and\r\nweakest aspect of the album. But that’s who I was and, to a degree, who I still am. “ \r\n- Don Muro, 2013\r\n\r\nHaving spent much of his life teaching others about the latest music technology through his books, videos,\r\nclasses and seminars, Muro’s influence on electronic music is immeasurable. His demonstration compositions for the legendary Korg M1 helped to make it the world’s best selling synthesizer. The recipient of several ASCAP\r\ncomposition awards, Muro’s music has been performed everywhere from New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral\r\n(where he presented the cathedral's first synthesizer concert) to Disneyland.\r\n\r\ndonmuro.com\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":41780211,"name":"LP (w/ download)","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48560832,"name":"CD

new Candy Claws LP on Two Syllable Records just might be our favorite album of the year! We like it so much that we are releasing a special instrumental mix of it! This is a limited edition of 100 tapes (including download cards). \r\nHere's Ryan from Candy Claws to tell you all about it!......\r\n\r\n\"What is DUAL MONO? Isn't that just stereo? Yes, stereo does consist of two separate channels, a right and a left, but it often shares sounds between the two, placing them in the \"middle\" of the stereo spectrum. In dual mono, none of the sounds in the left channel are shared in the right, and vice versa. This results in two isolated channels with nothing in between. Each side can be listened to as its own version of the song, and this method can highlight various instruments often lost in a complete stereo mix.\r\n\r\nIn this album, the rhythm section appears in the left channel. This is the drums, bass, percussion, rhythm guitar, and rhythm keyboards. The melodies appear in the right channel, usually played by lead guitars, keyboards, flutes, trumpets, trombones, clarinets, strings, etc. The orchestrations on tracks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 12 were created by Bryan Senti in New York.\r\n\r\nMuch of the haze was stripped away and the mix decompressed to offer a chance to listen to these instrumentals with the utmost clarity. This was how the mixes for \"Ceres & Calypso in the Deep Time\" were originally conceived, before we sent them back to the Mesozoic and the effects of time dilation, dimension inversion, instant fossilization, and magnetic thaw took their toll on the frequencies.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this new glimpse into the music.\"\r\n\r\n                                       -Ryan, May 2013\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":38426175,"name":"Instrumental Cassette (w/download card)","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/119551926/-/C_C_Cassette_Online_NEW.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/119551926/-/C_C_Cassette_Online_NEW.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":68062,"name":"Candy Claws","permalink":"candy-claws","url":"/artist/candy-claws"}],"categories":[{"id":2888895,"name":"Cassettes","permalink":"cassettes","url":"/category/cassettes"},{"id":3255585,"name":"Flannelgraph Releases","permalink":"flannelgraph-releases","url":"/category/flannelgraph-releases"}]},{"id":10440385,"name":"Via Vegrandis ||| Via Vegrandis EP ||| Compact Disc","permalink":"preorder-april-30-release-via-vegrandis-s-t-ep-compact-disc","position":10,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/preorder-april-30-release-via-vegrandis-s-t-ep-compact-disc","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-09T16:53:51.000Z","description":"What is Via Vegrandis?

Ever wondered what it’s like to be a dude from Crown Point, Indiana? Well this is for you - especially if you enjoy the sound of bands like Orange Juice, Felt, The Durutti Column, etc. coated in a mouthwatering sheen of oopy doopy Labrador Records glaze. These five songs are cohesive, yet individually distinct. While they sounded great upon first listen, what brings us back to this again and again is the excellent songwriting, a combination of hard work, lyrical & musical fortitude, and just taking your time with things while making interesting and engaging songs.\r\nChuck Berry’s cousin Marvin called us one day and told us that he had found that new sound that we were looking for. As he held the phone up into the air, the music of Via Vegrandis floated into the receiver, went down through the cord and all of the subsequent telephone wires and eventually found its way into our hearts. Marvin was right. \r\n\r\n1. Moving Target\r\n2. Another Statistical Quirk\r\n3. Foot In The Jamb\r\n4. Standing Still\r\n5.

Recommended!\r\n\r\nvia Orindal Records....\r\n\r\nFollowing the critically acclaimed debut album, A Shut-In’s Prayer (#19 on MOJO Magazine’s Best Albums of 2012 list), Advance Base returns with a tribute to early 20th century Texas street preacher, singer, songwriter & musical innovator Washington Phillips entitled The World Is In A Bad Fix Everywhere.\r\n\r\nWashington Phillips only recorded eighteen songs during his short career as a professional recording artist, & only sixteen of those recordings exist today. Mystery surrounds Washington Phillips’ music, as there is no known documentation of how it was made. For many years, it was believed that he performed his songs on a tiny, piano-like instrument called a dolceola, but many scholars now believe that Phillips custom modified two celestaphones (archaic, zither-like instruments), which he played simultaneously in his own special tunings. The strange, angelic sounds of strummed & plucked strings that accompany Washington Phillips’ forlorn spirituals have made him a legendary figure in gospel & outsider music circles.\r\n\r\nFor The World Is In A Bad Fix Everywhere, Advance Base’s Owen Ashworth has arranged a selection of Washington Phillips’ compositions for autoharp, piano, electric piano, drum machine & voice. Phillips’ unique, beautiful melodies & heartbreaking lyrics are a natural match for Ashworth’s raw, inventive production & doleful singing voice. Performed, recorded & mixed solely by Ashworth at his home in Chicago, Illinois, these tracks stretch the sound of Advance Base in new directions while paying tribute to one of Ashworth’s greatest influences. The World Is In A Bad Fix Everywhere showcases elements of gospel, psychedelic rock, traditional Americana, alt. country & lo-fi outsider art.\r\n\r\nThe World Is In A Bad Fix Everywhere was mastered by Timothy Stollenwerk, the same engineer who mastered a posthumous vinyl reissue compilation of Washington Phillips' original recordings entitled What Are They Doing In Heaven Today?\r\n\r\n\"The World Is In A Bad Fix Everywhere\" was recently included in the Chicago Reader's Best of Chicago 2013 list.\r\n\r\n1.

They’ve never been on tour. They’ve yet to release a blog-burning single. Until now, the only music to speak of was a self-released 12” EP from 2007, limited to a mere 100 copies! Yet, somehow, from the very first show, Prayer Breakfast seemed like something you’d already missed out on, though it was happening right before your very eyes. The truth is, Prayer Breakfast began as a simple excuse for some music-loving buddies to hang out together, eat pizza and whittle the hours away on YouTube.com. Nothing more. And I think that’s why their existence is such a powerful, and inviting one. Not only does the listening become a pleasure when there’s no pretense or uncalled for self-righteous ambition, but these guys are doing-like pros-exactly what we’re all clamoring for most of the time, anyway; spending valuable, quality time with their friends doing something that excites them and turns them on.\r\n\r\nDid I also mention that the songs are incredibly catchy and sooo good? I suppose that’s to be expected from the modern era’s indie rock version of the Cherokee Cowboys. What I mean to say is, this is a Bloomington, Indiana supergroup of the highest order. Every member of this band has been/is involved in a musical project that is recognized nationally (and in some cases, worldwide) on some scale, and this fact shines through like a lazerbeam shooting out of every song. Solid, head-bobbing rhythms and unforgettable hooks coming from the voices and the guitars are going to remind you of things like Heavy Vegetable, Built to Spill and Modest Mouse with touches of Dinosaur Jr. and No Knife, but don’t stop there, or you might have\r\nalready missed the point.\"\r\n\r\n1.
