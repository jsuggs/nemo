Originally developed for the severe conditions endured by wildland firefighters, LP protects, preserves, and restores boots, saddles, motorcycle leathers, tool pouches, gloves, baseball mitts, and more. It is especially useful for any leather that gets worked hard and is regularly exposed to harsh environments.\r\n\r\nThree natural oils are suspended in Beeswax and Propolis. In the leather these oils gradually seep out of the Beeswax/Propolis suspension formula. If exposed to heat or flexing the oils are released faster so leather gets oiled instead of parched and cracked.

The unique User Interface (UI) of the Tailcap decouples High/Low selection from On/Off functionality for predictable performance in high stress situations, an critical tactical advantage.  This model is excellent for every day carry (EDC) as the Low Beam is perfect for daily tasks or navigation while the blinding bright High Beam can blind an assailant or illuminate objects over 300 feet (100 meters).  \r\n\r\nA set of USA made 123A batteries is included with each Elzetta flashlight from the factory.\r\n\r\nWeight with batteries: 5.3oz (150g)\r\nLength: 4.9\" (125mm)\r\n\r\nMade in USA.\r\n\r\n<META NAME=\"Description\" CONTENT=\"Elzetta ZFL-M60-CS2D Flashlight\">","options":[{"id":12419044,"name":"Default","price":158.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.95,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":25.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43635305/-/elzetta_zfl_m60_cs2d_v4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43635305/-/elzetta_zfl_m60_cs2d_v4.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43635337/-/elzetta_zfl_m60_cs2d_v5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43635337/-/elzetta_zfl_m60_cs2d_v5.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36681932/-/elzetta_zfl_m60_cs2d_v1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36681932/-/elzetta_zfl_m60_cs2d_v1.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43635361/-/elzetta_zfl_m60_cs2d_v3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43635361/-/elzetta_zfl_m60_cs2d_v3.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5377956,"name":"Camping","permalink":"camping","url":"/category/camping"},{"id":2030206,"name":"Camp Tools","permalink":"camp-tools","url":"/category/camp-tools"},{"id":5377872,"name":"Accessories - Every Day Carry (EDC)","permalink":"accessories-every-day-carry-edc","url":"/category/accessories-every-day-carry-edc"},{"id":2095756,"name":"Flashlights and Acc.","permalink":"flashlights-and-acc","url":"/category/flashlights-and-acc"}]},{"id":7390813,"name":"Exotac MATCHCAP XL","permalink":"exotac-matchcap-xl","position":37,"price":32.0,"default_price":32.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/exotac-matchcap-xl","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-29T03:34:46.000Z","description":"Category: <a href=\"http://www.woodandmetal.com/category/camping\" target=\"_self\"<em><strong>Camping</strong></em></a>\r\n\r\nThe MATCHCAP XL™ is a nearly indestructible waterproof match case for storing matches and other fire starting material.  By integrating the red-phosphorus striker into the threaded are of the capsule, we created an innovative solution for having to pack separate match strikers.  To ensure our match case was going to be the best out there, we added a concealed o-ring, durable square threads, a bottom strike-anywhere striker, and a high-end aesthetic to bring it all together.\r\n\r\nThe MATCHCAP XL™ can carry all sizes of matches from the standard kitchen strike-on-the-box to NATO lifeboat matches and even the extended length stormproof matches.  With the dual-striker design you can use safety matches, strike-anywhere matches, or a combination of two.  An O-ring keeps both the matches and the red phosphorus (strike-on-the-box) striker dry.\r\n\r\nThe MATCHCAP XL™ isn’t limited to just matches. Using a Stormproof (2.9” long) match, leaves 0.3” to spare for tinder storage. If using kitchen matches, nearly half of the MATCHCAP XL™ is available for storage. Use the extra space to store water purification tablets, tinder, medicine, fishing hooks, first aid kit, etc.\r\nFor maximum match capacity, place a majority of the matches head up with a few head down.\r\n\r\nWaterproof, safe and redundant match striker design\r\nReplaceable striking pads\r\nWorks with both safety and strike anywhere matches\r\nFits matches more than 2.9\" in length\r\nScalloped body allows easy match removal\r\nSquare threaded cap for maximum durability\r\nWaterproof to depths >5 meters\r\nLightweight aircraft grade 6061 aluminum construction Anodized and laser engraved for durability\r\nUnique knurl for grip and use with strike anywhere matches\r\n\r\nAvailable in Gunmetal and Blaze Orange\r\n\r\nIncluded in the box:\r\nExtra O-rings \r\nExtra match strikers \r\nUser manual\r\n\r\n- C.H.\r\n\r\nLength: 3.60\"\r\nDiameter: 1.20\"\r\nWeight: 1.25oz\r\nStrike: 25-50 per pad\r\n\r\nMatch Capacity:\r\nKitchen: 40\r\nStormproof: 25\r\nNato: 32\r\n\r\nMade in USA.\r\n\r\n<META NAME=\"Description\" CONTENT=\"Exotac MATCHCAP XL\">","options":[{"id":23371961,"name":"Gunmetal","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23443639,"name":"Blaze Orange","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23443803,"name":"MATCHCAP XL Refill Kit","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.95,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":12.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73720521/-/exotac_matchcap_xl_orange_v1b.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73720521/-/exotac_matchcap_xl_orange_v1b.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73719777/-/exotac_matchcap_xl_both_v1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73719777/-/exotac_matchcap_xl_both_v1.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5377956,"name":"Camping","permalink":"camping","url":"/category/camping"},{"id":2030206,"name":"Camp Tools","permalink":"camp-tools","url":"/category/camp-tools"},{"id":5377872,"name":"Accessories - Every Day Carry (EDC)","permalink":"accessories-every-day-carry-edc","url":"/category/accessories-every-day-carry-edc"}]},{"id":9453425,"name":"UCO Stormproof Matches","permalink":"uco-stormproof-matches","position":38,"price":3.5,"default_price":3.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/uco-stormproof-matches","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-12T20:59:30.000Z","description":"Category: <a href=\"http://www.woodandmetal.com/category/camping\" target=\"_self\"<em><strong>Camping</strong></em></a>\r\n\r\nUCO Stormproof Matches are the best matches available for harsh conditions.

A great combination with the <a href=\"http://www.woodandmetal.com/product/exotac-matchcap-xl\" target=\"_blank\">MATCHCAP XL.</a>\r\n\r\nTIPS\r\nThese matches burn quickly and aggressively so be prepared.  Although wind and water will not put them out, it will hamper your ability to ignite other materials by reducing the flame size.  Be sure to have a wind break and fire preparations in place prior to lighting these.\r\n\r\nThe stick of these matches does NOT burn.  Once the material has been consumed (15s), the match will go out.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to take along several types of matches to increase your fire starting possibilities.

In simpler times all you needed was some dry tinder and a match. In the Kelly Kettle I found my way back to those times. I am able to pack this well built stainless tool and have hot water in minutes, wherever I am, without building a large fire or having to pack expensive fuel with me.\r\n\r\nSimply build a small fire in the base of the Kelly Kettle using twigs, pinecones, dry grass, bark or similar materials found close by. Place the water filled Kettle on top of the base before lighting the fire through the vent hole on the side of the base.

Cleans, conditions, preserves and weatherproofs all smooth oil-tanned leathers. Allows the leather to breathe. Buffs to a soft shine. How to apply: First clean the leather article by wiping it down with a sponge and clean water. You don't need a cleaner unless there is obvious discolorations in the leather. We recommend using a pH neutral cleaner. While the leather is still damp use a soft lint-free cloth, apply a small amount of dressing to the leather. Use a circular motion to work the dressing into the fibers. Continue to do this to all the leather parts of the article. There should only be a sheen on the surface of the leather after working the dressing in. Buff vigorously all areas with a clean cloth to melt the surface waxes to a nice shine.\r\n\r\nPecard Leather Dressing will darken your leather, but a minimal amount. It is a great option when you are only looking to preserve as much of the natural color while still protecting your leather.

The paper filter eliminates the grit typical of a French press.

Ranger lenses are designed to protect your eyes while highlighting your target and increasing overall contrast.\r\n\r\nThis RE Ranger XLW™ 3 lens premium set features fast and easily interchangeable optical grade polycarbonate lenses in Medium Yellow, Brown, and Copper Polarized. This combination of lenses was chosen specifically with the upland bird hunter and sport shooter in mind.\r\n\r\nDesign elements of the XLW include the industries first 8-base wrap frame, 100% distortion free NexPC™ lenses, soft silicone notepads with an adjustable nose bridge, military inspired bayonet temples for under head gear or ear protection and a lifetime warranty on all solder joints (assuming normal use).\r\n\r\nHaving the right lens tint is very beneficial for the shooting and outdoor enthusiast. See below the unique attributes of each of these tints included in the set.\r\n\r\nRandolph's Copper Polarized lens blocks undesirable blue light while improving contrast in other colors. It is an excellent choice for shooting targets against a green background on a bright day. This lens works great for sight fishing as well.\r\n\r\nThe Brown lens set is perfect for hunting game birds against an open background on bright, glaring days. It reduces light and is great at picking up the brown hues of the birds.\r\n\r\nThe Medium Yellow lenses are Randolph's most popular yellow tint. They are designed to highlight orange clay targets and enhance contrast in low light or overcast conditions.\r\n\r\nRandolph Engineering is so confident they make a product which will last you a lifetime they include a maintenance kit with each XLW set.

I came away inspired to collaboratively design something truly amazing - a glove that would be comfortable and functional all year long, but at its prime in the fall and winter.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to selecting the leather for this custom lined glove, kangaroo was the obvious choice. Kangaroo leather is selected for the finest driving, riding, shooting, and specialty gloves made. It is strong, dense, and wears well, allowing the thickness to be kept at a minimum for extraordinary dexterity in a lined leather glove. It also handles water and holds its shape better than many other leathers.\r\n\r\nThe 100% merino wool liner is an excellent compliment, keeping your hands warm while it absorbs excess moisture coming through the leather or from your skin. These select materials combined make these gloves amazingly comfortable to wear even as the temperature rises, or as you warm up from your activities.\r\n\r\nAs a finishing touch, we use matching kangaroo leather for the binding instead of the common synthetic material. Though the kangaroo binding is more costly and labor intensive, it is the combination of fine details like this that set this glove apart. \r\n\r\nNo one sells a better glove.\r\n\r\n\r\n-C.H.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlove: saddle brown wild kangaroo\r\nLiner: 100% Australian merino wool\r\n\r\nMade in the USA by Geier Glove exclusively for Wood and Metal.\r\n\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n// Popup window code\r\nfunction newPopup(url) {\r\n\tpopupWindow = window.open(\r\n\t\turl,'popUpWindow','height=550,width=550,left=10,top=10,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,toolbar=no,menubar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=yes')\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n<a href=\"JavaScript:newPopup('http://www.woodandmetal.com/sizing-care');\">Sizing & Care Information</a>\r\n\r\n<META NAME=\"Description\" CONTENT=\"Geier Glove Co.

Whether cleaning an antique SxS shotgun, lubricating the rails on my tile saw, cleaning and protecting my <a href=\"http://www.woodandmetal.com/category/flashlights-and-acc\" target=\"_blank\">Elzetta Tactical Flashlights</a> or keeping my Hi-Lift jack in good working condition, Ballistol is my first choice.  Read on and you'll understand why.\r\n\r\n-C.H.\r\n\r\nThe most astounding feature of Ballistol is perhaps its universality. No other protectant/lubricant on the market compares.\r\n\r\nBallistol allows you to clean, preserve, protect, prevent corrosion, maintain, impregnate and disinfect metal, wood, hard plastics, and even smooth leather - all without contaminating the environment.  Ballistol is biodegradable and contains no carcinogens. \r\n\r\nWARNING: Do not use on suede.\r\n\r\nUnlike most oils, Ballistol mixes with water and penetrates it. When the water evaporates, Ballistol stays behind and continues to protect.\r\n\r\nCurrent stock is labeled either Ballistol Lube or Ballistol Sportsman's Oil.  Contents are the exact same product and manufacturer.  Either label may ship in an order.
