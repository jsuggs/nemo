On a white or grey background for example, with plenty of light.","options":[{"id":42533856,"name":"Default","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":15.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123624555/-/Chaos.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123624555/-/Chaos.jpg","width":1266,"height":842}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6119676,"name":"Artwork","permalink":"artwork","url":"/category/artwork"}]}]
