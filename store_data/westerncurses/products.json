Showing that even the noisiest among us can get better with age rather than fade away, the two bands are releasing a split 7 inch together. They share traits that havenâ€™t been given up over the years- they are still loud, energetic, melodic, and, well, probably a bit drunk. And as this record shows, they are now also adept at wailing guitars, thoughtful songwriting, and wonderfully nuanced lyrics.","options":[{"id":12343630,"name":"Default","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35818018/-/split.cover.final.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35818018/-/split.cover.final.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2069186,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]}]
