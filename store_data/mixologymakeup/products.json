We are currently donating 5% of our monthly sales, but now we have a bigger mission! Our goal is to be able to sponsor 1 clean water well in an African Village through Blood:Water Mission (www.bloodwatermission.com). To do this, we will be donating $1 per item sold, that’s $1 per item, not $1 per sale! Our hope is to sell 3,000 products for the 1000 Wells Project by December 25th, 2008. Can we do it? With your help we can, we are fortunate enough to never think about where to get pure water only what pure water to choose. Did you know $1 = 1 year of clean water for an African! The 1000 Wells Project is building 1000 wells and clean water projects in 1000 African communities. Businesses, churches, schools, artists and individuals are collecting funds so they can sponsor the construction of wells in Africa. In the process, they are learning about how <span class=\"caps\">HIV</span>/AIDS affects African communities, and what it means to partner humbly with communities to pursue transformation. You can also help us by passing this on to any family or friends that would like to be apart of our challenge. Right now 3,000 products seems an impossible goal, but I choose to believe in Incredible things, not Impossible things!
