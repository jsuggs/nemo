(See drop down menu for colours- Those with * are pictured)\r\n\r\nThese are NOTHING like the twisted \"dreadlock\" extensions on dreadlocks.com.au, (also available for $3 each) which can untwist.\r\n\r\nThey are approx 0.8-1 cm thick and have one rounded end, and one tapered (pointy) end. This means you can choose which end you attach to your hair! They can be trimmed or even cut in half to make two.\r\n\r\nThese dreadlock extensions will not untwist, and are permanent. They look and feel a lot like human dreadlocks, and are slightly softer, stronger, and a little shinier. NOTE: They cannot be dyed- Their colour is permanent.\r\n\r\nAvailable in colours listed below.
