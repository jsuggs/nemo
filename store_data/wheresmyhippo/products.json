Real, FSC certified wood is used instead of synthetic or look alike \"stickers\".

American Apparel calls it a California Fleece. Light enough not to be bulky, but also warm enough for an evening at the beach.\r\n \r\nOur store is filled with illustration based designs featuring Herbert. This time we wanted to get back to our creative side but not in the typical illustration way we had developed Whereâ€™s My Hippo shirts around.\r\n\r\nThis time we focused on photography. To get started on this design, we rifled through a collection of old photos from 2008. Everything in this folder had been shot on a 1.3 megapixel Olympus digital camera. One of the shots was taken on a street (which shall remain nameless) in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, CA. The palm lined streets of Southern California are as iconic as the stars on Hollywood Blvd. so shooting a good picture of them is pretty easy.\r\n\r\nAs we were scrolling through this album of pictures, we  stopped  on the picture used in this design. We ended up editing the image down to three colors and having it screen-printed on a black American Apparel California Fleece. The back features a small upper white hippo print just below the neckline. Soft and warm.  \r\n\r\nAvailable for purchase exclusively through our online store\r\n \r\nConsider ordering a size up, these (like many American Apparel goods) run small, or a \"European Fit\". \r\n \r\nVery limited quantities, no exchanges. Returns are okay if shirt is returned in unworn condition.
