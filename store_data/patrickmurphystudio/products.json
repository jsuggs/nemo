It is the largest international contemporary art festival in the UK. For ten weeks every two years the city of Liverpool is host to an extraordinary range of artworks, projects and a dynamic programme of events. Leading and emerging artists have been commissioned to make permanent and temporary public artworks as well as long-term community-based projects. Works by over 60 artists from across the globe, unfold across the city in its major galleries.\r\n\r\nBelonging responds to the Biennial theme of the 'Unexpected Guest'. Banished from city centres and branded a nuisance, pigeons will become a familiar sight at the Walker Art Gallery during the Biennial, when around 205 brightly coloured birds will adorn the exterior of the gallery.\r\n\r\nBelonging elevates the very familiar site of pigeons from their everyday urban context; here they are welcome, colourful visitors. However the installation also evokes questions about ownership and feelings of being accepted or marginalised. Anthropomorphised, the pigeons can be seen to represent any group that struggles to find a natural home or sense of acceptance in a physical or geographical space.\r\n\r\nPatrick Murphy said, “Belonging will engage audiences with its bright colour compositions, but there's actually a deeper meaning behind the installation. The emblem of the pigeon is used to highlight the very human struggle in finding acceptance or a natural sense of place, whether this be an intellectual or a physical/geographical homeland\"\r\n\r\nThe Walker Art Gallery is an art gallery in Liverpool, which houses one of the largest art collections in England, outside of London. It is part of the National Museums Liverpool group, and is promoted as \"the National Gallery of the North\" because it is not a local or regional gallery but is part of the national museums and galleries administered directly from central government funds.\r\n\r\nFor more information visit <a href=\"http://www.patrickmurphystudio.co.uk/index.php?/works/belonging/#.UeQEINKHx80 target=\"_blank\" title=\"Patrick Murphy Studio Shop\">visit Patrick Murphy website</a>","options":[{"id":39269766,"name":"Unframed","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121314525/-/Frame-pigeon.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121314525/-/Frame-pigeon.png","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5738652,"name":"Screenprint","permalink":"screenprint","url":"/category/screenprint"}]},{"id":12297945,"name":"Tradition I","permalink":"tradition-i","position":2,"price":95.0,"default_price":95.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tradition-i","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-07-10T22:52:31.000Z","description":"Limited edition screenprint\r\nSomerset satin paper, 310gsm \r\nSize, 510mm x 370mm \r\nDeckle edge \r\nHand signed and numbered by the artist \r\nEdition of 50\r\n\r\nThis screenprint is taken from a series of paintings called Tradition. The symbol of the Whippet is central to this series of works. The breed was first popularised in the 1860s, in the north of England, where whippet racing took off with factory and mine workers in northern towns and cities. \r\nThe whippet was nicknamed 'the poor man's racehorse' and it became synonymous with the pastimes of working classes. In comparison the series also visually references the formal compositions of the 18th century artist George Stubbs. Stubbs was born in Liverpool, the son of a currier and leather merchant. He is regarded as the quintessential equine painter commissioned by leading aristocratic patrons to depict their horses.\r\n\r\nThe series of whippets are depicted in a typical show pose similar to how Stubbs composed his equine works. The dogs are presented in a series of identical silhouettes, only the inner content changes, with patterns referencing a past industry and contemporary culture, turning them from animal into a symbol.\r\n\r\nFor more information visit <a href=\"http://www.patrickmurphystudio.co.uk/index.php?/works/faster/#.Ud30dzuHx80 target=\"_blank\" title=\"Patrick Murphy Studio Shop\">visit Patrick Murphy website</a>","options":[{"id":39041946,"name":"Unframed","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121128105/-/dog.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121128105/-/dog.png","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5738652,"name":"Screenprint","permalink":"screenprint","url":"/category/screenprint"}]},{"id":12297897,"name":"Flock I","permalink":"flock-i","position":3,"price":95.0,"default_price":95.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/flock-i","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-10T22:50:37.000Z","description":"Limited edition screenprint\r\nSomerset satin paper, 310gsm \r\nSize, 510mm x 370mm \r\nDeckle edge \r\nHand signed and numbered by the artist \r\nEdition of 50\r\n\r\nThis screenprint is taken from a series of works called Flock. Murphy’s paintings of birds are an ongoing series. At times the pieces reference the illustrations used to catagorise species as carried out by scientific expeditions in the mid to late 1800s. This large collection also echos the Victorian natural history collections of species found within museums around the world, but unlike these collections Murphys birds are common UK species. The piece intends to create a false collection, that doesn't function as a guide to detailed catagorisation.\r\n\r\nFor more information visit <a href=\"http://www.patrickmurphystudio.co.uk/index.php?/works/faster/#.Ud30dzuHx80 target=\"_blank\" title=\"Patrick Murphy Studio Shop\">visit Patrick Murphy website</a>","options":[{"id":39042222,"name":"Unframed","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121128045/-/flock1.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121128045/-/flock1.png","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5738652,"name":"Screenprint","permalink":"screenprint","url":"/category/screenprint"}]},{"id":12297867,"name":"Chevron I","permalink":"chevron-i","position":4,"price":95.0,"default_price":95.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/chevron-i","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-07-10T22:48:45.000Z","description":"Limited edition screenprint\r\nSomerset satin paper, 310gsm \r\nSize, 510mm x 370mm  \r\nDeckle edge \r\nHand signed and numbered by the artist \r\nEdition of 50\r\n\r\nThis ‘Chevron I’ screenprint is taken from a series of paintings and large scale animated projections using the familiar compositional structure of the geometric chevron. The work references both historical and contemporary visual culture: the chevron design was used widely in heraldry; today it is used as a symbol on vehicles such as fire engines and motorway breakdown vans, and as a \r\nbadge or insignia for military and police uniforms. In the later 20th century the chevron design achieved wider usage in contemporary visual culture with its associations with the interior designs of the Hacienda nightclub and appropriation into dance music graphics.\r\n\r\nFor more information visit <a href=\"http://www.patrickmurphystudio.co.uk/index.php?/works/diagonals/#.Ud3nQTuHx80 target=\"_blank\" title=\"Patrick Murphy Studio Shop\">visit Patrick Murphy website</a>","options":[{"id":39003957,"name":"Framed","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121127970/-/Chevron.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121127970/-/Chevron.png","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5738652,"name":"Screenprint","permalink":"screenprint","url":"/category/screenprint"}]}]
