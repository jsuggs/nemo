It was voiced by critically acclaimed Audio Engineer and thinksound CEO, Aaron Fournier, and designed in collaboration with Grammy winning musicians and producers. The result is a headphone that Stephen Mejias of Stereophile Magazine calls \"immediately engaging, with fine resolution of detail, easy highs, clear mids, and a bold, robust bass.\" The ms01boasts advanced studio acoustics and a full range sound that delivers exactly what pros and discerning listeners demand.\r\n \r\nThe ms01 has ultra-lightweight design and reduced speaker diameter for better ergonomics, and passive noise cancellation to minimize ambient sounds. It also features tangle resistant PVC-Free cables, and a hand crafted, sustainable, wood housing for more accurate sound reproduction. Each pair comes with a cotton carrying pouch, Active Lifestyle Ear Hooks, and four sets of ear fittings to ensure a perfect fit. As with all thinksound products, the ms01 in-ear monitors come with a one (1) year warranty.\r\n\r\n<b>Specifications:</b>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Wooden housing for crisp, accurate music reproduction</li>\r\n<li>Advanced studio acoustics and a full range sound</li>\r\n<li>Frequency Response:  18 Hz – 20 kHz</li>\r\n<li>Sensitivity:  96 ±3 dB @ 1KHz 1mW</li>\r\n<li>Impedance: 16 ohms</li>\r\n<li>Plug: 3.5mm gold plated stereo plug for increased sound clarity</li>\r\n<li>Driver Size: Acoustically enhanced 8mm driver</li>\r\n<li>Color: Gunmetal Chocolate</li>\r\n<li>Weight (Approximate): 10g Ultra-lightweight design</li>\r\n<li>Kevlar-reinforced, tangle-resistant 4 foot long cable</li>\r\n<li>Passive Noise Isolation minimizes ambient sounds</li>\r\n<li>Sweat-resistant design, perfect for the gym</li>\r\n<li>One (1) year limited warranty</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Accessories:</b>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ear Fittings: Four sized flexible silicon ear inserts for secure fit (s/m/l/xl)</li>\r\n<li>Cord Clip</li>\r\n<li>Cotton Carrying Pouch</li>\r\n<li>Active Lifestyle Ear Hooks keep headphones in place and eliminates cord noise</li>\r\n</ul>","options":[{"id":16420243,"name":"Default","price":99.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":35.0},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":185,"name":"Puerto Rico","code":"PR"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49651885/-/ms01_choc_03.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49651885/-/ms01_choc_03.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49651893/-/ms01_choc_01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49651893/-/ms01_choc_01.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49651901/-/ms01_choc_04.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49651901/-/ms01_choc_04.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49651933/-/ms01_choc_05.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49651933/-/ms01_choc_05.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49651955/-/ms01_choc_02.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49651955/-/ms01_choc_02.jpg","width":800,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":615541,"name":"in-ear headphones","permalink":"in-ear-headphones","url":"/category/in-ear-headphones"}]},{"id":3217357,"name":"ts02 : black chocolate <br>suggested $99.99","permalink":"ts02-black-chocolate","position":3,"price":79.99,"default_price":79.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ts02-black-chocolate","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-02-01T07:51:21.000Z","description":"<a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/156772/2010/12/thinksound_ts02_mic.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://www.thinksound.com/images/macworld_rating.gif\" alt=\"macworld 4/5 mice\"></a>\r\n\r\n <a href=\"http://www.rwlabs.com/article.php?cat&id=375&pagenumber=1\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://www.thinksound.com/images/real-world-labs-editors-choice.jpg\" alt=\"Real World Labs Editors Choice Award\" width=\"144\" height=\"60\"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.avhub.com.au/index.php/Features/Sound+Image/soundimage-awards-2012.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://www.thinksound.com/images/soundimage.gif\" alt=\"Sound + Image 2012 Highly Commended\" width=\"135\" height=\"60\"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.avhub.com.au/index.php/Features/Sound+Image/soundimage-awards-2013.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://www.thinksound.com/images/soundimage2013prodpg.gif\" alt=\"Sound + Image 2013 Highly Commended\" width=\"135\" height=\"60\"></a>\r\n\r\n<b>“Audio enthusiasts should find these ear buds sound great with most, if not all music genres; imaging and a warm midrange really make the ts02 stand out.” <em>– Digital Trends</em></b>\r\n\r\nthinksound™ ts02 headphones flaunt a small 8mm speaker diameter and reduced housing size to provide better ergonomics, upgraded acoustics, and a wider sound-stage.
