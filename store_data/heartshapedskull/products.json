Rikki said Screw On Head was coming on right now, but I don’t see it. I think he is on acid.\r\n\r\nJhnen V: rikki is generally drunk.\r\n\r\nJhnen V: on ham.\r\n\r\nJhnen V: christmas hams from several seasons back.\r\n\r\nAaron A.: It’s sick, isn’t it. Ham drunks.\r\n\r\nAaron A.: He just tears the top off and guzzles the liquefied innards.\r\n\r\nJhnen V: he ages them in barrels he buries under his yard.\r\n\r\nJhnen V: then, when it rains, he burrows, naked, into the mud and brings up his rotting booty.\r\n\r\nAaron A.: Giggling the whole time. Full of pig-glee.\r\n\r\nJhnen V: it’s a horrifying scene to anyone who happens upon it.\r\n\r\nAaron A.: He likes when his own bodily juices mix with the ham.\r\n\r\nJhnen V: So he’s in there, twisting and writhing while just letting everything go into the mix…sweat, blood, piss and shit.\r\n\r\nJhnen V: stirring it up with his contortions.\r\n\r\nAaron A.: His juices age it ten years all at once. It’s important to age it like a fine wine.\r\n\r\nJhnen V: when the feeding is done, he just curls up there, the mud covering him, and drying as the day comes. He goes into a sort of torpor until the next ham season.\r\n\r\nJhnen V: sometimes, he is found by miners who break open rocks, only to find a still-living rikki in there, ravenous and screaming.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.questionsleep.com/mindspill/?p=1101\">And it goes on...</a></i>\r\n\r\nIllustration by Aaron Alexovich, color by Rikki Simons, Ham-beast. \r\n\r\nSigned by the artists.","options":[{"id":12543558,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36492236/-/BIGCARTEL_PRINT_HAMCHAMBER.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36492236/-/BIGCARTEL_PRINT_HAMCHAMBER.jpg","width":684,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2093540,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":3746382,"name":"\"SERA n' TESS\" signed print","permalink":"sera-n-tess-signed-print-13x19","position":19,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sera-n-tess-signed-print-13x19","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-05-13T10:58:13.000Z","description":"Fine art print.\r\n\r\nSigned by the artist.\r\n\r\nAvailable in two screamy sizes:\r\n\r\n13 x 19\" print on heavyweight semi-gloss photo paper - $18.00\r\n\r\n8.5 x 11\" print on heavyweight semi-gloss photo paper - $9.00\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://heartshapedskull.bigcartel.com/contact\">Custom sizes by request.</a>","options":[{"id":12543420,"name":"13x19\"","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12543422,"name":"8.5x11\"","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36491636/-/BIGCARTEL_PRINT_SERA-n-TESS.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36491636/-/BIGCARTEL_PRINT_SERA-n-TESS.jpg","width":684,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2093540,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":3746168,"name":"KIMMIE66 signed paperback","permalink":"kimmie66-signed-paperback","position":20,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kimmie66-signed-paperback","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-05-13T09:22:56.000Z","description":"Signed paperback.\r\n\r\nBlack & White |  176 pages.\r\n\r\n<i>\"Neuromancer for the Hello Kitty set!\"</i>\r\n\r\nSwirly-haired Telly and her ghostly pal Kimmie haunt the VR online “lairs” of the 23rd century.
