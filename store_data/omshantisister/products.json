Native American Indians used white sage for its cleansing properties and it is normally found wrapped for smudge sticks. It has a very powerful smell.\r\nLavender - from a friends garden. Calming and relaxing, used in many therapeutic items.\r\nMaiden hair- from my garden. I chose to use Maiden Hair vines to wrap the blessings to impart feminity, elegance, fragility and strength.\r\nSandalwood- from a camping trip to The Bluff, WA, Australia. Sandalwood has a very earthy aroma, balancing the other smells and imparting masculine strength, warmth and stillness.\r\nCopper- Each piece is secured with copper wire to enhance conductivity of the other energies.\r\nComes in a set of three.\r\nEach blessing can be burnt in cleansing rituals, kept in ur purse as a mindful smell item, or kept by your side when sleeping or traveling.","options":[{"id":48880695,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128107116/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128107116/-/image.jpg","width":598,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6696108,"name":"From the heavens","permalink":"from-the-heavens","url":"/category/from-the-heavens"},{"id":6696111,"name":"From the earth","permalink":"from-the-earth","url":"/category/from-the-earth"},{"id":6696114,"name":"Handmade by Elizar","permalink":"handmade-by-elizar","url":"/category/handmade-by-elizar"}]},{"id":15054231,"name":"Sweet purse","permalink":"sweet-purse","position":2,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sweet-purse","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-23T20:19:24.000Z","description":"Gorgeous hand embellished purse.\r\nUse for carrying your tumblestones, coins, lipgloss or as a package for a pair of our Mermaid earrings.

The plant must have a female and male species located next to each other to bear fruit, which is eaten away by ants to reveal the seed and a small hole. The hole is then drilled through in traditional way, signifying man and nature working together in harmony.\r\nTribally worn, strands of these are used as protection from evil spirits.\r\nI have combined these \"ghost berries\" with small copper beads, using the conductive nature of copper to amplify the goodness, balance and harmonious wish to both the wearer and those close enough to see them.
