Melissa says, “I believe in the permanence of the piece, and one of my greatest inspirations is in knowing that people will treasure their jewelry, hopefully for generations. My jewelry is not an accessory, but an expression. My pieces aren’t about buying into what mass media tells you you should be, but about finding a piece that speaks to the individuals and echoes their personality. I believe that jewelry can influence the way you feel; it can say and mean something different to every wearer.”","options":[{"id":50433987,"name":"Default","price":195.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129257424/-/Herkimer-diamond-_195-Unknown-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129257424/-/Herkimer-diamond-_195-Unknown-2.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129257421/-/Herkimer-diamond-_195-Unknown-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129257421/-/Herkimer-diamond-_195-Unknown-1.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129257430/-/Herkimer-diamond-_195-Unknown-3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129257430/-/Herkimer-diamond-_195-Unknown-3.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1173321,"name":"Earrings","permalink":"earrings","url":"/category/earrings"}]},{"id":15506847,"name":"Mystic Quartz with Kyanite Drop Necklace by Tracy Mallon","permalink":"mystic-quartz-necklace","position":35,"price":128.0,"default_price":128.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mystic-quartz-necklace","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-12T03:37:53.000Z","description":"Clusters of mystic quartz and pyrite adorn the oxidized sterling silver chain of this contemporary necklace with its wondrous kyanite drop.  18\" long. \r\n\r\nStarting out at Parsons School of Design in New York, Tracy Mallon was well received in the fashion industry.

The strands meet at an ornamental gold platted finding. This necklace is 23 inches long. \r\n\r\nBahgsu Jewels was created in 2007 as a way to express the inspiration Maggie Orli receives  from traveling and her passion to produce wearable art. Her idea is to design jewels that have a deeper meaning and are symbols of the beauty and wisdom of Mother Nature. All pieces are one of a kind, sourced with awareness and handmade. The crystals are not only powerful and beautiful but have been spawned over millions of years beneath the ground we walk on.  Also, gurus from the East suggest stones hold ancient truths that enlighten those who wear them.
