Memorable, entertaining, intricate and compelling...get your head out of whatever you’re rotting by and check out this band!”\r\n-Kevin Stewart-Panko, Decibel Magazine (Nov 2012, Issue 97)\r\n\r\n“4/5! If you haven't given this hard-hitting ensemble a chance yet, your time would be well spent getting acquainted with them. ...Dead Empires is an instrumental endeavor, fluctuating between sledgehammer riffs and moments of light repose.  One minute, an energetic groove grabs you by the collar, banging your head back and forth vigorously, and the next you're smoothly reclined into a comfortable jazzy interlude. ...Waiting In Waves is a fantastic first full length by a band who is striving to earn an audience.”\r\n-Barry Adkins, Better B# Music Blog (http://betterbsharp.weebly.com)\r\n\r\n\"4/5! Waiting in Waves shows a confidence in song-writing that makes it seem like the band perfected their sound two or three albums ago, with a creativity that indicates they’ll be keeping it up for many more.\" \r\n-Sputnikmusic.com\r\n\r\n“Waiting in Waves revolves around an axis of rhythmic excellence; the drums and bass mesmerize as they cheerfully beat you to the ground. The multifarious influences at play in the guitar work are well synthesized; the album has a pleasingly uniform and complete vision. When the cards are on the table, riffs always win, and that’s where Dead Empires shine. ...Please pour me another.” -Atanamar Sunyata, metalbandcamp.com\r\n\r\n“A+!
