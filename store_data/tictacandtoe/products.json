This pattern is easy to follow and is suitable for the beginner sewer. \r\n\r\nFABRIC CHOICE:\r\nI have sewed Tiggy using wool suiting. For her chic little dress I have used fabric from Jenean Morrison’s California Dreamin’ collection. However, this little feline friend can be made from any fabric scraps that you have on hand including light weight corduroy, denim and linen. Safety eyes or buttons may be used instead of embroidered eyes, but make sure your fabric and embellishments are baby safe if Tiggy is for a younger child.\r\n\r\nFINISHED DIMENSIONS:\r\nTiggy measures 20” (50 cm) in length and 13½” (34 cm) wide with arms outstretched.approximately\r\n\r\nPATTERN FEATURES:\r\n*Easy-to-follow instructions in English\r\n*Color photographs illustrating each step\r\n*Full-size pattern pieces \r\n\r\nPlease check Tictac & Toe's store policy section for further information on copyright and shipping.\r\n\r\nThank you and happy sewing!\r\n","options":[{"id":9177891,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/24943152/-/etsy_photo_5.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/24943152/-/etsy_photo_5.JPG","width":997,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1551934,"name":"Patterns","permalink":"patterns","url":"/category/patterns"}]}]
