Exfoliation helps to expose newer skin cells and helps to unclog pores, allowing sebum to flow and keep skin moisturized. Exfoliation also increases blood flow to the surface of the skin so toxins can be more readily removed and exfoliation can help improve the tone, texture and evenness of skin color.\r\n\r\nOur Blood Orange & Rose scrub smells like Sweet like candied flowers and marmalade.

I always thought they were so cool and \"grown up\" compared to the brightly colored kid lip balms I usually carried around. The tins made me feel so sophisticated and my friends would always ooh and ahh when I brought one out! And, having empty mini tins to store mini things in made me feel very organized (even though I never was and still am not!) I was a weird kid...\r\n\r\nOur tin slider lip balms come in six Flavors and are lightly tinted with color. They do not contain a sweetener, also very adult, and they can be used not only on your lips but, to help keep fly-aways at bay, as cuticle butter (at least the ones without too much color), or maybe even an eyebrow tamer? I'll leave it up to you! ;)\r\n\r\nOur lip balms contain a whole mess of good stuff including Mango butter and Olive Oil - two super moisturizers that also give the balm a smooth creamy texture! The wonderful blend of moisturizing oils and butters will leave your lips feeling happy! It is light and absorbs quickly in to your skin so no yucky greasy feeling!\r\n\r\nChoose from:\r\nBanana's Foster: Banana Liqueur and Vanilla Ice Cream with hints of Burnt sugar and Rum!\r\nBrown Sugar: Brown sugar and butter flavor!\r\nCoconut Lemongrass: Exotic and Fresh!

Exfoliation helps to expose newer skin cells and helps to unclog pores, allowing sebum to flow and keep skin moisturized. Exfoliation also increases blood flow to the surface of the skin so toxins can be more readily removed and exfoliation can help improve the tone, texture and evenness of skin color.\r\n\r\nOur Lemon Gingergrass scrub smells like Lemon Ginger Frosting and is made with Organic Shea Butter.

When we exfoliate we help remove dead skin cells from the outermost layer of our skin, the epidermis, which the keeps skin clean, and helps reduce dry flaky skin. Exfoliation helps to expose newer skin cells and helps to unclog pores, allowing sebum to flow and keep skin moisturized. Exfoliation also increases blood flow to the surface of the skin so toxins can be more readily removed and exfoliation can help improve the tone, texture and evenness of skin color.\r\n\r\nOur Key Lime and Grapefruit scrub smells like fresh squeezed Key Limes and Pink Grapefruit and is made with Organic Shea Butter.
