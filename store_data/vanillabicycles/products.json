In collaboration with ENVE, we’ve designed and built a carbon stem with integrated front brake routing that replaces the hanger and the associated flex, weight, chatter and unsightly lines that come with it. \r\n\r\nWe’ve been running this stem on our team bikes for years now and our experience is that it essentially eliminates front-end chatter while braking. The additional rider benefits that come with smoother cable routing, lighter braking action and 51g weight savings are in keeping with the Speedvagen mantra: “Take away everything that isn’t essential and refine what’s left.” \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n●\tEliminates the weight of the cable hanger and 8” of additional housing for a combined weight savings of 51g\r\n●\tSignificantly decreases cable flex and in turn adds power to braking\r\n●\tOffers the lowest possible stack height for shorter riders\r\n●\tThe more direct braking line means less cable/housing friction \r\n●\tHelps calm brake chatter\r\n●\tThe gradual radius of the stainless internal routing offers less cable friction and lighter braking action\r\n\r\nSpecs:\r\nTitanium hardware, cold forged alloy faceplate, molded-in threads and stainless internal routing. \r\n•\tWeight: 133g (110mm)\r\n•\tLength: 90, 100, 110, 120mm\r\n•\tRise: -6º\r\n•\tClamp: 31.8\r\n•\tStack: 41mm","options":[{"id":28514093,"name":"Black/Gold 90mm","price":350.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28514096,"name":"Black/Gold 100mm","price":350.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28514099,"name":"Black/Gold 110mm","price":350.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28514102,"name":"Black/Gold 120mm","price":350.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28514105,"name":"White/Gold 90mm","price":350.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28514108,"name":"White/Gold 100mm","price":350.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28514111,"name":"White/Gold 110mm","price":350.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28514114,"name":"White/Gold 120mm","price":350.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40722888,"name":"Matte/Gloss Black 90mm","price":350.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40722891,"name":"Matte/Gloss Black 100mm","price":350.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40722897,"name":" Matte/Gloss Black 110mm","price":350.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40722894,"name":"Matte/Gloss Black 120mm","price":350.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":12.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":17.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90499334/-/Speedvagen_Black_Stem_0057.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90499334/-/Speedvagen_Black_Stem_0057.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90507998/-/Speedvagen_White_Stem_0040.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90507998/-/Speedvagen_White_Stem_0040.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122314563/-/Prolly_Stem.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122314563/-/Prolly_Stem.jpg","width":1280,"height":854}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":295050,"name":"Speedvagen","permalink":"speedvagen","url":"/category/speedvagen"},{"id":4472336,"name":"Stems","permalink":"stems","url":"/category/stems"}]},{"id":9654803,"name":"Speedvagen Team Cap","permalink":"speedvagen-team-cap","position":13,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/speedvagen-team-cap","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-02-27T19:25:29.000Z","description":"Our new Speedvagen team cap is a good fit.
