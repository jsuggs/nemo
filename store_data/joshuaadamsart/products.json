Growing up in the bible belt, I frequently found myself in church and heavily exposed to the Christian faith. A large part of my adolescence was spent rebelling against the church with sincere negativity. Realizing that directing my negativity towards the faith and teachings of Jesus were illogical. In fact, if the people of the past had been true students of faith, the atrocities and genocide of the past would have never transpired. The true lessons I took away from history and expressed in this piece, are to be wary of the nature of man and decipher any spiritual guidance individually within one's own heart.\r\n\r\nWood: Butternut\r\nSize: 12.5x7.5\r\n         ","options":[{"id":43681821,"name":"Default","price":2500.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124444932/-/IMG_0057.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124444932/-/IMG_0057.jpg","width":2563,"height":3844},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124444971/-/IMG_0198.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124444971/-/IMG_0198.jpg","width":2848,"height":4272},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124444992/-/IMG_0097.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124444992/-/IMG_0097.jpg","width":2848,"height":4272}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4115544,"name":"MASK COLLECTION","permalink":"mask-collection","url":"/category/mask-collection"}]},{"id":11607075,"name":"Booger of Rebellion","permalink":"booger-of-rebellion","position":4,"price":9000.0,"default_price":9000.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/booger-of-rebellion","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-06T01:10:12.000Z","description":"A pledge of $5000.00 wil be donated to the Cherokee High School Art program and will sponsor the annual art show.

It was the manifestation of a vision that has been in my mind for as long as I can remember. The search for love, truth and knowledge, is without a doubt, the most important experiences that we humans can hope to pursue. It takes courage to walk these paths. Stated more elegantly here by the \"Grand Pappy McKenna\": \r\n\r\n“Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under, it will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering its a feather bed.” \r\n\r\n\r\n― Terence McKenna\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  Great Serpent mythology has to be one of the most interesting subjects in human history.
