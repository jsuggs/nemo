So we hand painted our own pretty gals who could act as spokesmodels for the tree and the entire holiday. Inspired by Golden Age Hollywood starlets, we were imagining their head shots and the classic star upon the dressing room door. And we gave them each some festive glitter adornments in the highlights of their hair. Each little gal is named and you've got three hair colors to choose from so be sure to check through the shop for other options. Very limited edition...but we'll be adding more versions in the following days so be sure to check back. \r\nOrnaments are paper mache and measure 4 inches wide by 3/8 of an inch thick.

Well we just so happened to already have one in the works…and here it is! We made it slightly larger so that it really stands out! It measures 6 ½ inches tall and with the fine dusting of clear glitter it simply looks magical.\r\nVintage bottlebrush trees can be found in just about every room of our home…all year round! They are one of our favorite collectibles and they always succeed in bringing some festive magic to our surroundings. \r\nA high quality print of our original painting mounted on study mat board that we back with some vintagey sheet music.

In all honesty, we designed these with ourselves in mind. We decorate with cupcakes year round, but we found a very noticeable absence of cupcakes when it came to our Christmas tree. So we made these on the double, and now we're thrilled to share them with all of you. They're made of sturdy mat board that we hand cut, and then sand the edges smooth. Each is backed with vintage recipe book clippings with corresponding cupcake recipes to match each cupcake! And of course...for some added holiday magic we've given them a fine dusting of Glitter! They hang by a loop of classic bakers twine. \r\nAnd don't limit these cuties to the Christmas tree...these are fab additions to tie onto a gift for the cupcake lover in your life. Or display them year round on cabinet knobs, drawer pulls, or even hang them from a chandelier.  \r\nSet of four, glittered, signed & dated, sealed for protection.

When painting Apple Pie our first artistic choice was to go VINTAGE...because it's just an American classic...it's Holidays and it's Grandma's house. So right away we painted a background of the ultimate vintage wallpaper in our favorite color scheme of tan, cream, pink, aqua...and of course, we had to go \"a la mode!\" If you look closely you can see the vanilla beans in the ice cream.

Keep this binder as your own personal recipe book or even as a sweets themed scrapbook for family memories.\r\nThe kit includes chipboard covers, mat board pages, binder rings, tons of our original artwork, ribbons, and glitter. All you’ll need is scissors, a couple paint brushes, some decoupage medium such as mod podge, and a standard hole punch. This kit is tried and true and our students absolutely loved it.

That's our starting point...a highly textured, super antiquey collage...the photos do not do our gals justice. The collage backdrop really has a great vintagey feel. And then we paint our gals with sleek black lines...using color only for their lipstick! We have two color versions of our Gorgeous Gals...Pink or Blue.
