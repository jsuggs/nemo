Five sparkling theme songs amble in sequence like a hand-cranked animated scroll, the protagonists boy shadows. \"Born Again\" warbles beneath the waves of a cramped coastal fairyland; \"Lucky Me\" is the boardwalk funhouse wriggling with ghosts. Part two's \"My House\" sounds as if the lamps and pots of your cottage are being tunefully tapped with a coffee table leg, and someone in the kitchen is sweetly bowing at the cookie sheet. \"Under Beach\" is the soft but thrilling chin-peck of un-certain doom, and \"Wishwell\" is the preemptive dirge. The far-from-home shivers constantly rattle and burble in the septics of the young men that helm this story, their naive bindle staffs boasting only ham sandwiches, an envelope of sour belts, and a tin of Vicks to remember mother by. In the wet, outstretched palm of every leering crone waits a suspect bonbon; nearby huddles a grizzled cast of wingnuts whose psychosis yawns 10 feet wide.

Floating bodies of restrained guitar and ethereal vocal chants summon Apsaras bearing cups of psychedelic nectar.\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful new recordings, the follow-up to their VT Tip LP, from the heavenly duo of Pat Murano (Decimus/NNCK et al) and Carla Baker: this one sounds even hazier than the LP and is the perfect soundtrack to drizzly fall afternoons, with Baker sighing her way through luminous zones of comedown psych guitar and slow sunsets of organ tone. Still an ethereal Japanese psych edge to what these two do (orbiting the more spectral Shizuka/Suishou No Fune end of the scale) but with a classic lost-in-time Bruno Nicolai Euro soundtrack atmosphere along with shades of mid-period Loren Mazzacane Connors.
