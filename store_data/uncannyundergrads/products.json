Its the story of a Professor who always wanted to be somebody and finally has his chance to when he secretly gathers four super powered college freshman at his school using a campus club as a cover. However, this has not gone unnoticed by the infamous Second Third Reich, a cultist nazi influenced crime syndicate that's obsessed with ancient prophecies who want to use those with super human abilities for their own means.\r\n\r\nThis is a story that goes into finding ones personal identity, living in a world where others that don't understand you try to manipulate your fate whether they have good intentions or not, and how to overcome that and come into your own. I think its a good story with a positive message with a lot of action and fun along the way. Its something I'm very passionate about, and with the help of illustrator Bob Wulff (the real hero here), I finally have a chance to see it drawn out.","options":[{"id":14425521,"name":"Default","price":1.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/42980649/-/Final_Revision_WEB.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/42980649/-/Final_Revision_WEB.jpg","width":667,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2424587,"name":"Digital Comic","permalink":"digital-comic","url":"/category/digital-comic"}]}]
