For Nikhil it is the duty of the artists in society to see beyond influences that seek to control the evolution of social consciousness, to subtly and accessibly point ahead a few steps with a perspective that provides inspiration and hope. His recent work is a striking illustration of surrender and reverence to levels of human consciousness that are said to connect us all as one human family. It is with this sentiment that Nikhil’s work has recently found its place in the shifting tides of Icelandic society. www.nikhilkirsh.com\r\nwww.stickerhappy.co.uk supports and publicises artists and galleries by selling high-quality, limited-edition stickers of their work.
