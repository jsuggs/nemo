They have taken up residence in these mini silicone cake cases, and have a very important message - \"Keep Calm and Have a Cupcake\"! These would make a perfect Mother's Day or birthday gift, or just as a treat for you.\r\n\r\nThe Cupcake Mice are made from polymer clay with black onyx eyes. They are holding a placard which is made from laminated gloss paper mounted on a shaped wooden stick. The total height of the mouse is about 6cm (2.4 inches) to the top of the placard. \r\n\r\nThe silicone cake case is food grade and can be used and re-used to make real cupcakes, and the mouse will perch quite happily on top of the cupcake (although he might have a nibble!) It can be used safely in the oven, fridge, freezer and dishwasher, and is 2.2cm (0.9 inches) tall.\r\n\r\nEach Cupcake Mouse is signed with an artist's mark - a slice of my unique 'QC' monogram cane. They come in a smart presentation box with a signed certificate and will be sent safely by first class post within the UK. For international orders, they will be sent by airmail post, and a tracked and insured service is available for an extra charge.\r\n\r\nBecause each Cupcake Mouse is a made entirely by hand, each one is a little different.\r\n\r\nThe Cupcake Mice are available in white or tan - let me know when ordering which colour of mouse you'd like (there's a place to add a comment in Paypal when going through the check out process, or you can email me at kirsten@quernuscrafts.co.uk). \r\n","options":[{"id":30081005,"name":"Red (tan mouse)","price":15.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30081007,"name":"Orange (tan mouse)","price":15.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30081009,"name":"Yellow (tan mouse)","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30081011,"name":"Lime Green (tan mouse)","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30081025,"name":"Bright Green (tan mouse)","price":15.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30081013,"name":"Pale Blue (white mouse)","price":15.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30081015,"name":"Bright Blue (white mouse","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30081017,"name":"Purple (white mouse)","price":15.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30081019,"name":"Bright Pink (white mouse)","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30081021,"name":"Pale Pink (white mouse)","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":30081023,"name":"Black (white mouse)","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94478007/-/Little_Cupcake_Mice__1_.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94478007/-/Little_Cupcake_Mice__1_.JPG","width":1000,"height":860},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94478047/-/Little_Cupcake_Mice__5_.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94478047/-/Little_Cupcake_Mice__5_.JPG","width":1000,"height":652},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94478295/-/Little_Cupcake_Mice__4_.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94478295/-/Little_Cupcake_Mice__4_.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94478823/-/Black_Cupcake_Mouse__2_.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94478823/-/Black_Cupcake_Mouse__2_.JPG","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94483741/-/Cupcake_colours__2_.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94483741/-/Cupcake_colours__2_.JPG","width":1000,"height":804}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3286967,"name":"Birthdays & Celebrations","permalink":"birthdays-celebrations","url":"/category/birthdays-celebrations"},{"id":3441561,"name":"Unusual Gifts","permalink":"unusual-gifts","url":"/category/unusual-gifts"},{"id":3037105,"name":"Mice","permalink":"mice","url":"/category/mice"},{"id":3288565,"name":"Rainbows","permalink":"rainbows","url":"/category/rainbows"},{"id":3287027,"name":"Mother's Day","permalink":"mother-s-day","url":"/category/mother-s-day"}]},{"id":15593097,"name":"Two Cheeky Chimps","permalink":"two-cheeky-chimps","position":3,"price":45.0,"default_price":45.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/two-cheeky-chimps","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-16T17:04:59.000Z","description":"\"So what exactly are you doing?\" says the chimp on the left. \"Wmphf lphmm ghwwmph\" says the chimp on the right, his mouth too full of toes to answer clearly.\r\n\r\nTwo Cheeky Chimps is a one off sculpture and one of the latest wee creature designs from Quernus Crafts.

The snowflakes are also a little different, as snowflakes often are.\r\n\r\nChristmas Mole comes safely packaged in a sturdy presentation box with a signed certificate, and will be sent safely by first class post within the UK, and by airmail post for international orders.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":49751217,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128745429/-/Snowflake_Mole_(1).JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128745429/-/Snowflake_Mole_(1).JPG","width":2560,"height":1920},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128745474/-/Snowflake_Mole_(2).JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128745474/-/Snowflake_Mole_(2).JPG","width":2560,"height":1920},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128745528/-/Snowflake_Mole_(3).JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128745528/-/Snowflake_Mole_(3).JPG","width":2560,"height":1920},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128745588/-/Mistletoe_Mole_(4).JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128745588/-/Mistletoe_Mole_(4).JPG","width":2560,"height":1920}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4543277,"name":"Christmas","permalink":"christmas","url":"/category/christmas"},{"id":3441561,"name":"Unusual Gifts","permalink":"unusual-gifts","url":"/category/unusual-gifts"},{"id":3037141,"name":"Moles","permalink":"moles","url":"/category/moles"}]},{"id":15295515,"name":"Little Mouse with Pencil Notebook","permalink":"little-mouse-with-pencil-notebook","position":64,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/little-mouse-with-pencil-notebook","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-03T11:37:27.000Z","description":"Another new design for 2013, this notebook has a printed cover of an original Quernus design - a little mouse with glasses holding a blue pencil.\r\n\r\nThe notebook is A7 size (approximately 72 x 105mm), and has 35 plain sheets - better for making notes than keeping a real mouse in your pocket!\r\n\r\nFor other available notebooks, click <a href=\"http://www.quernuscraftsshop.co.uk/category/bookmarks-cards-notebooks-prints\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.","options":[{"id":49726722,"name":"Default","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128727486/-/IMGP1191.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128727486/-/IMGP1191.JPG","width":1880,"height":2355},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128727504/-/IMGP1190.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128727504/-/IMGP1190.JPG","width":2470,"height":1803},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128727522/-/IMGP1174.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128727522/-/IMGP1174.JPG","width":2296,"height":1920},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128727546/-/IMGP1175.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128727546/-/IMGP1175.JPG","width":2560,"height":1920}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4543277,"name":"Christmas","permalink":"christmas","url":"/category/christmas"},{"id":3037143,"name":"Bookmarks, Cards, Notebooks & Prints","permalink":"bookmarks-cards-notebooks-prints","url":"/category/bookmarks-cards-notebooks-prints"}]},{"id":15295197,"name":"I Heart Books Bookmark","permalink":"i-heart-books-bookmark","position":66,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/i-heart-books-bookmark","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-03T11:16:13.000Z","description":"New for 2013, this lovely bookmark is based on a unique sculpture I made with the mice playing around on hand-cut and painted wooden letters saying \"I [heart] Books\"!\r\n\r\nThe bookmark measures 20cm x 5.5cm and is made from 350gsm double laminated silk art card.
