Sturges has created a series of intensely powerful and moving photographs with an outstanding sensitivity for composition and light. Sturges's artistic work is an uncompromising search for truth and clarity. His private life is marked by his open nature and inspired by the love he shares with his wife Maia.\r\n\r\nIn LINE OF BEAUTY AND GRACE, the filmmaker and photographer Christian E.
