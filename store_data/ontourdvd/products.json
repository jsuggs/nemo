All that Jus can do is constantly replay the memory of his brother’s gruesome murder over and over in his head. Having established himself as a rising hip-hop artist and the owner of an emerging entertainment group, “Just InCase Entertainment.” Jus is beginning to lose focus from his once-promising career. Chanel, Jus’s stunning girlfriend and talented artist in her own right, does all that she can to support him, offering new talent to his entertainment group and encouraging him to get back on the mic. Jus, haunted by the memories of Shawn’s death and the mystery surrounding who might have killed him prove to be much too strong and hold him back. Detectives Willis and Roberts question Jus, suspecting his direct involvement in his brother’s death. Music mogul Matt Longdale, owner of Longevity Music Group, becomes even more of a factor acting as a mentor, helping Jus think through his choices and decisions about Shawn’s murder influencing the future of his career.\r\n      ","options":[{"id":32590645,"name":"Default","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127644399/-/W.O.R.D.(poster).jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127644399/-/W.O.R.D.(poster).jpg","width":1661,"height":2478}],"artists":[{"id":191905,"name":"Vincent Stewart","permalink":"vincent-stewart","url":"/artist/vincent-stewart"}],"categories":[{"id":3174767,"name":"Digital Download","permalink":"digital-download","url":"/category/digital-download"},{"id":3174931,"name":"Book","permalink":"book","url":"/category/book"}]},{"id":10772115,"name":"The W.O.R.D.
