PURITY is made out of a soft, crinkly, sheer, light and airy fabric that best resembles a mix between cheesecloth and gauze. The purely white wrap is more sheer and light than the natural cream.\r\n\r\nThe wrap is designed to create beautiful wrapping images of newborn babies.  Wrap around the baby in various ways to create stunning images for your clients!\r\n\r\n\r\n* Easy to use, just wrap and tuck\r\n* machine wash & dryer encouraged\r\n* wraps measures approx 10\"x45\"\r\n\r\nThe more you wash, the more it crinkles.  So if you don't want it to crinkle too much, then hand wash and lay flat.  I love how it crinkles, so I throw it in the wash and dryer.  \r\n\r\nWhen you first open your wrap, it may appear smaller than it is due to the crinkle.  Just pull it out and wrap around the baby.  It's easy to just wrap from head to bum, then tuck any excess right under the baby.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll wraps in store are ready to ship and are shipped USPS First Class Mail.
