Made entirely from sterling silver, but suprisingly light. The points of each pentagon are slightly rounded for comfort. The bangle pictured has a silver finish on the outside, and an oxidised (blackened) finish on the inside.\r\n\r\nThis item is made to order. Please allow up to 3 weeks prior to postage. I order the silver in specially, which adds to the time I take to make it. The price reflects the cost of silver and the hours spent making.\r\n\r\nOPTIONS:\r\nThe bangle is sold with a standard inner diameter of approx 20cm, but can be made to any size. Let me know your size when placing your order. Measure your bangle size by running a dressmakers tape around the inside of a circular bangle that fits you well, making sure that it can slip over your hand. The bangle looks quite chunky when worn, so suits a bigger wrist.\r\n\r\nThe bangle is sold with a silver finish outside/oxidised finish inside.
