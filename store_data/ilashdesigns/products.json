Email or hard copy via snail mail notification includes gift certificate amount, gift code and the sender information on a small gift card and will also include my contact information, website addresses of my additional online shops and expiration date for redemption.\r\n\r\nGift certificates can be used for shipping costs. If the order or shipping costs exceed the amount of the gift certificate, an additional paypal payment will be required to cover the total costs.\r\n\r\nYour recipient will receive the gift item, inside a mailer, wrapped in tissue paper and tied with handspun yarn perfectly ready for receiving or gift giving!

The relationship between yin and yang is often described in terms of sunlight playing over a mountain and a valley. Yin (literally the 'shady place' or 'north slope') is the dark area occluded by the mountain's bulk, while yang (literally the 'sunny place' or 'south slope') is the brightly lit portion. As the sun moves across the sky, yin and yang gradually trade places with each other, revealing what was obscured and obscuring what was revealed.\r\n\r\nYin is characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, femininity and nighttime.\r\n\r\nYang, by contrast, is fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and aggressive; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, masculinity and daytime.","options":[{"id":44538510,"name":"dk weight straight single 12 wpi, 75ish yds, US avg. size 7 plus knitting needle, size 7  crochet hook","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":44538513,"name":"worsted weight straight single 8-10 wpi, 50ish yds, US size 11 plus knitting needlesize I crochet hook  ","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44538516,"name":"worsted weight thick and thin single  8-10 wpi, 50ish yds, US size 13 plus knitting needle, size I crochet hook","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44538519,"name":"chunky weight thick and thin single, 5-6 wpi, 40ish yds, US size 17 plus knitting needle, size K crochet hook ","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44538522,"name":"bulky weight, thick and thin single- 3-4-5 wpi, 30ish yds, US size 19 plus knitting needle, size M  crochet hook","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44538525,"name":"roving 2 oz.
