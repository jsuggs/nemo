These scarves are shaped like a circle and many ways these can be worn goes \"on and on\", hence naming them the 360. Much more functional than  a traditional scarf, these stay put once wrapped. Unisex. These HANDMADE, custom scarves are the perfect accent to your winter/fall wardrobe.  The 360 style typically measures length 34-36 in, width 6.5-8 in. Available in the following SOLID/SINGLE COLORS: BLACK, WHITE, RED, HEATHER GREY, NAVY, ROYAL BLUE, TURQUOISE, HOT PINK, LIGHT PINK, PURPLE, CHOCOLATE BROWN, TAN, ARMY GREEN, MONEY GREEN, ORANGE, GOLDENROD, and MULTICOLORS: GREEN CAMOUFLAGE AND PINK CAMOUFLAGE. \r\n*SPECIAL COLOR REQUESTS PLEASE EMAIL BEFORE ORDERING.
