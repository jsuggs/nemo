The fragrance of these soaps from Palam Rural Centre is unique, derived from herbs, roots, leaves or flowers, blended to aromatic perfection. Attractively boxed, making the perfect small gift.\r\n\r\n· Hand made\r\n· 3Lx2Wx1H inches\r\n\r\nMade in India\r\n\r\nAbout the artists: Palam Rural Centre offers employment opportunities to people of the marginalized Harijan caste community in southeastern India. Harijan people were traditionally leather workers, but had little ability to market their skills in their limited environment and were forced to take low-wage agricultural jobs before the centre opened in 1978. Palam Rural Centre seeks to build a “bridge” to the markets of the rest of the world, thus helping the Harijan people to support themselves through export sales.\r\n\r\n<b>Scented Soap Production</b>\r\nIn recent years the leather trade in India has gained momentum with the influx of large multinational companies, whose latest technologies have caused highly inflated prices for raw hides. Small traditional tanneries have been squeezed from the industry. Although Palam has struggled as well, their commitment to the harijans encouraged the development of new designs for leather products. After four years of careful planning, Palam has developed vegetable oil based bath soaps as a product alternative.\r\n\r\nVegetable oils are mixed in the correct proportion for the type of soap being produced. These oils are heated to separate the impurities from the oil. This heating and straining process occurs three times. Next the oil mixture is cooled and formed as a solid block. As the oil mixture hardens insoluble impurities collect at the top and bottom of the block. Those collected at the top are called the crust and those at the bottom of the block are called nigre. The solidified portion between the crust and nigre is known as neat and serves as the base for making bath soaps. The crust and nigre are used in making laundry soap.\r\n\r\nA block of neat is dried and when the moisture content is just right the block is cut into bars and fed into a chipping machine to make soap chips. The chips are air-dried and then blended with the perfumes and dyes in an amalgamator. Then the soap is milled which further blends the soap,perfumes and dyes while also reducing the mixture to ribbons of soap. The soap ribbons are moved to the plodder, which compresses the ribbons into the desired shape. The soap is then cut into bars and weighed by hand. Each bar of soap is embossed with the word, Palam, on one side and the same word in the Tamil language on the other side. These soaps are being marketed with confidence that Palam is committed to creating employment opportunities for underemployed people in India.\r\n\r\nProduct Code: #6896260","options":[{"id":9231580,"name":"Coconut","price":4.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9231585,"name":"Jasmine","price":4.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9231586,"name":"Neem","price":4.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9231590,"name":"Cucumber","price":4.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9231591,"name":"Rose","price":4.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9231592,"name":"Mango","price":4.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":37177863,"name":"Sandalwood","price":4.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":37177866,"name":"Lavender","price":4.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":37177869,"name":"Rosemary Garden","price":4.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25110744/-/rosesoap.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25110744/-/rosesoap.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25110732/-/cocosoap.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25110732/-/cocosoap.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25110736/-/jassoap.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25110736/-/jassoap.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25110740/-/palam.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25110740/-/palam.jpg","width":230,"height":140}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1556036,"name":"Body Clothing & Accessories","permalink":"body-clothing-accessories","url":"/category/body-clothing-accessories"}]},{"id":2675146,"name":"Beecology Foaming Moisturizing Hand Soap","permalink":"5-cylinder-onyx-candleholder","position":4,"price":6.99,"default_price":6.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/5-cylinder-onyx-candleholder","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-07-28T19:56:33.000Z","description":"Beecology knows what you want in an SLS-free All-Natural Foaming Hand Soap: luxurious lather, an intoxicating scent, and gentle but effective cleansing power.

Their coffee is Fair Trade Certified by TransFairUSA, Organic Certified by the Washington State Department of Agriculture and grown in shaded conditions. Through their partnerships with Grounds for Change, coffee growers in several different countries throughout Central America have been able to institute powerful positive social change, such as preventing the use of land for growing coca and poppies,  used to make illegal drugs,  making it possible for local students to attend college for the first time in their communities, creating sexual health education programs to prevent the spread of the virus that causes cervical cancer, and helping farmers to elevate their production to the level required for fair trade certification so that they can benefit as well. \r\n\r\nGlobal Gallery is proud to carry several varieties of Grounds for Change organic, Fair Trade coffees (<b>**Note all bags are 12oz whole bean</b>):\r\n\r\n<b>Cafe Femenino Peru</b>\r\nOut of Peru comes a story of strength, unity and hope. A new niche coffee, Cafe Femenino Peru, has evolved that is changing the role of women in rural coffee communities. Female coffee growers have become better educated, organized, and for the first time are producing women's coffee as a specialty commodity. This Fair Trade and organic certified coffee is grown, processed and traded exclusively by women. The women then decide how to use the additional funds to better their lives and those of their children. \r\n\r\nCafe Femenino Peru is a medium bodied coffee with a fine acidity, sweet aroma and hints of baker's chocolate that are accentuated by a slow, dark roast. We know that you will enjoy this unique coffee for its wonderful taste as well as for the special story that underlies its production.\r\n\r\n<b>Classic Espresso Blend</b> is a combination of five coffees that are balanced to deliver a smooth, yet spicy shot that is dark, distinctive and full-bodied but not bitter or smoky. This 100% arabica blend produces a thick, rich crema and is wonderful as a straight shot or blended with foamed milk. \r\n\r\n<b>Ethiopia Yirgacheffe</b>\r\nFragrant and floral with wine and fruit overtones, the Yirgacheffe is one of the most prized East African coffees. When roasted to a medium-dark level, it has a smooth medium body and long, lingering finish.\r\n\r\nThe Oromia Cooperative that produces this coffee is featured in the award-winning documentary Black Gold. We urge all of our customers to take the time to view this excellent film. \r\n\r\nProduct Code: #gfc\r\n","options":[{"id":9207198,"name":"Cafe Femenino Peru","price":11.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9207232,"name":"Decaf Cafe Femenino Peru","price":11.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9207222,"name":"Classic Espresso Blend","price":11.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":37177299,"name":"Decaf Espresso Blend","price":11.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":37177302,"name":"Nicaragua 'Segovia'","price":11.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":37177305,"name":"Agate Pass Blend","price":11.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":37177308,"name":"Mexico 'Chiapas'","price":11.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":37177311,"name":"Cafe Femenino Mexico","price":11.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25033005/-/FemeninoPeru.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25033005/-/FemeninoPeru.jpg","width":173,"height":204},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25033121/-/Yirg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25033121/-/Yirg.jpg","width":173,"height":204},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25033125/-/ClassicEspresso.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25033125/-/ClassicEspresso.jpg","width":173,"height":204},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25033133/-/fairtrade-coffee.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25033133/-/fairtrade-coffee.gif","width":246,"height":175}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1556033,"name":"Nourish","permalink":"nourish","url":"/category/nourish"}]},{"id":2597863,"name":"Higher Grounds Coffee","permalink":"higher-grounds-coffee","position":41,"price":12.99,"default_price":12.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/higher-grounds-coffee","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-06-02T03:51:33.000Z","description":"All bags are 16oz whole beans\r\n\r\nMade in Colombia, Ethiopia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru, Sumatra, Uganda\r\n\r\nHigher Grounds Trading Co. is a mission-driven company dedicated to offering you the highest-quality handcrafted 100% fair trade, organic, and shade-grown coffees from around the world.

True ''up'' from our standpoint on the earth, is away from the center, and the earth in space has no inherent up or down. To emphasize this point, this map includes an inset, which shows global views from various angles. In addition, other inset maps show examples of a variety of projections with notes on their merits and limitations.\r\nStandard size is 36'' x 56''\r\n\r\nODT25\r\n\r\n\"Peter's Projection\" Map:\r\nWhich is bigger, Greenland or China?

In response to such discrepancies, Dr. Arno Peters created an equal area map, a new world map that dramatically improves the accuracy of how we see the Earth. \r\nStandard size is 35'' x 50''\r\n\r\nODT24\r\n\r\nEqual Area Map of the U.S.A.:\r\nSee the USA in true size!

CAH artisans sell their work locally to tourists, and for export through the fair trade market.\r\n\r\nProduct Code: #8002070","options":[{"id":9432504,"name":"Default","price":135.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25791372/-/additional_8002070.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25791372/-/additional_8002070.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25791380/-/image_8002.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25791380/-/image_8002.jpg","width":230,"height":140}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1556035,"name":"Heart Home Decor","permalink":"heart-home-decor","url":"/category/heart-home-decor"},{"id":1556037,"name":"Spirit","permalink":"spirit","url":"/category/spirit"}]},{"id":2675193,"name":"Handmade daily News Hot Mat","permalink":"handmade-daily-news-hot-mat","position":68,"price":8.99,"default_price":8.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/handmade-daily-news-hot-mat","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-07-28T20:33:38.000Z","description":"All the news that’s fit to weave – artisans’ careful handwork makes a beautiful and effective hot mat from recycled newspapers.
