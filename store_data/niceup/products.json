Universally loved, very few people know it was originally recorded as a dancehall number, then later remixed in a jungle style by M-Beat for chart success around the globe. It is a tune that has traversed genres and ages and still smashes any dance to this day. Wrongtom takes it back to the source with a fresh bumping reggae riddim featuring live instrumentation and his trademark dub fx.\r\n\r\nOver on the flip, rising star of the reggae world Mr Benn gives his spin on the modern dancehall sound with a dancefloor pleasing remix of Cutty Ranks \"As You See It\". Probably one of Cutty's lesser known tracks, this also found its home in the jungle raves of the mid 90s when sampled extensively by the producers of the day. Taking his cues from classic 90s dancehall producers such as Dave Kelly, and Bobby Digital, this remix showcases the producers talents perfectly.\r\n\r\n<object height=\"225\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F3779006&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_playcount=true&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;color=ff7700\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F3779006&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_playcount=true&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;color=ff7700\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>   <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/niceuprecords/sets/inna-nice-up-fashion-02\">Inna NICE UP!

Containing 2 tracks that have only previously been available in a digital format, this dubplate special is heavy on the bass especially for DJs. First up, Scottish bassbin-botherers Mungo's Hi Fi rework the classic \"On A Dubstep Tip\" in a dancefloor devastating style - possibly one of their heaviest remixes to date! Over on the flip, recent single \"Rising Star\" by Bristol's Mr Benn gets a deep and dubby remix from Jstar, leaving just about enough of Serocee's vocal in the mix!\r\n\r\nHand stamped limited edition of 500 copies.\r\n\r\n<object height=\"225\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F3994169&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_playcount=true&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;color=ff7700\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F3994169&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_playcount=true&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;color=ff7700\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>   <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/niceuprecords/sets/nupdub01\">NICE UP!

Toddla T’s main hype man and dancehall don Serocee steps up on this, a heavy reggae / dubstep style track which he takes even deeper with tales of poverty, police brutality and torture, but managing to triumph over all – possibly one of his most introspective vocals to date. \r\n\r\nRemixes come from fellow rising star King Yoof whose ‘Back To Hackney’ EP on Sub Slayers set the bar for the jungle-breaks or ‘140 jungle’ sound – which he showcases perfectly here with some chopped amens, heavy bass and old school flavour. Next up Tomb Crew give the track a UK Funky style re-dub, lacing it with a haunting melody line and screwed up vocal chops.\r\n\r\n<object height=\"165\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2628924&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;show_playcount=true&amp;show_comments=true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2628924&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;show_playcount=true&amp;show_comments=true\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\"></embed></object><span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/niceuprecords/sets/mr-benn-ft-serocee-rising-star\">Rising Star - Mr Benn ft Serocee</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/niceuprecords\">NICEUPrecords</a></span>","options":[{"id":28513172,"name":"Default","price":5.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89404910/-/NUP005A.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89404910/-/NUP005A.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89404874/-/NUP005B.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89404874/-/NUP005B.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2516245,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":9670719,"name":"V/A - Spiky Dread","permalink":"v-a-spiky-dread","position":16,"price":12.5,"default_price":12.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/v-a-spiky-dread","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-02-28T22:18:19.000Z","description":"Fantastic compilation of punky reggae and post-dub punk from NICE UP! cohort Wrongtom & Ed Zed. 14 tracks of well researched and painstakingly licensed rare and obscure tracks exploring the connection between punk and reggae from 1978-1984.

Having received serious rotation from Mistajam and Ras Kwame on the radio, as well as heavy support from the likes of Skream, Hatcha, N-type and Jakes, the label wasted no time in snapping up \"On A Dubstep Tip\", an inspired reworking of SL2's rave anthem. Featuring Dynamite MC reliving his rave-hood on the mic alongside Jah Screechy who penned the original sample source \"Walk & Skank\", this is sure to blow the roof at any dance.\r\n\r\nOn the Bside, Adam shows off his knowledge and love of reggae with updated reworks of classics from some of the most timeless voices in the genre.\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\nA: On A Dubstep Tip\r\nB1: Dennis\r\nB2: Don't Say No","options":[{"id":15068395,"name":"Default","price":3.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/45083333/-/niceup013.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/45083333/-/niceup013.jpg","width":800,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2516245,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]}]
