He lent me the book Ishmael, and played guitar, and taught me about loving the environment. Years later, memories of our long friendship and his adventures building maple sugar cabins in Vermont inspired the fragrance Hunter. With tobacco absolute, organic Bourbon vanilla and balsam fir, this fragrance is best worn with a flannel shirt. \r\n\r\n<i>Ingredients: Organic Jojoba Oil, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Essential Oils and Absolutes</i>\r\n\r\n<b>Love:</b>\r\nThe first time I fell in love, it was all fireworks and sparks and a rush of crazy dancing. The second time I fell in love, it was in a field by the ocean.  My love is infinite. Intense and spicy top notes of Japanese yuzu citrus, French sweet basil and Chinese magnolia oil grow into the burning intensity of ancient templewood and gunpowder. The scent lasts forever, just like true love.\r\n\r\n<i>Ingredients: Organic Jojoba Oil, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Essential Oils and Absolutes, Fragrance</i>\r\n\r\n<b>Noble:</b>\r\nNoble is the first fragrance I ever created. Long before formal training, I was toying with the sensual, intoxicating scent of Indian jasmine absolute and combining it with the fiery, earthy vetiver oil of Haiti. The two ingredients are a symbol of time spent in the beautiful and spiritual country of Nepal.\r\n\r\nCombined with rich almondy notes of chai tea, burning incense, amber and musk, the jasmine-centered Noble is a long-lasting floral woody with an ethereal dry down.\r\n\r\n<i>Ingredients: Organic Jojoba Oil, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Essential Oils and Absolutes, Fragrance</i> \r\n\r\n<i><b>MCMC Fragrances</b> MCMC Fragrances is a small company in Brooklyn dedicated to creating original perfumes made with first-class ingredients.

A play on the Greek practice of Abecedarium inscriptions, the story is illustrated one letter a time, incorporating A-Z onto the page in ever more ingenious ways.\r\n\r\nFor his comic, Blexbolex transports the municipal film-noir genre into the jungle clearings of Abecederia, where our protagonists, Leon and Bernard Blanchett, two French born gangsters hiding from an international warrant for arrest in central Africa, are fleeing the police after a far from perfect bank robbery.\r\n\r\nA work that confounds with its twists and turns just as much at it impresses with its imagination, Abecederia explores themes such torture, totalitarianism, alienation and dehumanisation in a brutal world where no one is safe.\r\n\r\nFirst published in Germany in 2007, Abecederia is sold out in both it German and French versions and is available exclusively from Nobrow Press.\"\r\n\r\n+ Artist: Blexbolex\r\n\r\nDimensions: A5 | Extent: 32 pages | Colours: Three Spot Colours  | Format: Paperback | Edition: 3000","options":[{"id":21199923,"name":"Default","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68046863/-/abecederia_slide1-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68046863/-/abecederia_slide1-1.jpg","width":600,"height":653},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65536125/-/DSC_0735.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65536125/-/DSC_0735.JPG","width":800,"height":684},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65536137/-/DSC_0736.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65536137/-/DSC_0736.JPG","width":800,"height":684},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81452739/-/Odette___DogCrime.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81452739/-/Odette___DogCrime.jpg","width":600,"height":654}],"artists":[{"id":135473,"name":"NoBrow Press","permalink":"nobrow-press","url":"/artist/nobrow-press"}],"categories":[{"id":3421683,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":6664777,"name":"NoBrow - Dog Crime","permalink":"nobrow-dog-crime","position":187,"price":11.0,"default_price":11.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nobrow-dog-crime","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-10T22:43:30.000Z","description":"From the publisher\r\n\r\nIn a world where dogs are revered as gods, what’s the worst possible thing to be accused of? Dogcrime!\r\n\r\n\"Our protagonist finds himself embroiled in a set up which will land him on the wrong side of the law. He ends up running for his life caught up in a conspiracy that will set off a war to ravage the land. Dogcrime is the precursor to a much longer story by Blexbolex entitled No Man’s Land (a 200 page graphic novel which follows the path of our unfortunate protagonist as his mind explores the possibilities of what might have been before his self inflicted summary execution takes effect).
