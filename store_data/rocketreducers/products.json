Too many bands have more than enough quality for songs for a 7”, but not quite enough for an LP, which is where the 12” EP comes in handy. These guys could well have enough material for an LP; they fit seven dandies on this disc. Seriously, if you want to sit down for about 15 minutes of kick-you-in-the-nuts punk ‘n’ roll, this is your ticket. The songs are short (for the most part), catchy, raw, and delivered with a sense of urgency that will have you begging for more. This is worth going out of your way to find.
