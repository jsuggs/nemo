And that is why we have no limits… censorship to us is a weightless word. To reclaim the strength that this word has been given, and to render it meaningless, we delved deeper into its evolution in this issue, and by doing so, we stripped it of what history has turned it into, and simplified it, into nothing but an empty word. \r\n\r\nThis, our 11th issue of IN magazine features the award winning British singer Dido, in an exhilarating interview where she speaks candidly about her latest work, and her career. Read through the UNCENSORED issue to discover the secrets that made Alice Edde, a fashion mogul and powerhouse thousands of miles away from home. Get inspired by the words of Muriel Aboulrouss, the first female cinematographer in the Arab world. Join us in a journey of glittering dresses, pop princesses, and make-believe in our exclusive feature on Amato Haute Couture. In celebration of the uncensored we cover everything from Booty Calls to Kinky Boots!\r\n\r\nHere’s to more years to come and to you, our UNCENSORED readers! \r\n","options":[{"id":50711394,"name":"Default","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":229,"name":"United Arab Emirates","code":"AE"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":11.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129465873/-/Issue-11.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129465873/-/Issue-11.jpg","width":600,"height":784}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6910539,"name":"Fashion Magazine","permalink":"fashion-magazine","url":"/category/fashion-magazine"}]},{"id":15572787,"name":"IN 12 - Shutdown","permalink":"in-12-shutdown","position":2,"price":11.0,"default_price":11.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/in-12-shutdown","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-15T16:52:01.000Z","description":"Letter from the Editor\r\nThe Shutdown | Fall/Winter 2013\r\n\r\nWhen someone is afraid of something new or unfamiliar it’s called Neophobia. However, when fear of collective evolving and reluctance to accept non-traditional cultural expression is prevalent in a society, we call that a Shutdown!\r\n\r\nThe way society operates today has pushed us into one animal-like herd or another. Following “trends”, seeking the most coveted products, being told what is IN instead of deciding for ourselves on an individual level what is IN. This leaves us in a dumbed-down state that has eliminated our critical eye and our critical mind. Very few of us question, very few of us seek “truths”, but those of us who do, are unsung heroes. Free individuals may not necessarily be artists, rich investors, or outcasts, they are free because they have separated from the herd and seek innovation and evolution.\r\n\r\nTo question, to experiment, and to take risks is the true meaning of freedom. Shutting down on what we already know and casting away what is new and risky is against everything our ancestors believed in, we are a nation meant to rule, to evolve, and to thrive… We are not missing the ability to do so, we are missing the courage of acceptance. Today, every person has the choice between shutdown and freedom; one keeps you safe in one place until your dying day, and the other holds opportunities, discoveries, and delightful journeys full of hopes and dreams. Make your choice, pick a side!\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":50655405,"name":"Default","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":229,"name":"United Arab Emirates","code":"AE"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":11.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129424986/-/Issue-12.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129424986/-/Issue-12.jpg","width":600,"height":784}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6910539,"name":"Fashion Magazine","permalink":"fashion-magazine","url":"/category/fashion-magazine"}]}]
