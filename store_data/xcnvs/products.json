For 2 weeks I soaked in as much culture, art, weather, food (the list goes on) that I possibly could. There is hardly a single day that goes by that I don't think about Tokyo and how it inspires me as a designer and an artist. When I woke up to see the recent events on March 11th, my heart broke. My deepest thoughts and love goes out to all of those who were effected by these tragic events. I wanted to show my gratitude by creating this piece in honor of Japan. This is the first in a series of (3), 11\" x 11\" prints on canvas, which will be for sale. All proceeds will be donated to the Red Cross and their ongoing relief efforts to those abroad in need. <br />One Love. <i>-Matt Osborne</i>","options":[{"id":11868038,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/34390248/-/ozxcnvs_jpn.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/34390248/-/ozxcnvs_jpn.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1976138,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]}]
