Thanks for your patience!\r\n\r\nChunky, ice blue aquamarines are suspended on my hand made riveted and wrapped sterling silver earwires. The long, elegant wires have a strong feminine curve to them, and the rivets give a touch of industrial. These aquamarines have a stunning color and an unusual cut, and I wanted to display them in a distinctive, yet simple setting. \r\n\r\nAquamarine is the birthstone for March...these earrings will make the perfect gift for those with March birthdays. \r\n\r\nMy sterling rivet series comes in a longer and a petite size. This is the longer size. Earrings are 1 and 5/8 inches long and the stone is 3/8 inch across. The aquamarine rivet earrings are also available in the petite size. \r\n\r\nThis is a recycled listing (good photos are hard to come by, it turns out).
