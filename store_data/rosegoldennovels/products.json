Every Night Terror I had began to blur with reality until they were no longer separate. In the months that had passed, I was the only one to return. \r\n   With my death, I joined a war that lay beneath heaven and above hell, in limbo where people believed that the living were dead, and they were alive. I had put the people I loved most in danger of not only losing their lives, but their souls.

The deaths of mortals are escalating at an alarming rate.

Up until she turned sixteenth birthday that is. She would wake up in the middle of the night; a cold sweat drenching her sheets, gasping for air, her hands racing defensively to her throat. In these brief moments that followed, she would always realize two things. One: it all had been a nightmare, a terrible nightmare. And two: the three figures standing at the foot of her bed hadn’t disappeared with the scenery, they had followed her out. \r\n \r\nThese figures, she knew them all too well. Two were men silhouettes and one was female. She would always be running from them in a dark, eerie familiar place. But they would always reach her, pin her down, and begin to choke the life from her. Even after she woke, the pressure around her throat was real, would linger in bruises, and those figures would still be there, staring at her. \r\n \r\nDoctors called them night terrors. They said they weren’t uncommon for children and young teenagers who had recently lost their parents. Only, these started the night of her sixteenth birthday, two weeks before their death. \r\n \r\nA little over two months later, her best friend Holly Garland goes missing. With no dreaming being safe, she soon realizes that her abduction is a case of mistaken identity, and these people were really after her. She is rescued By Guardians named Alex and Kaw when she finds Holly’s grandmother dead, unknowingly joining a war that has been waging between the original angels, and fallen angels. What she doesn’t realize is the journey to save her friend will make her a little less than human, and ultimately, may claim her life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(206 pgs, available in paperback)","options":[{"id":50816841,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.95,"amount_with_others":0.99,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":22.95,"amount_with_others":0.99}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129545208/-/BookCoverImage.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129545208/-/BookCoverImage.jpg","width":333,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6929532,"name":"Supernatural Romance","permalink":"supernatural-romance","url":"/category/supernatural-romance"},{"id":6929670,"name":"softcover","permalink":"softcover","url":"/category/softcover"}]},{"id":15620391,"name":"Minus One","permalink":"minus-one","position":5,"price":11.99,"default_price":11.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/minus-one","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-12-17T20:09:34.000Z","description":"All of Gwen's life, she was the outcast.
