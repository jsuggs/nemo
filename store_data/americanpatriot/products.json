A lot of us know that. But not as many of us know where it comes from. \r\n\r\nPersia had tried to invade Greece in 490 BC, but at the battle of Marathon, Athens had thrown them back into the sea. With their tails tucked, they went back to the desert...But not for good. \r\n\r\nA new king of Perisa named Xerxes had taken over for his father, and he was working hard on finishing the task his dad had began. For four years he rounded up nations and soldiers, build bridges out of ships, and finally, in 480 BC had his army poised to crush Greece. \r\n\r\nThe historian Herodotus said the army was made up of 5 million men, while the poet Simonides figured 3 million. He also said that when they rested, they drank up rivers, and ate the entire food content of cities they passed through. He also said that when they marched, the earth would shake. Now, we know these are exaggerations, but the Greeks were certainly outnumbered. Modern history pegs the army of King Xerxes of Persia at between 200,000 and 300,000, plus animals and etc.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks quickly threw together the best alliance they could, and the city states began to prepare for war. Some simply gave up, and promised to kowtow to the Asian army if they were spared. Natually, the alliance was headed by Sparta. In laymans terms, the Spartans were the baddest mofos who ever trod our planet. From birth, they were engineered to be the best fighting men in the world. In fact, there was only one profession in all of Sparta. Soldier. \r\n\r\nAt birth, any sickly or deformed baby was left in the woods to die, or depending on the illness, if it survived 24 hours in the forest, could be brought home to have another chance. At 7 years of age, male children were sent to military academy, which lasted 14 years. Among the subjects they learned, naturally focusing on military skills, was the tolerance of pain. Tolerance to the point that whipping contests were held to see who could take the most lashing before making a single sound.\r\n\r\nAt approximately 10, they were sent into forest for a week, empty handed, and told to return alive if they were truly a Spartan, and to please die if they were not. \r\n\r\nAnyway, the point is, when these guys got out of military school at 21 they were pretty friggin' tough. There's more important things going on. The world's first democracy is about to be snuffed out by Persia!\r\n\r\nSo Sparta took charge of the handful of Greeks who were willing to fight. The problem was that Sparta was also forbidden from going to war! The religious festival of Carnea was in full swing, the religious rulers decreed it a sin to march to war until the conclusion of the games. An Oracle said that while Sparta could not go to war, they could still save themselves. All it would take was the sacrifice of a king.\r\n\r\nThat king was named Leonidas, and he was a pretty bright guy. He decided to take a walk. Naturally,when a king just took a stroll, be brought bodyguards with him. So he picked 300 of his finest soldiers (who had sons) and took a stroll. Straight at the Persian army. With them came about 6,000 other Greeks of varius states.\r\n\r\nLegend has it that when Leonidas went through his wilderness trial, he was attacked by a wolf. He wegded himself into a tight tunnel of rock, and when the wolf sprung, it became stuck, and he killed it. What better way to kill the Persians? The location was Thermopylae...The Hot Gates. Where the enemy would have to funnel into battle and their numbers would be meaningless. \r\n\r\nXerxes got reports from his scouts that Spartan soldiers were in his path, performing naked calisthenics and grooming themselves. He laughed. What the hell were these homos thinking they were going to do, prancing around in the buff? What he should have known is that the Spartans were performing the rituals of those who meant to die. \r\n\r\nFor four days, they stared each other down. The \"God-King\" Xerxes becoming more and more frustrated. Finally he demanded of Leonidas, throw down your weapons and you will be allowed to live. Leonidas laughed in his face and said \"MOLON LABE!\"....\"COME AND GET THEM!\". It was on. \r\n\r\nThe Greeks formed their Phalanx...A wall of men and sheilds across the whole pass. The Persians confidently strode forward to sweep these arrogant bastards out of their way. They were slaughered by the hundreds, no match for the Greek soldiers they faced. They were also slaves, and so they were herded again and again into the pass to emerge as hamburger. Many times they had men actually whipping them forward. The breaking point came when king Xerxes sent forth the Immortals, the best soldiers of all of Persia, and they were massacred in full view of the Persian camp. They were starting to fear the Greeks a lot more than they feared the whips that stung thier backs.\r\n\r\nAt that last minute, when the Persian army was beginning to revolt, A Greek named Ephialtes turned traitor and revealed to the Persians a goat path that would allow him to flank and slaughter the force of Leonidas. The 1000 Phocians guarding the pass quickly fled with only token resistance. \r\n\r\nIt was clear now their amazing victory was over. Leonidas released all of his non-Spartan soldiers to go home. 600 Thespians decided to stay and fight with the Spartans until the end. \r\n\r\nThey fought until their swords were broken, and then the fought with their bare hands and their teeth. And believe it or not, even unarmed and surrounded, outbumbered 1000 to one, the Persians were still too chickenshit to face them! They killed the remaining Greeks with flights of arrows.\r\n\r\nThere is a poem engraved in the rocks of Thermopylae which to this day still reads: \r\n\r\nGo tell the Spartans, passerby,\r\nThat here, by Spartan law, we lie\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nGo tell the Spartans, you who have read;\r\nThat we have followed their orders, and now are dead \r\n\r\nIn the end, all 300 Spartans were killed, along with 3,700 other Greeks. The Persians lost 40,000 or more. And it bought time for a newly inspired Greece to assemble and fight off the Persian army on another day. \r\n\r\nThis battle is still taught to aspiring officers in academies such as West Point all around the world, and it still means something to us too. \r\n\r\nIf they want our guns, they can come and get them. And although it might mean the end of us, it just might serve as inspiration to all those who cower and let them be taken, to stand up and be heard.'","options":[{"id":35999763,"name":"Small","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35999766,"name":"Medium","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35999769,"name":"Large","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35999772,"name":"XL","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35999775,"name":"XXL","price":16.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":35999778,"name":"XXXL","price":17.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United

With their tails tucked, they went back to the desert...But not for good. \r\n\r\nA new king of Perisa named Xerxes had taken over for his father, and he was working hard on finishing the task his dad had began. For four years he rounded up nations and soldiers, build bridges out of ships, and finally, in 480 BC had his army poised to crush Greece. \r\n\r\nThe historian Herodotus said the army was made up of 5 million men, while the poet Simonides figured 3 million. He also said that when they rested, they drank up rivers, and ate the entire food content of cities they passed through. He also said that when they marched, the earth would shake. Now, we know these are exaggerations, but the Greeks were certainly outnumbered. Modern history pegs the army of King Xerxes of Persia at between 200,000 and 300,000, plus animals and etc.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks quickly threw together the best alliance they could, and the city states began to prepare for war. Some simply gave up, and promised to kowtow to the Asian army if they were spared. Natually, the alliance was headed by Sparta. In laymans terms, the Spartans were the baddest mofos who ever trod our planet. From birth, they were engineered to be the best fighting men in the world. In fact, there was only one profession in all of Sparta. Soldier. \r\n\r\nAt birth, any sickly or deformed baby was left in the woods to die, or depending on the illness, if it survived 24 hours in the forest, could be brought home to have another chance. At 7 years of age, male children were sent to military academy, which lasted 14 years. Among the subjects they learned, naturally focusing on military skills, was the tolerance of pain. Tolerance to the point that whipping contests were held to see who could take the most lashing before making a single sound.\r\n\r\nAt approximately 10, they were sent into forest for a week, empty handed, and told to return alive if they were truly a Spartan, and to please die if they were not. \r\n\r\nAnyway, the point is, when these guys got out of military school at 21 they were pretty friggin' tough. There's more important things going on. The world's first democracy is about to be snuffed out by Persia!\r\n\r\nSo Sparta took charge of the handful of Greeks who were willing to fight. The problem was that Sparta was also forbidden from going to war! The religious festival of Carnea was in full swing, the religious rulers decreed it a sin to march to war until the conclusion of the games. An Oracle said that while Sparta could not go to war, they could still save themselves. All it would take was the sacrifice of a king.\r\n\r\nThat king was named Leonidas, and he was a pretty bright guy. He decided to take a walk. Naturally,when a king just took a stroll, be brought bodyguards with him. So he picked 300 of his finest soldiers (who had sons) and took a stroll. Straight at the Persian army. With them came about 6,000 other Greeks of varius states.\r\n\r\nLegend has it that when Leonidas went through his wilderness trial, he was attacked by a wolf. He wegded himself into a tight tunnel of rock, and when the wolf sprung, it became stuck, and he killed it. What better way to kill the Persians? The location was Thermopylae...The Hot Gates. Where the enemy would have to funnel into battle and their numbers would be meaningless. \r\n\r\nXerxes got reports from his scouts that Spartan soldiers were in his path, performing naked calisthenics and grooming themselves. He laughed. What the hell were these homos thinking they were going to do, prancing around in the buff? What he should have known is that the Spartans were performing the rituals of those who meant to die. \r\n\r\nFor four days, they stared each other down. The \"God-King\" Xerxes becoming more and more frustrated. Finally he demanded of Leonidas, throw down your weapons and you will be allowed to live. Leonidas laughed in his face and said \"MOLON LABE!\"....\"COME AND GET THEM!\". It was on. \r\n\r\nThe Greeks formed their Phalanx...A wall of men and sheilds across the whole pass. The Persians confidently strode forward to sweep these arrogant bastards out of their way. They were slaughered by the hundreds, no match for the Greek soldiers they faced. They were also slaves, and so they were herded again and again into the pass to emerge as hamburger. Many times they had men actually whipping them forward. The breaking point came when king Xerxes sent forth the Immortals, the best soldiers of all of Persia, and they were massacred in full view of the Persian camp. They were starting to fear the Greeks a lot more than they feared the whips that stung thier backs.\r\n\r\nAt that last minute, when the Persian army was beginning to revolt, A Greek named Ephialtes turned traitor and revealed to the Persians a goat path that would allow him to flank and slaughter the force of Leonidas. The 1000 Phocians guarding the pass quickly fled with only token resistance. \r\n\r\nIt was clear now their amazing victory was over. Leonidas released all of his non-Spartan soldiers to go home. 600 Thespians decided to stay and fight with the Spartans until the end. \r\n\r\nThey fought until their swords were broken, and then the fought with their bare hands and their teeth. And believe it or not, even unarmed and surrounded, outbumbered 1000 to one, the Persians were still too chickenshit to face them! They killed the remaining Greeks with flights of arrows.\r\n\r\nThere is a poem engraved in the rocks of Thermopylae which to this day still reads: \r\n\r\nGo tell the Spartans, passerby,\r\nThat here, by Spartan law, we lie\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nGo tell the Spartans, you who have read;\r\nThat we have followed their orders, and now are dead \r\n\r\nIn the end, all 300 Spartans were killed, along with 3,700 other Greeks. The Persians lost 40,000 or more. And it bought time for a newly inspired Greece to assemble and fight off the Persian army on another day. \r\n\r\nThis battle is still taught to aspiring officers in academies such as West Point all around the world, and it still means something to us too. \r\n\r\nIf they want our guns, they can come and get them. And although it might mean the end of us, it just might serve as inspiration to all those who cower and let them be taken, to stand up and be heard.'","options":[{"id":35999703,"name":"Small","price":6.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/113679150/-/Untitled11.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/113679150/-/Untitled11.jpg","width":1000,"height":906},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112453098/-/DSC04573.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112453098/-/DSC04573.JPG","width":971,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4535138,"name":"T-Shirts","permalink":"t-shirts","url":"/category/t-shirts"}]},{"id":11081085,"name":"CLEARANCE: Dark Red \"When Guns Are Outlawed, I Will Be An Outlaw\" Shirt","permalink":"dark-red-when-guns-are-outlawed-i-will-be-an-outlaw-shirt","position":10,"price":6.99,"default_price":6.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dark-red-when-guns-are-outlawed-i-will-be-an-outlaw-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-05-10T21:21:52.000Z","description":"Gildan DryBlend™ T-Shirt\r\n\r\n• 5.6 oz., 50% cotton / 50% DryBlend™ polyester pre-shrunk jersey knit\r\n• DryBlend™ moisture wicking fabric\r\n• Seamless double-needle 7/8\" collar\r\n• Taped neck and shoulders\r\n• Double-needle sleeve and bottom hems\r\n\r\nPrinted in Grand Rapids, MI","options":[{"id":34860195,"name":"Medium","price":6.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34860204,"name":"XXL","price":8.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":35999760,"name":"XXXL","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/119810274/-/Outlaw_Red.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/119810274/-/Outlaw_Red.jpg","width":980,"height":863},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116172810/-/DSC04554.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116172810/-/DSC04554.JPG","width":971,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4535138,"name":"T-Shirts","permalink":"t-shirts","url":"/category/t-shirts"}]},{"id":11795655,"name":"CLEARANCE: Dark Red \"Tyranny Response Team\" T-Shirt","permalink":"dark-red-tyranny-response-team-t-shirt","position":11,"price":6.99,"default_price":6.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dark-red-tyranny-response-team-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-06-14T21:54:04.000Z","description":"Gildan DryBlend™ T-Shirt\r\n\r\n• 5.6 oz., 50% cotton / 50% DryBlend™ polyester pre-shrunk jersey knit\r\n• DryBlend™ moisture wicking fabric\r\n• Seamless double-needle 7/8\" collar\r\n• Taped neck and shoulders\r\n• Double-needle sleeve and bottom hems\r\n\r\nPrinted in Grand Rapids, MI","options":[{"id":37274337,"name":"Medium","price":6.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":37274412,"name":"Large","price":6.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116225178/-/Untitled4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116225178/-/Untitled4.jpg","width":1000,"height":934},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116164536/-/DSC04645_-_Copy.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116164536/-/DSC04645_-_Copy.JPG","width":744,"height":728}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4535138,"name":"T-Shirts","permalink":"t-shirts","url":"/category/t-shirts"}]},{"id":11426166,"name":"CLEARANCE: Dark Gray \"ΜΟΛΩΝ ΛΑΒΕ\" T-Shirt","permalink":"dark-gray-t-shirt","position":13,"price":6.99,"default_price":6.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dark-gray-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-05-28T16:39:06.000Z","description":"Gildan DryBlend™ T-Shirt\r\n\r\n• 5.6 oz., 50% cotton / 50% DryBlend™ polyester pre-shrunk jersey knit\r\n• DryBlend™ moisture wicking fabric\r\n• Seamless double-needle 7/8\" collar\r\n• Taped neck and shoulders\r\n• Double-needle sleeve and bottom hems\r\n\r\nPrinted in Grand Rapids, MI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt means \"Come and take them\".

A lot of us know that. But not as many of us know where it comes from. \r\n\r\nPersia had tried to invade Greece in 490 BC, but at the battle of Marathon, Athens had thrown them back into the sea. With their tails tucked, they went back to the desert...But not for good. \r\n\r\nA new king of Perisa named Xerxes had taken over for his father, and he was working hard on finishing the task his dad had began. For four years he rounded up nations and soldiers, build bridges out of ships, and finally, in 480 BC had his army poised to crush Greece. \r\n\r\nThe historian Herodotus said the army was made up of 5 million men, while the poet Simonides figured 3 million. He also said that when they rested, they drank up rivers, and ate the entire food content of cities they passed through. He also said that when they marched, the earth would shake. Now, we know these are exaggerations, but the Greeks were certainly outnumbered. Modern history pegs the army of King Xerxes of Persia at between 200,000 and 300,000, plus animals and etc.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks quickly threw together the best alliance they could, and the city states began to prepare for war. Some simply gave up, and promised to kowtow to the Asian army if they were spared. Natually, the alliance was headed by Sparta. In laymans terms, the Spartans were the baddest mofos who ever trod our planet. From birth, they were engineered to be the best fighting men in the world. In fact, there was only one profession in all of Sparta. Soldier. \r\n\r\nAt birth, any sickly or deformed baby was left in the woods to die, or depending on the illness, if it survived 24 hours in the forest, could be brought home to have another chance. At 7 years of age, male children were sent to military academy, which lasted 14 years. Among the subjects they learned, naturally focusing on military skills, was the tolerance of pain. Tolerance to the point that whipping contests were held to see who could take the most lashing before making a single sound.\r\n\r\nAt approximately 10, they were sent into forest for a week, empty handed, and told to return alive if they were truly a Spartan, and to please die if they were not. \r\n\r\nAnyway, the point is, when these guys got out of military school at 21 they were pretty friggin' tough. There's more important things going on. The world's first democracy is about to be snuffed out by Persia!\r\n\r\nSo Sparta took charge of the handful of Greeks who were willing to fight. The problem was that Sparta was also forbidden from going to war! The religious festival of Carnea was in full swing, the religious rulers decreed it a sin to march to war until the conclusion of the games. An Oracle said that while Sparta could not go to war, they could still save themselves. All it would take was the sacrifice of a king.\r\n\r\nThat king was named Leonidas, and he was a pretty bright guy. He decided to take a walk. Naturally,when a king just took a stroll, be brought bodyguards with him. So he picked 300 of his finest soldiers (who had sons) and took a stroll. Straight at the Persian army. With them came about 6,000 other Greeks of varius states.\r\n\r\nLegend has it that when Leonidas went through his wilderness trial, he was attacked by a wolf. He wegded himself into a tight tunnel of rock, and when the wolf sprung, it became stuck, and he killed it. What better way to kill the Persians? The location was Thermopylae...The Hot Gates. Where the enemy would have to funnel into battle and their numbers would be meaningless. \r\n\r\nXerxes got reports from his scouts that Spartan soldiers were in his path, performing naked calisthenics and grooming themselves. He laughed. What the hell were these homos thinking they were going to do, prancing around in the buff? What he should have known is that the Spartans were performing the rituals of those who meant to die. \r\n\r\nFor four days, they stared each other down. The \"God-King\" Xerxes becoming more and more frustrated. Finally he demanded of Leonidas, throw down your weapons and you will be allowed to live. Leonidas laughed in his face and said \"MOLON LABE!\"....\"COME AND GET THEM!\". It was on. \r\n\r\nThe Greeks formed their Phalanx...A wall of men and sheilds across the whole pass. The Persians confidently strode forward to sweep these arrogant bastards out of their way. They were slaughered by the hundreds, no match for the Greek soldiers they faced. They were also slaves, and so they were herded again and again into the pass to emerge as hamburger. Many times they had men actually whipping them forward. The breaking point came when king Xerxes sent forth the Immortals, the best soldiers of all of Persia, and they were massacred in full view of the Persian camp. They were starting to fear the Greeks a lot more than they feared the whips that stung thier backs.\r\n\r\nAt that last minute, when the Persian army was beginning to revolt, A Greek named Ephialtes turned traitor and revealed to the Persians a goat path that would allow him to flank and slaughter the force of Leonidas. The 1000 Phocians guarding the pass quickly fled with only token resistance. \r\n\r\nIt was clear now their amazing victory was over. Leonidas released all of his non-Spartan soldiers to go home. 600 Thespians decided to stay and fight with the Spartans until the end. \r\n\r\nThey fought until their swords were broken, and then the fought with their bare hands and their teeth. And believe it or not, even unarmed and surrounded, outbumbered 1000 to one, the Persians were still too chickenshit to face them! They killed the remaining Greeks with flights of arrows.\r\n\r\nThere is a poem engraved in the rocks of Thermopylae which to this day still reads: \r\n\r\nGo tell the Spartans, passerby,\r\nThat here, by Spartan law, we lie\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nGo tell the Spartans, you who have read;\r\nThat we have followed their orders, and now are dead \r\n\r\nIn the end, all 300 Spartans were killed, along with 3,700 other Greeks. The Persians lost 40,000 or more. And it bought time for a newly inspired Greece to assemble and fight off the Persian army on another day. \r\n\r\nThis battle is still taught to aspiring officers in academies such as West Point all around the world, and it still means something to us too. \r\n\r\nIf they want our guns, they can come and get them.

They are computer cut and made from high quality vinyl that lasts. \r\n\r\nHere’s a very important set of facts about the Revolutionary War that every person who would call themselves an American should know. \r\n\r\nDuring the Revolutionary War, only THREE percent of the people actually fought against Great Britain.\r\n\r\nOnly TEN percent of the citizens actively supported that three percent.\r\n\r\nApproximately TWENTY percent considered themselves to be on the side of the Revolution, but they did not actively participate.\r\nTowards the climatic end of the war, approximately THIRTY percent actually fought on the side of the British.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the citizens had no disposition either way.  They didn’t care.  They didn’t want anything to do with what they deemed to simply be a political issue.\r\n\r\nThe sanctity, liberty, and freedoms of this nation were brought about by the unselfish, honorable, patriotic, committed, and determined acts of a mere 3%.  This three percent didn’t let the comforts of life blind them to the eternal significance of freedom.  They didn’t allow evil speaking to sway what their heart told them was true.  They didn’t postpone their actions for a more convenient time.  They didn’t value their own life over the life and liberty of their fellow citizens.  In many cases, they sealed their testimony of Freedom, Liberty, and Choice with their blood and the blood of their families.  Although it was only three percent, it was still sufficient to create a nation which was to be an example to all the rest of the world of a truly free republic.  This three percent laid the foundation of the most powerful and prosperous nation on the earth.  This valiant three percent manifested to the entire nation, and surely even the world, the unalienable value of hope, faith, family, virtue and freedom. \r\n\r\nThe question is does this nation still contain a “three percent” who possess the same traits?  Is there a “three percent” among us who can save this nation from crumbling into a vile, unrecognizable society?","options":[{"id":29733404,"name":"Default","price":7.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/93422714/-/ok.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/93422714/-/ok.jpg","width":1000,"height":975}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4535186,"name":"Decals","permalink":"decals","url":"/category/decals"}]},{"id":9645485,"name":"\"The Right To Bear Arms\" Decal","permalink":"the-right-to-bear-arms-decal","position":34,"price":7.99,"default_price":7.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-right-to-bear-arms-decal","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-27T00:44:24.000Z","description":"\"The Right To Keep And Bear Arms Will Be Defended\" Vinyl Decals.
