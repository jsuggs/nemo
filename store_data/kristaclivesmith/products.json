You’re at the point in your business where you have to either take it to the next level or choose differently. Something has to give.\r\n\r\nOne of two situations is likely at play:\r\n\r\n1.       You’ve been at it long enough to know you love it, but things just don’t seem to be working quite right. The flame of passion that burns so brightly within you and has set your soul on fire for the industry of professional organizing just seems to fizzle when thrown out into the marketplace of consumers. Or, if you’re lucky enough, a small flame is burning, but at best it’s precarious and vulnerable, one which you have to constantly ‘tend’ to and monitor constantly. The stress of living in fear of what might come along and snuff it out when it’s at such a susceptible stage is exhausting, and you’re not sure how long you can keep going at this pace.\r\n\r\n2.       Things HAVE caught fire, and you’re booked up like crazy and can’t handle the volume of what you’re up against. You’ve hit the ceiling of what is manageable and do-able for you, and you need some solutions on how to successfully leverage and scale it so you can manage and control the big picture as well as the millions of little details that overwhelm you on a daily and weekly basis.\r\n\r\n\r\nEither way, you’re in a position where it’s time to play The Growth Game. In this 4-Disc Audio Series for Organizers, you will learn the skills and tools necessary to transform your business through better understanding of the business, sales and marketing processes that will be involved – and required – if you’re planning to take things to the next level.\r\n\r\nEach disc is sold separately, for a limited-time introductory price of $30.00 per disc, or the Complete 4-Disc Set for $100.00. (All prices are in Canadian funds, and do not include shipping & handling and GST for Canadian residents, which are extra).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":628475,"name":"Default","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":7.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":7.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":20.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/760826/-/4_disc_set_image_diag_320x320.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/760826/-/4_disc_set_image_diag_320x320.jpg","width":320,"height":320}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":131431,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
