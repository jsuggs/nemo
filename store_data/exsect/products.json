If you are purchasing a service dog harness please contact me before you purchase. Special pricing is available*\r\n\r\nMeet my little warrior Ziggy! Inspired by King Leonidas from the feature film 300, though that character did not wear much and bless him for it ;) I designed, cut, tooled, dyed, painted and assembled this custom leather harness entirely by hand. This was not made from a patten, I slaved over the design for hours to ensure the most comfort for my beloved Boston and equal pressure distribution to eliminate possible rubbing and hair loss. I strived to make this custom piece both functional as well as aesthetically pleasing. \r\n\r\nAll harnesses are made to order. After purchase I will send an email explaining how to measure your pet. Also, this is when you will be able to specify desired leather color (black, saddle tan, medium brown, dark brown, blue), desired hardware (brass or stainless steel) and we will communicate about design selections, fonts for lettering etc. Pictured is a medium brown dye with stainless steel hardware. The edges were dyed black and hand rubbed with the medium brown dye to create a 'sunburst' finish. I hand tooled the rooster from a vector design. The font is my actual handwriting. Both the lettering and rooster were hand painted with black to give it a 'burned in' look.\r\n\r\nI handpick all leather in person from my supplier I only use top quality full grain leather. Everything is entirely hand made, I do not use machines or presses. Straps are adjustable and will be shipped with some extra length for growth and adjustments.\r\n\r\nDesigns can be hand tooled onto the chest plate or the back plate. You may want to include the pets name and contact information. Vector designs or line drawings work the best for hand tooling. I will be more than happy to help you with the selection of your design. A great place to look for design ideas is istockphoto.com or shutterstock.com, both websites make it extremely easy to enter a keyword and search by image type. Simply choose 'vector'!\r\n\r\nAll harnesses ship with delivery confirmation to US mailing addresses. I am always more than happy to snap photos and send updates of your harness in progress, just ask! Most likely the photos of your harness in progress will end up on my Instagram feed anyway!\r\n\r\nPlease email with any questions.\r\n\r\nCurrent turn around for all custom items is 4 weeks. I am blessed with an abundance of orders, I fulfill all orders on a first come first served basis. I thank you for your patience as I hand craft your custom piece. \r\n\r\nPlease allow 6 weeks for item to ship.

My gym (24 Hour Fitness) that I am ever faithful to removed all iPod/iPhone/water bottle/cell phone holds from ALL machines. This left me with no place to put my iPhone that I use as an iPod while at the gym. Unless I wore pants with pockets I was screwed. Who the hell has pockets at the gym? No more sweet sweet jams to keep me treading. I was lost in silence.\r\n\r\nThen an idea came to me like a beam of light shining down onto my over exercised little head : a leather case with a detachable strap is needed for this situation. I shall make one and save all the lonely musicless drones.\r\n\r\nAnd so I did.\r\n\r\nI initially made one for me and one from my girlfriend. However; Ive made 23 or so for the rest of the faithful gym attendees. I think it is time to sell to the masses.\r\n\r\nSimply hang the iPhone/iPod case from any arm of ANY machine and you are hands free like a pro. And believe me, many people will ask where the hell you obtained such a treasure.\r\n\r\nCase is assembled by hand. Choose from over 160 beautiful conchos from here : http://www.tandyleatherfactory.com/en-usd/home/department/Conchos/Conchos.aspx\r\n\r\nOnce your order is placed we will discuss your leather and size of the object in which you wish to hang.
