Today was Star Con, the ultimate Science Fiction convention where all the popular sci-fi shows, comics, and other pop culture converge into one giant gathering of awesomeness! For the con, Fran came dressed as one of her favorite characters: Princess Kartoola of the Blue Fairy Kingdom. The convention was going great so far. Fran had already amassed several hundred pictures, nabbed a couple of autographs, and even gave some blood over at the small Red Cross booth near the convention center's food court. As Fran walked away to continue checking out vendor tables, one of the other con attendees took his mask off to show his visibly sick face. He immediately began puking up blood, and before any attendants could come to his aid, the man leapt up and began chewing on the flesh on a nearby patron, who in turn began puking up blood and began raging and eating the flesh of another person. It was only a few minutes before the center became over run with infected people, tearing and ripping apart those who weren't like them. Fran was running as fast as she could across the floor, narrowly missing the infected who tried grabbing at her, ripping off her fairy wings and parts of her outfit. Fran quickly remembered the token weapons booth (there's one at every con after all), and grabbed a giant mace that she began swinging at the infected, bashing their heads in as green and red mush shot out. She grabbed up a handful of other weapons and locked herself into one of the small conference rooms along with several other survivors. Fran knew what she had to do. She knew she had to take a stand and destroy these zombie bastards before they escape from the center and take over the entire world. She started handing out the various swords and daggers out to her fellow survivors and prepared herself for what would be an epic battle. She was no longer Princess Kartoola of the Blue Fairy Kingdom. She was Queen Bad Bitch 3000.\r\n\r\nThis polish has a pink-toned red crelly base with various sizes and shapes of black and pink glitter. It is 3-free with 4 stainless steel mixing balls (mini bottles contain 2). Larger sized glitter may require some extra patience retrieving them from the bottle. Due to the size of some glitters, settling may occur. Turning the bottle upside down for a few minutes and then shaking prior to application will help.\r\n\r\nFor opacity, the polish may require up to three coats.\r\n\r\nPicture 1 is courtesy of ColorSplash Nails.\r\n\r\nPicture 2 is courtesy of Cosmetic Sanctuary.\r\n\r\nPicture 3 is courtesy of Gnarly Gnails.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Yoshi does not come with the mini polish.

Maddie was sitting at her own table at the food court on the second floor, watching the masses. She finished her Surly Curly’s meal nearly 20 minutes ago, but could not convince herself to leave her seat to join the first floor, which had escalated into a further agitated ant hill of chaos. She enjoyed the people watching while mocking the ridiculous consumerism all around her. Signs promoting beating each other over the best deals or ones convincing children to follow false idols from reality TV by buying their shoddy products. Maddie was repulsed by everything the holidays now stood for and had had enough. She stood up to begin searching for her mother when she kicked a pair of sunglasses that were on the floor. She picked them up and looked them over. They looked brand new and expensive, she thought. Maddie put the sunglasses on and fell into a wave of confusion. She took the glasses off and looked around. Everything was still the same. She put the glasses back on and there it was again. She kept putting them on and taking them off over and over. When she had the glasses on, she witnessed visions of madness all around her. All of the signs had been altered to their simplest form, reading BUY, CONSUME, and even OBEY. And the faces, the horrible faces. What was once little old ladies, happy couples, and bored husbands were now disfigured faces of death and all of them were staring at Maddie. She shrieked in terror and ran, letting the sunglasses fall to the ground and slide under the table for the next victim to find.\r\n\r\nSnowblind has a white crelly base with various size and shapes of silver holographic glitter. This is a limited edition polish that is numbered. It is full sized (15 mL). The polish is 3-Free. Full sized bottles contain two stainless steel mixing balls.

She put the hood over her head to block the slow drizzle of rain that fell from the sky. She walked for nearly a mile alongside the main highway before detouring into the woods. All of the trees were now naked, with their once vibrant leaves now covering the ground, but she knew the path by heart and continued through. After several minutes, she finally reached the creek where they would cross all the time to eat at the better pizza joint the next town over. Cassie rushed her walk alongside the creek after she realized she only had an hour left. Once she saw the tree, she cracked her first smile in over a week. As she approached it, she could still see the carved initials with a heart around it. She remembered giving him a hard time about it, saying it was corny and something people use to do a long time ago, but secretly she loved it. She sat there under the tree trying to recall if she ever admitted to that or not. Cassie looked at the clock on her cell phone. 30 minutes until the wake. She continued to sit there in silence as the rain picked up.\r\n\r\nCounterintuitive is a black jelly (almost crelly) glitter polish with various sizes and shapes of blue and purple glitter.

The Harris family had just moved to the neighborhood and into the biggest house on the street, which was quiet and devoid of any neighbors to welcome them. Mama Harris grabbed a tiny box and put some of her son’s toys inside of it so he could carry a box into his own room. She handed the box to little Christopher and smiled as he eagerly ran into the house and up the stairs. When he reached the top and started making his way down the long highway, the sun disappeared in between the clouds and the light from the windows faded away. Christopher stopped in his tracks and stared into the darkness. He began to hear knocking behind him and turned around to see a blue ball bouncing towards him from the other end of the hallway. Christopher began backing up and swelling with fear until the ball finally stopped bouncing and rolled up to his feet. He picked the ball up to have a closer look at it until he saw the bloody fingerprints and dropped it. He looked back up to see two girls at the end of the hallway. They were twin sisters, both with long black hair, matching sundresses and completely covered in blood. Little Christopher began to shake with fright as the sisters began levitating towards him, their mouths wide open and contorting as though they were screaming at him but no sounds came out. As they got closer, Christopher tried backing up but fell backwards onto the hardwood floor. He was frozen in fright as they loomed over him, not knowing what they were about to do. “Cut”, a voice yelled in the background, “that was perfect”. The boy stood up and dusted off his pants while the two women were circled by make-up artists doing touch-ups. The director walked up to the boy holding his clipboard with notes on it and began talking to the boy about what he needed to do differently on the next take.\r\n\r\nSoska is a black linear holo made in collaboration with rising cult/horror filmmakers, Jen and Silvia Soska of http://tinyurl.com/tWIStED-tWINS-PRODUCtIONS.

He began talking about the camp and how much it has changed over the years, especially after....the accident. Everyone perked up immediately, wondering what accident the counselor could be referring to. He went on to talk about the foolish groundskeeper who was an angry drunk and mean to most of the young campers. Those same young campers decided to play a trick on that mean old groundskeeper, but their trick went out of control and the groundskeeper became horribly disfigured. Some of the campers began to chuckle at the idea of a disfigured monster roaming the camp. The counselor remained serious and tone; even raising his voice a little to warn the kids that the old groundskeeper swore revenge on everyone. A hush fell over the campfire. Dead branches in the distance began to snap, which made a few of the kids gasp. \"He's out there....watching us.....waiting for the perfect moment to exact his revenge....and when he does....pray he doesn't come for you.\" Every one at the fire stared up at the counselor as he delivered each terrifying word, unaware that everyone was staring at the dark figure behind him with large shears.\r\n\r\nCropsy has a sheer yellow base with red and yellow glitter.

A sharp pain ignites alongside her head, and then the rest of her body. Her blurred vision keeps her from realizing that she was attached to hospital equipment. Various beeping sounds filled the room. The woman's vision came to and she could finally see where she was. She had been there unconscious for several hours, having arrived completely battered and bruised. She could hardly remember why or how she got there save for four masked figures. She stood up from the bed and fell to the ground, taking the IV bag down with her. It splattered across the floor, conjuring up the image of a exploding vase full of water and flowers that her husband had given for their anniversary yesterday, the day before Halloween.. Her husband, she immediately remembered, was hurt during the attack. She started to remember shots fired, then him falling to the ground. That's when they took off their halloween masks. She pulled herself up from the floor just as a police officer, who had been standing watch outside, came in to assist her up. As the cop encroached, she grabbed him and slammed his head against the bed rail, knocking him out. She remembered the four faces, the same faces she shared laughs and good times. The same four woman who she had known and worked with for many years. The same four woman who broke into her home and destroyed her family's lives. She pulled the cop's gun from his holster and handcuffed him to the bed. She got up and ran to the door as a nurse came into the floor, covering her mouth to muffle her screams. She pulled the gun to her and told her to get naked. As the woman quickly dressed herself in the nurse's garb, she tucked the gun in the back of her pants while envisioning those four faces and filling with rage. The same four woman who have hell to pay.\r\n\r\nDevil's Night is a very dark burgundy/brown/black base with blue shimmer.

At first, she felt bad for Horatio when he used his dumb \"I'm a professional photographer and want to take model pictures of you\" pick-up line, so she went out with him, but after a couple of dates, she started to like him. Turns out, he actually was a photographer. Who knew, she thought. She had finally humored him and was now breaking and entering into an old abandoned warehouse to do a photo shoot on Halloween night. They made their way inside through an opening where they assumed a door once stood. The warehouse looked incredibly creepy to Janelle from the outside, but the inside was less spooky and more old and dusty. She sat down and watched Horatio begin to clean the dust and cobwebs off of an old steel table and start setting up some lighting. Janelle had been carrying a smaller bag that contained his camera equipment, which he took from her, but not before kissing her sensually on the lips and chin. She smiled at him and disrobed from his long overcoat she wore to reveal a petite black dress. She had only wore it once before but stopped because it was too short and kept riding up and exposing her entire bottom region. Just thinking about that chaotic night made her snicker aloud. She walked into the lighting and sat on the table and started posing for his camera. He took several pictures of her in various poses for what seemed like hours. Janelle started to get tired and asked if they could go home already. \"Just one more pose....please\" he begged her. She smiled and attempted to do a naughty one for him by pulling up her dress before he stopped her. \"No, no...I'd like to do just a fun, silly one\". She pushed it back down quickly, embarrassed. \"Let's get in the holiday spirit and do one of you screaming\", he said with a slick smile. Janelle smiled, then widened her eyes, lifted her hands in the air and opened her mouth to let out a small audible yelp. Horatio chuckled and told her to actually scream. Janelle was never much of a screamer, but she tried again, letting a slightly louder one out. Horatio frowned at her, then asked if she needed some help. \"How are you going to help me\", she asked. Just then, Horatio began to change. Blood began to pour from all over his contorting face. She watched as his fingers began to split open to reveal large, leathery fingers with long talons for nails at the ends. His mutated hands went up to his mouth where he began ripping open his entire face in order for a beastly one to appear. His shrill screams turned into deadly hissing between large teeth. As the light of the moon danced along the building, Janelle's horrified screams filled the night air.\r\n\r\n(S)creme Queen is a dark maroon plum crelly/creme.

She opened it to see her friends from down the street with their boy Lennon. She welcomed them inside where all of her and her husband's other friends were gathered. Everyone had been trick or treating for the past couple of hours before coming over to the Henderson residence to have some drinks and laughs while the children played together downstairs and ate their candy. As Lennon's parents made their way towards where the party was, he put his clown mask back on, picked up his heavy bag of candy, and made his way down the stairs towards a closed door. He knocked the secret knock on the door and stood there. It was followed by a long block of silence before a small tiger opened the door. The tiger pulled up his mask to reveal himself to be young Tommy Doyle, who lived in this house. As Lennon walked in, he saw his three other friends, the cowboy, the zombie, and the shape. They gathered around in a circle and started pouring out all of the candy into one large pile. From the dark, another friend, the vampire, walked up with a large box and set it on the ground next to the candy. He opened the box and began pulling out various items. From the box, he pulled out several rolls of toilet paper and eggs. Each child began filling their bags with the items and turned to Lennon who pulled out a sheet of paper containing a list of names of people throughout the neighborhood. The neighbors who stole their balls, or chased them with their dogs. Those teachers who gave them detention and the bullies who beat them up in the school bathroom. The list even had the creepy man at the end of the street who would never give them any candy. All of them were about to be visited this Halloween night; a night they'll never forget.\r\n\r\nI Got a Rock is a purple leaning brown linear holographic polish.

They chatted on and off about the upcoming weekend but mostly kept quiet as they went from building to building. The walks usually took around 45 minutes, or an hour if Samuel, the third security guard, was working that night. Both of them hated Samuel. As they circled the third of the 6 buildings, Rhoda stopped in her tracks and pointed to a purple glow down one of the alleys across the parking lot between two of the buildings they had yet to reach on their walk. They made their way over their quickly to see what it was. Both were secretly hoping it wasn't the psychotic homeless men from last week who were drunk off of their Viper booze and trying to play keep away with Nick's hat. They reached the purple glow only to find a large puddle of a thick purple liquid all over the ground. Both were entranced by the substance as it slowly seeped from the sewer drain against the wall. Nick bent down and stuck his finger in it, slowly stirring it around while Rhonda looked on. He picked some up with his finger and licked it off. Nick was normally prone to be germaphobic but he could not resist the allure of this strange stuff all over the ground. As Nick turned to Rhonda to tell her how amazing it tasted, he began to choke up until his throat cleared just enough for him to let out a bloodcurdling scream. Nick's face began to turn red and swell until parts of it began to melt off. Rhonda watched quietly; her intense shock kept her from screaming or even moving her feet from where she stood. Nick's scream died immediately as most of his flesh fell off, followed by the dissolve of his bones until there was nothing left but his outfit. Rhonda knelt down and pushed his clothes aside so she could continue staring at the glowing liquid on the ground. She stuck her finger in it and began stirring it just as Nick has done, then pulled it up to look at it. She stopped herself from putting it in her mouth once she turned it over to see that beautiful glow of the liquid emanating from her nail. \"Hey, is everything alright over there\". Rhonda could hear Samuel walking up behind her as she continued picking up the liquid and spreading it on each of her nails. \"Come over here Samuel and have a taste of this stuff. It's delicious.\"\r\n\r\nThe Stuff is a matte rubber finish medium lavender polish with taupe micro flakies.

He was an older gentleman, balding. He had a cheap collared shirt on and khaki pants with a couple of stains on them. She could make out the tan line on his finger, where a wedding ring should have been. She knew that he screamed mini-van, so she brushed him off and waited for the next person to walk into the bar. The bartender walked by and put a drink next to her. It was lightly colored liquor with a disgusting smell and a cherry on top; something she would never order. She looked up at the bartender and asked \"what's this?\" to which he replied \"the gentleman over there bought this for you\". She turned to look at a younger man sitting a couple tables over who was flashing his pearly whites at her. She remembered him walking in earlier with a couple of other young guys. Probably a bunch of frat boys looking to get laid tonight. She smiled back and he wasted no time getting out of his seat to come sit by her at the bar. \"Sup,\" he so gracefully said. Oh yeah, she thought, definitely a frat boy. \"Hello\", Lisa replied back, then asked \"what kind of drink is this?\" He moved the drink closer to her and told her it was an Amaretto Sour, which she hated. Before Lisa could tell him to piss off, the Bro pulled out his keys and phone and set them on the counter, while he spouted off some story about his awesome keg stand skills. Her eyes widened when she saw the keys. They belonged to a 1968 Chevrolet Corvette L-88. Lisa had stolen her share of impressive vehicles, but this one was the holy grail. Lisa was focused now and ready to ditch the trust fund baby and take his car. Before the Bro could finish his story, she stopped him, picked up the keys, and told him to go tell his friends goodbye and to use the bathroom now because she lived on the other side of the city. The Bro, with smoothness similar to sandpaper, excitedly got up and ran to the bathroom. Lisa got up, put her jacket on and pulled money out for her tab and put it on the counter next to the glass of Amaretto Sour that now had a cell phone in it. She then made her way out of the bar, smiling from ear to ear once she saw the L-88 across the street.\r\n\r\nThis polish has a sky blue crelly base with holographic shimmer with various sizes and shapes of gray, silver, and blue glitter.

How may I help you today?\" Janey Glenn's summer was almost over and nearly every day of it was spent at the cursed Surly Curly's that she worked at. \"Here's your order of Chicken Thighs and Curly's Fries, sir\", she said as she handed the customer his tray of greasy food. A whole, entire summer wasted, she thought to herself. Her senior year of high school starts in less than a week and she couldn't help but thinking she was going from one hell to the next. You know what, she thought, I am going to make the best of this and everything is going to be great. She had almost a full week before school started and there were plenty of fun and exciting things she could get into before then. Just as Janey reached the end of her epiphany, Rick Morehouse came into the restaurant. Rick was the man of her dreams; her ultimate desire, and here he was about to order food from Janey and flippin' Surly Curly's. Janey was ready to die, but she remembered her new positive approach to things and greeted Rick with a smile. Rick smiled back and said \"Hey Janey, how are you\". Floored that Rick knew her name, Janey fumbled her words and could barely muster a hello. Again, she wanted to die. Rick smiled at her and placed his order, a chocolate milkshake. Janey went over to the milkshake machine to pour him one. The machine began to shake and make a loud clunking sound. Janey looked back at Rick and smiled, while elbowing it to make it stop acting up. The shaking and sounds stopped and the shake began to pour into the cup. Relieved, Janey looked at Rick to smile at him again, but when she turned back towards the machine, the spout exploded and shot milkshake all over Janey's face, covering every bit of her. Against the backdrop of laughter that flooded the restaurant, Janey refrained from looking back at Rick and just stood there quietly, reflecting over the day and the events leading up to this moment. FML, she thought, FML.\r\n\r\nThis polish has a burnt orange crelly base with various sizes and shapes of white, green, and gold glitter.

It was the middle of summer and Deb Snyder's party was the talk amongst everyone for the last two weeks and tonight was the night. Everyone was dancing and drinking and having the best time of their lives. Greg Tolan, the school dickhead, was there wearing his popular red Michael Jackson jacket he got last year after the video came out. Kenneth peaked out of the bathroom door and could see Deb down the hall in the living room, laughing and talking to friends. Kenneth was determined to tell Deb how he felt about her before summer ended and senior year started, but couldn't muster up the courage to pull himself out from hiding in the bathroom just yet. Every moment didn't feel like the right one...plus Greg was already drunk and probably looking to bash a nerd or two. Just then, the DJ put on Kenneth's song. It was the latest single \"Drive\" from The Cars; the one that makes him think of Deb every time. This was a sign, Kenneth thought to himself. It was time for him to stop being a coward and make his move....just as soon as Greg walked away. Kenneth came out of the bathroom and slowly made his way up to Deb in the middle of her living room. As he came up to her, she looked at him and smiled. \"Hello, Deb\".\r\n\r\nThis polish has a gray crelly base with holographic shimmer with various sizes and shapes of red and black glitter.

She stood up and looked around her. She had no idea where she was, but everything around her was a large canvas of vibrant colors and poetic imagery that began to bring tears of joy to Emma's eyes. She wondered if she was dead and now in an afterlife, but that brief moment of wonderment faded as she stared up to the sky as the clouds and the stars danced together. It was nothing like she had ever seen. The imagery entranced her and made her forget about all of her problems. She forgot about her dead-end job, a cheating boyfriend, and her estranged parents. She pushed it all away for this amazing landscape that seemed to go on forever and forever. \"Emma\", she heard a voice say. It was a familiar voice, one she was trying to forget about. \"EMMA\", the voice yelled at her. She knew the voice was familiar but couldn't place it. The voice was shrill and terribly annoying. She sat down on the ground to watch the sky continue to put on its show, ignoring her voice's calls. The calls began to fade as Emma closed her eyes and listened to the wind brush through her long flowing black hair. In the bright and dull office, Emma's boss stood over her. \"Emma, wake up!\". She continued sleeping on her desk, her snores drowning out the office of all its usual sounds. He pulled her head up and moved her red hair out of the way to see her face covered in drool, then quickly put her head back down. \"Why do I even bother\", her boss asked himself, walking away.\r\n\r\nThis polish has a teal green crelly base with holographic shimmer with various sizes and shapes of black, purple, and holographic glitter. It is 3-free with 4 stainless steel mixing balls (mini bottles contain 2). Larger sized glitter may require some extra patience retrieving them from the bottle. Due to the size of some glitters, settling may occur. Turning the bottle upside down for a few minutes and then shaking prior to application will help.\r\n\r\nFor opacity, the polish may require up to three coats.\r\n\r\nPicture 1 is courtesy of Polish Monster.\r\n\r\nPicture 2 is courtesy of ColorSplash Nails.\r\n\r\nPicture 3 is courtesy of Cosmetic Sanctuary.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Jake does not come with the mini polish.

The Fall of Earth. What remains of this planet is a post-apocalyptic and barren wasteland. Rampart desert stretches across all lands and the once blue oceans now flow black. Five years earlier, a supercomputer was developed linking all of our countries together to provide an intranet of sustainable energy now that peace was declared. Nobody anticipated the supercomputer to turn against us all. Nobody expected it to make our peaceful planet crumble within minutes. The computer reactivated long dormant nuclear weapons that went off at every corner of the Earth. Billions died immediately with the remaining human population scattering about the dying world. After the nuclear fallout, the computer continued to evolve into an even greater threat when it interpreted all existing human life to be contaminated and set out to destroy them. Now, very few remain save for small bands of people still hoping for our former way of life to return and even larger bands of psychotic warriors of the wasteland, having been ravaged by radiation and now bent on continuing the destruction of the world. This is our new Dystopia, a world of horror without any sort of hope......that is, until a heroine rises.\r\n\r\nDystopia is a light purple-tinted gray holo.

She was about to graduate from medical school to become an anesthesiologist. She had a boyfriend that she loved; parents, siblings, friends. Much like the world, life was nearly perfect, but even during peace, Susan had a unique side to her. An aggression scale that she kept hidden from everyone, along with a worn punching bag and even black market guns, which had long since been banned during the utopia. Now, during the Hologeddon, that charming, happy med student no longer exists. All that remains of her is the dark shadow that laid dormant during peace. She is now The Aunt, an unstoppable killing machine making her way across the wasteland towards the supercomputer and hellbent on destroying it once and for all. The Aunt is mere miles away from the main computer base before a gang of marauders come out of hiding and begin circling her. These once peaceful people, now vicious mutations that dabble in cannibalism, begin to close in on The Aunt, unaware of the violence and bloodshed that is about to fall on them.\r\n\r\nMarauders is a grayed copper holo.

She kept herself hidden from the robotic aircraft and tanks that guarded the base of the computer. As The Aunt came closer to the base, all of the aircraft and tanks started moving away from the area.....then silence. Before The Aunt could make her next move, the metallic ground began to shake and open up. As the opening grew larger, robotic tentacles began slithering out by the dozens, their ends equipped with large clamps. It was the mobile form of the supercomputer that people would tell stories of. Many had always referred to it as the Holocaust Spider, but The Aunt knew what it really was; the ED-209. As The Aunt pulled the Atom Destroyer from the gun latch on her back, one of the tentacles came crashing down on the ground next to her, with others coming towards her. The Atom Destroyer was only a single-shot with a 30-second recharge, so she knew this one shot needed to count. She began running towards the ED-209, narrowly avoiding all of the tentacles trying to annihilate her. As she closed in, she could make out the ED-209's mainframe. She raised the Atom Destroyer, aimed it at the mainframe, and took the shot.\r\n\r\nED-209 is a silver holo. It is full sized (15 mL) and is available as a 7 mL mini. The polishes are 3-Free.

The Aunt sat on the ground against the wall of crumbled building from the old world. She had a giant gash on the side of her stomach that she was trying to stop from bleeding. The sun was slowly beginning to rise and light up the dead city. The Aunt could see small groups of people begin to come out from hiding just over the horizon. She slowly began loading her guns again just in case they turned out to be cannibals. Now that the supercomputer was destroyed, can we re-evolve back into the world we once were? Can we go back to that same way of life? Probably not. Everything has changed. The world has changed and so has our way of life. Either way, The Aunt knew we were about to enter a new era. Whether it was good or bad was anyone's guess. Susan looked down at her wound that was still bleeding and pushed down harder on the cut to try and stop it. She started to feel drowsy, but kept alert as the people approached closer. She started to think about her family, then her boyfriend.

She had been babysitting him for several months now and this was the one of the few nights she was able to get him to fall asleep early enough for her to get in some serious study time. Rebecca quickly went downstairs, poured a late night bowl of Lucky Charms, and began ready through her Chemistry book. Before she could get too involved, the phone rang. She picked it up, only to hear silence on the other end. After a couple of unanswered hello's, she hung up the phone. After half an hour passed by, another phone call. \"Hello\", Rebecca said to silence again. \"This isn't funny, Paul\" she said, already accusing her boyfriend. Again, only silence. It wasn't until the third phone call another half an hour later when Rebecca heard loud breathing on the other end. \"You're starting to piss me off, Paul\" Rebecca said angrily. \"This isn't Paul\", the voice finally whispered, startling Rebecca. \"Who is this\", she asked. \"Oh, just a friend of the family\", the voice said. \"Well, the Robertson's aren't home right now. Can I take a message\", she asked the stranger. \"That won't be necessary. I only want to talk to you,\" he whispered again. \"I can barely hear you, why are you whispering,\" Rebecca asked with noticeable concern in her voice. \"Because I'm right next to Tommy and I don't want to wake him up.\"\r\n\r\nThis polish has a white base with various sizes, shapes, and colors of glitter.

The moment finally arrived on this breezy Friday night. Gloria and her date, Scott, had left the drive-in theatre a little early to get a good spot overlooking their hometown. The moon and stars lit up the skies and Gloria could not have imagined a better moment, though Scott could've been a little less of a cheapskate. He opted to bring a whole box of Frosted Flakes to eat out of during the movie instead of popcorn and soda. Still, the night was going great. As Scott began to unbutton her blouse, Gloria heard the sound of small branches on the ground snapping. \"What was that\" she frantically asked her date. Without even looking outside of the car, Scott smiled and assured her it was nothing. He slid back over to continue kissing on her and then another sound emitted from outside the car. Gloria pushed him back and asked if he had heard the new sound. \"Baby, it's ok, there's nothing out there\", he said, trying to assure her again. It was at that moment, before Gloria could even respond when she watched the large machete crash through the vinyl roof of Scott's convertible and into his head.\r\n\r\nThis polish has a off-white base with various sizes and shapes of white glitter.

Giselle was an escort, one that was very appreciated at her job. She didn't mind the negative aura an escort had, especially with all of the money she took home from it. She was perfectly fine with doing it day in and day out, getting done at the wee hours of the morning and going home to eat a bowl of Apple Jacks without even batting an eye. The mere thought of cereal was already getting her excited so much that she nearly missed the strange whistling behind her. Giselle turned around quickly, startled. There was nobody around. She called out \"hello\", but there was only silence. She shrugged and continued walking, wishing she had remembered to bring her Ipod for the walk home. The whistling started again and she stopped. She turned and there was only darkness save for the few streetlights that lit up empty sidewalks and closed businesses. \"This isn't funny\" she said. Giselle stood there, staring intently at the darkness that surrounded her, hoping her mind was playing tricks on her.

She could feel all of the watchful eyes and quiet whisperings as she made her way through this desolate town, into the only grocery store, and onward towards her mission. Maria had inherited a strange Victorian house just outside of Sommer Grove, encapsulated deep in what seemed like a never-ending forest. Maria instantly felt uneasy as she entered the house. There was a chill in the air that made all of the cobwebs on the walls and furniture dance slowly. Maria walked into the kitchen and uncovered the large bay window to let some much needed light into the house. She set her one back of groceries down and pulled out her milk and a box of Corn Pops, her favorite dinner. She sat down at the kitchen table and poured her bowl of cereal, all while contemplating her next move. Unfortunately, Maria was completely unaware of the masked figure in the other room, hiding in the shadows and quietly watching her eat her cereal.\r\n\r\nThis polish has a white base with various sizes and shapes of yellow glitter.

She stopped the car near one of the few remaining pay phones left in town. The first rule is to never have a hot car out in the open and standing still for too long, but she didn't care. She needed to call him to tell him how she felt. She wanted to pick him up and drive through the night, down the hills. She picked up the phone and dialed the number and it rang.

She popped out momentarily to stare out into the city landscape of Atlanta. It was the night of her 10 year high school reunion and her first time back since graduation. She knew only a select group of people had RSVP'd to the event and nearly all of them were the same people who constantly made fun of her. Fat Clara they called. Oh, how original. Now, 10 years later, nearly 80 pounds had disappeared. So did the outdated haircut and her poor choice of clothes. She looked up at the mirror hanging over the hotel desk and wondered if her new transformation would turn heads tonight. Those same heads that ridiculed her all four years. Clara decided that she was ready to face her fate straight on and as she tucked away the sharpened brass knuckles into her purse, she hoped that those former classmates were ready to face their own.\r\n\r\nConvergence is a reddish plum purple holographic polish.

What happened at their individual bases is a mystery but it didn't matter now. The two had found each other and knew they could be safe with one another. The snowstorm they were in had worsened though and both were frantically trying to keep each other warm while they searched for shelter in the bleak, wintery landscape.

A young woman was walking along, oblivious to the world thanks to the distraction of the music she was listening to on her phone, which she was texting on as well. She looked up briefly only to lock eyes with a young man walking in her direction about 20 feet away. She smiled at him and he smiled back. The man was gorgeous and he could not take his eyes of her, which she quietly became excited about. She couldn't help but feel sexier at the thought. With that and the music flowing through her ears, her confidence began to skyrocket. As they closed in on each other, she could not anticipate the car that drove too close to the massive rain puddle next to her, causing a wave of dirty water to wash over her. She was stunned but that was only second to the embarrassment that came over her as she could see the man turn to walk the other direction, as well as hear his not-so-stifled bouts of laughter over what he had just seen.\r\n\r\nAsymptote is a green holographic polish.
