But, these kits are larger (from 4\" hoop to a 5\", which = more stars!) and on a darker blue cotton fabric.\r\n\r\nOrion, the hunter, is one of most easily recognizable constellations, because of his bright \"belt\" of stars. Each pattern is a true representation of the stars in the night sky and pre-printed for you so you can start stitching right away. No transferring or tracing needed!\r\n\r\nThis kit gives you everything you need to complete a 5\" diameter Orion Constellation Embroidery...\r\n\r\nKIT INCLUDES\r\n+ Simple instructions with stitch guide\r\n+ ONE pre-printed Orion pattern on cotton fabric\r\n+ embroidery needle\r\n+ one full skein of yellow DMC cotton embroidery thread (If you'd like white thread instead- just let me know!)\r\n+ 5\" wooden embroidery hoop\r\n\r\nLEVEL:\r\nSome embroidery experience would be good for this kit, but is not necessary.\r\n\r\nPROJECT TIME\r\nThis project is one to take your time with. You can get lost making little french knots and stars. Approximate time varies, but to complete the pre-printed pattern can take a few hours.\r\n\r\nJessica Marquez, Miniature Rhino","options":[{"id":42819993,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123842346/-/orion-constellation-kit-miniaturerhino.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123842346/-/orion-constellation-kit-miniaturerhino.jpg","width":570,"height":457}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":13131750,"name":"woodgrain tag necklace","permalink":"woodgrain-tag-necklace","position":3,"price":46.0,"default_price":46.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/woodgrain-tag-necklace","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-23T15:17:21.000Z","description":"cast recycled silver woodgrain tag from old barn door | 16\" sterling ball chain\r\n\r\nJacque Schiller, triggerhappy","options":[{"id":41912865,"name":"Default","price":46.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123203880/-/triggerhappy-woodgrain-tag-necklace.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123203880/-/triggerhappy-woodgrain-tag-necklace.JPG","width":674,"height":675}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":13131453,"name":"oakes salvage framed photograph","permalink":"oakes-salvage-photograph","position":4,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/oakes-salvage-photograph","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-23T14:58:51.000Z","description":"While driving through Vermont this roadside junk shop sign caught my eye.
