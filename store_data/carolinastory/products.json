This will be a dream come true for us. The 2 new tunes are called \"Gold\" & \"Hotel Memphis\". \"Hotel Memphis\" was written by our good friend, Nick Redmond of Star & Micey. This is the first song we have ever recorded that is not our own. We wrote \"Gold\" in our basement a short time after tracking the album so it was left out of the initial line-up. We think you are going to love these 2 new additions to the album! The whole album has also been completely re-mastered! \r\n\r\nWith that being said, we are making the \"Home\" - (Deluxe Edition) vinyl available at this time. Your order will include a 12\" vinyl of the 8 songs on \"Home\" + 2 new tracks, \"Gold\" & \"Hotel Memphis\" along with a digital download card including all 10 tracks so you can have the mp3's of the songs. We can't wait to to get these to you! Thanks! \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Home\" (Deluxe Edition) VINYL\r\n--------------------------\r\n1. Carry Me Home\r\n2. The Morning Bird\r\n3. Help, Help Me\r\n4.
