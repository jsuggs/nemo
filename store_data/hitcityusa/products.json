Her work deals with a diverse array of subject matter including tragic pop culture figures, claustrophobic beach/crowd scenes and strange figures distorted through bodies of water. Hannah is almost obsessive in her ever-present need to draw. She's filled countless sketchbooks with studies of her surroundings, tours, friends/family and imaginary landscapes. As a member of Grouplove, Hannah has also taken on the role of art director for the band. Her work adorns virtually all of the albums, posters, merch and even the costume and stage design. The frenetic energy of her mark making and line-work echoes the inspired and frenzied performances of the group. \r\n\r\n'I can never sit still' -Hannah Hooper\r\n\r\nAfter graduating with a BFA from Parson's School of Design, Hannah cut her teeth in New York's Lower East Side art scene during the 2000s, rubbing elbows with some of today's most notable younger contemporary artists. In 2007, with Christian Zucchoni at her side, Hannah travelled to Crete for an intensive painting residency, where they soon met the other members of what would become Grouplove. Hannah now resides in LA, plays music with Grouplove and maintains a robust and multi-faceted studio practice on and off tour.</em>\r\n\r\nThese high quality digital prints are 11\" x 14\", hand signed by the artist and numbered out of 25. \r\n\r\nPlease allow a month for delivery of framed prints.

His work, reminiscent of vague childhood memories and adolescent fantasies, utilizes photography, collage and mixed media to create strong contextual pieces which are both appealing and alarming to the audience. When his works are viewed as a whole, his obsessions become evident—marble surfaces, hoop dreams, deconstructed portraits of quick-to-rise idols, and the overdone opulence associated with mid-90s celebrity athletes, executed in a manner that often exudes a sense of darkness within its message.</em>\r\n\r\nThese high quality digital prints are 11\" x 14\", hand signed by the artist and numbered out of 25. \r\n\r\nPlease allow a month for delivery of framed prints.

Her work deals with a diverse array of subject matter including tragic pop culture figures, claustrophobic beach/crowd scenes and strange figures distorted through bodies of water. Hannah is almost obsessive in her ever-present need to draw. She's filled countless sketchbooks with studies of her surroundings, tours, friends/family and imaginary landscapes. As a member of Grouplove, Hannah has also taken on the role of art director for the band. Her work adorns virtually all of the albums, posters, merch and even the costume and stage design. The frenetic energy of her mark making and line-work echoes the inspired and frenzied performances of the group. \r\n\r\n'I can never sit still' -Hannah Hooper\r\n\r\nAfter graduating with a BFA from Parson's School of Design, Hannah cut her teeth in New York's Lower East Side art scene during the 2000s, rubbing elbows with some of today's most notable younger contemporary artists. In 2007, with Christian Zucchoni at her side, Hannah travelled to Crete for an intensive painting residency, where they soon met the other members of what would become Grouplove. Hannah now resides in LA, plays music with Grouplove and maintains a robust and multi-faceted studio practice on and off tour.</em>","options":[{"id":50184705,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129092892/-/hassanh.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129092892/-/hassanh.jpg","width":779,"height":1246},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129067395/-/hh-mixtape.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129067395/-/hh-mixtape.jpg","width":1000,"height":667}],"artists":[{"id":257541,"name":"Hannah Hooper","permalink":"hannah-hooper","url":"/artist/hannah-hooper"}],"categories":[{"id":6859203,"name":"Tape","permalink":"tape","url":"/category/tape"}]},{"id":15430509,"name":"Nil Ultra: Screamin' Jay Bone's Last American Mix Tape Sessions Gold Edition Volume 01 Episode 01","permalink":"nils-ultra-screamin-jay-bone-s-last-american-mix-tape-sessions-gold-edition-volume-01-episode-01","position":19,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nils-ultra-screamin-jay-bone-s-last-american-mix-tape-sessions-gold-edition-volume-01-episode-01","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-09T06:29:43.000Z","description":"With Hit City U.S.A.'s \"Nice Touch\" mix tape series, we bring our best friends onboard to put their magic touch to cassette.
