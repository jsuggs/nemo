Each print is an edition of 5.  They are printed on a heavier parchment paper and are 35 by 23 in., so pretty big.  Because of the small scale run I'm also able to paint directly on each print.  So each print is a bit different and an original in it's own right.  This also means the print you get might have some slight variations from the one pictured (mainly in the bright red ink overlay).  All come signed and numbered.
