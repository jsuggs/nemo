Like his recent Spotify Sessions with The Shins, Father John Misty, Poliça, and Tennis, among others, the label will be entirely curated by Eno. He will also produce and engineer each release, with a focus on sonic quality. Public Hi-Fi Records is designed to be an outlet for unsigned artists he’s recorded, and as a means to issue special pressings of previously unreleased tracks from his array of artist sessions. All releases will be on limited edition 12-inch vinyl with accompanying high quality digital downloads.","options":[{"id":48481857,"name":"Default","price":28.8,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":26.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127821024/-/PHFbundle.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127821024/-/PHFbundle.jpg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127821015/-/Dupree_Album_Cover_Web-Res.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127821015/-/Dupree_Album_Cover_Web-Res.jpg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127821033/-/sondreLerche.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127821033/-/sondreLerche.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":171719,"name":"Dupree","permalink":"dupree","url":"/artist/dupree"},{"id":224781,"name":"Public Hi-Fi Sessions","permalink":"public-hi-fi-sessions","url":"/artist/public-hi-fi-sessions"}],"categories":[{"id":4514057,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":12907359,"name":"Public Hi-Fi Sessions 01 - Sondre Lerche","permalink":"public-hi-fi-sessions-01-sondre-lerche","position":2,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/public-hi-fi-sessions-01-sondre-lerche","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-11T20:07:08.000Z","description":"Release Date:  29 November 2013 (Black Friday)\r\n\r\nSondre Lerche’s ‘Rejection #5’ is the first of the Public Hi-Fi Sessions single series, produced by Spoon’s Jim Eno and released by his Public Hi-Fi Records.  The song and B-side “Screen Door” were recorded straight to 2” tape and mixed at Eno’s Austin, TX studio, then mastered directly to acetate from the ½\" mix tapes.  While “Rejection #5” is a song the Norwegian singer/songwriter tinkered with for nearly 10 years before finally recording it here, “Screen Door” came together just a couple months prior to Lerche’s impromptu sessions with Eno (who also drums on both tracks). The 180 gram black vinyl’s custom packaging includes gold and black silk-screened artwork, and each 12” comes with a high quality digital download card.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"280\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/117677658&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=false\"></iframe><br><br>\r\n℗ 2013 Public Hi-Fi Records, All Rights Reserved.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<iframe width=\"280\" height=\"158\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/RAOknLXt9AM?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","options":[{"id":41158140,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.55,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.25,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124521066/-/publichifi-01-sondreLerche-TN.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124521066/-/publichifi-01-sondreLerche-TN.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":224781,"name":"Public Hi-Fi Sessions","permalink":"public-hi-fi-sessions","url":"/artist/public-hi-fi-sessions"}],"categories":[{"id":4514057,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":9190154,"name":"Nuestro Camino - Vinyl","permalink":"nuestro-camino-vinyl-pre-order","position":3,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nuestro-camino-vinyl-pre-order","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-28T23:28:11.000Z","description":"This is the first release from the Jim Eno imprint, Public Hi-Fi Records.\r\n\r\nDupree have played and learned from the masters of the B3 trio art form.
