The band have also had recent support slots with Johnny Foreigner and Twin Atlantic and have a summer of festivals planned such as Kendal Calling, The Great Escape and 2000 trees to name a few. This indie quintet have also had tracks featured on Skins, Gavin and Stacey as well as the soundtrack to the recent ‘Killing Bono’ film. Never mind the hype, big things are already happening for this band. Joining Stagecoach will be Canada’s next big thing ‘Bravestation’ on their first UK tour, who are already making waves throughout the UK with their Foals-esque sounds as well as Sheffield’s finest ‘Smugglers Run' and 'Russian Dolls' as well as Hertfordshire rockers ‘Scholars’. \r\n\r\n// LIVE BANDS //\r\n\r\nSTAGECOACH\r\n(http://www.facebook.com/stagecoachuk)\r\n\r\nBRAVESTATION\r\n(http://www.facebook.com/Bravestation)\r\n\r\nSMUGGLERS RUN\r\n(http://www.facebook.com/pages/Smugglers-Run/24009336072)\r\n\r\nRUSSIAN DOLLS\r\n(http://www.myspace.com/russiandollmusic)\r\n\r\nSCHOLARS\r\n(http://www.facebook.com/scholars)\r\n\r\n\r\n// Tickets £4 - available from //\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ticketweb.co.uk/user/?region=gb_northeast&query=detail&event=445125&interface\r\n\r\nhttps://www.wegottickets.com/event/116930\r\n\r\n£5 On The Door.\r\n\r\nhttp://honeybadgerpromotions.info/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=168731953184518","options":[{"id":12502304,"name":"Default","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36351762/-/Press_Pic_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36351762/-/Press_Pic_1.jpg","width":720,"height":480}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1980900,"name":"Tickets","permalink":"tickets","url":"/category/tickets"}]},{"id":1837021,"name":"New Smugglers 2-Gun Tee.","permalink":"new-smugglers-2-gun-tee","position":2,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/new-smugglers-2-gun-tee","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-03-05T05:50:27.000Z","description":"The most recent t-shirt fresh from the Sheffield sweatshop!","options":[{"id":6670041,"name":"Small","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":6670201,"name":"Medium","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":6670211,"name":"Large","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":6670221,"name":"Xlarge","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.99,"amount_with_others":0.99,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.99,"amount_with_others":1.49}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/17578181/-/TSHIRT.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/17578181/-/TSHIRT.jpg","width":876,"height":776}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1135511,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]}]
