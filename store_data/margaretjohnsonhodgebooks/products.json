In the best selling sequel \"This Time\", it seemed that they didn't possess enough of the emotional glue to do that. But life has a way of following it's own rules and we see how much in book three -\"Tumbled\".  \r\n\r\nThe pursuit of happiness hasn't changed for Dajah or Rick. As \"Tumbled' opens, we see just how true that is. But love isn't simple or easy. It's messy, complicated, rule bending, but more importantly - life changing. It will have you doing what you swore you never would do and looking in directions you promised yourself you wouldn't ever look again.\r\n\r\nWith all the twists and turns and ring true-to-life drama that Margaret Johnson-Hodge is well known for, \"Tumbled\" takes the reader on another amazing journey about getting what we all want:  love - pure, simple, genuine but more importantly, real. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~ TRADE PAPERBACK\r\n   \r\n\r\n                      ","options":[{"id":40320186,"name":"Default","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":35.0,"country":{"id":55,"name":"Aruba","code":"AW"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122042580/-/TUMBLED__FINAL.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122042580/-/TUMBLED__FINAL.jpg","width":3931,"height":5850}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5863431,"name":"Novels","permalink":"novels","url":"/category/novels"}]},{"id":13554570,"name":"This Time","permalink":"this-time","position":2,"price":13.99,"default_price":13.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/this-time","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-09-14T03:15:42.000Z","description":"                                   FIRST EDITION SIGNED COPY!\r\n\r\n\r\nDajah Moore gave everything she had to save her relationship between herself and Rick.
