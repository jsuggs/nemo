Descendents of that early 90s Perth scene - Benji, Baked, Chapter Music, and especially O - and proof that \"regional sounds\" still exist.\r\n\r\nDrum Music said: \r\n\r\n\"Screeching feedback welcomes their vinyl debut and when twangy guitar, muffled vocals and thrashing drums combine to make a wall of noise, it's clear that Frozen Ocean's gritty no-frills punk is bets delivered through a format just as raw.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n300 copies on multi coloured vinyl. Each record is a different colour; if you order more than one, I'll send each copy on a different base colour (i.e. one red with black streaks, one yellow with green streaks). They range from quite solid primary colours to very wild looking \"oystered\" white, peacock feather green...\r\n\r\nReview from YellowGreenRed: \r\n\r\n\"Frozen Ocean seems like a name fit for a bearded metal-core outfit, not whatever this demented band is. All the better to surprise me, then, as First Fucking Vynil (their spelling, not mine) is about as raw and psychotic as hardcore-punk can get. I’m reminded of some sort of unholy mix of White Load and Exit Hippies, but with a slight touch of the blues… and maybe a little black metal? It sounds like a complete mess, and it certainly is, but Frozen Ocean are downright captivating in the way that they make rock music sound like the worst crime a person can commit. I am imagining a world where fans of Meatshits and Rupture (musically, not lyrically) can join up with beer-drinking Homostupids fans and abuse metal riffs together. And I’m pretty sure Frozen Ocean are a two-piece! Clearly, wonders never cease with these wackos.\"\r\n\r\n<object height=\"225\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2679376&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_playcount=true&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;color=580905\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2679376&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_playcount=true&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;color=580905\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>   <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/coffin-cut-records/sets/frozen-ocean-coffin-cut\">Frozen Ocean, Coffin Cut Records #7 (7\")</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/coffin-cut-records\">Coffin Cut Records</a></span>","options":[{"id":24400074,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.8,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/77157864/-/20121106_224539.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/77157864/-/20121106_224539.jpg","width":427,"height":450},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/77157894/-/20121106_224605.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/77157894/-/20121106_224605.jpg","width":432,"height":443},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75904404/-/distro190.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75904404/-/distro190.jpg","width":967,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75904452/-/distro191.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75904452/-/distro191.jpg","width":1000,"height":961}],"artists":[{"id":142561,"name":"AUSTRALIAN RELEASE","permalink":"australian-release","url":"/artist/australian-release"},{"id":170567,"name":"COFFIN CUT RELEASE","permalink":"coffin-cut-release","url":"/artist/coffin-cut-release"}],"categories":[{"id":1083171,"name":"7\" vinyl","permalink":"7-vinyl","url":"/category/7-vinyl"}]},{"id":13758078,"name":"Deathcage / Unknown to God 12\" red vinyl version (Coffin Cut #9)","permalink":"deathcage-unknown-to-god-12-red-vinyl-version-coffin-cut-9","position":4,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/deathcage-unknown-to-god-12-red-vinyl-version-coffin-cut-9","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-24T14:27:27.000Z","description":"This is the red vinyl edition of the Deathcage / Unknown to God split 12\".

Unknown to God, former members of Omnicide, Subversion, Noisam, Beastianity, Twin City Faction and Frank Rizzo.\r\n\r\nLive, they give the violent, conversionist performances these end times deserve: both bands bleed for the cause (as may you), and are heavily influenced by the Japanese masters of these dark arts - Deathside, Crow, Crude, Bastard, and Zouo (as you should also be).\r\n\r\nThere are also embroidered Deathcage patches for some of these copies.

The regular version, without.\r\n\r\nThe Sleeping Shaman says:\r\n\r\nWith the multitude of labels and bands sprouting up around the world, it’s easy to forget that slow was once very uncool. In the Nineties as in the Eighties, fast was the done thing in the underground as in the mainstream. There were no labels dedicated to the release and distribution of slow music (apart from Germany’s Hellhound records…), and so it was that many pivotal figures of the heavy music that we love so much today found temporary housing with punk/grind labels. Vitus were signed to SST (although Ginn never really signed any band that stuck to conventions or formula), and Burning Witch’s first 12” was put out by powerviolence supremos Slap-A-Ham. What may initially seem as an odd pairing in actual fact made a lot of sense where the misanthropy and politics were involved. After all, ultra-fast or ultra-slow, the music was made by disenfranchised individuals on the fringes of society and scene, steadfastly doing whatever the fuck they pleased in the face of indifference and ridicule. And so, Corrupted released a slew of splits with grind bands (my first exposure to the likes of Cripple Bastards!) and Eyehategod shared wax with Anal Cunt (OK, perhaps a slightly more obvious pairing!).\r\n \r\nTherefore, this 5” comes as a welcome throwback to the days when fast and slow spat in the face of society together – in fact, when I first mentioned this release to Lee Shaman for inclusion on this site, he expressed surprise that Suppression were still about!  As it turns out, they still are (as a duo?), but this split was originally meant to have been released in 1998, and the material dates from around that time. Noothgrush have recently reformed and are playing sporadic dates on both sides of the Atlantic, and the Fuck Yoga /Southern Lord reissues have done much to jog our collective memories into remembering  just how good they were. I’m of the opinion that bone-headed negativity will only get you so far, and Noothgrush’s keen social conscience always rendered them a cut above, and the savage two minutes of “Flee From Hunger And Disease” re-affirm their unmatched power, in lyrics as with the riffs. A brooding lament on mankind’s tendency to violent Xenophobia, I wish I could declare this a dated relic, but sadly the theme is all too relevant, if anything more pertinent in an age where ultra-Conservatism is gaining momentum and threatening  immigrant populations as a solution to economic woes. Musically, the song is vintage Noothgrush, starting out with a mid-paced riff that sounds like a slowed-down form of the hardcore that influenced them, before taking the pace down again to the tortured and unrelenting plod of DOOM METAL.\r\n \r\nSuppression manage to fit two songs into just over a minute (!) the first being a skree of noise reminiscent of Masonna at his most unlistenable (and brilliant), before launching into a mere 40 seconds of furious grind that is a beautiful chaos of drums, chainsaw guitars and massive rolling basslines. Unpleasant listening of the best kind. Methinks I shall have to get me the Suppression discography CD that Blow The Reactors (the other label involved in this split) has in stock; I was only aware of this band through their having done a split with sludge titans Grief (there’s that fast/slow juxtaposition again!), so this is a welcome introduction. There’s not really much else to say about this release! If you’re reading this, you probably know the score, it’s Noothgrush and is therefore an essential purchase, the artwork , presentation (if you’re into such nonsense you can get an edition that comes with a nifty puzzle) and music are all absolutely perfect and guaranteed to stick in your brain longer than most punk/sludge being churned out of late.

Coffin Cut's 6th release. One sided 12\", 300 copies only.\r\n\r\n6 songs, themed around the cycles of mental illness. The black dog chases its tail. Bleak, savage hardcore punk from the edge of Australia.\r\n\r\nRecorded by Adam Findlay. Mastered by Jack Control (World Burns to Death) at Enormous Door. Mixed by Brad Boatright (From Ashes Rise) at Audiosiege. Backing vocals by Brad Boatright. All art and layout by Brvce (copsmakegoodtargets.blogspot.com.au).\r\n\r\nInternational wholesale and trades available directly from Coffin Cut (minimum 5 copies). All domestic wholesale directly from the band.\r\n\r\nReview from YellowGreenRed:\r\n\r\nDog begins with a sociopathic spoken-word piece, the sort of thing Condominium and Cult Ritual loved bothering generic hardcore kids with, and it fits this one-sided 12″ nicely – Negative Reinforcement are pure hardcore and partially nuts. It blasts right into a gnarly grind part, broken down with back-up death vocals, eventually transitioning into a heavy Mind Eraser mosh riff. What’s not to like? Negative Reinforcement is a pretty generic name, but they manage to make hardcore truly sound bleak and destructive through these seven tracks. I never quite know where they’re gonna take me, like if they’re gonna try to whip up a Die Kreuzen-ish storm, mosh like they’re Darkside NYC or dirge through the dirt like Cult Ritual used to. Real good stuff, to the point where I wish the b-side had something my stylus could stick to. From the loss of close family members through murder to the disappointment of receiving socks instead of toys for Christmas, Negative Reinforcement speak to all levels of frustrated rage.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F57855244&show_artwork=true\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":21294981,"name":"Default","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":15.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65752325/-/20120714_131529.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65752325/-/20120714_131529.jpg","width":480,"height":465},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65752349/-/20120714_131540.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65752349/-/20120714_131540.jpg","width":510,"height":484}],"artists":[{"id":142561,"name":"AUSTRALIAN RELEASE","permalink":"australian-release","url":"/artist/australian-release"},{"id":170567,"name":"COFFIN CUT RELEASE","permalink":"coffin-cut-release","url":"/artist/coffin-cut-release"}],"categories":[{"id":3452591,"name":"12\" single sided","permalink":"12-single-sided","url":"/category/12-single-sided"}]},{"id":8877335,"name":"Error s/t cassette (hardshell snapcase edition or regular edition)","permalink":"error-s-t-cassette-hardshell-snapcase-edition","position":44,"price":5.5,"default_price":5.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/error-s-t-cassette-hardshell-snapcase-edition","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-10T15:46:31.000Z","description":"<iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1368380970/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"http://erroria.bandcamp.com/album/error\">Error by Error</a></iframe>\r\n\r\nThese copies are the last of the hardshell snapcase edition: a repurposed thick plastic case with handmade inserts.

Parts surface the melody riffed, guitar-driven hardcore of their classic 1980s records, but fumble a little in their complexity and a modern recording that doesn’t ever seem to pull a cohesive direction to the attack. The bass plunks, the drums hammer, and the vocals have a really uneven delivery. Add in all the different influences—from modern metal to classic ’77 style moves—and it’s just slightly off and sort of just rambles and stews. But you know what? RATTUS were fan-fucking-tastic in LA, and are still one of the world’s greatest punk bands. Ever. So I’ll keep spinning this—like any of their diehard fans—to try to glean their inspiration. Lyrics are Finnish with no translation. On the flip, Riverside, CA’s HOLOKAUST delivers three solid, meaty standard issue DISCHARGE blasts. These tracks distinguish themselves in the basic, wadded up crunch that the guitars get in their semi-lo-fi recording—a recording akin to the happy accidents of ’90s crust records, as opposed to a current intentionally lo-fi noise fest. The drums sturdily roll around this thick, dumpy chunk of simple riffs, as the vocals blast standard issue punk declarations over the din “Brainwashed into Submission!” “Waves of Fire! Mushroom cloud! Incinerated!” making for a familiarly satisfying, two fingers in the air, dose of good punk rock fun. \r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/u5loMScDzMU?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","options":[{"id":23094547,"name":"Default","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.8,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71559803/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71559803/-/300.jpg","width":199,"height":199}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1083171,"name":"7\" vinyl","permalink":"7-vinyl","url":"/category/7-vinyl"}]},{"id":7160707,"name":"Hatewaves \"The Tombs\" 5\"","permalink":"hatewaves-the-tombs-5","position":53,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/hatewaves-the-tombs-5","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-09-05T18:13:03.000Z","description":"OK, so the bloke on the cover is trying to look tough but is blighted with the kind of haircut I'd expect on a five year old boy.
