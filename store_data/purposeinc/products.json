A minimalists version of an iconic symbol. The design was an attempt to capture the look and feel of relaxation. By removing extraneous patterns and ornate fillers, we created a chair that is as beautiful as it is functional. Rocking chairs are not about the loud energetic things in life, they are for the reflective times. The design echoes that calm refined moment when you get to just sit and think. Whether it be a spring time afternoon nap or a 2 am feeding of a hungry newborn. The Rokur will not distract from what matters. \r\n\r\nRokur seen here in Brazilian cherry. Also offered with seat and/or back cushions at an additional charge.\r\n\r\ndims.\r\n22_31_34\r\n\r\nPlease contact for pricing.
