This is a very impressive, worship-orientated debut album. If you enjoy new, up and coming Christian UK songwriters then I think this songsmith is one to watch. Mr Crompton has written some very good songs bristling with strong melodies and memorable imagery. Likewise, session-seasoned producer Howard Williams really has caught the essence of Ali's songs and has produced a very pleasing debut album.  I really recommend you consider this to add to your worship music collection.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":826539,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1211427/-/lap.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1211427/-/lap.jpg","width":100,"height":100}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":167100,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":183644,"name":"IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT - Richard Bradbury","permalink":"its-the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it-richard-bradbury","position":4,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/its-the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it-richard-bradbury","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-11-13T21:21:38.000Z","description":"The opening years of this decade have been typified by terrorist atrocities such as 9/11; wars in places like Afghanistan and Iraq; starvation and disease in Africa; natural disasters such as the Tsunami and the earthquakes in Turkey and Pakistan. For the Christian, none of these should be a surprise. They are the ‘signs of the times’, Jesus himself described events such as these as ‘the beginning of birth pangs’ which point to His Second Coming. This book has been written as a guide to the end time prophecies in the Bible in order that the reader may understand events such as the Rapture, the Millennium, the judgement of the nations and Israel and decipher mysterious personalities such as the beast, the antichrist and the false prophet as the return of Christ draws near.","options":[{"id":826576,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1211547/-/end_of_the_world.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1211547/-/end_of_the_world.jpg","width":448,"height":648}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":167101,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":189410,"name":"DONATION","permalink":"donation","position":5,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/donation","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-11-22T23:48:02.000Z","description":"If you don't want to buy anything and just want to donate to the work then just click the link","options":[{"id":849184,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1270651/-/piggy_bank.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1270651/-/piggy_bank.jpg","width":300,"height":225}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
