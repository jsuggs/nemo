The only people disputing that claim are people who don't live in Oregon. And those people do not get to vote in this. So Oregon wins.\r\n\r\nThis shirt is the definition of Made Here. It is printed on a Heather Lieutenant (a combo of heather grey and a subtle amount of green) American Apparel 50/50 shirt (California). It is designed by me, a guy from Portland, OR. It is printed by hand in Vancouver, WA on a Riley Hopkins press (Washington) using black International Coatings inks (California) through a Ryonet screen (Washington) coated with CCI emulsion (California). There is nothing about this shirt that is not from the west coast, and for that reason, I know you'll love it.\r\n\r\nThe American Apparel BB401 is a unisex 50% cotton, 50% polyester tee and won't shrink much, if at all. We suggest washing on cold and drying on low heat to maintain its size. \r\n\r\nAs with most American Apparel shirts, it fits slimmer and closer to the body than typical tees. I normally wear a large, and in AA shirts I stick with large. But if you like your shirts a bit roomier, go one size up.

Should anyone challenge that way of life, I suggest that we do everything we can in order to defend her honor.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of Portland's war against the aggressors from the north, I offer you a challenge: are you brave enough to stand up and say \"enough is enough; we are tired of you bum-ass Seattle supporters and your bum-ass friends coming into our town and wasting our time with your bum-ass antics\"? If so, I applaud you.\r\n\r\nIt is time to show your support for our city, and you can do so while also supporting a great local organization.\r\n\r\nThe Defend Portland RCTID Shirt will only be made if we sell 10 of them by November 20.

We will either refund your money, or give you a choice of another shirt from our store. \r\n\r\nOh, and regardless of the outcome of this, we will give $10 from every Defend Portland RCTID Shirt we sell to Goals for Girls, an organization we have worked closely with and will continue to support as long as we possibly can. Even if we do not meet the minimum quantity of 10, you are helping support young women on a mission to change the lives of girls in India!\r\n\r\nThese are printed on the soft and stylish Anvil 980 tees.

They fit a bit slimmer than the Gildans we also sell, but you can still order your regular size.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of this deal, please be patient as you may order before we have met our minimum; in order to get the shirt faster, spread the word and get your friends to pick one up!","options":[{"id":47547474,"name":"Men's Small","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47547477,"name":"Men's Medium","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47547480,"name":"Men's Large","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47547483,"name":"Men's XL","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47547486,"name":"Men's 2XL","price":22.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":47547489,"name":"Men's 3XL","price":22.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":47547492,"name":"Women's Small","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47547495,"name":"Women's Medium","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47547498,"name":"Women's Large","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47547501,"name":"Women's XL","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127140150/-/Good_Full.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127140150/-/Good_Full.JPG","width":2304,"height":3072},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127140132/-/Good_Zoom.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127140132/-/Good_Zoom.JPG","width":2304,"height":3072}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5857518,"name":"Made Here","permalink":"made-here","url":"/category/made-here"},{"id":5008345,"name":"I-5 Rivals","permalink":"i-5-rivals","url":"/category/i-5-rivals"},{"id":5920752,"name":"Oregon","permalink":"oregon","url":"/category/oregon"}]},{"id":14627964,"name":"Skyzoo #FGR First Generation Rich Hoodie","permalink":"skyzoo-fgr-first-generation-rich-hoodie","position":6,"price":39.99,"default_price":39.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/skyzoo-fgr-first-generation-rich-hoodie","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-05T04:30:40.000Z","description":"Welcome to the #FGR: First Generation Rich Collection, brought to you by Skyzoo and Moreland Print.\r\n\r\nThis is the second piece in the FGR movement, and is going to make you wonder why you ever bought another hoodie in your life.\r\n\r\nBrooklyn lyricist Skyzoo has released multiple critically acclaimed LPs, as well as worked with the likes of 9th Wonder, Just Blaze, Jill Scott, Wale, Jahlil Beats and even Portland-based producer Maze Rockwell.

Known for his taste in fashion and quality as much as his pen, he chose Moreland Print to collaborate with for his official merch line, coinciding with the launch of his new label imprint \"First Generation Rich\". \r\n\r\nThe #FGR: First Generation Rich shirt is printed by hand in Vancouver, WA on the following tees:\r\n\r\nMEN: We use a black 100% cotton Gildan G2000 shirt with white ink. These shirts fit true to size, so order what you normally wear. \r\n\r\nWOMEN: These are on Gildan Softstyle tees, which are a bit of a slimmer fit.

Not only was I interested in his story, I LOVE his Del and Tom Waits portraits, and I knew I needed to reach out and get to know him. \r\n\r\nTurns out he is a really cool, normal guy. He works at a hospital, raises a family, and just loves to draw some amazing stuff. Since then we have been sending ideas back and forth, and this is what came of our first discussion of what we called \"The War on Art\". It melds the classic Rosie the Riveter image with the Dia de los Muertos sugar skull makeup. People may fear the art you create, but don't be afraid to show them what you are made of.\r\n\r\nThese are printed on Anvil 980/880 tees, which are made of pre-shrunk 4.5 oz 100% combed ring spun cotton. These are our absolute favorite shirts, and we would rather walk around naked than without one of these. Please see the sizing chart in the images.\r\n\r\nMEN'S SHIRTS- These are printed on Heather Grey tees. These fit pretty true to size, but are just a bit slimmer and stylish. You can order your normal size.\r\n\r\nWOMEN'S SHIRTS- We are offering these on a Pink tee. Meghaan says these run a bit larger than normal women's tees. If you are on the fence about what size to order, go down a size. Otherwise, order as you normally would.\r\n\r\nWe plan to release more colors of these as time goes on, so make sure to keep checking back!\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":47029833,"name":"Men's Small- Heather Grey","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47029836,"name":"Men's Medium- Heather Grey","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47029839,"name":"Men's Large- Heather Grey","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47029842,"name":"Men's XL- Heather Grey","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47029845,"name":"Men's 2XL- Heather Grey","price":22.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":47029848,"name":"Men's 3XL- Heather Grey","price":22.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":47029851,"name":"Women's Small- Pink","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47029854,"name":"Women's Medium- Pink","price":19.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47029857,"name":"Women's Large- Pink","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47029860,"name":"Women's XL- Pink","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126759090/-/IMG_6359.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126759090/-/IMG_6359.JPG","width":1936,"height":1936},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126759108/-/IMG_6358.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126759108/-/IMG_6358.JPG","width":1936,"height":2592},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126759105/-/IMG_6357.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126759105/-/IMG_6357.JPG","width":1936,"height":2592},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126759123/-/Anvil980Sizechart.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126759123/-/Anvil980Sizechart.jpg","width":980,"height":939},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126759120/-/Anvil_880_Size_Chart.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126759120/-/Anvil_880_Size_Chart.png","width":1097,"height":1419}],"artists":[{"id":245190,"name":"Diego Corral","permalink":"diego-corral","url":"/artist/diego-corral"}],"categories":[{"id":5008348,"name":"Vancouver","permalink":"vancouver","url":"/category/vancouver"},{"id":5113684,"name":"Washington","permalink":"washington","url":"/category/washington"},{"id":5269878,"name":"Ladies","permalink":"ladies","url":"/category/ladies"},{"id":6552162,"name":"Diego Corral","permalink":"diego-corral","url":"/category/diego-corral"}]},{"id":13279248,"name":"DAT 6 Shirt","permalink":"dat-6-shirt","position":11,"price":19.99,"default_price":19.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dat-6-shirt","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-31T06:21:55.000Z","description":"This shirt pays homage to the fastest man in college football, Oregon's De'Anthony Thomas.\r\n\t\r\nIf you haven't seen this dude yet, don't feel bad; most people can't actually see him because he is too fast.

It (singular) is a stickers (plural).\r\n\r\nWhat do I mean? I mean that this 5\"x5\" piece is actually comprised of 3 individual stickers, which are all cut and ready to rock. There is the 4\"x4\" main Oregon Outline sticker, a skinny lil' Made Here logo, and a cute Moreland Print guy that we threw in for kicks and giggles.\r\n\r\nDon't want all 3 of them? That's fine; we know lots of people who hate having a good time. Don't feel bad about it.\r\n\r\nWant to live a little and get down with all 3 stickers? THEN DO IT! We fully support that. \r\n\r\nThese stickers come in the following configurations:\r\n\r\n1) White ink on clear background- these are great for your car or house window. The backing is crystal clear and birds will surely try flying through it over and over.\r\n\r\n2) Black ink on clear background- samesies as above, but black ink. Less stealthy, way more brutal.\r\n\r\n3) Black ink on white background- this is a sticker. If I have to explain this to you, I'm not sure you're in the market to buy anything from us, or anyone else ever again for the rest of your life.\r\n\r\nThese come with free shipping in the contiguous US, and Meghaan kisses every single envelope that leaves our shop.

Our first offering is the Oregon Outline Shirt, and we cannot wait to get it into your hands.\r\n\r\nDave from Moreland Print teamed up with Kim and Kristin from BDC, Portland's premier event design studio, to create a shirt that represents our home state of Oregon. We love the Beaver State, and we know you do as well.\r\n\r\nThis shirt is the epitome of wearable art; not only is the design impressive, the shirt itself is a nice, soft tee that you will be eager to wear day after day.\r\n\r\nWe are using our new MP House Blanks, which are based on the Anvil 980/880 series. The shirts are made of Kelly Green pre-shrunk 4.5 oz 100% combed ring spun cotton, and they are so soft you will probably think you accidentally purchased a cloud rather than a piece of clothing. Please click on the images to the left to find more info on the fit of these shirts.\r\n\r\nBesides the front Oregon Outline print, you will also find the Made Here logo printed along the side of the shirt, which gives it a little extra flair.\r\n\r\nBeyond all of that, the shirt features a Moreland Print custom printed label, the first time we are offering this to the public. It really ties the whole shirt together and makes it feel like one cohesive design concept.\r\n\r\nOh, did we mention that \"Made Here\" is more than a clever marketing name? These shirts are actually made here. HERE, meaning Portland, OR and Vancouver, WA. We print these by hand and complete all of the work ourselves, in our own shops, here in the Pacific NorthWest. \r\n\r\nPreorders for the shirt will start July 26 and shipments will begin to leave by August 14, which just so happens to be the day Oregon turns 154.5 years old. Joy to the world!\r\n\r\nWe are thrilled to partner up with <a href=\"http://www.bienestar-or.org/web/programs/youth.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Bienestar</a> in support of their 2013 Homework Club, which aims to support low-income and migrant students with homework and literacy training. FOR EVERY MADE HERE SHIRT SOLD THROUGH AUGUST 21, 2013, WE WILL DONATE $3 TO THIS INCREDIBLE PROGRAM. If we reach our goal of $100 (33 shirts sold), we will donate another $100 for a total of $200.

Using imagery that feels very Portland in nature, we give you an opportunity to take a stand for your city.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nMEN'S SHIRTS: \r\n\r\nSMALL, XL, and 3XL: This shirt is printed on a green pre-shrunk 100% cotton Gildan shirt, which is a classic, standard t-shirt that you are familiar with and love to wear. These have a very true fit so if you wear a large, order a large in this.<br>\r\n\r\nMEDIUM AND LARGE: We updated our line by printing these on the soft and stylish Anvil 980 tees. The shirts are made of Kelly Green pre-shrunk 4.5 oz 100% combed ring spun cotton, and they are so soft you will probably think you accidentally purchased a cloud rather than a piece of clothing. They fit a bit slimmer than the Gildans, but you can still order your regular size. IMPORTANT: They are Kelly Green, so they are identical in color to the women's shirts.\r\n\r\nWOMEN'S SHIRTS: We use a Bella 6004 which is a 4.2 oz pre-shrunk 100% cotton super-soft baby jersey knit tee and looks very cute, according to Meghaan. The green in this picture is off; the shirts are a true Kelly green.\r\n<br>\r\nFor $19.95, you are getting the following:\r\n1) The Seattle Sucks Thorny Axe Shirt\r\n2) The Seattle Sucks Thorny Axe Sticker\r\n3) Free Shipping in the US \r\n4) A chance to help out a local youth soccer program. $3 from every shirt sold benefits the Cleveland High School Boys' Soccer Team. I went to CHS and am good friends with coach Scott Killen and want to use some of this money to keep a great program operating at a high level.\r\n<br>\r\nGo forth, fellow Seattle dislikers, and shine your beacon of disdain brightly for all the world to see!\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT UPDATE: We have enabled \"overselling\", which means you can order shirts even if they are out of stock. Please take a look at the inventory bars at the bottom of the page; if your shirt is not in stock, expect about 2 weeks for it to arrive.","options":[{"id":35294160,"name":"Gildan Small","price":19.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35294163,"name":"Anvil 980 Medium","price":19.95,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35294166,"name":"Anvil 980 Large","price":19.95,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35294169,"name":"Gildan XL","price":19.95,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35294172,"name":"Gildan 2XL","price":22.95,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":35294175,"name":"Gildan 3XL","price":22.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":37624698,"name":"Women's Bella Small","price":19.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":37624701,"name":"Women's Bella Medium","price":19.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":37624704,"name":"Women's Bella Large","price":19.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":37624707,"name":"Women's Bella XL","price":19.95,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110350101/-/Seattle_Sucks_Timbers_Gildan_Green_Shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110350101/-/Seattle_Sucks_Timbers_Gildan_Green_Shirt.png","width":800,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110350173/-/Seattle_Sucks_Thorny_Axe_Sticker.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110350173/-/Seattle_Sucks_Thorny_Axe_Sticker.JPG","width":747,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/117167682/-/Seattle_Sucks_Timbers_Bella_Kelly_Shirt.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/117167682/-/Seattle_Sucks_Timbers_Bella_Kelly_Shirt.png","width":807,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5008345,"name":"I-5 Rivals","permalink":"i-5-rivals","url":"/category/i-5-rivals"},{"id":5113684,"name":"Washington","permalink":"washington","url":"/category/washington"},{"id":5269878,"name":"Ladies","permalink":"ladies","url":"/category/ladies"},{"id":5920752,"name":"Oregon","permalink":"oregon","url":"/category/oregon"}]},{"id":11163699,"name":"Seattle Sucks Thorny Axe Sticker","permalink":"seattle-sucks-thorny-axe-sticker","position":20,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/seattle-sucks-thorny-axe-sticker","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-15T05:32:11.000Z","description":"FREE SHIPPING AND QUANTITY DISCOUNTS\r\n\r\nThe Seattle Sucks Thorny Axe Sticker lets people know what you think about Seattle: it is not your favorite place on the planet.\r\n\r\nThis is a friendly way of adding fuel to the rivalry between Portland and Seattle, and we have lots of respect for Seattle and its occupants*\r\n\r\n*Note: We do not necessarily respect its occupants.\r\n\r\nPortland Til the Death!","options":[{"id":35125803,"name":"Quantity- 1","price":3.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35125806,"name":"Quantity- 2","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":35125809,"name":"Quantity- 3","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":35125812,"name":"Quantity- 5","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":35125815,"name":"Quantity- 8","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109786329/-/Seattle_Sucks_Thorny_Axe_Sticker.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109786329/-/Seattle_Sucks_Thorny_Axe_Sticker.JPG","width":747,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5008345,"name":"I-5 Rivals","permalink":"i-5-rivals","url":"/category/i-5-rivals"},{"id":5251575,"name":"Stickers","permalink":"stickers","url":"/category/stickers"}]},{"id":11067843,"name":"Idaho Love Shirt","permalink":"idaho-love-shirt","position":21,"price":19.99,"default_price":19.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/idaho-love-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-10T05:25:42.000Z","description":"Do you love Idaho?

Yes we can.\r\n\r\nWe are offering the Portland Neighborhoods Shirts in many varieties, as you are well aware of (click on NEIGHBORHOODS above if you don't believe me). But we can't really take a stab at all the places people in or from Portland want to represent, so we need to leave it up to you.\r\n\r\nHere's how it works: \r\n\r\n1) The shirt has a base price of $20, which includes one line of text (12 characters per line). Optimally you would have about 8 characters per line so that the text doesn't look squished, but 12 would still look pretty sexy.\r\n\r\n2) Let's say you want an additional line of text. Perhaps it isn't even that you went over the 12-character maximum. Maybe you just want the shirt to say \"SE PDX\" with them on separate lines. You pay $5 more for this. \r\n\r\n3) Each additional line is $5, with the 12-character maximum, and maxes out at 3 ADDITIONAL lines (which is 4 total lines).\r\n\r\nThe shirts are all the same as the Neighborhoods series (heather gray Gildan 2000 or Canvas 3001H) and use the exact same black font as the other shirts in the series.\r\n\r\nSelect from the menu below how may lines of text you plan on using and you are good to go. We will email you to find out what size and type of shirt you prefer and exactly what you want the garment to say.\r\n\r\nJust so we are clear on the prices:\r\n\r\n$20- Shirt and 1 Line Text (Base Price)\r\n$25- Shirt and 2 Lines Text\r\n$30- Shirt and 3 Lines Text\r\n$35- Shirt and 4 Lines Text\r\n\r\nWe are not doing super-custom orders of specific colors or fonts or designs at this moment.
