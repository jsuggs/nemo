Fun pigments that change color in the sun!\r\nThe pack & the individual colors are available in this listing. The colors in this pack are purple, red, and blue. Although they appear cloudy in the bottle (in shadow), these go on clear. The blue does have a slight green/yellow tint, however that is the nature of the pigment.\r\n\r\nPicture #1 - Pigments in base, in shadow.\r\nPicture #2 - Pigments in base, out in the sun. These have a jelly-ish finish.\r\nPicture #3 - Bottle & swatch shot, out in the sun. This is after adding white base to the lacquer, it made it much more opaque.\r\n\r\nThese can be mixed with other colors for different effects, I suggest layering these over light colors for better results, if leaving it as a jelly.\r\n\r\nThese are not as concentrated as the other pigments I have available, and these do require a little more TLC in terms of dissolving the pigment into the base fully, you may need to add solvent as well. The sampler pack brings 4g of each pigment, total of 12 grams. See pricing for individual sizes available.\r\n\r\nPlease store product where light contact is minimal, and in a cool area. Please refer to the \"About Us\" section regarding color changing pigments.\r\n\r\nPigment is a fine powder.

Keep in mind, just a little bit goes a long way with this product. These are very HIGHLY pigmented.\r\n\r\nYou can add this to only suspension base for a jelly-ish look, or add it to a suspension/white base combo for a more opaque look.\r\n\r\nIn the swatch pictures shown above, I mixed both suspension & white base with a pinch of the pink neon pigment to achieve the look. For a smooth finish add a top coat. Because these are very pigmented I recommend using a base coat, I haven't had issues with staining, but just mentioning it as a preventative measure.\r\n\r\nThe color choices are;\r\n\r\nOrange\r\nGreen\r\nYellow\r\nRed Coral\r\nPink\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to store product where light contact is minimal.\r\n\r\nPigment is a fine powder. Please remember to use all safety precautions when handling pigment, and be sure to work in a properly ventilated area with appropriate safety wear.\r\n\r\nPackaged by volume. \r\n\r\nIf you have not used these pigments before, please start off with a sample before committing to a larger size.","options":[{"id":34805280,"name":"3g-Green","price":3.5,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34805283,"name":"3g-Orange","price":3.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34805286,"name":"3g-Pink","price":3.5,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34805292,"name":"3g-Red Coral","price":3.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34805301,"name":"3g-Yellow","price":3.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.25,"amount_with_others":0.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108811446/-/Neon_Collage.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108811446/-/Neon_Collage.jpg","width":1000,"height":510},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108811473/-/Pink-Blacklight.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108811473/-/Pink-Blacklight.jpg","width":370,"height":409},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108811593/-/SAM_4247.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108811593/-/SAM_4247.JPG","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5269065,"name":"Neon Pigment","permalink":"neon-pigment","url":"/category/neon-pigment"}]},{"id":11241135,"name":"Holo Pack","permalink":"holo-pack","position":92,"price":5.5,"default_price":5.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/holo-pack","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-19T02:22:40.000Z","description":"Holographic glitter pack includes 1tsp of the following colors ;\r\n\r\n-Magenta hex .032\"\r\n-Turquoise hex .032\"\r\n-Black hex .032\"\r\n-Red hex .032\"","options":[{"id":35375163,"name":"Default","price":5.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.25,"amount_with_others":0.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110584965/-/Holo_Collage.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110584965/-/Holo_Collage.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5337486,"name":"Glitter Packs","permalink":"glitter-packs","url":"/category/glitter-packs"}]}]
