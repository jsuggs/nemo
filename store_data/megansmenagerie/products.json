Snuggle and wrap yourself up in this warm and cozy cowl. I love the diversity of this cowl as there are so many different ways to wear it! Wear it with casual clothes or when your all dressed up! It also makes a great gift. What a perfect way to stay warm, cozy and fashionable.\r\n\r\nI hand crocheted this colorful cowl using an extra soft 100% acrylic yarn. I love to use acrylic yarn because its washable. Just throw it in the wash and lay it flat to dry. The colors of this cowl flow beautiful with one another! This yarn will not itch. I used two buttons made from coconuts on this cowl. They look awesome on this! I made the buttons small enough so that they can slip right between the stitches but big enough to stay put.\r\n\r\nAll my items come beautifully wrapped and include a card.
