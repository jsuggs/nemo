Four and a bit tracks of blistering mathy punk.\r\n\r\nGreat Deeds are a mathy punk band from Sheffield. They play songs that are a bit faster than they should be, slightly more melodic than people think they would be and songs that are a little less complicated than they first sound. It's still punk...just in 7/8.\r\n\r\nBooklet includes words and scores for all tracks so you too can play noisy songs to annoy your neighbours.\r\n\r\nAlso comes with a free two track demo CD!\r\n\r\nRecorded over two and a bit days in April 2011 at Rec and Play, Sheffield.
