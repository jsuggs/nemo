The band’s sound has truly come into their own, offering riffy swagger, bomb-string heaviness and massive multi-layered vocal harmonies on the new LP. It’s almost like Alice in Chains discovering the first two Baroness EP’s, or maybe the Melvins covering the Beach Boys. They somehow manage to hit fresh, uncharted territory using familiar hallmarks of stoner metal, Seattle grunge and modern melodicism. The recording is warm, lush and as thunderous as the guitars will allow, but the crushing moments are woven through harmonious sun soaked vocal passages and used as a release, not a crutch. This could easily be the first sludge metal soundtrack for hitting the beach.\r\n\r\n“Sunshine” was recorded at New Alliance in Cambridge, MA by drummer/vocalist, Alec Rodriguez and the band features guitarist/vocalist Nicholas Wolf from Phantom Glue.

Our first brethren from the west coast, Litany are a mixed bag of dark charging hardcore, chaotic grit and haunting atmospherics. Exploring the seedy underbelly of raw punk and noisy “post rock” the four piece hit with a wall of sound that smells of booze and tastes of blood. The recording of their debut album “Dolores” was done at the famous Prairie Sun Studios (The Melvins) with mastering by Carl Saff. The artwork was handled by a friend of the band, Chris Taylor (Darkest Hour, Pig Destroyer, Pg 99). Dolores will be released this summer on TDB Records (CD and Digital) and vinyl will be split by MolSook Records and The Perpetual Motion Machine. \r\n\r\n<b>CD comes in 6 panel digipack case</b>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://cahdownloads.com/album_detail.php?id=341\">Would you rather buy digitally?

Tell mom if she needs you, you'll be in the pit.</b>\r\n\r\n\"Municipal Waste are heralded as heroes of thrash's recent resurgence due to their D.R.I.-meets-Nuclear Assault onslaught. However, Ramming Speed may very well usurp the kings thanks to the sheer brutality and assault of debut full-length Brainwreck. With its thrash riffing, crustcore blast beats and death metal gurgling (circa Entombed's Left Hand Path), it's a veritable cesspool of extremities fornicating in their own filth and vomit. And just when it seems as if they couldn't become any more disgustingly brutal, a wave of Black Flag-ish hardcore washes over the sullen mess with epic chant-along choruses.\"\r\n-Keith Carman (Exclaim! Magazine)\r\n\r\n\"Boston's Ramming Speed has it all figured out. Right in the face of what many have labeled as a thrash revival, these five dudes from Boston compacted a few decades of metal, grindcore, and punk influences into a half hour of highly energetic and entertaining classic thrash worship. So what's the trick to rising above other bands when a style of music is enjoying a swell of popularity within the metal community? It's simple: just prove that you love it more than anyone else. And thanks to this product of the thriving Boston DIY scene, listeners will be hard-pressed to find another band more enthusiastic about every corner of the thrash, grindcore, and punk genres.\r\n\r\nBottom Line: Fans of classic acts like Napalm Death, Slayer, Discharge, and Testament and time-tested activities like eating pizza and drinking beer will find a lot of good times in Ramming Speed...If you're going to revive old musical styles and pay homage to the classics, you better make it feel authentic and you better make it entertaining.

Bang your head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Listen up, I'm about to make a statement: Engineer is arguably the heaviest and most intense band in the current metal and hardcore scene. You'll notice that I went with the \"arguably\" mainly because dealing with absolutes tends to lead to journalist booby traps, but nevertheless, the statement carries considerable weight. Anyone who has had the pleasure of witnessing a live show, and thus waited the extra few minutes for the band to set up their wall of cabs to reap the benefits of being blasted by unforgiving walls of sound will most likely support me on this one. And with the release of The Dregs, Engineer's second full-length, they show absolutely no signs of relinquishing their perch atop the hardcore and metal world.\r\n\r\n\tBottom Line: Just like Engineer's 2006 release of Reproach, The Dregs is a record built upon a strong foundation of pure intensity. But The Dregs also represents a mature step forward for the band in songwriting, and their ability to maintain their trademark heaviness while adding melodic subtleties into the mix easily makes this record one of this year's best. <b>I can't imagine a single person who calls themselves a hardcore and metal fan not getting into this record.</b> Support these four dudes from Syracuse because they sure as hell deserve it.\" -Lambgoat.com\r\n\r\n<Br>\r\n<img src=\"http://www.piratespress.com/myspaceimg/ROTW031408/3.jpg\">\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":510416,"name":"Default","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":9.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/487605/-/cover300x300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/487605/-/cover300x300.jpg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/487609/-/whole_package_pirates_press_image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/487609/-/whole_package_pirates_press_image.jpg","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/487613/-/Giant_fish_eye_photo.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/487613/-/Giant_fish_eye_photo.jpg","width":942,"height":796}],"artists":[{"id":2923,"name":"ENGINEER","permalink":"engineer","url":"/artist/engineer"}],"categories":[{"id":43246,"name":"VINYL","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":61602,"name":"COCTOPUS - INCHES OF... 12\"","permalink":"coctopus-inches-of-12","position":16,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/coctopus-inches-of-12","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2007-12-19T03:10:28.000Z","description":"When skate thrash titans Bones Brigade, and Misfits-worshiping punks Shanghai Valentine broke up, something was already brewing in the steamy waters of Boston Harbor.
