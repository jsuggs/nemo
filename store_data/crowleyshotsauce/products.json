An awesome blend of capsicum, garlic, onion and chilli that is your 'go to' sauce when you just want heat and acidity that a good sauce delivers.  No standout flavours like the rest of the range, just a nice balance of heat and flavor.  At the top end of the 'everyday person' heat scale, this pushes the pain threshold just a little bit, but for most it's bareable.  For some, it might just be a little too hot!  Asian and Mexican dishes scream out for this sauce.","options":[{"id":24716034,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76927224/-/Seeded_Close.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76927224/-/Seeded_Close.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76927296/-/Seeded_Wide.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76927296/-/Seeded_Wide.jpg","width":1000,"height":667}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2895707,"name":"Savoury Range 250ml","permalink":"savoury-range-250ml","url":"/category/savoury-range-250ml"}]},{"id":7832832,"name":"Smoke & Fire - 250ml","permalink":"smoke-fire-250ml","position":2,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/smoke-fire-250ml","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-05T03:23:01.000Z","description":"You know what they say.  \"Where there's smoke.......\"  In this case, it's on purpose.
