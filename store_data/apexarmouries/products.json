These are part of an expression of Luddite or acoustic noise, which is to say an expression of freedom. While putting acoustic noise on an electric disc and advertisements for it online is essentially a contradiction in terms, the artifact is intentionally made to only be propaganda. Each “song” on/in the disc is representative of experiments in acoustic noise; you are being allowed to hear them in order to encourage more experiments. Some recordings are of gramophones being played together, others are of individuals improvising live without the use of any electricity, two are of shellac discs recorded using an old phonograph horn recorder, one is just the sounds of shellac discs being scratched, a few show the results of painting over 7-inches, there's a prank call to a psychic medium, another is a magickal dulcimer ditty inspired by Austin Osman Spare that was randomly made while breaking into a roughly 4,000 year old Native American religious site, there’s even a blues song played on acoustic guitar – without permission – in a cemetery at night, etc. In the future, there will be no electronic compact disc and even more off-the-grid secrecy, honestly, in order to become more authentic. If you want the real thing, just listen to the painted anti-record on a gramophone, or better yet, use this thing to beat a rhythm on a desk or just use the rubber band to make a guitar.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: THIS IS A PRE-ORDER.

Unhealed wounds. \r\n\r\nSOME THINGS HAVE TO BE ENDURED. \r\n\r\nThe latest offering from NY synth-death master Theologian (aka Leech, also the mastermind behind the renowned power electronics/death industrial outfit Navicon Torture Technologies), \"Some Things Have To Be Endured\" features eight new tracks of punishing black industrial, apocalyptic darkwave frequencies, and nerve-rending electronic deathscapes. \"Endured\" is a collection of collaborations between Theologian and a lineup of female vocalists/artists from both within the industrial / noise / dark ambient / coldwave realm and beyond, with contributions from Rachael Kozak (Hecate), Kristen MacArthur (Sewer Goddess), Rachel Maloney (Tonikom), Nikki Telladictorian (Prometheus Burning), Patricia Benitez (Fetish Drone), Gillian Leigh Bowling (Teloahqaal), Christiana Key (Delphic Oracle), Joan Hacker (Factoria), Shari Vari (Void Vision), and professional opera singer Melissa C. Kelly. The tracks shift from grinding industrial dread to ethereal coldwave beauty, blasts of rumbling blackened synthcrush met with washes of haunting electronic melody, while always remaining rooted in Theologian's bleak, jet-black industrial sound. Co-produced with Derek Rush/DREAM INTO DUST and mastered by James Plotkin, \"Some Things Have To Be Endured\" contains some of the most moving and dramatic music to emerge from Theologian's black sonic abyss, and the album comes adorned with striking photography by Ione Rucquoi that makes this one of the more visually arresting releases in Theologian's growing catalog.","options":[{"id":45631077,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125756412/-/Screen_shot_2012-11-21_at_1.44.49_PM.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125756412/-/Screen_shot_2012-11-21_at_1.44.49_PM.png","width":531,"height":728},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125756649/-/1383490_528307413913634_951195392_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125756649/-/1383490_528307413913634_951195392_n.jpg","width":960,"height":717}],"artists":[{"id":9194,"name":"THEOLOGIAN","permalink":"theologian","url":"/artist/theologian"}],"categories":[{"id":317535,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":812521,"name":"Distro Items","permalink":"distro-items","url":"/category/distro-items"}]},{"id":3691844,"name":"SUFFERING BODIES.

Under this new name, the power electronics and death industrial influences were merged into even darker, more majestic sounds, crafting something that was significantly more atmospheric than his work with NTT, while also reaching into new extremes of experience. On Theologian's latest, The Chasms Of My Heart, this sound is perfected, incorporating more melody and percussion into the long, oppressive dead-world ambiance and pummeling electronic doomscapes, and it's one of the best albums that Leech has brought us.\r\n\r\nChasms opens with what may be Theologian's most stirring and evocative piece of music to date, a monumental end-time dirge titled \"Abandon All Hope\" that starts off as a swirling ocean of blackened synthesizer roar before morphing into the sound of pounding metallic percussion and skull-rattling bass frequencies. At first, it's the sort of pitch-black apocalyptic death-synth heaviness that Theologian has long claimed as its own, but when the layered vocals begin to pour in, soaked in distortion and climbing skyward in a gloriously miserable multi-part harmony above an eerie minor-key hook, this heaviness is transformed into something new. Like some kind of hellish fusion of industrialized shoegaze and thunderous power electronics, \"Abandon All Hope\" reveals a new side to Theologian's black-hole sound that is explored further throughout these eight tracks.\r\nThere's no shortage of Theologian's trademark black ambiance, though. The frantic clanking rhythms on \"We Can't All Be Victims\" becomes a backdrop to a maelstrom of monochrome drone and howling demonic noise, obscuring the nightmarish cacophony of choral voices and screaming feedback and epic strings buried deep below; and \"Starvation Is A Legitimate Weapon Of War\" appears as an ocean of abyssal low-end churn and rumble that spreads out into infinity, leading into the crushing orchestral power of \"My Body Is Made Of Ash...I Live As Ash\", where titanic distorted synth-pulses echo up from vast, lightless depths and achingly beautiful strings drift in on clouds of kosmiche shimmer, evoking images of monstrous crematoriums belching smoke and cinder into the skies, extinguishing the sun as raging vocals rise and war-drums begin pounding relentlessly in the blackness.\r\n\r\nThis album also has some of Theologian's most celestial music, like on the deep-space power electronics transmissions of \"Bed Of Maggots\" and the final track, both of which begin to resemble the sound of Tangerine Dream blasting out of the heart of a dead black star.\r\n\r\nEvery track on Chasms - from the more minimal abyssal dronescapes to the thunderous percussive power of the opener - exudes a kind of dark majesty, perfectly blending in the vague orchestral sounds (strings, choral voices, synthetic horns) with the more abrasive and noisy textures that seep from every corner of the album. It's one of the finest slabs of apocalyptic electronic / industrial music that I've ever heard, and certainly a new high point in Leech's long career in the PE/industrial/noise underground.\r\n\r\nThe Cd release of Chasms comes in a six-panel DVD-size digipack illustrated with Leech's striking artwork.\r\n\r\nAudio Preview:\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1412957&show_artwork=true\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":23441655,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72752731/-/776127485-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72752731/-/776127485-1.jpg","width":600,"height":450},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72752749/-/1087433263-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72752749/-/1087433263-1.jpg","width":600,"height":450},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72752765/-/1569760629-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72752765/-/1569760629-1.jpg","width":600,"height":450},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72752783/-/1607095901-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72752783/-/1607095901-1.jpg","width":600,"height":450},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72752791/-/3110746055-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72752791/-/3110746055-1.jpg","width":600,"height":450}],"artists":[{"id":9194,"name":"THEOLOGIAN","permalink":"theologian","url":"/artist/theologian"}],"categories":[{"id":317535,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":812521,"name":"Distro Items","permalink":"distro-items","url":"/category/distro-items"}]},{"id":7280967,"name":"THEOLOGIAN.

Bartow is a revered pillar of the modern noise movement. He turned heads in the 90s with his Navicon Torture Technologies project and also founded the Annihilvs Power Electronix label. Theologian has previously released material on the incomparable Crucial Blast Records.\r\nThis four-song ep (more like a full-length album: each track clocks in at a minimum of 11-15 minutes in length) was recorded concurrently with the forthcoming full-length, THE CHASMS OF MY HEART (Crucial Blast). Like that album, there is much more emphasis on rhythmic elements here, as opposed to strictly ambient textures. Drawing inspiration, in part, from certain artists that came to light during the brief “witch house” craze of 2011, Bartow wanted to see what his version of that music might sound like, filtered through THEOLOGIAN’s death industrial lense. The end result is quite beyond the realm of dance music trends, but the influence is there. Hypnotic and deep, more than saliently dark, there is still plenty of atmosphere.\r\nThe packaging features incredible photography by visual collaborators JL Joseph Beaulieu (photography), Esther Rosenstein (makeup and prosthetic effects), and model Dessa Fell, along with imagery by Brooklyn artist Karlynn Holland.\r\nMastered by James Plotkin, presented in a full-colour, 4-panel DVD digipak.

This cold, inhuman soundworld is in turn terrifying and abject, evoking the infinite void and the ultimate extinguishing of the self. This begins as a rhythmic, almost martial sounding sweep of distortion and muted white noise that reveals ominous minor key melodies lurking beneath the bleak expanse of Theologian's icy black realm, like the soundtrack to soaring over a dead, crumbling city on some far-off sunless world, fields of minimal drift met with distant oceanic rumbling and clarion blasts of high tones that sound like massive trumpets blowing across vast wastelands. Towards the end, hellish looped demonic vokills begin to drop in, and here is where Theologian's sound begins to morph into a kind of dreadful power electronics. The second track features syncopated blasts of symphonic sound that are washed out, roar and decaying like tidal movements across the void, a constant rush of black hiss across the horizon; it becomes more surreal sounding as swells of orchestral string-like sounds and soft whirring drones materialize. From there, more of those monstrous horns blow across the Styx, joined by melodic choral synths, the sound slow and throbbing as it slowly dissipates into a distant rolling cloud of muted noise, far off eruptions reverberating while a deep single note synth drone extends into infinity. Its absolute desolation interrupted only by the frantic whine of high siren-like tones, and is what we imagine the final moments leading up to total nuclear immolation would no doubt sound like. The final track is also possessed with this pulsating undercurrent, but its more dissolute, a cloudy black throb, the weak pulse of a dying planet, faint strains of gorgeous peripheral melody lurking in the deep, eventually leaving only nebulous particles spinning in the blackness, then reassembling into an utterly massive slow motion orchestral dirge shrouded in dead radio waves.\"\r\n\r\n- CRUCIAL BLAST","options":[{"id":1616933,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3293183/-/maxbitsm.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3293183/-/maxbitsm.jpg","width":216,"height":216},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3939691/-/MAXBIT-REARPANELsm.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3939691/-/MAXBIT-REARPANELsm.jpg","width":342,"height":342}],"artists":[{"id":9194,"name":"THEOLOGIAN","permalink":"theologian","url":"/artist/theologian"}],"categories":[{"id":6479619,"name":"ANNIHILVS COMPACT DISCS","permalink":"annihilvs-compact-discs","url":"/category/annihilvs-compact-discs"},{"id":317535,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":812541,"name":"ANNIHILVS Items","permalink":"annihilvs-items","url":"/category/annihilvs-items"},{"id":2106580,"name":"PRODUCED ON DEMAND","permalink":"produced-on-demand","url":"/category/produced-on-demand"}]},{"id":1375351,"name":"THEOLOGIAN+STEVE MOORE.

One of the first of these is Into The Uttermost Fields Of Ether, a full length album of chthonic ambience from Theologian that travels into more kosimiche regions of synth blackness than usual, due to these tracks being formed from source material that was provided by Steve Moore from retro-futurist soundtrack masters Zombi. Obviously, we're big fans of Theologian over here, and we love Zombi, so we've been extremely psyched to hear this. Ether begins with a massive twenty-two minute void of pulsating electronic buzz titled \"From Beyond An Obfuscated Constellation\", deep throbbing bass-heavy synthesizers emitting sheets of icy black drift. When the ominous clusters of synth notes begin to circle in, it becomes very Tangerine Dream-like, specifically reminding us of their most desolate work like Zeit; the warbling synths drift from speaker to speaker, hovering over an abyssal expanse, immense stretches of deep subterranean rumble and vast minor key drone flecked with high-pitched cricket-like chirping. That minimal black drift gives birth to \"Fields Of Ether\", a pounding percussive throb rising out of the void and becoming surrounded with intercepted radio waves and squeals of electronic noise. Cavernous ambience and simple two note bass throb gives the fifteen-minute \"Cities Of Negative Space\" a very John Carpenter-like vibe, something that Zombi are masters at, and joined with Theologian's brand of black-hole desolation, it reaches new depths of dreadfulness. The last track is the most active on the disc, \"Song for the Spheres\" spreading into swarms of glitch that erupt from lush clouds of cosmic synth drone, an ominous sci-fi soundtrack ambience that closes the album like an utterly black Tangerine Dream piece. Fans of Theologian’s deep cosmic dread will love it, as will fans of the arctic isolationism of Lull and Yen Pox, the bleak drones consumed in blizzards of grainy digital noise and deep cosmic blackness.\"\r\n\r\n- CRUCIAL BLAST","options":[{"id":5035641,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/13117581/-/FIELD_OF_ETHER1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/13117581/-/FIELD_OF_ETHER1.jpg","width":342,"height":342},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/13117621/-/FIELD_OF_ETHER2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/13117621/-/FIELD_OF_ETHER2.jpg","width":342,"height":342}],"artists":[{"id":9319,"name":"STEVE MOORE (ZOMBI)","permalink":"steve-moore-zombi","url":"/artist/steve-moore-zombi"},{"id":9194,"name":"THEOLOGIAN","permalink":"theologian","url":"/artist/theologian"}],"categories":[{"id":6479619,"name":"ANNIHILVS COMPACT DISCS","permalink":"annihilvs-compact-discs","url":"/category/annihilvs-compact-discs"},{"id":317535,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":812541,"name":"ANNIHILVS Items","permalink":"annihilvs-items","url":"/category/annihilvs-items"},{"id":2106580,"name":"PRODUCED ON DEMAND","permalink":"produced-on-demand","url":"/category/produced-on-demand"}]},{"id":406440,"name":"THEOLOGIAN.

(or Total Occultic Mechanical Blasphemy) have been creating a particular brand of industrial death worship with some of creepiest recordings that I've heard out of this realm. I discovered the band through their 2007 album Macabre Noize Royale on Todestrieb, whose grating industrial rhythms, blasts of blackened noise and malformed black metal left my skull a charred husk, and I've been following their clandestine electro-acoustic experiments and rituals of corpse-abuse ever since. Now, T.O.M.B. have brought us their latest album (and first for Crucial Blast) UAG (or Undercovered Ancient Gateways, and it follows the group of crypt-crawlers through eleven tracks of suffocating black ambience and lifeless industrial pummel that strips away most of the black metal elements of previous releases, crafting a more abstract, ambient sound this time around.\r\nThe band has largely distinguished their approach to black industrial because of the sound sources they use; making their way into abandoned sanitariums, morgues, decaying crypts, and other sites of psychological and spiritual distress (such as the Pennhurst State Hospital in Pennsylvania, and Kentucky's infamous Waverly Hills), the members of T.O.M.B. capture the natural ambience of these locations with field recorded sounds, and engage in pounding percussive workouts by banging and hammering on the very walls and structures of these sites. These rumbling industrial rituals result is a mix of Neubauten-esque bashing and rhythmic forms combined with crushing harsh industrial noise and lightless black ambient voids, sculpted into a uniquely haunted industrial ambience on UAG. As far as references go, I hear traces of death industrial (a la Atrax Morgue / Subklinik / Mauthausen Orchestra / Brighter Death Now) here, as well as the black industrial weirdness of bands like Abruptum, MZ412, and Stalagggh, but there's also echoes of Lustmord's early work here as well in the cavernous black spaces that T.O.M.B. explores.\r\nThere is no narrative here, nothing resembling \"mood music\"; each track flows directly into the next, the album crawling and breathing as a single malevolent organism. The title track opens the album with massive metallic reverberations rumble through vast cavernous realms of darkness and roaring subterranean maelstrom, corrosive distorted noise washing over the pounding sheet-metal percussion and almost tribal-like rhythms, like the howling of the dead emanating from the bowels of the earth. Then \"Torment\" creeps in, layering agonized distorted howls and monstrous moaning vocalizations over sweeping noise and a pulsating distorted synth, the whole sound drifting through an echo-chamber of hallucinatory horror, then slipping into the swelling subterranean rumblings, juddering machine rhythms and pounding cemetery gate rhythms of \"Mausoleum Witchcraft\". The subsequent depths of the Underground Ancient Gateways are further infested with these rattling infernal engines and massive rumbling dronescapes, violent metal percussion, ghostly effects and mysterious sounds drifting across the abyssal emptiness, various nightmarish vocalizations, the pounding drums and other hammered objects a constant presence.\r\nSome of the album's more disturbing moments appear on the psychedelic noise eruption \"Blood Vortex\" that resembles one of CCCC's extreme synth-noise meltdowns, a mass of swarming electronic glitch whirling over smeared drones and distant machine noise that apparently used actual blood as a sound source; the snarling, teeth-gnashing blood ritual chaos of the \"Tribe Of The Corpse\" gives way to the dank Lustmordian depths of \"Graveyard Requiem\"; and the twelve-minute \"EMPLEH\", where the cavernous ambience transforms into twisted atonal guitar noise, distant cries, and eerie howls cloaked in thick black fog, later revealing warped, quasi-black-metal shapes as it drifts deeper and deeper into the pit. The closest that the album ever approaches anything resembling black metal, though, is on the psychotic blastscape \"Leech\", where those faint, programmed blastbeats drift up out of a hazy dungeon ambience amid snarling demonic vocals and reverb-soaked synthesizers. The one piece on UAG that really gets under my skin though is \"Cadaver Transmissions\", a recording of contact mic scrapings across the rotting flesh of an actual corpse, backed by echoing black drift, creating the blackest of ambient soundscapes on what is already a supremely unsettling listening experience.\r\nHighly recommended to fans of blackened industrial and black ambience.

The name is the really the only thing that changed, as the occult hypno-doom and grim, folk-stained nightmares that populated their previous albums are all intact here. This double disc from Crucial Blast collects both the Gathering Strengths Lp (Olde English Spelling Bee) and Blood Seed Lp (20 Buck Spin), both of which were previously available only on limited edition vinyl. The material has been remastered for this format, and comes in an eight-panel digipack that features both the original album artwork as well as new imagery that further compliments Wolvserpent's avant-garde witch-sludge.\r\nOriginally released under the name Pussygutt, Gathering Strengths offers more of their signature blackened dronescapes and ominous metallic ambience that we heard on the amazing albums She Hid Behind Her Veil and Sea Of Sand, with two massive tracks, each one a mysterious and abstract slab of twilight drift and formless low-end blackness. The beginning of \"Gathering Strengths (Silence Within)\" is a spacious blend of abstract doomdrift and eerie nocturnal field recordings, the chirping of crickets and other nighttime forest sounds surrounding the slow deep wheeze of a clarinet drifting through the woodland shadows, the tones of the clarinet stretching and winding into tendrils of dark drone, a subtle undercurrent of rumbling heaviness deep beneath all of this. As the track continues to unfold, clinking metal and the whir of prayer bowls and distant tolling bells drift in, along with what sounds like a detuned banjo, muted strings, blurred streaks of violin, the sound smoldering for quite awhile, a sort of cinematic chamber-doomdrift, looped and scraped strings becoming more intense, joined by a gorgeous violin melody that begins weeping over the dark diaphanous ambience. And then the calm is split apart as a billowing black fog of metallic heaviness rumbles across the landscape, crawling over the horizon, seething and roiling just behind the mournful violins and creaking, whirring drones. The second begins with black wavering buzz floats across the simple pound of hand drums and a slowly beaten tambourine that begins \"Gathering Strengths (Spirit Walker)\", slowly joined by violins playing a simple keening melody, the mood bleak and sorrowful, with buzzing cello-drones slowly swarming beneath. The sound gradually builds into waves of rumbling doom riffage hovering over the horizon, never becoming overly heavy, instead spreading out and forming into a hazy doomfolk ritual with hypnotic violin melody and deep strings and soundtracky synths, becoming a dreamy funeral processional, dark and beautiful, austere and apocalyptic.\r\nThe band's fourth album Blood Seed was released as a limited vinyl edition in 2010 on 20 Buck Spin, and is featured here as a single unbroken track. The first half is mostly made up of swirling nocturnal folk-drone, the second shifting into fractured, crushing heaviness. The first side is titled \"Wolv\" and starts off with the soft warm blur of a synthesizer drifting through a black expanse, very dark, dreamy, and cosmic, slowly joined by the sound of a violin playing a melancholy minor key melody that drifts over the soft swirling hum of the keys. Right from the beginning, the sound is dramatic and moving, and heavy with a feeling of loss and grief. This feeling is amplified as more layers of violin are gradually added, the strings sometimes falling away into pure drone. After a few minutes of this, the guitar finally appears, playing a slow creepy figure plucked in slow motion, and combined with the violin and keys creates something resembling atmospheric, funereal chamber music. Bits of slide guitar are draped over top, and it almost sounds like an extremely depressed and despondent Amber Asylum. About halfway through the side, the drums suddenly kick in and the guitar swells up in a rush of heavy distortion, and the duo lurches into this massive heaving sludge riff, all pounding slow mo drums and down tuned metallic crush, the grinding riff and pounding ultra heavy pace reminiscent of the Melvins, but with the violins and keys continuing to swirl around, transforming the heaviness into some kind of mysterious folk-doom ritual. Up to this point it's been more or less instrumental, but now the howling unintelligible shrieks begin to appear, the sound of demonically possessed throats screaming in the midst of a monstrous doom jam taking place in the middle of the woods at midnight, a single riff grinding over and over, backed by a legion of classical violins, layered and intricate yet totally trance inducing. More effects start to appear, as well as strange echoing noises and droning guitar notes, the violins taking off on haunting counter-melodies, the sound becoming incredibly huge as the side approaches the end of the first side, until the drums fall away and the guitar dissipates into a cloud of dense feedback fug and it winds down into those witchy violins and clouds of amp buzz. The \"Serpent\" side picks up from there, with soft wisps of violin licking at the edges of a buzzing guitar leaning against an amplifier, gushing black feedback. Then we hear the distant howling of wolves, their cries actually forming into a sort of melody that merges with the other elements, the strings diffusing into a soft circling melody over that rumbling guitar hum. After a few minutes, all of this fades out once more and a creeping, muted guitar appears, playing a menacing Sabbathoid riff for a moment before the full band drops in again, grinding out another massive sludgy metallic dirge, wolf howls reappearing behind the pummeling slow mo metal. The chorus of strange nocturnal cries is joined by other yelps, moans, echoing shrieks, and chanting voices, evoking images of a midnight garage doom jam performed by a coven of witches, the sludgy riffing and heavy drumming speeding up into a pounding groove and slowing back down into pure tar-pit sloth, a serpentine gothic sludgefeast that stretches out to the very end of the album.","options":[{"id":30235503,"name":"Default","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94939719/-/wolvserpent_-_gathering_strength-bloodseed.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94939719/-/wolvserpent_-_gathering_strength-bloodseed.jpeg","width":266,"height":265}],"artists":[{"id":180039,"name":"WOLVSERPENT","permalink":"wolvserpent","url":"/artist/wolvserpent"}],"categories":[{"id":317535,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":812521,"name":"Distro Items","permalink":"distro-items","url":"/category/distro-items"},{"id":5016280,"name":"SALE","permalink":"sale","url":"/category/sale"}]},{"id":9662285,"name":"GNAW THEIR TONGUES.

Roughly translated, with blood and whip, we worship the dark. This is the latest collection of atrocities from Gnaw Their Tongues, an eight song investigation into the rites and rituals that emerge from the copper-scented frenzy of the serial killer, the obsessive acts of death worship enacted by those that live on the edge of abyss, the limits of experience sought by black cults. The sound is, as always, immensely heavy, with fractured drums and tunderous tympani skins reverberating within a maelstrom of seething black doom, screeching classical strings, horns, piano, and some of the most vomitous vocals imagineable. However, Per Flagellum Sanguemque is marked by the most frenetic percussive attack that we have heard from Gnaw Their Tongues, with volleys of chaotic drumming, fractured blasts, and maniacally complex patterns that sometimes seem to border on free-jazz drumming.\r\nThe band has rarely sounded as nauseating and depraved as it does on the opener \"Hic Est Enim Calix Sanguinis Mei\", where putrid bass riffs and lurching double bass drums spasm and thunder over the harrowing tension of atonal strings and the layered screams of the eviscerated; when the chaos suddenly drops out and we are left alone with the sounds of a woman gagging as somber strings slowly rise from below, it is one of Gnaw Their Tongue's more unsettling moments. The classical elements take over on \"Human Skin For The Messengers Robe\", where pleas for mercy are drowned out by blasts of evil, dissonant piano, demonic bloodlust-driven shrieks, and halting, lumbering percussion that eventually leads into the terrifying wail of choral groups rising out of the guts of Hell.\r\nConversely, the soaring harmonies and strings that take form on \"Urine Soaked Neophytes\" allow for brief moments of repreive from the surging black chaos, breaking into shafts of heavenly glory that peirce through the evil cacophony for a moment before being swallowed back up by the lurching amoirphous doom. French horns and Wagnerian strings dominate \"Tod, Wo Ist Dein Licht\", and on \"Fallen Deities Bathing In Gall\", the strings rise in series of high drones like some horrific Bernard Hermann nightmare as monstrously distorted overdriven bass crawls and buzzes and the drums are whipped into a frenzy of rolls and fills, fractured blastbeats pounding against the background and a jagged blackened anti-groove takes shape and claws it's way into a field of mangled, mewling black ambience. The remainder of the album offers no relent from the pain; \"Bonedust On Dead Genitals\" is an agony ritual fueled by industrial clank and the slow pound of a kettledrum as death-chants, blow-out doom bass and wild beasts roar and gibber in fury, and on \"The Storming Heavens As A Father To All Broken Bodies\" we are thrown a curveball when the song immediately lurches into an assault of fucked-up industrial black metal with blastbeats chooped up and splattered across the orchestral insanity in a manner reminiscent of electro-death mutants Whourkr. The album ends with the stentorian brass fanfare and hellish descent of the title track, a nearly ten minute exercise in grueling horror where chains meet flesh, throats are torn on the torture wheel, and a female voice recites lines from Charlotte Mew's death-poem \"The Quiet House\". - description from Crucial Blast","options":[{"id":30235319,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94938861/-/GTT_-_Per_flagellum.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94938861/-/GTT_-_Per_flagellum.jpeg","width":360,"height":360}],"artists":[{"id":23741,"name":"GNAW THEIR TONGUES","permalink":"gnaw-their-tongues","url":"/artist/gnaw-their-tongues"}],"categories":[{"id":317535,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":812521,"name":"Distro Items","permalink":"distro-items","url":"/category/distro-items"}]},{"id":9830053,"name":"NEVER PRESENCE FOREVER.

The nine tracks featured here revolve around the mythology of the war goddess, the spectre of doom that lurks at the edge of the battlefield, and begins at the heart of a roiling black blizzard and proceeds through a charred nightmare soundscape of icy corroded black metal riffs, fractured blasting, melancholic melodies blurred and smeared into malevolent new shapes, and scathing distorted witch-screams ripping through the blackness, all doused and drowned in Merzbowian levels of feedback and distortion abuse. Now presented on Cd for the first time, this early swarm of Wold's psychotropic black metal/noise terror comes with all-new artwork from Pippi Zornoza.\r\nThe short introduction \"Her Voice I\" thrusts the listener into thew midst of a brutal blizzard, roaring wind whipping gusts of snow, blinding sheets of frozen ice filling the air, and then it suddenly stops, cut off as the band jerks into the title track, a hellish buzzing storm of painfully strained and shredded screams, droning bass, and dreary guitar notes all swept up in a violent Merbowian blizzard of distortion. On many of these tracks, it appears that they didn't even use drums, but on others like \"Nine Virgions Of Badb\", pounding blastbeats hammer away in the background, almost totally obscured by the white noise and deformed howl of the massively blown-out guitar. Most of the time the guitar is a monstrous hollowed-out wall of buzzing, but sometimes an actual black metal riff takes shape, a simple, sometimes surprisingly catchy riff churning in all of the high-end fuzzed out chaos, slipping in and out of focus or morphing into a weird chiming, almost \"poppy\" melody as the band's wall of black noise shifts in intensity. On other tracks (such as \"The Wind Shall Carry Her Message\" and \"Evocation Of Badb\"), the in-the-red distortion becomes so extreme that the sound seems to break apart completely, crumbling into glitchy noise and scraped guitar skree before coming back together into another swarming blacknoise assault, or else dissolving into pure industrial noise and feedback.\r\nThis reissue of Wold's crucial early full length is one of the most extreme releases from Crucial Blast this year, and a stunning blast of black noise metal highly recommended to devotees of extreme distorted evil. - description from Crucial Blast","options":[{"id":30235069,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94937895/-/wold_-_badb.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94937895/-/wold_-_badb.jpeg","width":417,"height":419}],"artists":[{"id":180033,"name":"WOLD","permalink":"wold","url":"/artist/wold"}],"categories":[{"id":317535,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":812521,"name":"Distro Items","permalink":"distro-items","url":"/category/distro-items"}]},{"id":9830551,"name":"LAP DANCER/DECEMBER 23RD SPLIT CD-R (EN.MI.TY RECORDS)","permalink":"lap-dancer-december-23rd-split-cd-r-en-mi-ty-records","position":68,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lap-dancer-december-23rd-split-cd-r-en-mi-ty-records","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-03-09T23:56:43.000Z","description":"Limited to 75 copies","options":[{"id":30755230,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96571831/-/lapdancer_dec_23.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96571831/-/lapdancer_dec_23.jpeg","width":538,"height":453}],"artists":[{"id":182869,"name":"DECEMBER 23RD","permalink":"december-23rd","url":"/artist/december-23rd"},{"id":182872,"name":"LAP DANCER","permalink":"lap-dancer","url":"/artist/lap-dancer"}],"categories":[{"id":4718241,"name":"CD-R","permalink":"cd-r","url":"/category/cd-r"},{"id":812521,"name":"Distro Items","permalink":"distro-items","url":"/category/distro-items"}]},{"id":9662337,"name":"EHNAHRE.

As a terrifying chorus of operatic female howls suddenly waft out of cracks in the floor, the guitars finally appear, all alone and slowly weaving an ominous dissonant melody that takes over the piece as the listener is propelled further into Ehnahre's twisted soundscape. It's not long before the band tumbles into their trademark atonal death-doom, that spidery fractured guitar suddenly swelling into a monstrous clanging anti-riff while withered, ragged screams and bizarre mewling join in, and the rhythm section erupts into brief blasts of chaotic slow-motion heaviness and free-jazz inspired drumming. If anything, Ehnahre's sound becomes even more abstract here, the warped noisy death metal (which often resembles a cross between Disembowelment and Obscura-era Gorguts) folding in on itself and mutating into crushing, droning riffage before it trails off into the intensely creepy second act. Here, the double-bass, keyboards and delicate percussion take over, joined by the gorgeous and ghostly trumpets of guest musicians Greg Kelley (Heathen Shame) and Forbes Graham (Kayo Dot), offering up one of Ehnahre's most spellbinding moments as the band ventures into an utterly creepy world of twilight avant-jazz fusion and shadowy atmospherics. The following chapter winds back into the bone-crushing deathdoom, another monstrous wave of lurching heaviness and dissonant skronk, spilling over into the final passage, bludgeoning jagged death metal riffs welded to a lurching, lopsided dirge, the final moments collapsing in dramatic fashion as the band decomposes back into the hallucinatory wash of sounds that began the album...\r\nAs terrifying as it is haunting, 'Old Earth' is another intensely challenging and completely unique offering from Ehnahre, who still sound like nothing else in the metal/avant underground. It has some of the most bleakly beautiful, burnt-out moments the band has brought us so far, and those jazz-influenced passages in the middle of the album are pretty goddamn stunning. Might be difficult listening for some, but Ehnahre's otherworldly heaviness is immensely rewarding for the adventurous listener. - description from Crucial Blast","options":[{"id":30235445,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94939495/-/ehnahre_-_old_earth.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94939495/-/ehnahre_-_old_earth.jpeg","width":280,"height":280}],"artists":[{"id":180037,"name":"EHNAHRE","permalink":"ehnahre","url":"/artist/ehnahre"}],"categories":[{"id":317535,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":812521,"name":"Distro Items","permalink":"distro-items","url":"/category/distro-items"},{"id":5016280,"name":"SALE","permalink":"sale","url":"/category/sale"}]},{"id":9830851,"name":"SUSPICION BREEDS CONFIDENCE.

Featuring three extended descents into jet-black drift, funereal chamber music, monstrous metallic noise, booming ritualistic percussion, slit-throat recitations of formless horror, and further abyssal abominations.\r\nFragments From The Aethyr presents a triptych of long, sprawling pieces that descend through dark layers of cinematic sonic horror. The music shifts between violin-led passages of pitch-black, dissonant chamber music backed by booming kettledrums and traces of modern music composition and the rotting exhalations of the dead, to blasts of crushing shapeless doom where huge metallic chords thunder in the deep, sending tremors of doom-laden dronemetal rumbling through the strata of Funerary Call's demonic industrial nightmares. The sound of Fragments sometimes resembles a Bela Bartok piece drifting through a fog of black-mass ambience and the murmerings of the long dead, the sound imbued with a deep ominous feel but also glowing with a mysterious dark beauty as it builds to a crescendo of black majestic power, as on the nearly twenty minute centrepiece of the album \"Fragments\".\r\nThere are noisy elements that appear here that threaten to push the music into ear-destroying industrial cacophony at times, but even when the sound is at it's most chaotic, it's held together by the searing melodies of the stringed instruments, tethering the plumes of black industrial noise to the graveyard ambience that soaks deep into the surface of the album.\r\nAbsolute lightlessness from this seminal artist, highly recommended to fans of Gnaw Their Tongues, Megaptera, Nordvargr, TenHornedBeast, MZ.412 and Aghast.

From the beginning, Nekrasov's mechanized black blasts and sprawling abyssal soundscapes have been infested with the most caustic forms of electronic abuse and frequency terror. But starting with the extremely limited disc In Solitude And Darkness, The Last Step Is Made that came out on Void Séance last year, Nekrasov has now also started to work with the rigid aesthetic of the \"wall\", sculpting brutal, immersive infernos of extreme static noise that are reminiscent of Vomir. The mindset is certainly similar; going for extremely long unbroken tracks of churning high density distortion that remains unrelenting and unchanging, Nekrasov's efforts in HNW drag me down into the same sort of depressed, lightless Zen state that the French master is so adept at invoking. This is no small feat.\r\nIn Solitude was a successful first effort in the field of HNW from the artist, and now follows that with a new two-disc set called The Ever-Present that we have issued on our Crucial Blaze sub-label. This set offers more massive black walls of rushing static noise, with two half hour long pieces on the first disc, and a single monolithic track on the second disc that stretches out for over an hour. Each of these tracks is formed from varied frequency levels and different approaches to texture, shifting in tone and extremity as the listener moves from one track to the next, but it all flows together rather seamlessly as an exercise in intense, super heavy trance-blast. In addition, deep listening reveals myriad sonic events and nuked drones that swarm deep within the maelstrom of The Ever-Present, and the monolithic \"III\" in particular ventures into more detailed regions of noise where fragments of grinding rhythmic clank, smoldering static riffs, and howling blackened melodies can be heard buried underneath the roaring inferno.\r\nIt's the the heaviest slab of \"pure\" noise work that we've heard from Nekrasov so far, that's for sure. Fans of the band's more \"black metal\" centric work are warned that when we describe this as a noise album, we're not kidding. But for fans of HNW and Nekrasov's more abstract industrial side, The Ever-Present is a crushing experience. The two discs are packaged inside of the clear dvd-style case like all Crucial Blaze titles, and include a sticker, 1\" pin, and a twenty-eight page zine filled with black and white collage art, with murky, inky visions of all-devouring blackness, carcinogenic landscapes, cathedral-like tumor masses, amoebic growths, and Watchers from behind the shadows.

It's also the most focused work yet from this utterly demented Texas outfit that started out in the mid 90s as a pure noise project but gradually evolved into this weird, lumbering black-dirge that we hear now.\r\nThe eight songs that make up Evil Walks feature the signature Korperschwache moves: thumping minimal drum-machine pound courtesy of the relentlessly decisive Doktor Omega, droning dissonant riffs that veer from hypnotic noise to dismal quasi-black metal buzz, RKF's narcoleptic croaking and malevolent sneer bathed in reverb and amp skuzz, guitars humming and droning against cranked-up amps while creepy news sound bites, the distant sad howling of wolves and ear-piercing screams drift across the background, songs like the sprawling eleven minute \"The City Of Lost Girls\" and \"Me And You And A Can Of Gasoline\" crawling all soft and solemn through clouds of deep bass buzz and those weird sing-song ghoul-snarls and trance-states of repetitive slow-motion industrial beats, while \"Heaven's Gate\" hurtles through a primitive scum-thrash assault of clanking drums, noise, simple punky riffing and distant howls that explodes into a washed out smear of overdriven blast beats and dreamy major key guitar. Strange post-punk reverberations rumble all throughout this disc, nothing new to those who are familiar with the myriad other Korperschwache discs that have come out since 2001 when RKF first began flirting with his odd mix of simple, mesmeric gloom-guitar and black mechanical slime, but it's never sounded better to my ears than it does here, when the music forms into this stoned blackened hypno-rock thing, the buzzing guitars and acid-scorched melodies looping over the skittery industrial beats and weird dubbed-out snares and concussive Godflesh-esque rhythms, turning into something that sounds remarkably like a mutant cross between late-80s British psych/drone rockers Loop and those notorious improv-black metal freakazoids Abruptum. A comparison that I've used before when trying to describe the thumping psychedelic graveyard din of Korperschwache, certainly, but it's never been more relevant than it is here. A warped, blasted beauty shining through rotting shadows and rapidly declining emotional states. A series of ecstatic demon zone-outs. A hallucinatory strain of necro drone-rock. It's not black metal, but Korperschwache's Evil Walks is definitely recommended to fans of the demented fringes of underground blackness inhabited by like-minded bands like Utarm, Wrnlrd, Charnel House, Diapsiquir, Brobdingnagian, Mamaleek, Wormsblood and Lonesummer.

Miscarriage Of The Soul is a new full-length from the Indiana blacknoise duo Demonologists, whose lineup includes a former member of cult black metal weirdoes Ensepulchred; this band has been possessing the sound system at Crucial Blast over the past year, with releases like their split with Blue Sabbath Black Cheer and the Sermons Of Death And Eternal Damnation tape that recently came out on Waves Of Decay getting mucho play. Their grim, malevolent noisescapes are as extreme as it gets, going beyond mere industrial black noise into Merzbow-style levels of ultra violent electronic destruction. This is ritualistic deathworship rendered through howling, smoking amplifiers, extreme pedal abuse, and hateful vocalizations, equal parts infernal power electronics, obliterated black metal buzz, and crushing harsh industrial noise. Total nihilism. Absolute misanthropy.\r\nMiscarriage Of The Soul features five tracks of this nuclear strength sonic hate, and be warned, this is not for wimps. Beginning with opener \"Necro Prayers\", the band descends into an inferno of seething HNW that masks the sound of eerie chiming ambience and reverberating gongs, an ominous black ambience veiled by corrosive hiss, revealing stretched out minor key melodies bathing in the black coruscating fire. On the following track \"Chalice Of Snake Venom And Piss\", that metallic creaking dissonance is first to appear, joined by a soft downpour of fuzz and crackle, but within moments it becomes swallowed up within a crushing monstrous wall of black noise; you can hear bits of vague minor key creep, horrific industrial chaos and screeching demonic vokills all along the periphery of this howling maelstrom of distortion and static, the sounds constantly struggling to rise through the impenetrable ocean of amplifier filth, like the sounds of hell itself obscured by the roar of a volcanic eruption. The blackened noise of Wold is one reference point for what Demonologists are doing here, but this goes much deeper into pure noise. Then suddenly halfway through the track, the noise completely drops out, and it's just an expanse of dark ambience and strange, dissonant processed strings that lasts for a moment; and almost as quickly as it appeared, it's devoured by the raging noise, which now becomes much more static and dense, the various sounds within it pushed even deeper, with just traces of them bleeding through, the final five minutes essentially becoming a pure wall of hiss and static.\r\nOn \"Suicide Stench\", however, the band summons creepy repetitive melodies up through the swirling grit, looped pianos and strings surrounded on all sides by a massive whirling cloud of static, sounding as if we're listening to a horror movie score being played underneath a Vomir disc, like a nightmarish orchestral/HNW piece. \"The Blood Of Black Wolves\" follows suit, combining a dense, suffocating noise wall with shimmering ominous drones and minor key melody, creating a really psychedelic effect as the different sounds merge together and form auditory hallucinations; this stops at the six minute mark, the harsh noise disappearing and replaced with just the nightmarish looped melodies and mysterious textural sounds panning from speaker to speaker and whirling through the darkness.\r\nThe title track comes last, beginning with a minimal organ drone; then a pounding drum beat appears, joined with droning strings and swells of metallic synth for a moment, but this lasts only briefly. A minute later, it explodes back into churning noise, with loud coruscating drones running through the storm of blackened noise wall, bits of suspenseful orchestral sound bleeding through, later erupting into a chorus of horrific screams while the buzzing noise rages all around; in the final minutes of this track, the noise once again drops out, and it's just legions of screaming voices trapped in infinite suffering, slowly fading out as the album comes to a close.\r\nMiscarriage Of The Soul also includes a twenty-eight page black and white chapbook filled with crepuscular visions and nightmare delirium from the band: strange abstract photo-collages, twilight photography, cobwebbed basements, death totems, and portraits of decomposition are all collected here. The package comes in a clear dvd-style library case, and also contains a vinyl Demonologists sticker and a 1\" badge, and is issued in a hand-numbered edition of 250 copies.","options":[{"id":30234625,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94936441/-/demonologists_-_miscarriage_of_the_soul.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94936441/-/demonologists_-_miscarriage_of_the_soul.jpeg","width":406,"height":630}],"artists":[{"id":180027,"name":"DEMONOLOGISTS","permalink":"demonologists","url":"/artist/demonologists"}],"categories":[{"id":317535,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":812521,"name":"Distro Items","permalink":"distro-items","url":"/category/distro-items"}]},{"id":9959398,"name":"CLOVERLEAF.

This Dutch one-man avant black/doom/industrial band is responsible for two of the most chilling albums of abstract heaviness to have been released in recent years (An Epiphanic Vomiting Of Blood and All The Grand Magnificence Of Perversity, both from Crucial Blast), but with this new full-length, Gnaw Their Tongues peels back additional layers of it's bombastic horror to reveal moments of euphonic beauty more than we've heard on the previous albums.\r\n\r\nThis is still harrowing stuff, though. The album opens with soaring choirs of the damned and a cacophony of tortured shrieks and demonic howling underneath a crushing, sludgy bass riff and pounding elephantine drumming, total blackened doom that's soon joined by peals of dissonant strings and softer droning cellos and violins. As you get deeper into \" L'arrivée de la terne mort triomphante\", there are moments of severe beauty that emerge, brief passages of fragile piano and mournful strings, the soft crackle of ancient vinyl grooves and French horns. These moments repeat throughout the album, lots of symphonic shadow that drifts amidst the pounding industrial blackness, but they never last for long as the spiraling woodwinds and cyclical piano figures inevitably become subsumed into the blasts of malevolent orchestral might. The fearsome martial drums and brass fanfares at the beginning of \"Les anges frémissent devant la mort\" eventually evolve into stretches of abstract industrial percussive pummel over droning strings and organ, and then into a stunning cinematic finale. That's followed by the clanking doom, swarming black buzz and sheet-metal cacophony of \"La mort dans toute son ineffable grandeur/splendeur\", the most industrial-sounding track on the album. \"Le Chant De La Mort\" is a lurching, blown-out death march that shifts into an infernal dubbed-out dirge, and the closing track \" Le trône blanc de la mort (de white throne of death)\" rumbles through funereal classical drift, waves of horns, strings, percussion surging into a series of dark, mournful shapes at first, but are then shattered by pounding doom metal drums and wailing choir voices, becoming an utterly grim blackened dirge with distorted shrieking vocals that are wracked with agony, ending the album with a suffocating atmosphere of death. At its heaviest, it's like funeral doom bathed in modern orchestral music, a cross between Penderecki and pitch-black doom filth, pulverizing and intensely evil.\r\n\r\nOf course, this is essential for fans of previous Gnaw Their Tongues albums, but it's equally recommended to fans of both abstract blackened weirdness of bands like Emit, Abruptum, and Blue Sabbath Black Cheer, and the bleak Wagnerian industrial of In Slaughter Natives and Shinjuku Thief. Like the previous two Gnaw Their Tongues releases on Crucial Blast, this comes in a deluxe gatefold tip-on jacket (which is exclusive to the North American release of this disc). Released for North America and all other non-European/UK territories by Crucial Blast.

This undefinable mass of black amorphic horror is one of the most intense listens we've engaged in recently, a nihilistic pit of howling orchestral strings and blackened abstract doom, operatic female voices plunging into a fetid sewer of filth and blackness, equal parts avant black metal and splattered sludge and symphonic horror movie score. An overwhelming deathscape scrawled in jagged figures across pieces like \"My body is not a vessel, nor a temple.

On Dread, we're feeling an even heavier bass-assault compared to the other releases, and this is easily the heaviest Gnaw Their Tongues release yet. This monstrous, noxious bottom-end roar that skulks and slithers throughout the album suggests a foul fusion of Abruptum (which is still the closest reference point to Gnaw Their Tongue's black chaos) and Leonard Rosenman's most nightmarish film scores, piled in towering heaps of sadistic noise, warped orchestral strings, degraded samples, shrieking voices, and punishing lurching doom draped in suffocating atrmosphere. Hyper-abstract black metal sound-collage? Wagnerian avant-doom psychosis? That's one way of putting it, but Gnaw Their Tongues is ultimately impossible to pin down, defying simple categorization as this album plunges even deeper into a black pit of total cinematic horror, sexual perversion, and shapeless heaviosity.\r\n\r\nSTREAMING AUDIO SAMPLE:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.crucialblast.net/stream/01MyOrificesAwaitRavaging.m3u\">MY ORIFICES AWAIT RAVAGING</a>","options":[{"id":4698751,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/11931171/-/GTTgrandbig.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/11931171/-/GTTgrandbig.jpg","width":648,"height":265}],"artists":[{"id":23741,"name":"GNAW THEIR TONGUES","permalink":"gnaw-their-tongues","url":"/artist/gnaw-their-tongues"}],"categories":[{"id":317535,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":812521,"name":"Distro Items","permalink":"distro-items","url":"/category/distro-items"}]},{"id":2828324,"name":"NEKRASOV.

Early on, Nekrasov's sound was steeped in caustic noise, a blazing industrialized black metal assault that was doused in heavy levels of irradiated distortion and Merzbowian skree. But more recently, it's mutated into less metallic regions, alternating the hyperblast black metal with forays into crushing, demonic wall-noise and blasted ambience. Now, Nekrasov is back with a new full length (the first for Crucial Blast), and it's the most advanced slab of their blacknoize terror that we've heard so far. An octagonal prism of isolationist drone, flesh-rending mechanical black metal, abstract otherworldly beauty, claustrophobic industrial dread, and the most violent, suffocating strains of harsh noise, Extinction is pure cyclonic contempt for humanity.\r\nThe eight-song disc combines hyperspeed cybernetic blastscapes and bleak black metal riffage, the tracks often revealing snarled minor key melodies that are buried deep beneath blizzard blasts of machinegun drum machines, the drums veering through nerve-fraying rhythmic shifts, and acidic croaks bathed in black hiss. Triumphant frost-bitten riffs scream out of maelstroms of violent distortion, and Choral voices soar through a cyclone of helicoptering blastbeats and sheets of blown-out, ultra distorted drone, streaked with bits of gorgeous vibraphone-like melody, somber Hammond-like organ drones and looped synth, sometimes breaking off into grinding slo-motion industrial throb or swirling kosimiche drift. The tracks on Extinction go back and forth between the noisier, more industrial like material and overt black metal, though the two sides of Nekrasov's sound are always present together. When the sound does move into pure noise, it's either vast fields of minimal ambient drift, metallic clank and distant percussive sounds, utterly bleak Lustmordian soundscapes, or crushing, almost HNW-style slabs of molten noise, scouring waves of hellish skree and crushing slow-motion tidal surges of jet-black sonic syrup flecked with dubbed-out blasts of tectonic crush and electronic glitches that ripple across the void.\r\nClosing the album, the title track descends even further into black industrial crush, a monstrous, almost seventeen-minute long sprawl of plodding, simple drum pound echoing within a slowly swirling fog of distorted fx, churning, billowing black ambience, buried black buzz, an endless whirlpool of blown-out synthesizers and the immense black breath of leviathan lungs heaving deep below the surface.\r\nLike everything else from Nekrasov, this album is loaded with blasting inhuman drumming and ferocious riffing that form into noise-drenched trance-scapes of bestial industrial BM, but the attention to texture and sound sculpture elevates this above most mechanized black metal projects, with immersive layers of electronic sound, creative stereo panning techniques, and other production tricks that create a harsh, alien atmosphere that is pretty unique to Nekrasov's sound.

Slayer and Cannibal Corpse keep things theatrical, but on their new EP, Cleveland's Fistula tackle the all-too-real case of alleged rapist and murderer Anthony Sowell. The band cranks out ultra-distorted riffs over clattering drums; the vocals are an indecipherable howl of pain. Goat is a seriously ugly record, as befits its morbid and disturbing subject matter. The music is a buzzing, hostile roar. Samples of news coverage tell the story of sex crimes and the discovery of bodies (and body parts) in Sowell's home. The dispassionate narration, bolstered by grinding riffs, makes the whole thing even more depressing and bleak. There's no Cannibal Corpse-style shock value here — this is real death metal.\" — Phil Freeman, CLEVELAND SCENE\r\n\r\n\r\nOhio is rotting. Fistula once again team up with Crucial Blast to deliver another heavy dose of their septic, filthy, lumbering death-sludge in the form of Goat, a five-song Ep of low-fi and low-end nihilistic filth and rabies-laced caveman thrash with songs based on the ghoulish discovery and subsequent investigation of the eleven decomposing bodies found in the Cleveland home of Anthony Sowell in the Autumn of 2009. This new disc delivers more of the pulverizing, slime-covered sludge and primitive death metal rot that these Buckeye barbarians have been carving out in the back of Medina garages over the past ten years, continuing to follow in the coagulated blood tracks of Frost, Autopsy and Winter, but filtered through Fistula's uniquely mangled and inebriated scum-haze and utterly negatory worldview.

Each of these tracks averages around fourteen minutes, an extended death-rattle formed from black glacial riffs suspended in space, tectonic percussive rumbles, anguished shrieks of torment and abject suffering, deep guttural demon-toad throat singing, and endless sheets of glistening metallic feedback that spill and drift to the far edges of their extreme time-stretched ambient doom, a crumbling, blighted majesty, noxious ambient blackdoom adrift on putrescent tides. The wretched vocal effluvium creeps formlessly across austere slabs of crushing heaviness arranged into ghoulish constructs of atmospheric dread, moving so slow that the music seems to lose all sense of propulsion at times, becoming lost in a fog of howling amplifiers and buzzing feedback, the guitars stretched into massive decomposing drones, the spaces between infested with controlled bursts of drums that skitter and rumble, almost \"jazzy\" in a vague sort of way, but still incredibly slow and ponderous. Freed Of This Flesh inhabits the same sort of black-tar depths as the likes of Burning Witch, Monarch, Khanate, and Bunkur while stripping the slo-mo heaviness into their own twisted, skeletal configuration.

Rage Inside the Window takes the listener into the mind of a savagely depraved soul. Don't expect ambient of the spaced out, blissful, and softly textured variety. This is dirty and impenetrably dark, with an intertwining mass of demonic squalls, intense probing, highly ominous tonal drones, distant monolithic pulsations, and bleak isolationism. 6 lengthy tracks of pure psychological horror are presented here, with each piece segueing into each other in transforming waves, progressively getting darker, brooding, and more menacing as it goes. Finally, with the final track, some semblance of solace is achieved.

Compared to the perhaps darker, more layered sound of Megaptera, Negru Voda is stripped down, unrefined, and to the point – old school, true to form, and primitive industrial music heavily influenced by pioneering electronic artists such as Test Dept, S.P.K., The Klinik, Cabaret Voltaire, Severed Heads, and the like. Primarily built upon a strong foundation of punishing and persistent rhythms and cold, analogue pulsations, these are colossal soundscapes, where harsh, factory corrosion is met with insidious waves of distorted, electro-shock blasts streaked with highly ominous and bleak atmospherics as fueled by pints of lager, drams of Islay single malt, alienation, media wastelands, and cold Scandinavian winters.\r\nWith Vald de Luxe, Malignant presents a comprehensive 3CD overview of the complete Negru Voda sound, combining a slew of new, unpublished recordings, coupled with a collection of out of print, completely re-mastered works, including the full length Dark Territory CD (Old Europa Café, 1998), plus 3 bonus tracks, as well as the des Esseintes split 10” (Fin de Siecle, 2001) and the AVA: (dunk) picture 7” (Formosan, 2002). Also featured is the enlisted help of such notables as Magnus Sundstrom (des Esseintes, The Protagonist), Ulf Soderberg (Sephiroth), Kristoffer Oustand (V:28, K.N.O., Plague Machinery), and Christian Pallentin (P.A.L).\r\nFew can stake claim to the immeasurable influence and legacy of Peter Nystrom, and with Vald de Luxe, it becomes immediately evident that authentic, old school Swedish industrial still reigns supreme.

Six tracks is all it takes for the duo's second full-length to unleash more than 40 minutes of superb experimental noise that continues to take death industrial and power electronics into a new realm. \"Salvations Succumb to Rust\" starts things off with sinister low rumbles and manipulated vocals along with some more straightforward male/female vocal work, eventually leading up to a droning, semi-melodic dirge of distorted bass notes. There are even a few \"verses\" present, with faster vocal arrangements and concrete bass runs amidst various rugged layers of texture. \"Mindlock (Septic Utopia)\" uses looped samples and churning distorted textures with subtle ambient hums and feedback twisting around in the distance for its duration, but I really like the fact that you can make out most of the samples, as it creates a consistent and curious mood. An unlikely sample from an old Little Red Riding Hood record (or perhaps a cartoon) kicks off \"Frontal Lobe Castration\" prior to eerie feedback and drones laying the foundation for spoken female vocals - delivered as a narrative of sorts. \"Nihil Transmission\" is similar to \"Mindlock...\" in its repetition of samples and textures, though in this case the droning repetition has more of a hypnotic quality that I really appreciate - even though the content of the samples is a bit harder to discern. Then nine-minute \"Strength is Beauty\" begins with some distant sirens and shuffling, fluttering harsh noise with a few carefully placed melodic layers sweeping across the midrange from time to time. Garbled and indecipherable vocals break in for a brief section prior to an overloaded and somewhat thrashy set of bass runs (one in each speaker) and Helmkamp's token vocal snarls, later giving way to more of the spoken female vocals. More thick drones and a sample that I believe is in Russian begin the final track, \"Mourning Tsar\". After a great deal of repetition, some industrial sounds (clanging metal and such) and smooth ambient hums come in with a very unique melody (somehow performed on the bass). In fact, this is the most \"melodic\" track herein, though you wouldn't expect it at first. Very interesting work... The recording is right on the line: It's not quite lo-fi, but it's not pristine either. If it were me, I'd try to push it just a bit more towards the brighter, crisper direction so that the textures and details would really have room to show through, without shedding the atmosphere and warmth that the rawness adds. The sound remains uniform throughout, which is a positive, and I'm not at all bothered by the perceptible absence of acute clarity to some degree, so in the end it works out as is... though certain improvements could heighten the impact of the material. The layout consists primarily of (now former) Terror Organ member Lea Helmkamp posing nude in various positions and wielding a sledgehammer. The band logo and tracklist appear on the front cover, while the back cover shows a full color photo of some filthy children near some polluted black water next to an industrial site. There are also some nice vibrantly colored live photos inside, and the center spread shows an old image of some sort of odd medical procedure (it looks almost like it could be from a film or something). This is a great disc, and a definite progression for the group. The material is more cohesive and focused than their first full-length, and still original without straying too far from the tenets of its associated genres. I certainly look forward to hearing future efforts, as in my opinion Terror Organ is one of the remote few American acts that can match what has always best been delivered from European shores. Highly recommended.

Released on the little-known Wrotycz Records, Bocksholm offers us a icy cold slab of dark ambience, invaded by occasional loops of power electronics.\r\n\r\nThe album opener \"Franz Enokk the bastard\" is one of the coldest tracks I've heard in a while. It sounds exactly like someone trying to unzip their body bag, while the morgue comes to life. Mummification at it's best.\r\n\r\n\"The Haunting Curse\" is easily the best track here - a quiet number with the occasional horn, wind chimes, and some sudden loud soundscapes, it does exactly what it says on the tin - an aural, haunting nightmare.\r\n\r\n\"Rollermill Waltz\" - Yet another classic example of a title summing up the song. You can feel yourself walking through an abandoned (but not empty) fairground late at night. The track picks up with some wonderful and original drum loops. A Highlight.\r\n\r\n\"Pressbyran '78\" Opens the diversity of the release, an 8 minute opus, it starts with the usual intricate sounds, before exploding into fast drums, and some guitar riffs. Hell breaks loose, and Skogs-Sara is winning it's vicious mind game.\r\n\r\n\"Elektrik Swastika Lokomotiv\" is a 21 minute tapestry of deranged electronic chaos, rebellion, and the sound of a heart beating in a frozen jar. Around 8 minutes into this riot, a short barrage of noise and distant drums penetrates the senses, and the aforementioned organ explodes.\r\n\r\nThe conclusive track, \"Bira(th) anthem\" is like the worst comedown you could ever have. The Morgue is back, and the walls are torturing you with their echoes. The bittersweet Irony of this track is wonderful. This is as much an anthem as it is party music.\r\n\r\n\"The Haunting Curse Of Skogs-Sara\" is a success. It's creators have exorcised the ghost, and it torments us forever more in this; it's last recorded message.\r\n\r\nGold.

This is a highly personal recording, which takes some firm mature steps further into physical essence and digs deep into the walls of the mothers utero with its hypnotic drones and drenching layers of organic sounds from cymbals, stringinstruments, accordion and bass, all treated with great care and respect. Instrumental throughout, bicephalous in the way of screeching, shuddering sounds and drowsy in opposition. There is something strangely slippery about the recordings, a frightening, obtuse atmosphere embedded in silk and soft controlled feedback. Receivers take note: fully stunning in retrospect.

Bubbling organics merge with cold, isolationist subsonic layers to produce a cinematic rainy day soundtrack. \r\n\r\nThe first three pieces on this release flow into one another like wisps of toxic smoke twisting into the atmosphere. Second track Tropic of Cancer is introduced with a piercing reverberating tone, which gradually trails off into the distance, as the steady heartbeat rhythm of Rats & Ravens climbs upon its spine. Grainy, twisting echoes pounce and play with predatory delicacy until silence finally closes the album’s first movement.\r\n\r\nBook of Margins is simply gorgeous, rising from the silence with a calm refrain, lulling the listener into a false sense of security before shadowed bass distortions rise from the depths, flanked by curiously ominous percussive clangs and blips. \r\n\r\nThis cacophony melds into Painlevé, which opens with a blackened ambient drone that ebbs and flows like consciousness dawning upon slowly fluttering eyes. This piece gradually builds into a grating, metallic symphony of machine ambience and frenetic rhythms, before exploding into a clamourous, deconstructive crescendo, at last retreating back into the winding dark. August I shimmers and shifts like reflections on black glass, escalating from its abyss before giving way to the plaintive, tortured screams of the toiling miners wailing through the profundity of Polonium Symphony. Biological sounds loop and whine, like a quarrelsome sonic examination of intestinal processes. Beats like bones against plate steel and gutteral, thumping resonances hack and slash their way throughout the more than 15 minute-long piece, before the screams abate and those chirping night sounds of The Reckless Sleeper overtake us. The interplay of silence and sound is skillfully executed on this release, it is a massive achievement of aural sculpture, where space is created and manipulated to excellent effect.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":2521701,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/5775731/-/fon_13.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/5775731/-/fon_13.jpg","width":144,"height":144}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":317535,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":812521,"name":"Distro Items","permalink":"distro-items","url":"/category/distro-items"},{"id":5016280,"name":"SALE","permalink":"sale","url":"/category/sale"}]},{"id":651451,"name":"BEREFT.

The sound on this new album takes a far more confrontational approach, compared to the single, which had a darker, more death-industrial feel to it. \"Your Messiah Will Fail\" is certainly one of the most straightforward power-electronics recordings that BloodLust! has released in quite some time, and it falls somewhere alongside the high-fidelity assault of the recent Twodeadsluts Onegoodfuck 7-inch and the classic P.E. approach of Slogun -- all the while maintaining its own personality and style. Now expanded to a venomous two-piece group, as Andrew Grant [AKA The Vomit Arsonist] has joined Peter Lee [also the head honcho of the Force of Nature label] since the aforementioned single was released, the sound on this disc thoroughly defines what power-electronics means -- accosting the listener with a combination of harsh-yet-nuanced electronic sounds and potent vocals that feature prominently in the mix.

The sounds are augmented by some manic vocal screaming blending in with the noise intelligently. Maybe it's the influence of the dirt but I get a very organic feel with these tracks, the squirming synths begin to take on a gross slimy quality, like you are trapped in an early grave and are being eaten by worms.\r\n\r\nSide B is a bit more subdued using glitching feedback and synths to produce another bubbling track that has the quality of rotting materials. This actually somewhat reminds me of a harsher Harm Stryker material. The track starts out with bursts of glitch and rumbling feedback but lets itself go more and more until it is held back again. There are a lot of dynamics in this one which is fine by me, Black Meat know when to hold back and let go, the pacing is well thought out and all of the restraint just makes the all out noise that finally blasts through all that more effective. I really like the use of vocals in here, they are basically just another texture of noise layered on and rarely separate from the thick core of sounds. \r\n\r\n- BLOOD TIES WEBZINE","options":[{"id":4811361,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/12255901/-/blackmeat-c20.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/12255901/-/blackmeat-c20.jpg","width":168,"height":126}],"artists":[{"id":24051,"name":"BLACK MEAT","permalink":"black-meat","url":"/artist/black-meat"}],"categories":[{"id":812511,"name":"Cassettes","permalink":"cassettes","url":"/category/cassettes"},{"id":812521,"name":"Distro Items","permalink":"distro-items","url":"/category/distro-items"}]},{"id":406011,"name":"UNSOUND NYC.
