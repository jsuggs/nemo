Well, that's because it doesn't exist - but if it did, this game would be worthy of the official licence!\r\n<br /><br />Developed by Achim Volkers and Trevor Storey, this latest collaborative release from <a href=\"http://www.psytronik.net/\">Pystronik Software</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rgcd.co.uk\">RGCD</a> is all about high octane motors, big guns, risky high-speed vehicular pursuit and deadly force. Play the role of Captain James Hutch as he takes on the might of the ruthless drug baron 'El Guato'. The baron has infiltrated and spread corruption through the highest ranking positions within the police force and local government, meaning that you, your partner and your tricked-out squad car are all that stands in the way of El Guato and his henchmen taking control of the city. You've never dealt with a villain this powerful before but that won't stop you from bringing his empire to its knees!\r\n<br /><br />Featuring super-fast gameplay, awesome weapons, nine levels to blast your way through, superbly designed background graphics and amazing music this is one game you don't want to miss!\r\n<br /><br />The Vice Squad is a PAL only game, and has been confirmed working on the C64, C128 and C64GS.</p>\r\n<div class=\"video\"><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"300\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/_54HXH-e8-o\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>The standard cartridge version is packaged in a cardboard carton, whereas the deluxe version uses a modified plastic Universal Game Case. \r\n<br /><br />The cover art features an illustration by Smila and the game comes complete with a printed manual, an A3 poster (folded) and a vinyl RGCD sticker.

\"Smila\" Storey have returned with their first new collaborative game since their record-breaking successful hit <a href=\"http://rgcd.bigcartel.com/product/soulless\">Soulless</a>!\r\n<br /><br />Another <a href=\"http://www.psytronik.net/\">Psytronik</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rgcd.co.uk/\">RGCD</a> collaboration, Guns 'N' Ghosts delivers a long-awaited, original single or two-player arcade style experience to your C64 in all formats (cartridge, disk, tape and download).  Grab your shotgun, ready your psychic powers and help paranormal investigators Trev and Georg battle through 72 screens infested with zombies, skeletons and bats and various other spooks & spectres!\r\n<br /><br />Reports of supernatural sightings have been coming in from all over the country and Trev and Georg are on the case!  Georg is very handy with a shotgun, useful for getting rid of any unwanted zombies, reanimated skeletons or freakish lab experiments gone wrong, and Trev is gifted with incredible mind powers.  These give him a special link with the spirit-plane - and the ability to send demons back to whatever hell-hole they crawled out of.\r\n<br /><br />Guns 'N' Ghosts is an intense action game with a variety of play modes that offers a particularly rich two-player cooperative adventure, so get a friend round, plug in an extra joystick and kick some undead ass!</p>\r\n<div class=\"video\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/pU8duh6Pcvk?feature=player_detailpage\" width=\"400\"></iframe></div>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>The standard cartridge version is packaged in a cardboard carton, whereas the deluxe version uses a modified plastic Universal Game Case. \r\n<br /><br />The cover art features an illustration by Smila and the game comes complete with a printed manual, and seven vinyl stickers.

/>Jagware 2013 \r\n<br /><b>Compatibility:</b><br />PAL/NTSC \r\n<br /><br /><a href=\"http://jagware.org/\">Jagware</a> presents a new Atari Jaguar CD compilation of four puzzle games from four groups; Do The Same from <a href=\"http://www.cerebral-vortex.net/\">Cerebral Vortex</a>, Diamjag by <a href=\"http://onorisoft.free.fr/\">Orion</a>, Atomic Reloaded from <a href=\"http://removers.free.fr/\">The Removers</a>, and Beebris by <a href=\"http://reboot.atari.org/\">Reboot</a> - all four of which support online scoreboards.  But that's not all - also included is an exclusive early look at the alpha build of 'Project II', Reboot's ambitious forthcoming horizontal scrolling shmup.\r\n<br /><br />CVSD's <a href=\"http://dothesame.jagware.org/\">Do The Same</a> is a beautifully presented tile-rotation game where your goal is to match a given pattern of blocks in as few moves as possible (and before the time runs out).  A highly polished release featuring backgrounds based on hand-crafted clay models and 112 levels to beat, Do The Same was previously available on CD in very limited quantities - now those who missed it in physical form have the chance to grab it again!\r\n<br /><br />Next up is <a href=\"http://removers.free.fr/atomic/atomic.php\">Atomic Reloaded</a>, a logic puzzle game inspired by Thalion's Atomic in which you are tasked with creating molecules from their component atoms by moving them around a maze.  Described as 'Atomic as it should have been', Atomic Reloaded features 82 original levels guaranteed to challenge even veterans of the original!\r\n<br /><br /><a href=\"http://diamjag.jagware.org/\">Diamjag</a> is an early release from the prolific Jaguar coder Orion, in which you must guide a ball-like character around 28 single-screen mazes collecting diamonds - the catch being that when your ball starts rolling you wont stop again until you hit a wall!\r\n<br /><br />Reboot, the organisers of this project have contributed <a href=\"http://reboot.atari.org/new-reboot/beebris2.html\">Beebris</a>, their updated Jaguar conversion of one of Law's old Atari ST releases based on a 'popular tetronimo game'.  With four game modes, each with forty levels of difficulty, Beebris remains one of Reboots more popular additions to the Jaguar homebrew catalogue.\r\n<br /><br />Jagware Collection One is a superb compilation of games, but if you want further incentive to pick up a copy you may wish to consider that all profits made through sales of this Jagware release will be going toward funding future Jaguar hardware development by SCPCD, creator of the JagCF and the Jagtopus 4-cart programmer - the format on which future cartridge games will be distributed.</p>\r\n<div class=\"video\"><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/63371940?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>The physical release comes cellophane wrapped in a clear DVD box with full colour, double-sided printed inlay on a full face printed, glass-mastered CD, direct from the factory (100% professionally produced in the UK). Instructions for each game are included on the inside of the inlay.  It requires no additional hardware to run other than the Jaguar CD console itself.

the classic run 'n jump collect 'em up 'Sir Ababol' and mind-bending platform-puzzler 'Nanako in Classic Japanese Monster Castle'.\r\n<br /><br />Classic Japanese Monster Castle is the story of Nanako, who is on a quest to rescue her witch apprentice sister Mya from the Heún Tower.  Mya had disobeyed her mentor's orders and broke all the palace rules in order to visit the Heún Tower - as she wanted to improve her knowledge of dark magic.  Now it is up to Nanako to rescue her sister and avoid the army of Karakasas that stand in her way.\r\n<br /><br />In Sir Ababol, an unfortunate happenstance has left our hero without his sword.  The only way for him to retrieve his beloved blade is to collect wild poppies, scattered throughout the varois screens in this arcade adventure.  There is questing to be done, and it is up to you, Sir Ababol, to do it!\r\n<br /><br />Sir Ababol and Nanako In Classic Japanese Monster Castle have both been tested on both PAL and NTSC machines, and they work on the C64, C128 and C64GS (there is no keyboard input required to play). Although the games run on NTSC hardware, they do play fractionally faster. As such, the games are labelled as NTSC compatible, but designed for PAL systems. SID 8580 recommended.

The 64KB PCB is housed in a transparent purple cartridge shell illuminated by an internal LED.  The full game is also available for free download from the game's page at <a href=\"\">RGCD</a>.\r\n<br /><br />Please note that <a href=\"http://www.psytronik.net/\">Pystronik Software</a> are also selling the game on premium/budget disk and tape for £9.99/£4.99 and £3.99 respectively (plus shipping) via their <a href=\"http://www.binaryzone.org/retrostore/\">Binary Zone Retro Store</a>.\r\n<br /><br />The Psytronik version is a compilation of Sir Ababol, Nanako in Classic Japanese Monster Castle and UWOL: Quest for Money.

Sub Hunter is one of the few homebrew titles that has really stood the test of time well, with its varied level-to-level game design always keeping the player on their toes.\r\n<br /><br />This PAL/NTSC compatible cartridge version of the game features the intro sequence, instructions and main game all included within a GS-friendly joystick controlled menu system designed by Dr. Martin Wendt (enthusi). Some minor bugs were fixed (such as raster splits being improved), but otherwise it is the same as the previous version without the minor hassles associated with using disk or tape media.\r\n<div class=\"video\"><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/58779293?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>The standard cartridge version is packaged in a cardboard carton, whereas the deluxe version uses a modified plastic Universal Game Case.\r\n<br /><br />The game comes complete with a printed manual and a vinyl RGCD sticker.

Following our glowing <a href=\"http://www.rgcd.co.uk/2011/12/kobayashi-maru-atari-jaguar.html\">review</a> of an earlier build back in 2011, this version has been further updated and fine-tuned following player feedback for commercial release. Use your rotary controller (adjustable to allow for sensitivity of your particular spinner) or regular Jaguar pad to steer your warpship in this arcade space shooter, battling countless drones and huge boss craft in ever-tougher waves of attack. Featuring subtle use of the Jaguar's RMW graphics capabilities, background graphics blend together as you tear around in the upper atmosphere over four worlds.\r\n<br /><br />Kobayashi Maru: Final runs at 50/60 FPS (NTSC/PAL) written utilising a version of the new <a href=\"http://reboot.atari.org/new-reboot/raptor.html\">Raptor Engine</a> by Reboot and it can be played with either a rotary controller (such as Chaos Reins, Tyrant or Jonathan Ascough pad) or a regular Jaguar joypad. This retail version features updated graphics, new sound effects, webscores and of course supports Memory Track game saves.

procedurally generated maze shmup that plays like Pac Man with guns (and optionally with two players). The goal of each procedurally generated level is to eat all the crosses/dots, grab the key and head for the exit whilst collecting power-ups and merrily blasting away anything that gets in your way.\r\n<br /><br />Originally released as Get 'Em back at the end of 2011 as an entry in <a href=\"http://www.rgcd.co.uk/2011/05/c64-16kb-cartridge-game-development.html\">RGCD's C64 16KB Cartridge Competition</a>, everyone who played this great little game saw the promise behind the crude presentation. With a little encouragement and extra help from Sean and Ilija, Georg took the game back to the studio. Now, almost a year later, the final 'DX' version has finally arrived!\r\n<br /><br />Get 'Em DX is both NTSC and PAL compatible, and its joystick-only control means that it is even playable on the Commodore 64 GS console.

/>GCE 1982, TRSI 2009-12 \r\n<br /><b>Compatibility:</b><br />PAL C64/128/GS (8580 SID Recommended)\r\n<br /><br />Originally released at Breakpoint 2009, <a href=\"http://www.trsi.de/\">TRSI</a>'s C64 conversion of this Vectrex exclusive title is an amazing vector-based shmup that is quite unlike anything else on the Commodore, with its bizarre array of enemies, bullet-ricocheting blast 'em up action and unique visual style.\r\n<br /><br />Your goal in the <a href=\"http://www.rgcd.co.uk/2012/10/fortress-of-narzod-c64-2012.html\">Fortress of Narzod</a> is to successfully travel a series of three roadways leading to the Fortress then destroy the powerful Mystic Hurler who acts as guardian to Narzod himself. Once the Mystic Hurler is destroyed, the Fortress of Narzod and all the evil it contains will disintegrate before your eyes.\r\n<br /><br />Fortress of Narzod utilises the border areas of the screen to maximise the play area and the excellent 8580 soundtrack by Linus really takes this production to the next level. The game requires no keyboard input, so it will work on the C64GS, but unfortunately the full-screen action comes at a cost of not running on NTSC machines (sorry!).\r\n<br /><br />Through negotiating with Jay Smith of Smith Engineering/Western Technologies (via his son Spencer), RGCD finally have permission to sell the Commodore conversion of this classic game.

href=\"http://www.rgcd.co.uk/2012/08/quod-init-exit-c64-2012.html\">Quod Init Exit</a>'s simple design has stood the test of time admirably. Being fans of the game here at RGCD, when it was originally released Dr. Martin Wendt (enthusi) investigated the possibility of making a 16KB cartridge version of the game. However, the source code was unavailable and it was determined that the game was simply too big to fit on a small cartridge.\r\n<br /><br />A year later, we approached Simone Bevilacqua again, this time with a 64KB cartridge in mind. Martin wrote a wrapper and cartridge boot code for the compiled game binary, learning how the previously undocumented 64KB cartridge hardware worked in the process. This is the end result of that work.\r\n<br /><br />The player's goal in Quod Init Exit is simple: help Zampo the pig survive through a full day without dying of hunger or missing the toilet. You'll need to guide Zampo around the colourful screen of platforms in order to catch the yummy food that zips across horizontally, whilst simultaneously avoiding vials of unappetizing poison.  However, this is not all. Stuffing your belly full isn't the key to success. In Zampo's words, \"whatever goes in, comes out\" - to complete each level you'll also need to catch the toilet and ride it to victory.\r\n<br /><br />Quod Init Exit has been tested on both PAL and NTSC machines, and works on the C64, C128 and C64GS (there is no keyboard input required to play). Although it runs on NTSC hardware, it does play fractionally faster and will be harder as a direct result of this. As such, the game is labelled as NTSC compatible, but designed for PAL systems.

/>Aleksi Eeben 2006-12 \r\n<br /><b>Compatibility:</b><BR />PAL/NTSC C64/128/GS (6581 SID Recommended) \r\n<br /><br />RGCD and <a href=\"http://psytronik.net/\">Psytronik Software</a> are incredibly honoured to present to you two of the finest arcade games available for the Commodore 64, <a href=\"http://www.cncd.fi/aeeben/\">Aleksi Eeben</a>'s acclaimed Greenrunner and Redrunner – both upgraded and optimised to run on both PAL and NTSC machines. Not only that, but Aleksi has also managed to squeeze into the 64kb cartridge version an updated (and also NTSC fixed) version of Retroskoi+, converting your C64 computer into a two-oscillator monophonic synthesizer.\r\n<br /><br />Released back in 2006 at the Game Over(view) Freestyle Jam, <a href=\"http://www.rgcd.co.uk/2012/07/greenrunnerredrunnerretroskoi-c64-2012.html\">Greenrunner</a> literally blew the competition away with its frantic arcade gameplay and amazing mix of sampled speech and high quality soundtrack. It's a game so hardcore and visually intense that it's probable that even Jeff Minter would beg for mercy at the thought of having to beat all 100 levels.\r\n<br /><br />One year on, the bugs are back, and this time they are in full colour! Improving on the high-res character based graphics of the original, 2007's <a href=\"http://www.rgcd.co.uk/2012/07/greenrunnerredrunnerretroskoi-c64-2012.html\">Redrunner</a> challenges the player with an all new and improved 100 waves of chaos. Lock 'n' load!\r\n<br /><br />In addition to the two games, the cartridge-exclusive Retroskoi Plus is a 2-oscillator monophonic synth for the Commodore 64. This enhanced Plus version comes with additional preset sounds and a wider keyboard range. In short, using Retroskoi+ and an audio connector you can rock up to a gig, plug in the C64 and cartridge and use your Commodore as a synthesizer or noise box - no monitor or other peripherals required!\r\n<br /><br />Greenrunner, Redrunner and Retroskoi+ have been updated since their initial release to ensure NTSC and PAL compatibility, and the game menu joystick control means that the two games are even playable on the Commodore 64 GS console.

/>Georg Rottensteiner & Trevor Storey, 2012 \r\n<br /><b>Compatibility:</b><br />PAL/NTSC C64/128/GS \r\n<br /><br />RGCD (in association with <a href=\"http://www.psytronik.net/\">Psytronik Software</a>) are proud to present Georg Rottensteiner and Trevor Storey's long-awaited collaborative project <a href=\"http://csdb.dk/release/index.php?id=115523\">Soulless</a>. Our biggest game release to date, it was a real struggle to squeeze this epic adventure complete with full intro and outro sequences into the 64KB limit, but nonetheless Georg succeeded in releasing a cartridge version to go alongside the tape, disk and download releases on sale via Psytronik's <a href=\"http://www.binaryzone.org/retrostore/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=87\">online store</a>.\r\n<br /><br />A hybrid of Draconius and Impossible Mission, Soulless is an exploratory platformer that sees you playing the role of a betrayed King who has been transformed into a beast and trapped within an subterranean prison, your mission being to gather the soul-stones hidden throughout the 70+ screen underworld in order to regain your humanity. When collected, the soul-stones must be placed in the correct sequence within the chamber at the top of the map, but your quest will not be easy; not only is the underworld populated by foul traps and evil critters to avoid, but every time you play each of the stones will be hidden within a different object and their order randomised!\r\n<br /><br />Soulless is both NTSC and PAL compatible, and its joystick-only control means that it's even playable on the Commodore 64 GS console. The game comes in an internally LED illuminated purple transparent cartridge shell complete with two printed soul-stone sheets, an A3 map and poster, stickers, a companion CD containing 600MB of bonus material and a 16 page comic/instruction booklet!\r\n<br /><br />These extras come at a cost though, and we at RGCD appreciate that the price tag may be too expensive for some. This is why we have also provided the option (in the destination box below) for customers to buy the boxed cartridge only at a reduced price. The game, instructions, map and soul-stone sheets can also be downloaded <a href=\"http://downloads.rgcd.co.uk/games/soulless/soulless-final.zip\">here</a>.\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>The standard cartridge version is packaged in a cardboard carton, whereas the deluxe version uses a modified plastic Universal Game Case.\r\n<br /><br />The cover art features an illustration by Smila and the game comes complete with two printed soul-stone sheets, an A3 map and poster, stickers, a companion CD containing 600MB of bonus material and a 16 page comic/instruction booklet!  The 64KB PCB is housed in a transparent purple cartridge shell illuminated by an internal LED.\r\n<br /><br />Please note that <a href=\"http://www.psytronik.net/\">Pystronik Software</a> are also selling the game on disk and tape and as a download for £14.99/£9.99, £4.99 and £1.99 respectively (plus shipping).

/>The Mojon Twins, 2006-12 \r\n<br /><b>Compatibility:</b><br />PAL/NTSC C64/128/GS \r\n<br /><br />RGCD present our very first 64KB cartridge with Algarbi's official conversion of The Mojon Twins' <a href=\"http://www.mojontwins.com/juegos_mojonos/uwol-quest-for-money-c64/\">UWOL: Quest For Money</a>. Originally released back in 2010, the C64 port of this superb little platformer has stood the test of time admirably and remains as enjoyable today as was on its initial release. With the ZX Spectrum game designer na_th_an on board, Algarbi rewriting the code and Conrad on soundtrack duties, UWOL's classic arcade design and addictive gameplay translated over to the C64 to create a game that's arguably better than the original.\r\n<br /><br />This cartridge version by iAN COOG was actually created to test our new 64KB PCBs, but it proved to be so much fun that we just had to look into the possibility of publishing it with The Mojons' permission. After a few quick emails and deals signed and secured, the final release candidate arrived at RGCD HQ ready for production - and now you too can own a physical copy of this great C64 conversion and guide UWOL back through Storm Mansion's cellar labyrinth on his quest for money!\r\n<br /><br />UWOL is both NTSC and PAL compatible, and its joystick-only control means that it's even playable on the Commodore 64 GS console.

are proud to present to you <a href=\"http://noname.c64.org/csdb/release/?id=103161\">Panic Analogue</a>, a fast-paced and highly addictive analogue paddle controlled game for one or two players. The game was developed as an entry for the RGCD <a href=\"http://www.rgcd.co.uk/2011/05/c64-16kb-cartridge-game-development.html\">16KB Cartridge Game Development Competition</a> (2011) and came third place out of 11 entries. Easy to learn, almost impossible to master, each of the 14 procedurally generated levels are carefully designed to challenge every kind of gamer - as well as offering almost unlimited replayability.\r\n<br /><br />Your objective is to keep poor little Redhead alive, trapped in his cave. It's a cruel world in there with droplets of water and fireballs constantly falling from above. In order to survive he has to collect every water droplet in his mouth to stay fresh, and keep his torch alit by catching the fireballs. If a water droplet hits the torch things will go very wrong - and swallowing a fireball of course also leads to pure catastrophe!\r\n<br /><br />NTSC and PAL compatible, Panic Analogue even works on the GS - the only requirement being a pair of analogue paddles. The original Commodore variety or Atari 2600 'Tennis' controllers will do fine, and the game <a href=\"http://www.redcrab.se/sideways/\">website</a> even gives instructions for making your own!</p>\r\n<div class=\"video\"><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/61204311?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>The standard cartridge version is packaged in a cardboard carton, whereas the deluxe version uses a modified plastic Universal Game Case.\r\n<br /><br />The cover art features an illustration by <a href=\"http://www.redcrab.se/\">Redcrab</a> and the game comes complete with a printed manual and a vinyl Goin' Sideways sticker.

href=\"http://www.rgcd.co.uk/2011/12/c64anabalt-c64-2011.html\">C64anabalt</a> is an official conversion of Adam Atomic & Danny B.'s award winning single-button 2009 indie game <a href=\"http://adamatomic.com/canabalt/\">Canabalt</a> for the 8-Bit, 64KB RAM, 1Mhz Commodore 64 home computer developed by Paul Koller (<a href=\"http://noname.c64.org/csdb/scener/?id=21728\">Paulko64</a>). This particular version was designed to run from a 16KB cartridge (although there are also tape and disk versions available to download as well).\r\n<br /><br />The game was developed as an entry for the RGCD <a href=\"http://www.rgcd.co.uk/2011/05/c64-16kb-cartridge-game-development.html\">16KB Cartridge Game Development Competition</a> (2011), and the name C64anabalt was suggested by Adam Atomic himself. The physics and procedural algorithms are based on those documented in the original game's open source code.\r\n<br /><br />There are two versions of C64anabalt available; one with a SID chip conversion of Danny B.'s original score by Mikkel Hastrup (Encore), and an alternative build featuring music from the PC indie game ThrustBurst by Andreas Slotte (Ghormak). Unfortunately it wasn't possible to fit them both into a single 16KB ROM, so we've made two versions available.\r\n<br /><br />Please note that C64anabalt is compatible with NTSC C64's, but lacks the static parallax background cityscape (the background scrolls instead) and it stutters slightly at high running speeds (due to the NTSC machine having less CPU time available). The game also plays fractionally faster than the PAL version. None of these issues severely affect the play of the game, but it should be noted that the game was coded specifically for PAL machines.

/>Cosine, 2011 \r\n<br /><b>Compatibility:</b><br />PAL/NTSC C64/128/GS \r\n<br /><br />Shortly after releasing the <a href=\"http://noname.c64.org/csdb/release/?id=76950\">C64DTV<a> version of the Blok Copy in 2009, T.M.R mailed me a feature complete C64 version of the game using the original PET version's character graphics as temporary placeholders. Then in mid 2011, a video of a beta version of the game with proper multicolour graphics popped up on YouTube, with a comment suggesting that it may be suitable for a 16KB cartridge release. This game is the end result; Cosine's entry for the <a href=\"http://www.rgcd.co.uk/2011/05/c64-16kb-cartridge-game-development.html\">2011 RGCD 16KB Cartridge Development Competition</a>.\r\n<br /><br />The player's objective in <a href=\"http://noname.c64.org/csdb/release/?id=103158\">Blok Copy</a> is simple; the playfield contains seven numbered and distinctly different patterned tiles arranged into columns of five. At the start of each level the tiles are shuffled around, with the number of moves increasing as you progress through the game. The player must then reorganise the tiles to resemble their starting order against the clock to progress to the next stage until all ten levels have been successfully resynchronised. Blok Copy plays similarly to a two-dimensional Rubik's cube (if you can imagine such a thing); instead of moving the blocks independently, you select a row/column via the joystick controlled cursor and rotate it either up, down, left or right.\r\n<br /><br />The game has been tested on both PAL and NTSC machines, and works on the C64, C128 and C64GS (there is no keyboard input required to play). It comes boxed with a printed manual, and the cartridge is a transparent split candy-coloured shell containing an internal bright LED so that it emits a glow when plugged in.\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>The standard cartridge version is packaged in a cardboard carton, whereas the deluxe version uses a modified plastic Universal Game Case.\r\n<br /><br />The cover art features an illustration by Smila and the game comes complete with a printed manual and a vinyl RGCD sticker. The 16KB PCB is housed in a transparent split candy-coloured cartridge shell illuminated by an internal LED.  The full game is also available for free download from the <a href=\"http://noname.c64.org/csdb/release/?id=103158\">Commodore Scene Database</a>

/>Cosine, 2011 \r\n<br /><b>Compatibility:</b><br />PAL/NTSC C64/128/GS\r\n<br /><br />Some games require a back story, whereas other games don't. <a href=\"http://www.cosine.org.uk/\">Cosine</a>'s <a href=\"http://noname.c64.org/csdb/release/?id=102047\">Edge Grinder</a> falls into the second category. There's no need for an elaborate and clichéd plot detailing how you are mankind's last hope against yet another race of hyper-violent alien invaders hell-bent on destroying planet Earth; Edge Grinder is a game about scoring points, blowing shit up and grinding walls. And that is all there is to it.\r\n<br /><br />During the early stages of development it became apparent that a 16KB cartridge version of the game would be possible. This discovery coincided with the launch of RGCD's cartridge game development competition, and it was decided that rather than being an entry, Edge Grinder would instead act as a benchmark, showing what was possible within the limitations of a 16KB rom. And Edge Grinder uses near enough every last byte of that space!\r\n<br /><br />The end result of several months work is a Caravan-style, frenetic and challenging score-attack shmup. Edge Grinder only features one level, the goal being to survive the duration whilst simultaneously amassing as many points as possible by blasting enemies and flying dangerously close to the scenery. Compete against your friends, blog your high score online and brag about how you can beat Edge Grinder on one life! As with all set-length games there is a maximum possible score, but who will hold the record?\r\n<div class=\"video\"><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/61413798?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>The standard cartridge version is packaged in a cardboard carton, whereas the deluxe version uses a modified plastic Universal Game Case.\r\n<br /><br />The cover art features an illustration by Smila and the game comes complete with a printed manual and a vinyl RGCD sticker.

href=\"http://www.rgcd.co.uk/2013/03/not-even-human-inhumane-edition-c64-2011.html\">Not Even Human - Inhumane Edition</a> is a frantic-paced two-player strategic alien battle game. With the addition of an AI 'practice mode' since the initial release, this competitive game gained a lot of fans when it was made publicly available for download, and the original concept (enthusi), graphics (ptoing) and musical score (conrad) still feel fresh today.\r\n<br /><br />Not Even Human has been tested on PAL/NTSC machines and has been confirmed as C64/128 compatible. The game is also playable on the Commodore GS, but lacks the AI mode or the ability to change colour schemes (due to the lack of keyboard).\r\n<div class=\"video\"><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/61204310?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>The standard cartridge version is packaged in a cardboard carton, whereas the deluxe version uses a modified plastic Universal Game Case.\r\n<br /><br />The cover art features an illustration by <a href=\"http://ilkke.blogspot.com/\">iLKke</a> and the game comes complete with a printed manual and a vinyl RGCD sticker.

Then we moved on to these slimline cardboard cartons, using matt-finish stickers to decorate the box.  Finally, we've upgraded again to using glossy 140gsm adhesive photopaper for what we consider to be our best finish yet (aside from the 'Deluxe' Universal Game Cases).\r\n\r\nIs your RGCD collection looking a bit worn out?
