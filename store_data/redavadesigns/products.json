The pod was cast in nickel-free bronze using lost-wax casting. I start with a wax model, and then a plaster mold is made from the wax. Liquid metal is poured into the mold and heated in a kiln to create the final pod, which is then tumbled, tumbled, and tumbled again, and polished to bring out the shine. The pod measures 20mm. The necklace measures 22\" long. It hangs from a silver rollo chain with an arrow and heart clasp. Chain can be shortened upon purchase.\r\n\r\nThe deep indentations in the pod made it very tricky to cast, but give the finished product amazing depth and texture. The look of this beautiful necklace is both organic and space-age. It will compliment just about anything you wear it with and is attention-getting and distinctive, with just the right touch of mod glam.\r\n\r\nFor $69, the necklace can be cast in sterling silver; please convo me if you would like it in silver.

The bale has a floral vine pattern, with a sterling silver chain and a silver dragonfly clasp. It has been oxidized and polished by hand. Pendant measures 1\" wide and 1.25\" high, on a 16\" sterling cable chain.\r\n\r\nDragonflies are creatures of both wind and water. The wind signifies change, while water is associated with dreaming and the subconscious. The dragonfly symbolizes subconscious dreams coming to the surface and its short life reminds us that life is fleeting. It also symbolizes renewal.","options":[{"id":11852486,"name":"Default","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.55,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.55,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/34332752/-/RedAvaDesigns_1.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/34332752/-/RedAvaDesigns_1.JPG","width":1000,"height":837}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1462221,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]},{"id":3532820,"name":"Sterling Wood Grain Ring","permalink":"sterling-wood-grain-ring","position":3,"price":65.0,"default_price":65.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sterling-wood-grain-ring","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-04-03T03:56:46.000Z","description":"This ring is completely hand-made.
