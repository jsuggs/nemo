It is funny because I just created because I needed to get rid of my magazine collection and I wore it school the next day and everyone thought it was really cute. It is a really unique product that stands out and makes a big statement. Attached to elastic band with a little pearl in the middle it is very simple and easy to put on. It has a layer of glue on it so it won't rip easy but I don't reccommend wearing it on a rainyday without an umbrella. If you want a certain colour scheme or a special celebrity on your piece please email me at ella_4561@hotmail.com.

Roses have such an elegant romantic feel to them and thats why I love them so much. I made this piece to make you feel pretty and very feminine looking. Thats what every girl wants right? This piece is attached to a hair pin but if you would prefer to have it on a headband just email me and you can pay and extra 50 cents.
