In Ossie's signature crepe fabric with chiffon bell shaped sleeves and a figure skimming cut. The deep V neckline and open-back style is reminiscent of his famous, sought after 'Cuddly' design. The chiffon ties at the neck before draping over the the open back. There are further ties at the back of the waist. Below the ties is a further open area of fabric, which isn't quite visible in the picture as the ties drape over the area. From the waist down the dress is lined.\r\n\r\nThis is a rare and sought after item and is in particularly good condition. Due to the nature of the crepe fabric, many vintage Ossie Clark dresses suffer from thread pulls and iron shine. This dress appears to be hardly worn. The crepe fabric is in excellent condition. The elastic at the cuffs has is showing some slight deterioration. This is really a minor issue - there is about half an inch near the seam of each cuff where the elastic has come away. This does not effect the rouching of the cuffs. \r\n\r\nThe dress states size 10. It is approximately a UK size 8.
