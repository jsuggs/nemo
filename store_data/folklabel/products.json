At the time of his birth in 1826 there were some 23 miles of track, but by by the 1840’s railroad engineers were in high demand as the rails spread out in all directions. With today's ease of transportation it is difficult to think of a railroad as a technological revolution, but each section of rail turned days of travel into mere hours, which fostered trade and improved quality of life.\r\n\r\nAfter working on a number of railroads in the Northeast, Judah headed to California to build the first railroad west of the Mississippi. But, Judah was preoccupied with an even greater vision; a transcontinental railway that would <strong>connect the east coast to the west coast</strong>. His passion on the subject earned him the affectionate nickname \"Crazy Judah\" because at the time many considered this an impossible feat. Judah, on the other hand <strong>believed that not only COULD it be done, but that IT MUST be done</strong>. So, he set out on his mission to make it so.\r\n\r\nLittle by little through scouting, surveying, lobbying, and tireless fundraising Judah painted a vision of a nation united by a ribbon of iron rails. He did not live to see it built, but his effort laid the tracks for a cause that would unite a nation... literally; <strong>proving that with perseverance and tenacity, the impossible… is sometimes possible.</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>\"Never give up trying to build the world you can see, even if others can't see it.\" ~ Simon Sinek</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Move with purpose.</strong>","options":[{"id":12447668,"name":"unisex - Small","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12447670,"name":"unisex - Medium","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12447672,"name":"unisex - Large","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12447674,"name":"unisex - XLarge","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12447676,"name":"womens - Small","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12447678,"name":"womens - Medium","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12447680,"name":"womens - Large","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.95,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.95,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.95,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.95,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/40175935/-/MWP_main.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/40175935/-/MWP_main.jpg","width":590,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37645382/-/MWP-Indoor-2-1020.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37645382/-/MWP-Indoor-2-1020.jpg","width":590,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37647070/-/MWP-Indoor-0879.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37647070/-/MWP-Indoor-0879.jpg","width":590,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37645166/-/MWP-Indoor-2-1168.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37645166/-/MWP-Indoor-2-1168.jpg","width":590,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38676927/-/mwp_coaster2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38676927/-/mwp_coaster2.jpg","width":590,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1680505,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":3713772,"name":"Soar","permalink":"soar","position":2,"price":19.0,"default_price":19.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/soar","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-05-07T04:30:21.000Z","description":"<h4>Discover: Your Wings</h4>\r\n\r\n<em>“People who soar are those who refuse to sit back, sigh and wish things would change.

When it began, Apple Computer, was a two man company launched in the garage of Steve Jobs’ parents’ home. We all know the Company and the man behind it, but back then it was just the dream of a young college dropout <strong>beginning the journey of his life</strong>.\r\n\r\nIn his 2005 commencement address to the graduating class of Stanford, Jobs tells the story of how he was given up for adoption by his young, unwed college student mother. His parents promised the young mother that her son would one day attend college. And 17 years later he did indeed go to college, only to find that he didn’t have a clue what he wanted to do with his life and felt that the expense of school was a drain on his parents’ life savings - so his journey took a turn and he dropped out. It was a scary move, but looking back he says it was one of the best decisions he ever made. For him, dropping out did not mean leaving, it meant <strong>being free</strong> to drop in all the classes he found interesting and skip out on the ones he didn’t. One of these classes was a calligraphy class that fed his love for beautiful typography, which influenced the function of the first Apple computer. It was through this open journey that he discovered “you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future” and <strong>explore the path they will lead you to</strong>.\r\n\r\n<em>\"<strong>You've got to find what you love</strong>. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.

Graham's father was a doctor who specialized in nervous disorders and was quite interested in diagnosis through attention to physical movement. This foundational belief in the body’s ability to express its inner senses was crucial in Graham’s developing a desire to dance, although she did not find  her calling until she was in her teens.\r\n\r\nHer early performances were not generally well-received. She expressed her view of the world with strong, precise movement, charged with beauty and emotion that was vastly different from everything that preceded it. Before Graham, dance was an expression of glamor and grace, not raw emotion. Through her spastic movements, tremblings, and falls she expressed emotional and spiritual themes ignored by other dance... <strong>which would leave everything that  came after it indelibly changed</strong>.\r\n\r\nGraham, <em>the mother of modern dance</em>, found that <strong>through movement she could \"speak\" a new language</strong>, and used  it to tell the story of the passion, the rage and the ecstasy common to  human experience. Her story of life and how she chose to express it sent a rift through the dance world, leaving in its wake a level of intense inspiration that can be compared to what Stravinsky did to music, Picasso did to the visual arts, or Frank Lloyd Wright did for architecture.\r\n\r\n<strong>Find what moves you and share it with the world!</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>What's inspires you?</strong> <i>Figured it out?</i> Please <a href=\"http://folklabel.com/your-story\">share it with us</a>.\r\n","options":[{"id":12447684,"name":"unisex (heavy metal) - Small","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12447686,"name":"unisex (heavy metal) - Medium","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12447688,"name":"unisex (heavy metal) - Large","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12447690,"name":"unisex (heavy metal) - XLarge","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12447692,"name":"womens (vintage teal) - Small","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12447694,"name":"womens (vintage teal) - Medium","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12447696,"name":"womens (vintage teal) - Large","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.95,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.95,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.95,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.95,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38620815/-/INSP_main.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38620815/-/INSP_main.jpg","width":590,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37414640/-/Insp-Indoor-2-1043.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37414640/-/Insp-Indoor-2-1043.jpg","width":590,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37414648/-/Insp-Indoor-2-1046.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37414648/-/Insp-Indoor-2-1046.jpg","width":590,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37386722/-/Insp-Outdoor-1-1369.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37386722/-/Insp-Outdoor-1-1369.jpg","width":590,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38676807/-/insp_coaster2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38676807/-/insp_coaster2.jpg","width":590,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1680505,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":3149443,"name":"Geared for Life","permalink":"geared-for-life","position":6,"price":19.0,"default_price":19.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/geared-for-life","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-01-18T01:57:52.000Z","description":"<h4>Seek: Meaning</h4>\r\n\r\n<i>\"To make our way, we must have firm resolve, persistence, tenacity.

The turning of one gear to turn another, each has a purpose, but must <strong>find the right groove</strong> in order for the whole thing to work together as a system.\r\n\r\nNick Sambrato is a man who has heard the calling simply-complex machinery. Nick runs <a href=\"http://mamas-sauce.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mama's Sauce</a>, a boutique print and design shoppe in Orlando, Florida. There, a small band of craftsman utilize Letterpress equipment from days past to<strong> transform ordinary paper into works of art</strong>. Nick believes, \"Letterpress machines are beautiful. They move incredibly - you instantly see the ingenuity behind it and think of the great minds that put this together. It's mind boggling.\" (read the full interview by Grain &amp; Gram <a href=\"http://www.grainandgram.com/nicksambrato/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>)\r\n\r\nPart of his fascination of the machines comes from their transparency. Unlike many of today's products that get encased in a sleekly designed outer shell, Letterpress machinery is completely visible. The individual parts are exposed, allowing you to follow the entire process with your eyes and ears.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious from Nick's words, the focus of his gaze, and the sweat on his brow that <strong>he as found the groove where he belongs</strong>. That is what Geared for Life is all about.\r\n\r\n<em>\"By showing and striving for quality in what you do, you can show that you are striving for quality in who you are.\"</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Find your groove!</strong>\r\n\r\nBe sure to <a href=\"http://folklabel.com/blog/geared-for-life/\">see the full blog post</a> for Nick's video. \r\n\r\n<i>Have you found your groove or are you still searching for it?</i> Please <a href=\"http://folklabel.com/your-story\">share your story with us</a>.","options":[{"id":12399176,"name":"unisex - Small","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12399178,"name":"unisex - Medium","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12399180,"name":"unisex - Large","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12399182,"name":"unisex - XLarge","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12399184,"name":"womens - Small","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12399186,"name":"womens - Medium","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12399188,"name":"womens - Large","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.95,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.95,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.95,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.95,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38210852/-/GFL_main.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38210852/-/GFL_main.jpg","width":590,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37385402/-/GFL-Indoor-0511.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37385402/-/GFL-Indoor-0511.jpg","width":590,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37385410/-/GFL-Indoor-0501.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37385410/-/GFL-Indoor-0501.jpg","width":590,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37633014/-/GFL-Outdoor-1-1336.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37633014/-/GFL-Outdoor-1-1336.jpg","width":590,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38676791/-/gfl_coaster2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38676791/-/gfl_coaster2.jpg","width":590,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1680505,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":3149429,"name":"Enjoy The Ride","permalink":"enjoy-the-ride","position":7,"price":19.0,"default_price":19.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/enjoy-the-ride","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-01-18T01:55:30.000Z","description":"<h4>Find: Balance</h4>\r\n\r\nAtop a six-foot-tall large-wheeled Ordinary bike, also known as a <a href=\"http://folklabel.com/img/productpage/stevens.jpg\" class=\"popup\">penny-farthing</a>, Thomas Stevens set out of San Francisco at 8 o’clock on April 22, 1884 on a <strong>journey to become the first person to pedal across the country on a bicycle</strong>. He loaded up a handlebar bag with socks, a spare shirt, a raincoat, and a .38-calibre Smith & Wesson and set out on his mighty effort encompassing some 3700 miles of rough wagon trails, railways, canal towpaths and irregular public roads. His adventure would take 83 and a half days of traveling (over a third had to be walked because it was too rough to ride) and 20 days stoppage for inclement weather, but on August 4, 1884 Mr. Stevens completed the first transcontinental bicycle ride as he rolled into Boston.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens went on to continue his trek across the oceans, making his way around the globe. In the end, <strong>it wasn't about the estimated 13,500 miles he rode, but rather the amazing stories he gathered and the interesting people he met along the way</strong>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Wherever your journey takes you... enjoy the ride.</strong>\r\n\r\n<i>Have a fascinating, bike-related story?</i> Please <a href=\"http://folklabel.com/your-story\">share it with us</a>.\r\n","options":[{"id":10756999,"name":"unisex - Small","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":11426802,"name":"unisex - Medium","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":11426804,"name":"unisex - Large","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":11426806,"name":"unisex - XLarge","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":11426808,"name":"womens - Small","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":11426810,"name":"womens - Medium","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":11426812,"name":"womens - Large","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.95,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":11.95,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.95,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":13.95,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37869508/-/ETR_main.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37869508/-/ETR_main.jpg","width":590,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37307812/-/ETR-Indoor-2-1322.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37307812/-/ETR-Indoor-2-1322.jpg","width":590,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37307824/-/ETR-Indoor-2-1323.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37307824/-/ETR-Indoor-2-1323.jpg","width":590,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37307836/-/ETR-Outdoor-1-1301.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37307836/-/ETR-Outdoor-1-1301.jpg","width":590,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38676759/-/etr_coaster2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38676759/-/etr_coaster2.jpg","width":590,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1680505,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]}]
