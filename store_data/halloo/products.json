It was supposed to be a dumb comment, but regardless, it turned into a tongue-in-cheek study for a series of the woman in nature. Looking at colloquial terms for female genitalia, which seem to be predominately nature-based, I illustrated them in their 'natural' form.\r\n\r\n3 colour Risograph print. Signed A3.

Dismayed at the poor manufacturing and design quality of Victorian goods, he curated a show that exposed and dissected the poor workmanship, hideous form and garish design now synonymous with Victorian taste. His friend, Henry Morely, visited and was inspired to write a satirical essay on the mental degradation of a neurotic man forced to live in a house filled with these manufactured 'horrors'. Funny and beautifully observed, still relevant to any suffering designer, the essay is accompanied with an introduction to the historical contexts of the piece, and side notes throughout.\r\n\r\nFor more pics, visit HALLOO's zine <a href=\"http://cargocollective.com/halloo/1848871/Zine-2-The-House-of-Horror\">blog </a>","options":[{"id":13978625,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41567815/-/hohbg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41567815/-/hohbg.jpg","width":636,"height":669}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":4241473,"name":"#1 - The Offline Other","permalink":"1-the-offline-other","position":4,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/1-the-offline-other","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-08-11T16:23:58.000Z","description":"[ONLY 4 REMAINING]\r\n\r\nHALLOO's first zine is a sum of parts from all over the world. Designed in Melbourne, HALLOO worked with UK writer Dean Brown, on his essay The Offline Other, and the <a href=\"http://laptopogram.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Laptopograms</a> of Italian creative Aditya Mandayam.\r\n\r\nWritten as a criticism of our growing reliance and familiarity of social networking, Brown writes as an outsider, seeking the answers of our dependency and is prophetical of the future. Together with Mandayam's imagery - photographs printed from the light exposure of a laptop screen - the zine is a reflective artifact of 2011.\r\n\r\nFor more pics, go to HALLOO's zine <a href=\"http://cargocollective.com/halloo/1848191/Zine-1-The-Offline-Other\"> blog</a>","options":[{"id":13977505,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41567807/-/ottbg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41567807/-/ottbg.jpg","width":636,"height":669}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
