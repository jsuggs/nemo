She bore him 2 sons who were corrupted by their father. Although a dedicated wife and mother, she always maintained her faith. After 18 years, she convinced her husband to repent. But, it was too late to save his life. He was killed by his enemies. The sons sought revenge and Rita convinced them to set aside their hate. They died of natural causes within the year. She was then accepted to the convent at Cascia where she served with acts of goodness for the remainder of her life.

He surrendered all of his worldly possessions and vowed a life of poverty in devotion to God, unknowingly founding the Franciscan order of monks. He received the marks of Stigmata, appearing only on the most devout of followers. He is often shown with the marks. He may be shown with skull, cross, animals.

Commonly found in and around granite, mica is incorporated into a variety of regional arts & crafts, including the wonderfully practical micaceous clay pottery of the Spanish Colonial Arts tradition.  (See examples at Tintero Gallery in Old Town).  The mica not only adds an enchanting glow to the pottery, but also helps the pottery to retain heat, making it ideal bakeware.  \r\n\r\nMica can be added to your retablo painting either mixed in with the pigment for a subtle shimmer and texture or after the pigment is applied for a more snow-like effect.  \r\n\r\nThe mica is very light, but for convenience, I'm packaging it in the same containers as the pigments, approximately 1oz by volume.\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia:  The word \"mica\" is derived from the Latin word mica, meaning \"a crumb\", and probably influenced by micare, \"to glitter\".
