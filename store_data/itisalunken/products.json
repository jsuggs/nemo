MK32/BOUND AND DROWNED\r\n\r\nHow it happened: A track bearing the moniker [signature; nickname] BOUND instead of MK gets into the pool somehow; a second BOUND is written in answer [reaction; rejoinder; antiphony].  It doesn’t require a leap [soar; jolt] to see why an idea emerges to do a record. Leap [dive; bound] at the chance with Twilight Luggage.\r\nWhere the BOUND comes from: It seems to be low [depression; nadir] frequency dissonance; additional bass weight for kicks [buzz; thrill]; noise is slower down there. For heightened [delicate] focus [concentrate]. Feint [stratagem; manoeuvre] of noise; revealing noise [resonance; silence]. A series of documenting [essays; evidences]; [icons; depictions; snapshots] of developmental stages in the music making. Ideas completed thoroughly [painstakingly] and through to conclusion. The research leads us back to a MK: it can be said that the final track on the record is the informed result of what went before it [a priori].\r\nDescriptively: BOUND is the sound of experiments exploring the noise side of IT'S A LUNKEN and how to get back from it, with an evaluation of findings in the guise of an apocalyptic sludged-out dirge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n£6.66 +P&P to your area.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe album is available to download for free or to order on CD-R from www.twilightluggage.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":9543912,"name":"Default","price":6.66,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26185684/-/SDC15657.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26185684/-/SDC15657.jpeg","width":580,"height":435}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":274484,"name":"Cassettes","permalink":"cassettes","url":"/category/cassettes"}]}]
