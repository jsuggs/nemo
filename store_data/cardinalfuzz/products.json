Waving the ‘psych-my-delic’ banner,  The Shine Brothers epitomise the seedier side of music with a mind melting collection of garage psych. But look out as The Shine Brothers achieve an alchemic balance of slanted sunshine pop song structures with howling devilish rhythms, crowned by dirty, weaving vocal harmonies with tracks veering from Beatles like sunshine pop to frenzied fuzz induced E.P.I. freakouts. \r\n\r\nThe Shine Brothers’ ensemble includes Nate Ryan (ex The Black Angels), Colin Ryan (ex   Woven Bones), Oakley Munson (ex The Rondelles), and Ryan Rapsys (ex Too Many Bands To Name). \r\nLP comes with a download code that also features 3 bonus tracks.\r\n\r\n500 Press. 200 on Red Vinyl of which 150 are for sale through the Cardinal Fuzz Big Cartel Store Page\r\n\r\nAvailable from the big cartel store a few weeks before the official release date of 27th January 2014\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":46804674,"name":"Default","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126592929/-/photo_(1).JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126592929/-/photo_(1).JPG","width":932,"height":932}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4707223,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":12901518,"name":"Lantern - Rock n Roll Rorschach £14 (Ltd Gold Vinyl with free bonus cd with 4 bonus tracks)","permalink":"lantern-rock-n-roll-rorschach-14-ltd-gold-vinyl-with-free-bonus-cd-with-4-bonus-tracks","position":2,"price":14.0,"default_price":14.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lantern-rock-n-roll-rorschach-14-ltd-gold-vinyl-with-free-bonus-cd-with-4-bonus-tracks","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-11T11:10:58.000Z","description":"Release Date - 7th October 2013\r\nPre Sale - 2nd September\r\n\r\n150 Ltd colour vinyl for direct sales\r\nAll vinyls come with bonus cd that has all the LP tracks + 4 bonus tracks.

Orbiting around the songwriter duo of Zachary Devereux Fairbrother and Emily Robb (with the auxiliary addition of Montreal-import Christian Simmons on skins, also of Sheer Agony), Lantern is what rock 'n' roll was - loud, oozy, inspiring, perspiring, pummeling directly forward yet cloaked in the arcane. \r\n\r\nOver the course of three years and an impressive handful of releases (six EPs and a 7\", for those of you studying the horses) on labels like Bathetic and Night-People, Fairbrother & Robb have spawned a sonically relentless dark-force, twisting, perverting, and penetrating open ears with the scent of rotten, sultry soul, fanged fuzz & wah, boogie-downers, jungle night-moves, exercises in exorcism, black leather, and sex. Inspired by their idols: The Rolling Stones, Stooges, Bo Diddley, Cramps, MC5, Bowie, and all the originators of R&B and blues, Lantern are taking their own whack at the punching bag that is the great American folk tradition/condition/religion -- Rock 'N' Roll music. \r\n\r\nThis summer, they fold it in on itself with the release of their latest album (and 12\" vinyl debut), Rock 'N' Roll Rorschach into the stinking hot heat of early July A.D. With the help of fellow Philly engineering magick-maker, Jeff Zeigler (Purling Hiss, Kurt Vile, Clockcleaner) behind the boards, the record marks a shift in sound from the blown-out hiss of lo-fidelity, four-track home recordings toward a more balanced and discernable breed of raw, unflinching power. \r\n\r\nLantern's sound melts genres together, rockabullying weirdo blues into a frenzy of fuzzed-up soloing and glammed-down dance beats, ultimately resulting in a mound of grooves garnering moves from the '80s/'90s garage-rock rattles of Dead Moon, Gibson Bros, and Billy Childish to the '60s/'70s pre-punk lore of Hasil Adkins, Flaming Groovies, or even The Velvet Underground. Rorschach is a testament to the age-old odyssey of rock 'n' roll, searching for something \"advanced\" (dare we say \"futuristic?\") in paying homage to its primal whims and primitive-earth foundation. \r\n\r\nThe true treasure is the exploration itself. And with that, what are you waiting for?

Previously available as a CD-r on the great Deep Water label, Lupus is released as double LP with new artwork in a gatefold sleeve. \r\nDead Sea Apes are a Manchester based trio with a big, dark sound that incorporates everything from space to drone to dub in its ambitious instrumental rockscapes. Now, given that these boys hail from the heartland of the Industrial Revolution in Manchester, it sounds like they have been spending far too much time in dark woodland forests.\r\nLupus is the band’s first full-length album, following two EP’s on the group’s own Soul Desert Records and a collaborative album with Black Tempest – The Sun Behind The Sun – released on Cardinal Fuzz. Compared with the muscular mini-epics on those releases, Lupus seems to emanate from a more ghostly dubbed-out post-punk/kraut aesthetic.  Lupus is at once meditative, elliptical and mysterious. \r\nLupus took shape in August 2011 as an experiment in improvising on drones and loops, followed by varying amounts of editing and further recording using the same methodology as DSA heroes - CAN. The immersive outcome ranges from ambient cloud to massive crunch via elliptical extended rhythms and creeping effects, all shot through with a hovering ominous presence. \r\nSeven tracks, 57 minutes. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://deadseaapes.bandcamp.com/album/lupus\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":40683624,"name":"Default","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.25,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124373223/-/lupusgold800.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124373223/-/lupusgold800.jpg","width":800,"height":1171},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122287983/-/Lupus_bandcamp.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122287983/-/Lupus_bandcamp.jpg","width":3780,"height":3718}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4707223,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":12812580,"name":"Vision Fortune - Night Jukes 12\" (Ltd 150 Pink for direct sales.

The shamanic psychedelic trance of darkness and drone of the The Worker Drone Queen and Head Honcho Ep’s ended up on more than a few end of years best offs. The recordings eventually found their way into the hands of Cardinal Fuzz who on the spot decided to release the whole shebang on a glorious 2x12\" gatefold vinyl. Also exclusive to this release are the Al Lover remix of \"Death Song\" and Strssmnt remix of Coming Down + a brand new track \"Nevereverism\".

All disc one is sourced from Mini Disc and so features cleaner recordings of the band with none of the remaining 42 minutes featuring tracks ever heard before.\r\nDisc 2 is sourced from cassette tapes and if hiss bothers you, then this here disc is not for you, as this disc features lotsa tape hiss...but if you think tape hiss only adds to it, then you my friends are in for a treat as you are dropped straight into the middle of a Heads rehearsal from November 06.
