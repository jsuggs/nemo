Its a highly evolved, focused and visual soundtrack to life in the city and it's streets and characters.\r\nFull of life stories and descriptive rap narratives mixed over big world standard production 'Street Visions' is the sixth studio album in Tornts highly respected catalogue of ground breaking releases.\r\nThe lead single and video 'I Do This' produced by Dutch producer Ciph Barker, is a highly personal track where Tornts writes of his own life and struggles as well as those of others. The listener can tell they are in for an album that stands out on it's own in terms of it's depth and descriptive wordplay over world class beats.\r\nThe second single and video is the street anthem 'This Place' produced by Tornts himself, features rising dancehall/reggae artist Apprentice. For the first time, hard hitting Melbourne street rap has combined with underground dancehall/reggae to produce outstanding & classic results. Tornts raps 'We ain't living on the beach in Home and Away, there's poverty, homeless and strays' while Apprentice keeps up the relentless truth with a strong vocal style that hits the mark & stays on repeat in the listeners mind.\r\nOther standout tracks on the album include the hard hitting trap single 'Dirty Town' which features Melbourne beatmaker Kharnivor on production. This introduces us to a world where 'Lost memories, bottleshop key rings, Lacoste crocodiles snap in a sea of sin'. Fellow HG crew member & crowd favourite Diem shares the spotlight on the captivating song 'Dark Days' which contains an unmatched visual intensity that describes claustrophobic life in troubled times. Over a powerful, synth laden beat Tornts delivers visual lines 'In the abyss watch the vertigo, tortured souls like Guantanamo, ordered cold, that's the city bro, whore to hold, one fifty dough'\r\nFamed UK producer Beat Butcha (Lloyd Banks, Prodigy) helps to deliver the monstrous anthem 'Life', which Tornts' aggres-sive yet steady flow is paired perfectly with. He also produced 'Killin' It' which sees BTE's newest rising star Dr. Flea stepping up to the mic with Tornts.\r\nQLD dons Kings Konekted step up to smash guest verses on 'Out Here', rapping over slow Tornts melody driven trap produc-tion. The track is highly cinematic with lines by Tornts such as 'Rough little Conans, hating their old man's, and wishing for gold hands' setting up for an incredible track that showcases the standards that 'Street Visions' has risen to.\r\nTornts' crew, Hired Goons also feature on an epic banger called 'This is HG' cementing their status one of the most respected underground rap groups in the country.\r\nThe album is brutally honest and as visual as a motion picture, standing out on its own with an international standard of pro-duction, highly original content and delivery that is indicative of Tornts' style. 'Street Visions' is a definite evolution in his jour-ney as an artist that's never been afraid to speak the truth about his life and the darker sides of society, while pushing bound-aries with every release.\r\nFocus tracks: “This Place”, “I Do This”, “Life”\r\n\r\n01 - Dirty Town\r\n02 - This Place (Ft Apprentice)\r\n03 - I Do This\r\n04 - Out Here (Ft Kings Konekted)\r\n05 - Crush All The Hype\r\n06 - Dark Days (Ft Diem & Murky)\r\n07 - Scimitar\r\n08 - Killin' It\r\n09 - Say Nothing\r\n10 - Life\r\n11 - This Is HG (Ft Bigfoot, Ciecmate, Billy Bunks, Murky & Diem)\r\n12 - Fire\r\n\r\n\r\nPostage included in price.","options":[{"id":43683462,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124446657/-/Tornts-cover-roughs-5.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124446657/-/Tornts-cover-roughs-5.jpeg","width":480,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124615854/-/BTE024-Tornts-StreetVisions-A3_copy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124615854/-/BTE024-Tornts-StreetVisions-A3_copy.jpg","width":2365,"height":3311},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124615782/-/Tornts-StreetVisions-stickers_copy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124615782/-/Tornts-StreetVisions-stickers_copy.jpg","width":787,"height":314},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125271747/-/BTE024_-_Tornts_-_Street_Visions_-_PRESS_RELEASE.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125271747/-/BTE024_-_Tornts_-_Street_Visions_-_PRESS_RELEASE.jpg","width":1240,"height":1754}],"artists":[{"id":47397,"name":"TORNTS","permalink":"tornts","url":"/artist/tornts"},{"id":47455,"name":"HIRED GOONS","permalink":"hired-goons","url":"/artist/hired-goons"}],"categories":[{"id":1223361,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":12527403,"name":"BTE025 - Dr Flea - Keep On Moving EP","permalink":"bte025-dr-flea-keep-it-moving-ep","position":4,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bte025-dr-flea-keep-it-moving-ep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-23T07:30:22.000Z","description":"Debut EP from newest BTE family member Dr Flea.\r\nHis introspective style, mixed with a healthy dose of street smarts makes for an impressive listen filled with emotive lyrics and visionary concepts.\r\nBanging beats, stellar lyrics.\r\nDr Flea is sure to deliver.\r\n\r\nEP has 9 songs\r\n\r\n\r\nPricing includes Postage.\r\n","options":[{"id":39817335,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121687560/-/Dr_Flea_-_Keep_On_Moving_Image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121687560/-/Dr_Flea_-_Keep_On_Moving_Image.jpg","width":1600,"height":1600}],"artists":[{"id":220443,"name":"Dr Flea","permalink":"dr-flea","url":"/artist/dr-flea"}],"categories":[{"id":1223361,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":10781523,"name":"BTE023 - KNOWN ASSOCIATES - Ashes To Dust","permalink":"bte023-known-associates-ashes-to-dust","position":5,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bte023-known-associates-ashes-to-dust","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-26T05:02:00.000Z","description":"\r\nCiecmate & Maggot Mouf are Known Associates.\r\n\r\nFor over a year these 2 contemporaries have locked themselves in the studio once a week to diligently shape and craft a new offering, “Ashes to Dust”. \r\nCiecmate & Maggot Mouf trade verses back and forth, bar-for-bar in an epic team effort that interlocks prose and sonic aesthetics seamlessly. The joint delivery puts forth a tag-team approach reminiscent of a classic Hip-Hop style that has not yet permeated Australia's often individually focused scene. The insane turntable prowess of Dj No Name Nathan (2 x ACT DMC Champion) stitches the release together, officially making Known Associates a triple threat. \r\n\r\nThe production on “Ashes to Dust” is rich in melody, hypnotic drums, and deep bass. With a heavily atmospheric and diverse aesthetic, ranging from dark and brooding to bright and positive. The thematic landscape is all encompassing, covering a diverse range of relevant topics with a strong conviction and symbiosis. From party anthem \"Known Associates,\" to the thought provoking \"Beware Of Bio Chips,\" or the summertime soundtrack \"Short Shorts,\" this is no mere journey, it's an adventure.\r\nAshes To Dust is a sure shot hit for discerning Hip-Hop aficionados, recent converts, and the occasional rap fan. \r\n\r\n“In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground;

He first earned his stripes in the UK’s underground live circuit and has since proven himself to be one of the UK’s finest exports. Having shared the stage with the likes of Skinnyman, Kano, Klashnekoff and Blak Twang, Fraksha spent a long time honing his craft and refining his approach. 2013 sees the culmination of those years of passion, mixtapes, shows, experimentation, and straight up skill in the form of the album “My Way”.\r\n\r\n“My Way” is an exploration into a soundscape often not heard on Australian shores. The thickly layered synths, contemporary Hip-Hop, poignant lyrics and a heavy dose of Grime served up with an unmistakable English accent are a unique and refreshing approach. Fraksha has toured Australia many times over through Drum n Bass, Dubstep, Grime, Hip-Hop gigs and raves alike and has combined all of these influences to position “My Way” as a new sound. \r\n\r\nThe production credits range from the Aria award-winning M-Phazes, Nebs (Kerser, That’s Them), BTE’s own Tornts, Filth Collins, Dazed (Down For The Count Records), Geko (Crate Cartel), Megatroid, Kharnivor and Juzlo. With such a diverse production team, you can feel the meticulous selections made by Fraksha form a eclectic yet cohesive bond across the album.\r\n\r\n“My Life” is a powerful introduction to the album that sets the aural scene with a no holds barred recount of where Fraksha has been, what he’s done, and his relentless ambitions ahead.  On “Future,” Brad Strut (Lyrical Commission), Byron (UK), and Diem (Hospice Crew/Hired Goons/Smash Brothers) share the spotlight over an insane M-Phazes synth laden anthem and depict a bleak view on where society as a whole may be in the coming years if things continue on as they are today.\r\n\r\nThe lead single of “Creepin” featuring Brinks (Nine High) and Diem is a pure, raw, unadulterated street anthem served cold on a Dubstep platter. The Grime driven remix by Kharnivor is equally engaging and cements Kharnivor as a producer to keep a close eye on in the future. “New Dawn” is a smooth track, an uplifting experience that covers the age old advice of putting your past behind you and moving on to where life takes you. Fraksha’s introspection and Candice Moniques smooth vocal styling over M-Phazes production is a match the world’s finest sommeliers could not argue with.\r\n\r\nIn what may sometimes seem risky, “My Way” is as cohesive as it is diverse, and will impress a broad spectrum of discerning listeners. It crosses sub-cultures and genres alike, while it traverses through sounds in a fashion that shows mastery of all its atomic elements. It is a genre defying and artist defining body of work. This is the album Australia had to have.\r\n\r\n\r\nPostage included in purchase price","options":[{"id":29175374,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91641614/-/BTE022_-_Fraksha_-_My_Way_-_Cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91641614/-/BTE022_-_Fraksha_-_My_Way_-_Cover.jpg","width":992,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":173906,"name":"FRAKSHA","permalink":"fraksha","url":"/artist/fraksha"}],"categories":[{"id":1223361,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":6027697,"name":"BTE021 - Maggot Mouf - Running With Scissors","permalink":"bte021-maggot-mouf-running-with-scissors","position":17,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bte021-maggot-mouf-running-with-scissors","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-25T18:58:30.000Z","description":"SIGNED PRE ORDER COPIES AVAILABLE!!\r\n(Shipped out 3 days prior to release date - 11.05.12)\r\n\r\nBirthed from the scent of stale weed smoke, a hazy laboratory, brown paper bags covering empty longnecks, and calloused thumbs as a result of PlayStation controllers is “Running with Scissors”.

Broken Tooth\r\nEntertainment’s most prolific MC returns with a hard hitting dose of reality rap and\r\nimagery riddled visions of city life in 2012.\r\n\r\nSince he exploded on to the scene in 2003 with his groundbreaking first album “Adding\r\nInsult to Injury,” his uncompromising approach has inspired young hopefuls\r\nnationwide. “Concrete Slang” is another chapter in the evolution of Tornts’\r\nundisputed originality, as he continues to grow in his style, delivery, content, and as\r\nan artist.\r\n\r\nStark and confronting, and always pushing boundaries, he has refined and honed his\r\nstyle of story telling narratives and rebellious social commentary to a new level.\r\nTornts has garnered the reputation as a unique voice for the growing under-class of\r\nour sprawling cities and those who are downtrodden and frustrated with their place in\r\nsociety, and that voice is one that is truly to be reckoned with.\r\n\r\nThis is the Australia that most people choose not to see, crime, violence, poverty,\r\ndrug problems, racism, dispossession, and a general apathy and anger at a society that\r\nincreasingly ignores some sections of itself.\r\n\r\nThe production is powerful, with modern synth laced beats from himself, UK’s Beat\r\nButcha (Mobb Deep, Lloyd Banks, Brad Strut), Holland’s Ciph Barker (Killah Priest),\r\nMelbourne’s own Wik (Crate Cartel), Sydney’s Nebs (Kerser, That’s Them), and\r\n2Bladez (Audio Zombie Productions). The heavy production line-up lends a varied,\r\ncontemporary, and immense background for his aggressive wordplay and visual\r\nverses.\r\n\r\nKnown for his vigilance in providing a visual aesthetic to his gripping tales, the\r\ncritically acclaimed and highly praised video clip (and single) ‘Traumatic Cinema,’\r\nis a vivid revenge tale of abused youth. The song is a powerful account of the issues faced daily by a forgotten segment of\r\nour society. The album delves deeper into the mind of a story teller, with such tracks\r\nas ‘City Life’ - which depicts his street tainted visions of life in the Melbourne\r\nof ‘cold steel eyes and paranoid minds’ - and ‘Undercover Maggot,’ a real life\r\naccount of an undercover police and deceptive entrapment.\r\n\r\nThe contrast is stark when highly personal stories of his life and dark past, such\r\nas ‘The Rain’ and ‘Rise Up’, hit hard while anthems such as ‘Danger’ (ft/ fellow\r\ncohort Diem) and the cinematic tale of ‘Smack Dust’ (ft/ Brad Strut) add further\r\nimpact. Any listener can tell that “Concrete Slang” is not your typical local rap album,\r\nbut an evolved masterpiece from a veteran rapper, considered by many to be the most\r\noriginal and important voice of underground hip hop in Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Price includes Postage & Handling\r\n","options":[{"id":17923259,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54662795/-/Concrete_Slang_Cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54662795/-/Concrete_Slang_Cover.jpg","width":709,"height":709},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54673019/-/Tornts_Photo__Web_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54673019/-/Tornts_Photo__Web_.jpg","width":1000,"height":998},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54673131/-/Tornts_Studio_Pic__Web_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54673131/-/Tornts_Studio_Pic__Web_.jpg","width":846,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":47397,"name":"TORNTS","permalink":"tornts","url":"/artist/tornts"},{"id":47455,"name":"HIRED GOONS","permalink":"hired-goons","url":"/artist/hired-goons"}],"categories":[{"id":1223361,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":4615797,"name":"BTE019 - CIECMATE Presents: Chess Sounds Volume 01","permalink":"ciecmate-presents-chess-sounds-volume-01","position":19,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ciecmate-presents-chess-sounds-volume-01","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-10-12T06:48:29.000Z","description":"For every Ciecmate beat that's made it out into the world, there have been scores of others laying in wait, lurking, watching for the right MC.

His latest album, 'You're All Ears' is ready to lay down an aural assault with its crisp production and sharply observed lyrics.\r\n\r\n'You're All Ears' features production by BTE's powerhouse, Ciecmate and the intimidating talent of Sammy Scissors. Featuring guest verses from 1/6 (this year’s 2010 Hilltop Hoods Initiative Winner), Scotty Hinds (Nine High / Smash Brothers), Dekoda and additional production from the devastating Joey Gargoyle and Bigfoot (Hired Goons / 750 Rebels), 'You're All Ears' is a more personal solo album which has been stewing slowly for the last two years since the release of 'Maggots Anonymous'.\r\n\r\n'You're All Ears' is a 16 track odyssey through an often cold world where brief shards of humour only serve to emphasise the bleakness of the everyday for the disjointed and out of place. Opener 'Village of the Damned' pulls us through Maggot Mouf's eerie subconscious, where horror merges with reality over Joey Garg's unsettling beats. From the first breath of the day, something spooky (yet familiar) is going on: this is a place where “work is a nightmare, not like Elm street, get my feet twisted in my own Misery.” The legacy of horror films have left their mark, and Maggot is forced to confront the truth - “all of it a movie, some of it my life\".\r\n\r\nTrack listing:\r\n01.

A Tale of Two Cities finds the two men on the move at large in different cities, but tackling the same dilemmas. “They’re Watching” is an examination of the modern day surveillance state, “Club Meds” explores the complex world of recreational substance use and “Men Still Moving” is a global nomad’s travelogue. Judiciously selected guests include Billy Bunks on “Codename Cougar”, an ode to intergenerational love and Diem on the murky “Labyrinth of Shadows”. Finally, a hard hitting posse cut closes proceedings with Bunks, Swarmy of Overproof and Maggot Mouf warning pretenders to “Run For Cover”. After six years of dedicating their efforts and time to the label and their extended crew, weathering the pressures of day to day life and pushing the BTE insignia out to the world at large, their original plan has come full circle. Through numerous interstate trips and sleepless studio sessions, Ciecmate and Newsense have crafted an album of diverse, neck-snapping beats and incisive, topical lyricism. The result is A Tale of Two Cities, a long anticipated and richly rewarding work from two of Australia’s hardest working hip hop icons. \r\n\r\n1. Intro (The Conversation)\r\n2. Resume\r\n3.
