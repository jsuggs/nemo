Held up close, the images will look like a series of dots in various tones of grey to black but looking at it from afar, will reveal a photograph -- a really cool, graphic effect. Pieces as large as these are customarily and most comfortably viewed from at least four feet away.\r\n36\" x 48\"\r\n\r\nPlease note this print has some wear from its trip across the country to us.

Books\r\nCharley Harper An Illustrated Life\r\nby Todd Oldham\r\nIllustrations by Charley Harper\r\nHardcover\r\n17.3\" x 12.2\" inches \r\n424 pages\r\n\r\nCharley Harper is an American original who created his art from his home studio in Cincinnati, Ohio, until his death in 2007, at the age of 84. He is beloved for his delightful, graphic, and often humorous illustrations of nature, animals, insects, and people alike. Charley liked to say that when he paints a bird, he doesn’t count all the feathers in the wings —he just counts the wings. Minimal realism, he called it, and his unique and precise style continues to resonate and inspire his admirers. \r\n\r\nCHARLEY HARPER—AN ILLUSTRATED LIFE showcases his illustrations that appeared from 1950-1975 in the Ford Times magazines, as well as in books such as the beloved, “The Giant Golden Book of Biology” in 1961, “Betty Crocker’s Dinner for Two” in 1961, and “The Animal Kingdom” in 1968, among many others. His well-loved book, “Birds and Words,” first published in 1974, is considered a classic. Remarkably, however, Charley’s work had never before been published in one complete retrospective. Accordingly, this massive volume is the definitive Charley Harper book to have on your bookshelf!\r\n\r\nAmmobooks.com\r\nImages and text courtesy of Ammo

greatest designers of the 20th century. They are, of course, most well known for their groundbreaking and iconic furniture designs, but they also created important, creative, experimental, and beautiful work in the areas of architecture, exhibit design, textile design, product design, graphic design, toy design, film, and photography. Their distinctly postwar American enthusiasm and openness to the world around them gave them free license to explore work in many disciplines. This book celebrates the seamlessness and fluidity in which they operated as both a husband-and-wife team and as designers unrestricted by traditional professional boundaries. They brought a sense of innocence and playfulness to the design process, as well as a tremendous love and discipline in all they created in many different fields and mediums. Augmenting the abundant visual images are quotes and essays by the Eames family, including: Charles and Ray Eames, Lucia Eames, Carla Hartman, Byron Atwood, Lucia Dewey Atwood, Eames Demetrios, and Llisa Demetrios.\r\n\r\nAmmobooks.com\r\nimages and text courtesy of Ammo Books","options":[{"id":49254765,"name":"Default","price":125.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128388150/-/EAMES_JPEGS1_largecrop.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128388150/-/EAMES_JPEGS1_largecrop.jpg","width":470,"height":470},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128383509/-/EAMES_JPEGS9_1024x1024.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128383509/-/EAMES_JPEGS9_1024x1024.jpg","width":970,"height":543},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128383512/-/EAMES_JPEGS3_1024x1024.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128383512/-/EAMES_JPEGS3_1024x1024.jpg","width":947,"height":532},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128383515/-/EAMES_JPEGS6_1024x1024.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128383515/-/EAMES_JPEGS6_1024x1024.jpg","width":970,"height":539},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128383521/-/EAMES_JPEGS7_1024x1024.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128383521/-/EAMES_JPEGS7_1024x1024.jpg","width":969,"height":532}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6713439,"name":"Goods","permalink":"goods","url":"/category/goods"}]},{"id":15167949,"name":"Handcrafted Cup #4","permalink":"handcrafted-cup-4","position":160,"price":48.0,"default_price":48.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/handcrafted-cup-4","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-28T10:16:40.000Z","description":"K L A I\r\nHandcrafted Cup\r\nBee mix and mason stein\r\n18 oz\r\n\r\nklaibrown.com\r\nImages and information courtesy of K L A I","options":[{"id":49280991,"name":"Default","price":48.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128403930/-/LerfuFaceCup4BC1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128403930/-/LerfuFaceCup4BC1.jpg","width":870,"height":870},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128402952/-/LerfuFaceCup4BC2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128402952/-/LerfuFaceCup4BC2.jpg","width":870,"height":870},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128402961/-/Lerfu-Face-Cup-4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128402961/-/Lerfu-Face-Cup-4.jpg","width":870,"height":870},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128402967/-/LerfuFaceCup4BC4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128402967/-/LerfuFaceCup4BC4.jpg","width":870,"height":870}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6713439,"name":"Goods","permalink":"goods","url":"/category/goods"}]},{"id":15139629,"name":"Locals Only","permalink":"locals-only","position":161,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/locals-only","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-27T08:39:20.000Z","description":"Ammo Books\r\nLOCALS ONLY \r\nby Hugh Holland\r\nEdited by Steve Crist\r\nHardcover \r\n84\r\n\r\nOne afternoon in 1975, a young photographer named Hugh Holland drove up Laurel Canyon Boulevard in Los Angeles and encountered skateboarders carving up the drainage ditches along the side of the canyon. Immediately transfixed by their grace and athleticism, he knew he had found an amazing subject. Although not a skateboarder himself, for the next three years Holland never tired of documenting skateboarders surfing the streets of Los Angeles, parts of the San Fernando Valley, Venice Beach, and as far away as San Francisco and Baja California, Mexico.\r\n\r\nDuring the mid-1970s, Southern California was experiencing a serious drought, leaving an abundance of empty swimming pools available for trespassing skateboarders to practice their tricks. From these suburban backyard haunts to the asphalt streets that connected them, this was the place that created the legendary Dogtown and Z-Boys skateboarders. With their requisite bleached blonde hair, tanned bodies, tube socks and Vans, these young outsiders are masterfully captured against a sometimes harsh but always sunny Southern California landscape in LOCALS ONLY.\r\n\r\nAmmobooks.com\r\nImages and text courtesy of

work by contemporary artists who are aesthetically and regionally joined through a variety of mediums and demographics. By showcasing unknown and emerging artists alongside established icons who all call California home, MILK AND HONEY recognizes the fact that region and lifestyle directly influence the working process and ultimately the state of contemporary imagery. \r\n\r\nIn the same spirit as Roger Gastman and Jeffrey Deitch's recent seminal MOCA show: Art in the Streets, MILK AND HONEY celebrates a group of contemporary artists with roots across various areas, including graffiti art, surf, and skate culture, and other uniquely Californian influences. As is evident in that highly acclaimed museum show—as well as the current Pacific Standard Time Show throughout Los Angeles—California affects trends and sets the stage nationally and internationally for some of the most creative art being made in the world today.\r\n\r\nMore than 50 artists featured, including: Ed Ruscha, Ed Templeton, Cleon Peterson, Megan Whitmarsh, Sage Vaughn, RETNA, Piero Golia, and Ye Rin Mok.\r\n\r\nAmmobooks.com\r\nImages and text courtesy of
