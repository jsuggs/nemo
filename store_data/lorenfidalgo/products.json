Carribelle reminds us that the only time we really have is captured in the moment we experience it. We need to cherish each moment, knowing that we will never feel or experience it quite the same way again. After a moment passes, a new moment comes, with a new story and feeling. \"Cherish the moments, they come only once!, is the quote that reads at the top of the bookmark\r\n\r\nThis bookmark is brought to life, with a combination of mediums and techniques. Each part is hand drawn, then graphically manipulated and layered in the computer. When arranged in the computer, it reveals a tapestry of floral images, rendering a collage mixed-media look. \r\n\r\nThe Carribelle bookmark image measures 2x6, is printed on white ink jet photo matte paper and is white on the back.  My signature is in black on the back.  The bookmark is then laminated to give it durability and it comes a little over the sides to protect the edges. \r\n\r\nThis bookmark is strung with satin ribbons that come streaming down to meet up with some lovely unique beads.    NOTE:  Each bookmark is made with a variation of beads and may not be the exact selection of beads that are featured in the photograph. Each piece is unique and will be a surprise.  The variety can be glass, bamboo, wooden, acrylic, shell and metallic beads that will hang from the ribbons and look so nice outside of your book.\r\n\r\nYour bookmark will be packaged in a bubble envelope and with a sheet of cardboard to prevent it from bending.\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact me.

I often think about how we should be kind to our hearts, as if they are a bushel of fragile flowers. We usually tend to flowers with loving care and they touch our emotions and feelings. I wonder how we can give the same time and attention everyday to our hearts, that is like the care and feeding of things in our outside world. Hmm... something to think about. \r\n\r\nWhen I think about Juliana's color palate, it brings up images of drinking a glass of pink lemonade on a bright sunny day. I can also imagine sitting on a country porch, while talking with old friends and reminiscing. \"Remember to tend to the flowers, that bloom in your heart!\" is the expressional quote that reads at the top of the bookmark.\r\n\r\nThe Juliana bookmark image measures 2x6, is printed on white ink jet photo matte paper and is white on the back.
