This 35 track album is only available in a limited edition run of 350 and is a split with labels Teenage Teardrops, Awesome Vistas and Marriage Records.\r\n\r\nFeaturing songs from: Lucky Dragons, Brendan Fowler, Dragging an Ox Through Water, White Rainbow, Jib Kidder, Crazy Band, Bobby Birdman, Karl Blau, Dunes, SAFE, Jackie O Motherfucker, Jordan Dysktra, ARP, Deer or the Doe, Caspar Sonnet, Secret Circuit, White Fang, Larry Yes, Spencer Moody, Sun Foot, Crystal & Stefan (us!,) The Polyps, Rob Walmart, DAVIS HOOKER, Wanda and Wonder, Jake Ransom, Megazord, John Rau, Art Husband, Giggles, Boron, 90 Billion Raindrops, LA Ladies Choir, Deep Fried Boogie Band, and Cross Country Club.\r\n\r\nFor Songs on Conceptual Art, Crystal Baxley and Stefan Ransom  invited musicians to compose original songs inspired by Sol LeWitt’s Sentences on Conceptual Art (1969). LeWitt wrote this list of 35 statements at a time when artists were radically expanding notions of what art could be and what artists could do, with proclamations like “Ideas can be works of art” (Sentence #10). To expose this significant text to a larger public, artist John Baldessari improvised melodies to each of the 35 sentences in his 1972 video piece Baldessari Sings LeWitt.\r\nInspired by Baldessari’s intention to open up the Sentences to new audiences, Baxley and Ransom asked a different musician to create a song for each sentence. Some of the musicians used the text verbatim, some of the musicians altered, expanded upon or commented on the text, and some didn’t use words in their songs at all. Sentences were assigned sentences on a first-come, first serve basis, and the songs are in the order of the original text.\r\n\r\nLearn more about the project here: http://songsonconceptualart.com\r\n\r\nSol LeWitt Sentences on Conceptual Art © 2012 The LeWitt Estate / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York. \r\n","options":[{"id":20370665,"name":"Default","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":6.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/62802903/-/SOCA-face-for-web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/62802903/-/SOCA-face-for-web.jpg","width":1000,"height":983},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/62802999/-/REC_Back.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/62802999/-/REC_Back.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/62803047/-/REC_Poster___Insert.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/62803047/-/REC_Poster___Insert.jpg","width":1000,"height":667}],"artists":[{"id":125519,"name":"Sol Lewitt","permalink":"sol-lewitt","url":"/artist/sol-lewitt"}],"categories":[{"id":140858,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":5593635,"name":"SECRET CIRCUIT - Cosmic Papers","permalink":"secret-circuit-cosmic-papers","position":7,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/secret-circuit-cosmic-papers","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-03-02T02:40:24.000Z","description":"VOLUME 3 of the Secret Circuit mixtape series. 60 minutes. 150 pressed.
