He wanted to study the width between tree rings to see the temperature at  different times in history. He had ordered a special drill to take a core sample of a gnarled, old Great Basin Bristlecone Pine tree. He began twisting the drill into the tree, but it became too difficult to turn. Finally, the drill broke into the tree. The drill was a special order item, and the scientist needed it to finish his research.  He found a district ranger nearby and the ranger tells him not to worry, “we’ll just cut down the tree.” He takes a big slab of the tree home and counts over 4, 800 rings. He learns that he had cut down the oldest living organism in the world.\r\n\r\nThis story was heard on an episode of WNYC Radiolab about a year ago and has been on my mind ever since.  I  cringe every time I think about all of the people and events the Prometheus Tree outlived only to be cut down in a short time.”\r\n\r\n18 X 24\r\nSIGNED & NUMBERED BY THE ARTIST\r\n\r\nYELLOW - Edition of 20\r\nGREEN - Edition of 10\r\nBROWN - Edition of 10","options":[{"id":19693057,"name":"YELLOW","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19840661,"name":"GREEN","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19840663,"name":"BROWN","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61069935/-/IMG_1507.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61069935/-/IMG_1507.jpg","width":750,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1650778,"name":"Art Prints / Posters","permalink":"art-prints-posters","url":"/category/art-prints-posters"}]},{"id":5459195,"name":"IPaintMyMind Mandala Logo + Text Print - Limited Edition of 25","permalink":"ipaintmymind-mandala-logo-text-print","position":3,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ipaintmymind-mandala-logo-text-print","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-02-13T05:39:46.000Z","description":"We're so thrilled with our NEW logo art by Iain Macarthur.
