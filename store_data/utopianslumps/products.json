For Duppy Housing, Martorell re-housed his personal speaker collection within a variety of found objects, including basket balls, bread, baskets, plastic bags, tubes, bike helmets and dirt. His re-housed speakers, handmade electronic instruments, costumed figures and wall works combined to explore notions of electricity, vegetable-powered sound, sine waves and sound system mobility. \r\n\r\nText: Christopher L.G.
