Not easily classifiable, Souvenir's Young America effortlessly surpass genre restrictions with a unique combination of heavy and ambient guitars layered with harmonica, keyboards, electronics, organs, and percussion. These tracks, their first written as a quintet, are epic, emotional narratives that pull the listener in with both crushing and meditative passages. The album was recorded at Sound of Music with John Morand (Labradford, Sparklehorse, etc), mastered by James Poltkin (Khanate, Sunn O))), Earth, etc), and features original artwork by Sasha Barr (Sub Pop Records). Members also currently involved in Anduin and Ventoux. Released by Init Records.

Divided into six flowing movements, \"An Ocean Without Water\" is filled with intensely beautiful melodies that drift on lonesome harmonica strains and sparkling, celestial electronics, shot through with mystic, western slide guitar, passages of crushing angular riffage, rolling tribal drumming, and transcendent blues. Through their intricate song arrangements and moody textures, Souvenir's Young America has created an epic, emotional narrative. The sound draws from the collected DNA of forebears like Popul Vuh, Earth, Labradford, and Neurosis, yet they form a powerfully evocative instrumental language all of their own. Released by Crucial Blast.
