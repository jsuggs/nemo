From the airborne brides of flight research to the carpeted forests of groundspeed, Laing’s photographic series commemorate the site-specific interventions under-taken across Australia, capturing the continent in panoramas of extraordinary beauty and strangeness. \r\n\r\nUnquiet is often a word used to describe the photographs of Rosemary Laing. Her images appear suspended between fantasy and reality, and render the impossible possible. These extraordinary images are created without digital manipulation, and are often the result of Laing’s journeys to far-flung corners of the continent.","options":[{"id":21824931,"name":"Default","price":69.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67555925/-/Laing.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67555925/-/Laing.jpg","width":376,"height":283}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
