newest addition to our collection, Newspaper Rucksack with screen-printed black beans pattern is smaller and lighter than Top Roll Rucksack but more constructed that the Sacks.\r\n\r\nIts unique

The whole thing is in fact made of one long piece of textile, folded and sewn to achieve the desired shape.\r\n\r\nCreated to keep all the things you love. It will definitely carry the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook and obviously some books and magazines. The back of the rucksack is supported by insert felt what makes it comfortable to carry all the things that you need.\r\n\r\nMade by hands in our Warsaw-based workshop.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>All leather elements are made of vegetable-tanned natural leather. The fabric is 100% cotton. All components including the fabric, leather, threads and buckles are sourced from Poland. <br><br>Difficult stains may be hard to remove.
