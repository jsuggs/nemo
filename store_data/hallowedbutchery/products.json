Limited to 100 copies. I have only a handful.\r\n\r\nDescription from VENDETTA RECORDS: <em>\"Back before the release of his debut record (“Funeral Rites for the Living”) he was using the Hallowed Butchery moniker to write and record his take on the black metal genre. Very little of what he recorded was actually released (aside from a track or two on a couple of obscure compilations), so it only seemed to right to make the songs available to the public. Along with these unreleased black metal songs, there are also 3 new unreleased songs, and some bonus demos from the pre-production of the “Funeral Rites for the Living” LP.\"</em>\r\n\r\nReview from THE METAL CRYPT of some of the earlier material: <em>\"Sounding somewhat like the bastard son of Aborym, Mysticum and Anaal Nathrakh, mixed in with the occasional spattering of early Norwegian synthesizer histrionics, the two short tracks blast and tear in equal measures, showing that not only is their still talent submerging from the US underground, but that it's pretty fucking harsh too. Opener 'Barren Existence' has the most Anaal Nathrakh feel to it out of the two, with prominent synths punctuating the evil riffs… but then it's all over all too soon, just as you were beginning to get a real feel for it. The same goes for the slightly longer 2nd track, which is more of a blast fest at the beginning, before sliding effortlessly into an aching piano led passage which drips with emotion (partly in thanks to the blood spitting vocal delivery which couples it).\"</em>","options":[{"id":23047245,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71406315/-/covercard_outside.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71406315/-/covercard_outside.gif","width":420,"height":313}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1710982,"name":"Tapes","permalink":"tapes","url":"/category/tapes"}]},{"id":4404281,"name":"Split w/ The Austrasian Goat (10\" LP)","permalink":"the-austrasian-goat-split-10-preorder","position":2,"price":6.66,"default_price":6.66,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-austrasian-goat-split-10-preorder","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-09-08T19:18:20.000Z","description":"Heavy-gram 10\" vinyl records housed in screen-printed metallic packaging, courtesy of VENDETTA RECORDS.\r\n\r\nSIDE A > THE AUSTRASIAN GOAT\r\n- Nailed Down\r\n- Hikikomori\r\nSIDE B > HALLOWED BUTCHERY\r\n- Hexagram: The God of Self\r\n\r\n\"The USA-based progressive doom soloist Hallowed Butchery teams up with the French funeral doom soloist The Austrasian Goat for a monumental collaborative split 10\" based upon the moral stance of self-reliance, popularized and preached by the Transcendentalist movement of the 19th-century. In a world of consumerism, conformity, religious-brainwashing, and political bullshit, these two musical geniuses refuse to merely follow the pack. This is reflected in both their lyrical content, and in their approach to their music, which is performed in solitude, and which often defies categorization. The Austrasian Goat begins the split with two songs of dark, minimalistic, funeral doom reminiscent of Ahab, Celestiial, and Nortt, but with an approach all his own. On the second of the two dirges, Ryan Fairfield of Hallowed Butchery makes a guest appearance. Side two features one epic song from Hallowed Butchery. His song is different from anything he has done in the past – reminiscent of Hawkwind-on-a-bad-acid-trip with Black Sabbath chugging cough syrup, while My Bloody Valentine snorts a mishmash of pills. The song features guest appearances from Julien Louvet of The Austrasian Goat and Brad Bolduc of Terrible Old Man. In a nutshell, \"Songs of Self-Reliance and Solitude\" is music for the forward-thinking, the individualist, the anarchist, the artist, and the metal-head in us all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":14454469,"name":"Default","price":6.66,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43095079/-/HB-AGsplit10_front.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43095079/-/HB-AGsplit10_front.png","width":400,"height":398}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1709740,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":2896442,"name":"Split w/ Batillus (12\" LP)","permalink":"split-12-lp-w-batillus","position":3,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/split-12-lp-w-batillus","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-11-18T19:43:45.000Z","description":"<strong>BATILLUS</strong>\r\nA1 \tThe Division \t\t\r\nA2 \tThe Children Of The Night Make Their Music \t\t\r\nA3 \tBeyond The River \t\r\n<strong>HALLOWED BUTCHERY</strong>\r\nB1 \tAn Introduction \t\t\r\nB2 \tCoffin Life \r\n<br />\r\nHigh-quality, heavy gram vinyl with artwork by yours truly.
