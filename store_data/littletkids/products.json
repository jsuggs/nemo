We offer two styles, the honey amber bead necklace and the mixed colour amber bead necklace.\r\n\r\nWhen a baby is wearing an amber teething necklace on the skin, the skin’s warmth releases healing oils from the amber which are absorbed via the skin into the bloodstream. Amber is not a stone and therefore warm to the touch. It is also very comfortable and light to wear. Children wearing amber is a very old traditional custom in Europe and the Far East. Amber is known to reduce inflammation of the throat, ear and stomach. It also is a useful tool in fighting inflammation, infections and respiratory diseases. Traditional beaded amber necklaces are a less intrusive remedy for the pain and side effects such as lack of appetite, upset stomachs, ear ache, fevers and colds. Amber is a natural analgesic which will help calm a baby without resorting to drugs. Amber’s anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are also recognised by allopathic medicine. These necklaces are long known for the healing properties of amber which include calmative, analgesic, antispasmodic, expectorant and anti-fever functions.\r\n\r\nOur necklaces are suitable for babies and children. They are designed for boys and girls. They are a MUST have for teething symptoms. Baltic amber is a completely natural pain relief with NO side effects.\r\n\r\nOur necklaces are from Lithuania and are 100% genuine Baltic Amber. They have been carefully made using genuine, authentic, and natural Baltic amber stones. No two stones are the same and for that reason; sizes, colours and shapes of the stone will vary from necklace to necklace.\r\nEvery bead is knotted individually from the next bead and each necklace features a twist screw closure for your child’s safety.\r\n\r\nThe necklace can be worn from 8 weeks old and it is recommended that the earlier you introduce this to them that they will not even notice that they are wearing when they are older.\r\n\r\nI can personally vouch for this product as I was the biggest sceptic of them all. My son was 6 months old and we had had a nightmare of a week when he cut his first tooth, my husband went and purchased an amber necklace without my knowledge and put it on him. We checked his mouth a week later and found that he had cut two more teeth without any fuss!! For our family the amber teething necklace was a saviour!","options":[{"id":38721837,"name":"Honey colour","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":38721840,"name":"Mixed colour","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120420198/-/mixed_coloured_bead_necklace_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120420198/-/mixed_coloured_bead_necklace_2.jpg","width":800,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5706762,"name":"Babies","permalink":"babies","url":"/category/babies"},{"id":5706765,"name":"Accessories","permalink":"accessories","url":"/category/accessories"}]},{"id":12220359,"name":"Girls Beanie","permalink":"girls-beanie","position":4,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/girls-beanie","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-07T01:09:58.000Z","description":"A crochet beanie in cream and pink with a pom pom attached on top.","options":[{"id":38721771,"name":"Pink","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":38721774,"name":"Cream","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":12.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120419994/-/photo.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120419994/-/photo.JPG","width":310,"height":310}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5706765,"name":"Accessories","permalink":"accessories","url":"/category/accessories"}]},{"id":12217344,"name":"Girls animal print top","permalink":"girls-animal-print-top","position":5,"price":22.0,"default_price":22.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/girls-animal-print-top","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-06T20:57:10.000Z","description":"This is a gorgeous top for a little girl. \r\n\r\nThe pattern has small deers and a black bow on the neck line.\r\n\r\nThe puff arms are comfortable and stylish for your little one.","options":[{"id":38712783,"name":"2 Years","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":38712786,"name":"4 Years","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":38712789,"name":"5 years","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":12.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120390762/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120390762/-/image.jpg","width":641,"height":577}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5706756,"name":"Girls clothing","permalink":"girls-clothing","url":"/category/girls-clothing"}]}]
