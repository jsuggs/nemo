As young children, discouraged away from the full expression of our emotions, we learn that shallow breathing helps us not to feel as much. The repression of feeling can become automatic, and life, while perhaps less painful, also has less joy. Unakite can be very helpful in the steady release of feelings long held in. An opaque coral and olive-green stone (two colors associated with the solar plexus), it consists of three minerals: feldspar, epidote, and quartz. When one is supported by deepened self-esteem and self-awareness, it is easier to allow old feelings to arise so that they may be released. Unakite lends another element to self-awareness. In working with this stone people have noticed that they were able to go deeper than the physical symptoms of an illness and understanding the mental and emotional sources for it. It is also believed to help release conditions which have been inhibiting personal growth.","options":[{"id":19028881,"name":"Default","price":4.8,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.8,"amount_with_others":3.8,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58381795/-/Unakite.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58381795/-/Unakite.jpg","width":496,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3118159,"name":"Tumble Stones","permalink":"tumble-stones","url":"/category/tumble-stones"}]}]
