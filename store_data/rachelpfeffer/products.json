The last photo shows the ring in the white option, but gives you a size reference.\r\n","options":[{"id":47066556,"name":"size 5","price":108.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47066559,"name":"size 5.5","price":108.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47066562,"name":"size 6","price":108.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47066565,"name":"size 6.5","price":108.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47066568,"name":"size 7","price":108.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47066571,"name":"size 7.5","price":108.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47066574,"name":"size 8","price":108.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47066577,"name":"size 8.5","price":108.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47066580,"name":"size 9","price":108.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126785457/-/DSC01469.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126785457/-/DSC01469.JPG","width":2122,"height":1909},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126785490/-/DSC01470.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126785490/-/DSC01470.JPG","width":2176,"height":1863},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126785304/-/DSC01457.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126785304/-/DSC01457.JPG","width":3180,"height":2713}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5923428,"name":"ALL","permalink":"all","url":"/category/all"},{"id":2230133,"name":"Fingers","permalink":"fingers","url":"/category/fingers"}]},{"id":14523672,"name":"Sterling Bike Necklace with Brass Hearts","permalink":"sterling-bike-necklace-with-brass-hearts","position":20,"price":88.0,"default_price":88.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sterling-bike-necklace-with-brass-hearts","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-31T01:52:26.000Z","description":"A twist on the classic Le Petit Bike pendant, this little beauty has a loving spin!

After a long hiatus, I have re-designed my well loved hot dog ring. This time I carved him out of wax and cast him in recycled sterling silver. And there are so many options! First of all, he has a wide half-round band on the bottom. This guy has a heart stamped on him, but he can come unstamped, or stamped with a name, or with more hearts. The underside of the hot dog has a furrier finish (see necklace sample). So please be sure to let me know how you want it finished!!
