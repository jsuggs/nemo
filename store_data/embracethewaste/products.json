This is a 15 track sound piece reflective of hard hitting beats and non commercial gimmicks. If you are under the impression that a rapper is just a rapper, you are mistaken. AfterDark is what we consider to Be an Emcee. Check out www.myspace.com/afterdark1 or just buy this EPIC album now. You won't take it out of your rotation ever.\r\n","options":[{"id":1437426,"name":"A.D.D.","price":7.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2779928/-/afterdarkhiphop.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2779928/-/afterdarkhiphop.jpg","width":200,"height":200}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":287362,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
