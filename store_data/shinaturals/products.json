(Liquid Oil Cream) method is a 3 step application of products, scientifically one of the best ways to moisturize and keep moisture the hair.\r\n\r\nHow it works : \r\n1. liquid phase - apply the liquid to moisturize hair strands. Can be used on dry, wet or damp hair.\r\n\r\n2. Oil phase - apply the oil after the liquid phase. This will seal in the moisture.\r\n\r\n3. Cream phase - apply the cream to seal in the first and second phases for prolonged moisture retention.\r\n\r\nWhy it works:\r\nCurly and dry hair textures need moisture to thrive.

Cotton may feel soft to the skin but its weave actually grips and tugs at individual strands causing damage and breakage. The effects of continuous contact with cotton pillowcases can tangle and ultimately ruin hair\r\n\r\nHair treated by bleaching, highlighting, coloring, chemical perms, relaxers, blow dryers, and curling irons are  especially susceptible to breakage. For braided, chemically treated or normal hair, the use of a satin pillowcase:\r\n\r\n    * reduces hair breakage\r\n    * helps maintain proper moisture balance\r\n    * protects hairstyles\r\n    * eliminates most tangling\r\n\r\nTo keep your style fresh for days, sleep on satin pillowcases. Unlike cotton pillowcases, which can snag hair, satin pillowcases allow hair to glide over them, reducing tangles. \r\nSatin  pillowcases benefit hair treated by bleaching, chemical perms or relaxers and are an ideal remedy for preventing color-treated and highlighted hair from drying out. Your hair comes in contact with one thing more than any other – the pillowcase.
