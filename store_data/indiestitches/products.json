The flutter sleeves flatter arms and the open armhole can be slightly sultry, offering a teasing peek at the Simple Slip or perhaps a lacy bra underneath. There are several ways to style--wear it loose, with a ready-made belt, with shirring, or with a fabric sash. Both the box pleat at the back of the neck and the soft shirttail hem add a bit more interest, and you can show as much or as little leg as you like by shortening or lengthening the pattern pieces.\r\n\r\nSIMPLE SLIP is a quick-to-sew, easy-to-wear piece. It’s perfect for layering under any dress, but completely suitable for wearing alone.

View Green is the deep pink sample shown, in a medium weight t-shirting type fabric. View Blue is shown in a cotton sweater knit with woven shirting fabric details. Fabric requirements for the top are calibrated and tested for a maximum 24\" front waist length, shorter waists will require less fabric.\r\n\r\nChoose the Hummingbird Top by nearest full bust measurement. If a closer fit is preferred, go down a size. Go up a size for a more relaxed fit. Top is calibrated for 0\" ease at the full bust.\r\n\r\nChoose the Hummingbird Skirt by nearest full hip measurement. 2.5\"-3\" ease is built into the skirt, which is designed for size and ease customization at the side seams.

It's easy to sew, easy to fit, and works in such a wide range of fabrics that we know it will become your next handmade wardrobe staple.\r\n\r\nWith only 4 main pattern pieces (plus details like pockets and belt loops), you'll spend less time cutting and more time making. And because the cut is full, Zinnia only requires fitting in one place — the waist. So there are no tricky curves to get just right.\r\n\r\nAnd once you make it once, you will definitely want more. Try version 1 in a chambray for summer, make a tartan skirt for Fall with version 2, or get dressy using chiffon and version 3, which includes instructions for lining.\r\n\r\nZinnia has plenty of features that you can feel free to interchange. You can switch out the in-seam or patch pockets, or use the belt loops on any version.\r\n\r\nVersion 1 is a gathered skirt that falls below the knee, with a button-front placket and patch pockets. Version 2 is pleated, hits above the knee for a shorter length, and includes belt loops and in-seam pockets.
