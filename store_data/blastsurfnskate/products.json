A peak into how Jamie O’Brien was weaned to throw himself over Pipeline ledges translating into a life-long adventure. Draining bombs, tweaked airs, broken legs,Tavarua, Nias, Teahupoo, P Pass, Chungu, and Hawaii; this will be the movie of the year. A note from Jamie O’Brien: There are filters between me and you. Unless you know me like my Dad does, assume you don’t know me. I am more than what the filters let you see. And less. Who is JOB is my attempt to talk directly. Through my art and video. It’s taken me 3 years to create an hour without filters. When it’s done, please watch. Then hate. Or love. Or ignore. Or whatever. Who is Job DVD is a must own!","options":[{"id":10452937,"name":"Default","price":28.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29490965/-/SF1310DVD-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29490965/-/SF1310DVD-1.jpg","width":150,"height":236}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1770751,"name":"DVD's","permalink":"dvd-s","url":"/category/dvd-s"}]}]
