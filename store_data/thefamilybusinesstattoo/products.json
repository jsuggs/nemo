Visually taking us through the creative and physical process of having a tattoo, this book is as much an inspirational design source as a peek into the private world of the tattoo parlour, its artists and clients. From the first traces to the finished design, the characters and equipments used, this book reflects the status of the tattoo as a truly twenty-first century art form.\r\n\r\nMo Coppoletta is one of the world’s most respected tattoo artists. He established The Family Business Tattoo shop in 2003 in the heart of London with the aim of creating a new setting for tattoo enthusiasts – a shop with a different approach and a unique environment. The Family Business has built a strong following and is now internationally renowned for its high standards of creativity and talented artists.\r\n\r\nHardback, 208 pages\r\nPublished in 2010 by Pavilion Books\r\nPhotography © Fredi Marcarini and Chris Terry","options":[{"id":18593805,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":18.0},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":73,"name":"Bulgaria","code":"BG"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":89,"name":"Croatia (Hrvatska)","code":"HR"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":91,"name":"Cyprus","code":"CY"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":100,"name":"Estonia","code":"EE"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":41,"name":"Turkey","code":"TR"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":204,"name":"Slovenia","code":"SI"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":203,"name":"Slovakia (Slovak Republic)","code":"SK"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":189,"name":"Romania","code":"RO"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":184,"name":"Poland","code":"PL"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":245,"name":"Isle of Man","code":"IM"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":19,"name":"Iceland","code":"IS"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":125,"name":"Hungary","code":"HU"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":244,"name":"Guernsey","code":"GG"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127680993/-/Screen_Shot_2013-11-16_at_16.06.21.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127680993/-/Screen_Shot_2013-11-16_at_16.06.21.png","width":575,"height":707},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/56895551/-/book.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/56895551/-/book.jpg","width":584,"height":712}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3048165,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":5799925,"name":"Vouchers","permalink":"gift-vouchers","position":2,"price":15.5,"default_price":15.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/gift-vouchers","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-03-28T12:18:54.000Z","description":"Available in various amounts, posted to your door.\r\nA 3.5% surcharge has been added to cover processing fees.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis item is not refundable.
