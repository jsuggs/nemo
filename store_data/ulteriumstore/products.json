Twist of Fate\r\n\r\nThe self-titled debut album from Theocracy has been out of print for several years, and fans have constantly asked for a re-issue. In order to improve upon the drum machine and amateur production of the original release without losing the charm of the recordings, Theocracy drummer Shawn Benson recorded drums on all tracks, while nothing else was re-recorded. Matt completely re-mixed the album, with the mastering handled by Mika Jussila.\r\n\r\nThe result is mind-blowing. The classic tracks and the great feeling from the debut album are still there, but with a production and sound that is so dramatically improved that it feels like a completely new album.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re a fan of Theocracy or not, don’t miss out on this essential album full of high-quality progressive power metal!\r\n\r\nClick here to check out an album teaser over at YouTube: http://youtu.be/ffoULa9OfCU","options":[{"id":44231613,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124845357/-/theocracy_artwork_internet.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124845357/-/theocracy_artwork_internet.jpg","width":800,"height":800}],"artists":[{"id":46839,"name":"Theocracy","permalink":"theocracy","url":"/artist/theocracy"}],"categories":[{"id":83424,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":13778625,"name":"Theocracy - Theocracy [12\" double gatefold vinyl edition]","permalink":"theocracy-theocracy-12-double-gatefold-edition","position":4,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/theocracy-theocracy-12-double-gatefold-edition","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-25T10:39:46.000Z","description":"Theocracy - Theocracy [12\" double gatefold vinyl edition]\r\nULTLMT007\r\n\r\nShipping now!\r\n\r\nDelivery times looks something like this;\r\nWithin Europe: Less than one week\r\nNorth America: 1-2 weeks\r\nThe rest of the world: 2-4 weeks\r\n\r\nThe 12\" double gatefold vinyl edition is strictly limited to 500 copies worldwide.\r\n\r\nTrack listing\r\n\r\nSide A:\r\n01.
