If you never had a chance to pick up this art object back in 2001... today's your lucky day.\r\n\r\nEach box is signed with an invader and skull drawing.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nPrayStation year 2 cdrom, my hard drive. A joint project between IdN magazine in Hong Kong and myself.\r\n\r\nThis hopefully will strike against most of our notions about how a cdrom should behave. Usually we acquire and view media on cdrom in a traditional manner, by launching an executable and letting it take over our desktops. This cdrom is the exact opposite. Its purpose is for the viewer to sift through the 397 folders, exploring the 3,637 files which total 462 megs of data.\r\n\r\nIt is everything I collected over the past year, which made PrayStation year 2 what it was. All original source files, art files, text files, accidents, epiphanies, etc.\r\n\r\nsome data may even be broken - as it attempts to connect with the PrayStation server. Nothing was altered. It is there for you to explore how things were built and how things talked to each other.\r\n\r\nIn March 2000, my very first open-sourced flash file hit PrayStation, and it's been pure chaos ever since. The notion of needing to give something away in order to receive something new has never hit home harder than it has in the past year. A community of people have banded together - hoping to help build and nurture the new media experience.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this booklet and cdrom - it's truly a glimpse into process, successes, failures, and accidents.","options":[{"id":23812541,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73961585/-/ps2_cdrom.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73961585/-/ps2_cdrom.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":193535,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":7500965,"name":"the Triangle Grid, Teal","permalink":"the-triangle-grid-teal","position":5,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-triangle-grid-teal","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-10T03:20:57.000Z","description":"<h4>Specifications :</h4><br />\r\n\r\nPrinted on the HP Designjet Z3100 Photo Printer using HP Vivera pigment inks which resist fading for over 200 years.
