Not a formally trained artist, Powell came up on the scene in his native New York City during the mid 1980s, took his 35 millimeter camera out of his pocket and captured the personalities that defined an era of urban history. Through his friendship with the Beastie Boys, Powell introduced himself to old-school rappers such as Slick Rick, LL Cool J, Run DMC, Biz Markie, Method Man, and legendary artists like Basquiat and Keith Haring. The collection of photographs is curiously egalitarian-a picture of a supermodel shares the page with a shot of an afghan hound-and images of ordinary people rank just as prominently as the picture of Powell himself with Andy Warhol. With graffiti by choice designers superimposed on some of the photographs, and letters to Powell that are simultaneously shout-outs to him and to another era of city life, the book is a collaborative construction much like a yearbook that annuals Powell's encounters with the world: a hectic convergence of talent, loosely organized, gritty but with disarming warmth in unexpected people and places.\r\n\r\nDate of Publication  ::  2005 \r\nCondition  ::  Mint/New\r\n\r\n:: Price ::  $100 [+ s&h]","options":[{"id":24257259,"name":"Default","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75441756/-/Ricky__1_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75441756/-/Ricky__1_.jpg","width":650,"height":488},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75441768/-/Ricky__2_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75441768/-/Ricky__2_.jpg","width":650,"height":488},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75441792/-/Ricky__4_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75441792/-/Ricky__4_.jpg","width":650,"height":488}],"artists":[{"id":147747,"name":"Ricky Powell","permalink":"ricky-powell","url":"/artist/ricky-powell"}],"categories":[{"id":2486031,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":3121603,"name":"Signed/Numbered","permalink":"signed-numbered","url":"/category/signed-numbered"},{"id":2511923,"name":"One of the Kind","permalink":"one-of-the-kind","url":"/category/one-of-the-kind"},{"id":2587733,"name":"Street Art","permalink":"street-art","url":"/category/street-art"}]},{"id":9732551,"name":"ANTHEM x McGINNESS","permalink":"anthem-x-r-mcginness","position":3,"price":35.0,"default_price":35.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/anthem-x-r-mcginness","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-04T19:50:17.000Z","description":":: ANTHEM No.8 :: \r\nAnthem x Ryan McGinness\r\n\r\n:: Focus :: \r\nThe LA/Art Issue\r\nLtd Edition of 450 copies\r\nExclusive Ltd Edition Cover 2/3\r\n\r\n:: Specifics :: \r\nOut of Print, Dead Stock, Rare\r\n\r\nDate of Publication :: 2003\r\nCondition :: Near Mint\r\n\r\n:: Price :: $35 [+ s&h]","options":[{"id":30458797,"name":"Default","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95634101/-/Anthem__1_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95634101/-/Anthem__1_.jpg","width":650,"height":488},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95634109/-/Anthem__2_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95634109/-/Anthem__2_.jpg","width":650,"height":488},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95634125/-/Anthem__3_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95634125/-/Anthem__3_.jpg","width":650,"height":488}],"artists":[{"id":181113,"name":"Ryan McGinness","permalink":"ryan-mcginness","url":"/artist/ryan-mcginness"}],"categories":[{"id":2486033,"name":"Magazines","permalink":"magazines","url":"/category/magazines"},{"id":2490251,"name":"Out of Print / Dead Stock","permalink":"out-of-print-dead-stock","url":"/category/out-of-print-dead-stock"},{"id":2587723,"name":"Photography","permalink":"photography","url":"/category/photography"},{"id":2587733,"name":"Street Art","permalink":"street-art","url":"/category/street-art"},{"id":2587739,"name":"Fashion","permalink":"fashion","url":"/category/fashion"},{"id":2899511,"name":"Design/Art","permalink":"design-art","url":"/category/design-art"}]},{"id":8880155,"name":"CLARK -

photographer Boogie possesses a rare talent for documenting the human condition. His black and white photographs capture the character and the inhabitants of some of the most tumultuous cities in the world. Traditionally photojournalism focuses more on content--recording a moment or an event-- and less upon formal concerns. However, Boogie gracefully integrates both a documentarian's eye with a finely honed artistic sensibility. Many of his images are at once deeply poignant, and totally unsettling. Boogies work has taken him from Serbia, to Cuba and throughout South America.
