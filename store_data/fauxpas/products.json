Featuring members of acts like Nals Goring, Horse Boys, and Heat Wilson, this cassette is 30 minutes of aggressive pop drive-by, tape manipulation, and the skewed skits of Russian immigrants. More recently having expanded into a quartet and changing their name to Easy Street, this may just be one of the last few Sord recordings to exist.

Still, Brattleboro’s (by way of Colorado) Happy Jawbone Family Band has made one of the most creative and exciting pop records I have heard in years, with 40 songs and over an hour of music that will capture your heart, feed it LSD, dance to records with it all night, then tuck it in with a kiss as the sun rises. For fans of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, Maher Shalal Hash Baz, the Beatles, music, etc. Discs come wrapped in cardstock in a hand-numbered edition of 100, sealed in poly bags with a lollipop!

Consequently, all further outgoing copies will not include candy, and will only have polybags while supplies last. I gurantee that you will still get a quality, undamaged product, and the price has also been reduced by a dollar to reflect this boo-boo. That's what I get for trying to be cute...\r\n","options":[{"id":9420034,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25752543/-/hjfbpackage.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25752543/-/hjfbpackage.jpg","width":494,"height":492}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":84262,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
