Their anecdotes bring nods of recognition, smiles, chortles, sometimes even tears! \r\nRay Kenneth Gullickson is \r\nthat kind of “storyteller.” \r\n\r\nAfter decades of listening to \r\nDad’s vivid narratives at family gatherings, My brothers and \r\nI convinced him to create \r\na new family heirloom. \r\nWe persuaded Dad to write down his true tales of colorful characters and sometimes surprising situations in \r\n“A Second Pair of Shoes.” \r\n\r\nIt was an instant treasure to family and friends.\r\n\r\nDad and I worked together for the past few years to give this book BROAD APPEAL and HISTORICAL VALUE. \r\n\r\nIt has more than 100 images, including over thirty of Dad’s wonderful illustrations! His drawings provide an historical record of life on a typical farm in the American Midwest during the 1930s and 40s \r\nin the context of charming true stories.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nHere’s an excerpt from \r\n“A Second Pair of Shoes”\r\n\r\n(The reunion) seemed kind of dreary until eighty-year-old Aunt ‘Glady’ arrived in her brand-new, yellow and black Dodge hardtop. Her twin sister, Gertrude, was with her. \r\nI knew right away that we could look forward to some bright conversation about their recent adventures as world travelers.\r\n\r\nThey liked to travel on cruise ships and always kept their passports ready, in case one of them heard about a bargain fare on an international tour \r\nto anywhere! They had JUST returned from South America, where they had climbed up to see the ancient Incan ruins in the mountains of Peru. \r\n\r\nTHEY knew how to enjoy life! To prove it, each of them showed everyone at the reunion her certificate for being chosen by fellow shipmates as: ‘The ONE who had the most FUN!’\r\n\r\n...(Reunion) attendance was the largest it had been in \r\nforty years! Everyone brought something to eat. It was tempting to “try a bit of everything.” After all… \r\n“I wouldn’t want to offend by passing up someone’s favorite recipe… I can DIET tomorrow!”\r\n\r\nGladys and Gertrude made their way around the serving table. Both of them had an abundance of food on their plates when they returned to their places at the table. \r\nBut, just as they sat down, Gertrude discovered a serious problem.  She said, “I… I think \r\nI forgot to bring my TEETH!” After a hasty search of her oversized purse, she confirmed she \"must have left them on the sink...” \r\n\r\n“Don’t worry, Dear,” Aunt Glady said. “We’ll just take turns! I’ll finish this drumstick and then you can eat yours.” Without another word, Gertrude started eating her Whipped Jello™ while she waited for Gladys to finish a piece of fried chicken. \r\n\r\nThen, taking her dentures out of her mouth, Aunt Gladys handed them across the table to her sister so BOTH of them could enjoy the reunion feast!\r\n\r\nWas my Aunt Glady SPECIAL-- or what?\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nSomething else makes \r\n“A Second Pair of Shoes” unique and truly exceptional. Readers are given the opportunity--and space--\r\nto record their own precious memories, making it easy to pass along a personal legacy!  If someone you know has great stories to tell and memorabilia that ought to be shared with family, friends and future generations, this book can help! \r\n\r\nCover-to-cover, it’s full of humor, history and heart. \r\nI'd really like to see the book succeed for Dad.
