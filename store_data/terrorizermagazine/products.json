We talk to NAPALM DEATH'S Shane Embury; the man, the legend that is Mr Tom G. Warrior of CELTIC FROST and TRIPTYKON; the living death metal encyclopaedia Trevor Strnad of THE BLACK DAHLIA MURDER and some even more familiar faces…\r\n\r\nBut that is only the beginning. We talk to DEICIDE frontman Glen Benton, about why the band are actually a bunch of nice guys, and why they finally split with Ralph Santolla. We talk to HELL about having to prove they're a creative, current band and not a retro pastiche, and reminisce with Max Cavalera about the recording of SEPULTURA classic 'Chaos A.D.'.\r\n\r\nWe chat to NIGHTWISH about trying to find stability, and why they might do anything from death metal to reggae on their next album. We find that there is life after Candlemass for Leif Edling as AVATARIUM find their feet, discover why metalheads are the most open-minded music fans with post-punk's new stars BEASTMILK, and discover how NECROPHOBIC are feeling after their recent dramas.\r\n\r\nPost-metal collective THE OCEAN are pitted against Norwegian black metal/jazz lunatics SHINING in our Hard Of Hearing test, GLORIOR BELLI explain why a French black metal band playing music that sounds like it's from the US' Deep South is actually authentic, ROSETTA explain why they want musicians to kill the music industry and the death metal filth of DARK DESCENT RECORDS is profiled.\r\n\r\n<html>\r\n<p>If that's still not enough, this special anniversary issue also features:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>YEAR OF NO LIGHT</li>\r\n<li>CONAN</li>\r\n<li>GENERATION KILL</li>\r\n<li>code</li>\r\n<li>VAURA</li>\r\n<li>MONOLITHE</li>\r\n<li>FALKENBACH</li>\r\n<li>GLITTERTIND</li>\r\n<li>CASTEVET</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subscribing using the PayPal button below will set up a quarterly subscription which will be charged automatically every 12 weeks.

We explore life, death and getting stuck in the middle of Germany in your underwear in winter when your tour bus catches fire with PARADISE LOST and LACUNA COIL. Cristina Scabbia and Nick Holmes explain the different ways they create, and their very different relationships with darkness.\r\n\r\nSEPULTURA also discuss the passage of time, but with a far more aggressive soundtrack. You can also find out what connects them with SAHG – who discuss their trip into prog land, and why metal’s getting a lot more interesting – and also with the latest Cult Of Luna record. Hear also how MONSTER MAGNET have gone off into psychedelic territory, and whether new album ‘Last Patrol’ marks the end for Dave Wyndorf and co…\r\n\r\nWe get behind the story that took DIMMU BORGIR’S music to Hollywood, find out what keeps the fire burning bright within KATAKLYSM, introduce BRUTAL TRUTH to the grind inquisitor, and then find out what goes on in the minds of INQUISITION themselves as they become the hottest name in black metal.\r\n\r\nSKELETONWITCH explain why consistency is a massively underrated virtue for bands, and why they’ll never land us with a ‘Cold Lake’ moment, ONSLAUGHT explain why they’re flattered by being told they will corrupt your life, and we get drawn into the confusing, frightening world of CORRECTIONS HOUSE, the new supergroup featuring Mike Williams from Eyehategod and Scott Kelly from Neurosis.\r\n\r\nWe get a frosty, necro Mixtape from Matt Heafy of TRIVIUM, find out what KEEP OF KALESSIN’S new album will sound like, learn about World War II generals with HAIL OF BULLETS, profile ROADBURN FESTIVAL, report on the LONDON TATTOO CONVENTION and hear how Joel Grind from TOXIC HOLOCAUST is like, er, Frank Sinatra…\r\n\r\nAnd if that’s still not enough, Halloween’s Terrorizer also includes:\r\nPESTILENCE\r\nBROKEN HOPE\r\nUFOMAMMUT\r\nDEMONICAL\r\nORANSSI PAZUZU\r\nKILL DIVISION\r\nRED FANG\r\n\r\nGo right to the bottom of the page and \"Add to Cart\" to buy a single copy of issue 242, or use the PayPal button below to subscribe using our new three-issue subscription and save a bunch of money.

We flip through the history books to investigate just how much the horned one has enjoyed dabbling in the creative arts.\r\n\r\nCOVEN\r\nDeath threats, ritualistic sex and an album that turned rock music on its head forevermore. The ultimate witch of Rock Jinx Dawson reveals all.\r\n\r\nDOOM\r\nFrom Black Sabbath to Cathedral to Electric Wizard, the doom movement’s relationship with the darkside is explored and dissected.\r\n\r\nBLACK SABBATH\r\nPioneers of the metal world, and a band that brought fear into God botherers everywhere – former drummer Bill Ward looks back at their illustrious career.\r\n\r\nMERCYFUL FATE\r\n30 years since it was unleashed we celebrate Mercyful Fate’s ‘Melissa’ and its follow-up ‘Don’t Break The Oath’ with an in-depth reflection of both albums from frontman and metal legend King Diamond.\r\n\r\nTHE CULTURE OF DARK, SATANIC AND RITUALISTIC MUSIC\r\nRituals, pentagrams, Satanic Bibles – we dissect the elements of evil and the culture that exists.\r\n\r\nTHE DEVIL’S FLICKS\r\nWinterfylleth’s Simon Lucas explores the (un)healthy relationship between heavy metal and horror movies and looks at some of the most vital horror and occult-inspired films. Are you sitting comfortably?\r\n\r\nBLACK METAL\r\nSatanism, goats, sacrifices… Black metal is a genre of essential Hell songs. Tracing the origins of the genre and celebrating the forefathers; Cradle of Filth’s Dani Filth recounts tales of the second generation, and we finish off looking at the pure ritualistic side of this ultimately evil genre.\r\n\r\nCRONOS\r\nHis band is called Venom, he’s been at war with Satan, he’s been possessed, and he invented black metal – this is the world created by Cronos!\r\n\r\nDISSECTION\r\nIn one of the last times he was interviewed for Terrorizer, Dissection’s frontman Jon Nödtveidt talks about his interest in Satanism.\r\n\r\nABSU\r\nMasters of magick and rituals, Absu’s dark lord Proscriptor McGovern talks all things esoteric.\r\n\r\nHIGH PRIESTESSES - GIRLS UNDER THE OATH\r\nWithout all-powerful women leading the charge, the Left Hand Path would not be a path worth treading. We celebrate the dominant force in occult rock.\r\n\r\nKING DIAMOND\r\nThe Godfather of Evil – King Diamond talks frankly about being the true Dark Lord of Metal!\r\n\r\nNWOBHM\r\nThe world’s most important movement in the history of heavy metal was steeped in bands celebrating the dark side – from Satan to Hell, Witchfyde to Demon. But just how dark were our British bands? We talk to the pioneers to find out.\r\n\r\nHELL\r\nStraight from the fiery pits, Hell’s Kev Bower recalls the origins of the band that were in league with Lucifer – at least by name association.\r\n\r\nSATAN\r\nUpsetting the local vicar, a band so evil they named their band after the Dark Lord himself.

Emperor’s former mainman IHSAHN, God Seed/ex-Gorgoroth shrieker GAAHL, Carpathian Forest’s TCHORT and Cradle Of Filth’s ever-controversial frontman DANI FILTH all speak about what black metal is, how it reached this point, and where it is going – and answer whether heavy metal’s most evil style can survive.\r\n\r\nDefinitely still alive are death metal masters AUTOPSY, who discuss with Terrorizer how they have kept the fire. We find ORPHANED LAND in pensive mood in their quest to banish hate from the Middle-East, while AMON AMARTH remind us that their songs may be catchy, but they still sing about bloody death in fire.\r\n\r\nMental Italian black metallers ABORYM tell us how the seedy side of America and Italian polluters inspired their new album, SKINNY PUPPY discuss their music being used Guantanamo Bay torture and WHITE WIZZARD try and bolt their revolving door of personnel.\r\n\r\nNorwegian prog metallers LEPROUS step out from under Ihsahn’s considerable shadow, CHTHONIC fight to bring their music to the world and Isis and Deftones members team up for PALMS. We discuss the very different but equally excellent approaches to black metal of SHADE EMPIRE and SVART CROWN, delve into the past with NECROPSY and put NYHC legends VISION OF DISORDER to the test in Hard Of Hearing. We also talk to the hero/madman behind grindcore heaven OBSCENE EXTREME.\r\n\r\nNew bands on the Choice Cuts slab this month include FULL OF HELL, DEMON LUNG and DEATHCHAIN, we select and dissect new albums from AUTOPSY, CHTHONIC, DEAFHEAVEN and JEX THOTH, and take in DESERTFEST, SWR, NEUROTIC DEATHFEST, MARYLAND DEATHFEST and DEVIN TOWNSEND. We preview HELLFEST, and to round the issue off, Mille Petrozza of thrash gods KREATOR picks his ultimate mixtape.\r\n\r\nIf that’s not enough, this month’s issue also features:\r\n\r\nDEICIDE\r\nTHE SECRET\r\nJEX THOTH\r\nCOFFINS\r\nMASTER MUSICIANS OF BUKKAKE\r\nSHINING (NORWAY)\r\nREPULSION\r\nHATEBREED\r\nSUICIDAL TENDENCIES\r\n\r\nGo right to the bottom of the page and \"Add to Cart\" to buy a single copy of issue 237, or use the PayPal button below to subscribe using our new three-issue subscription and save a bunch of money.\r\n\r\nWhy subscribe?

If there was ever a band to assign a riff beyond its sonic confines to, say, that of a physical object like a runic sceptre of awesomeness, it's Electric Wizard! \r\n\r\n2012 has been their year, so there is no better way to honour them by welcoming the doom lords onto this month's cover. We enter the house of Jus Oborn and Liz Buckingham and discuss the difficulties of following up seven solid albums let alone one and the skinny on the EXCLUSIVE! tape included with selected copies of this issue. \r\n\r\nWe also sit down with post-metal pioneers Neurosis and discuss the perpetual evolution of a band considered visionary. We travel to Yorkshire to catch up with My Dying Bride, talk religious righteousness and art with grind heroes Pig Destroyer, look back over Lacuna Coil's career with frontwoman Cristina Scabbia and remember Isis' 'Oceanic' record a decade later. \r\n\r\nWe also talk to Rotting Christ ahead of their headlining set at Germany's Nuclear War Now! festival, get green with Hexvessel, talk about hate with ex-Cryptopsy frontman Lord Worm's Rage Nucléaire, dress in denim with Cauldron and discover that it's business as usual for Converge.\r\n \r\nAlso you can find out what our esteemed wrecking crew thought of the latest releases by Converge, My Dying Bride,  Neurosis, Cradle Of Filth and many others. And we bring you reports from Bergen's Beyond The Gates festival, LA's Power Of The Riff festival, Vision Of Disorder's return tour and Cold In Berlin's London show.

From metal’s very nativity story, the birth of Black Sabbath, which changed rock music forever and created a genre deemed too dangerous and evil for the young and impressionable, to the heroes of stoner doom, funeral doom, drone and sludge.

Enforcer is the way now!”</italic>\r\n\r\nYou gotta love emails from <bold>Fenriz</bold>. When it comes to metal he is the benchmark for all things badass and so often have we discovered a new band only to find out he's already championed them on his blog. So it's good to know that my near obsession with these spandex-clad Swedes is shared by ol' Fenrico himself. I can't remember when I discovered Enforcer but it was around a time when I was furiously digging up any band that sounded like it could have been in Kerrang circa 1982. Getting a daily fix of Enforcer's 'Into The Night' album when it came out in November 2008 was akin to a serious crack habit – friends and family forcing me into an intervention situation, weaning me off high voltage spinners like 'Speed Queen' gradually, spoon feeding me musical methadone to calm me down from my denim and leather high.\r\n\r\nThat album made it into our year end list (and our decade Top 100 too!!) in issue #179 (Jan 2009) and saw Terrorizer salivating over them and their studded cohorts in a scene report about the rise of the traditional heavy metal sound from Sweden, and then when Earache brought out the genre-defining compilation 'Heavy Metal Killers' later that month it was set in stone – true metal was back with a vengeance and I was in my element. Explaining my love of Enforcer back then to a friend (who works at Earache) I told her, “one day that band will be on the cover of Terrorizer.” Eighteen months later when the label got the deal to put their killer cut 'Diamonds' out in Europe I was reminded of my overzealous claim, and well the rest is history.\r\n\r\nIt's refreshing to champion something so fresh and exhilarating once again on our cover, no okay, not exactly new but definitely renewed. With no holds barred photos taken during their recent trip to London and an insightful interview with Kevin Stewart-Panko we hope you get as excited as I am about these true metal diamond geezers. \r\n\r\nENFORCER\r\nKINGDOM OF SORROW\r\nYAKUZA\r\nSTARKWEATHER\r\nGRAVE\r\nSEVERE TORTURE\r\nYOB\r\n\r\nDOMINION #5 with\r\n\r\nLACRIMOSA\r\nFRONT LINE ASSEMBLY\r\nKMFDM\r\nSUICIDE COMMANDO","options":[{"id":9367499,"name":"Magazine","price":4.25,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.75,"amount_with_others":1.75,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.75,"amount_with_others":4.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25574502/-/_199_ENFORCER_COVER_NEW-1_LORES.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25574502/-/_199_ENFORCER_COVER_NEW-1_LORES.jpg","width":496,"height":670}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":294659,"name":"Terrorizer magazine","permalink":"terrorizer-magazine","url":"/category/terrorizer-magazine"},{"id":1365511,"name":"Single Copies","permalink":"single-copies","url":"/category/single-copies"},{"id":1742237,"name":"Dominion","permalink":"dominion","url":"/category/dominion"}]},{"id":2611381,"name":"Terrorizer #198 July 2010 Grand Magus, Dio Tribute + more","permalink":"terrorizer-198-july-2010-grand-magus-dio-tribute-more","position":66,"price":4.25,"default_price":4.25,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/terrorizer-198-july-2010-grand-magus-dio-tribute-more","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-06-11T16:37:43.000Z","description":"May 16 should have been a normal day, I'd gone down to Total Rock to present my Sunday afternoon radio show and by the time I'd got there at 3pm the rumours of Dio's death had done the rounds online. It was with immense relief that I read his wife's statement on air that Dio was alive, but extremely ill and in his honour my show became dedicated to the strength and courage of a man who had informed my music taste, whether I knew it or not, throughout my life. He was, without doubt, the voice that inspired my musical heroes and as I discovered Rainbow and 'Mob Rules'-era Sabbath, he himself became my idol. The discovery, upon returning home from the studio, that he had passed away was shattering. I was consoled knowing that this incredible man, who left a impact on everyone he met or played to, live or in his immense body of recorded work, had left us only in body, his spirit will live on.\r\n\r\nSo it's fitting that in this issue, where features were promptly shifted to make space for Jonathan Horsley's moving tribute that metal's current torch bearers Grand Magus are on the cover. Who better to represent the continuing legacy of Dio's career than the band that have been outspoken time and again about his influence on their music? With traditional heavy metal at a deafening high with Grand Magus signing to metal powerhouse Roadrunner and their fellow countrymen Enforcer storming the UK on their recent Terrorizer-sponsored tour with Cauldron, Dio may have reached his last high note on this world stage, but his music and the music he inspired still soars in anyone who lives to bang their heads, pump their fists and throw the horns.

From the Norwegian 'blackjazz' of Shining and the brass-laden mentalism of Japanese legends Sigh, all the way to the cinematic excess of the mighty Rotting Christ and the carnival of madness that is our cover stars Finntroll  – a band more interested in charting their own course through the annals of Finnish black metal than hooking their longship to trend or hype – b lack metal now is less about frost-covered forests and more about fireworks to the face.\r\n\r\nWe examine the roots of metalcore, trudging into the dark and oft-forgotten world of misanthropic genre pioneers Integrity, the accidental crossover brilliance of the Cro-Mags and the genre's assault on the metal mainstream, earning it the ire of metalheads and hardcore kids alike.\r\n\r\nShedding blood, patience and tears in pursuit of metal's most talked about topics, we hit the road with reactivated sludge gods EyeHateGod, get the skinny on the unlikely collaboration between King Ov Hell (ex of Gorgoroth) and Shagrath (Dimmu Borgir), uncover the eagerly awaited new album from British doom institution Cathedral and more besides.\r\n\r\nAs if that wasn't enough, we proudly lauch Sick Sounds, the world's first magazine for extreme metal musicians with a sixteen page teaser free inside this issue. Shred like Testament, record like Russ Russell and uncover the secrets of Sleep.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE THE COVERMOUNT CD IS NOT INCLUDED.","options":[{"id":8078641,"name":"Terrorizer #193 Feb 2010","price":4.25,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.75,"amount_with_others":1.75,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.75,"amount_with_others":4.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/21596851/-/_193_Finntroll_Cover_LORES.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/21596851/-/_193_Finntroll_Cover_LORES.jpg","width":496,"height":670}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":294659,"name":"Terrorizer magazine","permalink":"terrorizer-magazine","url":"/category/terrorizer-magazine"},{"id":294660,"name":"Sick Sounds","permalink":"sick-sounds","url":"/category/sick-sounds"},{"id":1365511,"name":"Single Copies","permalink":"single-copies","url":"/category/single-copies"}]},{"id":2246601,"name":"UK - Terrorizer Subscription 13 issues for the price of 10","permalink":"uk-terrorizer-subscription-13-issues-for-the-price-of-10","position":71,"price":42.5,"default_price":42.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/uk-terrorizer-subscription-13-issues-for-the-price-of-10","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-04-06T15:15:19.000Z","description":"Subscribe to Terrorizer today and you will receive 13 issues for the price of ten, and receive the magazine on your doorstep before it gets into the shops.\r\n\r\nTerrorizer is the world's most exiciting, most authoritative Extreme Music and Heavy Metal magazine.
