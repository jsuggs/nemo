Straight out from their cracked Fruity Loops program, the result is this 'sonic vessel' in which Citizen Ledge glides and finds his inspiration, recounting his doubts as to the future of the world and his own existential abyss.","options":[{"id":11755046,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36385668/-/album_copy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36385668/-/album_copy.jpg","width":1000,"height":960}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1988532,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
