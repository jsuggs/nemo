The medium I used was colored pencil on poster board. Growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area during the 60's I was greatly influenced by the psychedelic art and artist of that time such as Stanley Mouse, Greg Irons and especially the work of Rick Griffin. Tribute to The Almightys is a work about religious belief in my own style. Iconic images of Buddhism, which fascinated me at the time, and Christianity, my belief then, are represented.  Satanism, represented by the skulls, is also included because it is believed good cannot exist without evil. Ones religious belief is a matter of the heart and these beliefs are usually deeply rooted, thus being represented by the bottom image. Each 11X14 print is printed on a quality 60 lb luster finish paper using archival inks for long lasting colorfastness. A matt finish fine art paper will be offered at a later date. Each print is signed and numbered with a certificate of authenticity. Limited run of 150 prints.
