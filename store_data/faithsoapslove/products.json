can hear you now.....what is Spikenard?! Spikenard is the essential oil that Mary used to anoint Jesus' feet with in John 12:1-8\r\n\r\nThen, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was who had been dead, whom He had raised from the dead. There they made Him a supper; and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with Him. Then Mary took a pound of very costly oil of spikenard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the oil.\r\n\r\nSpikenard has been described as a combination sweet/spicy/musky, a very organic earthy scent. I added a touch of lavender essential oil to it to soften/sweeten it. I think it smells a lot like patchouli. Remember is the story how Judas was so upset that Mary 'wasted' such an expensive item on Jesus? Well spikenard is still an extremely expensive essential oil today at nearly $40 an ounce!\r\n\r\nThere is a story behind why this soap looks the way it does in terms of shape and color. The round shape represents the tomb stone, the wisps of red represent Mary's auburn hair, the red round shapes are representative of spikenard berries.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about this soap, visit my blog:  http://www.faithsoapsandlove.blogspot.com/2013/09/marys-tears-spikenard-essential-oil.html\r\n\r\nEach soap will come in a gift box as pictured in the last photo. Why not a fancy, gold box you ask? Well, Jesus wasn't a fancy, gold box kind of guy.

You heard me right! This is a completely unscented, untinted shampoo bar that will leave your hair amazingly clear of all the silicones that standard shampoos leave on your hair. This works equally well as a soap too - it is not just for hair!\r\n\r\nI absolutely love this shampoo bar - the amount of bubbles is insane! I have to have my own bar in the shower because my husband doesn't like me using his! Apparently I use it different than him (I rub the flat part on my hair - he uses only the edge!) and this bothers him! Oh well!\r\n\r\nSafe for color treated hair!\r\n\r\nThis listing is for one bar about 4.75-5.0 ounces.\r\n\r\nShampoo bars are perfect for traveling because they do not count as a liquid! You can pack them in your luggage with no worries about TSA!\r\n\r\nHow do you use a shampoo bar? Simple! Just get your hair wet like normal and rub the bar directly on your hair! Once you have built up a good lather you can wash your hair like normal. You may not even need conditioner because this soap will not strip your hair's natural oils.\r\n\r\nI recommend using a rinse of 1 tablespoon cider vinegar in 1 cup of water once a week when using cold process soaps. Let it sit on your hair for 1-3 minutes before washing out out. This will help remove any built up oils and products.\r\n\r\nContents: Coconut Oil, Distilled Water, Sunflower Oil, Castor Oil, Palm Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Jojoba Oil, Cocoa Butter.","options":[{"id":29148503,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.75,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":11.75,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":18.2,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":18,"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HK"}},{"amount_alone":11.75,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":11.75,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":11.75,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":13.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":13.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":190,"name":"Russian Federation","code":"RU"}},{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":17.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":40,"name":"Thailand","code":"TH"}},{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":41,"name":"Turkey","code":"TR"}},{"amount_alone":13.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/106673547/-/Naked_Shampoo_Bar__1_.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/106673547/-/Naked_Shampoo_Bar__1_.JPG","width":1000,"height":613},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/106673637/-/Naked_Shampoo_Bar__2_.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/106673637/-/Naked_Shampoo_Bar__2_.JPG","width":1000,"height":670},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/106673721/-/Naked_Shampoo_Bar__3_.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/106673721/-/Naked_Shampoo_Bar__3_.JPG","width":1000,"height":672},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/106674093/-/Naked_Shampoo_Bar__4_.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/106674093/-/Naked_Shampoo_Bar__4_.JPG","width":1000,"height":670},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/106674225/-/Naked_Shampoo_Bar__5_.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/106674225/-/Naked_Shampoo_Bar__5_.JPG","width":1000,"height":668}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4563875,"name":"Fragrance Oil Soaps","permalink":"fragrance-oil-soaps","url":"/category/fragrance-oil-soaps"},{"id":4563878,"name":"Essential Oil Soaps","permalink":"essential-oil-soaps","url":"/category/essential-oil-soaps"}]},{"id":9315317,"name":"Ylang Ylang - All Natural Soap - Cold Process Olive Oil Soap with Ylang Ylang Essential Oil","permalink":"ylang-ylang-essential-oil-soap-natural-soap-handmade-soap-homemade-soap-cold-process-soap","position":55,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ylang-ylang-essential-oil-soap-natural-soap-handmade-soap-homemade-soap-cold-process-soap","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-05T00:01:26.000Z","description":"Ylang Ylang has a sweet, deep aroma of sensual flowers. The flower is a small delicate bloom from the Cananga tree native to rainforests. It is known for its ability to lift spirits, promote relaxation and enhance sexuality. Ylang ylang is considered an aphrodisiac and has a soft, luxurious aroma. It has many uses such as adding it directly in a bath, a diffuser or even directly sniffed from the bottle to sooth panic, anxiety and calm nerves. Ylang Ylang can also be added to skin toners or hair tonic to help balance oil or dry skin conditions.\r\n\r\nIn this all natural soap, I have colored the various layers with safflower powder, olive leaf powder and yarrow flower. It is topped with cornflower petals.\r\n\r\nThis listing is for one 5.00 ounce (approximate) bar.

It is woody and lush. The soap is colored with Yellow Silt Clay, Rhassoul Clay and Cocoa Powder! This soap is made with yogurt for an amazing skin treat!\r\n\r\nYogurt soap? Why yes! Here are just a few of the benefits:\r\n\r\n* Yogurt contains lactic acid, which is a mild abrasive to the skin. Cleansing your face with yogurt soap will give that lactic acid the chance to penetrate the skin a bit, causing some minor irritation. When rinsed off, the dead skin and debris sloughed off by the soap will go down the drain, leaving skin refreshed. It is mild enough to be used every day.\r\n\r\n* Yogurt contains a high concentration of zinc, which can help dry and heal pimples!\r\n\r\n* Yogurt has antibacterial properties and a high fat content that smooth and quench dry skin.\r\n\r\nThis listing is for one 5.00 ounce (approximate) bar of this unique unisex soap!

The last image shows an example of the packaging.\r\n\r\nThis listing is for THREE 2 ounce solid lotion bar tubes.\r\n\r\nBE SURE TO INDICATE WHICH THREE SCENTS YOU WISH TO RECEIVE!

Need a bunch of gifts? Consider purchasing a full loaf of one of my soaps!\r\n\r\nYour loaf will come to you uncut. It will be 18\" long and can be cut into whatever size bars you like. Cut into mini bars for shower favors! Cut into full size bars for gifts! Afraid of cutting yourself? I will cut it for you for an additional cost - see listing http://www.faithsoapsandlove.com/product/add-on-item-soap-loaf-cutting\r\n\r\nWhen I cut these loaves for my shop, I cut 1/2 inch off either end (they are sort of like the crusts of bread - they just don't look quite as nice but they work great!) and then the remaining loaf into 17 - 1\" bars. They will weigh about 4.75 - 5.00 ounces once cured.\r\n\r\nLoaves are approximately 5 pounds - 18\" long x 4 \" wide x 3\" tall.\r\n\r\nThese loaves are made to order - I do not have them on hand.  Your soap will cure in my home for about a week and then be shipped to you to finish curing.  You can cut it as soon as you receive it or allow to cure as a loaf.  Please allow your loaf/bars to sit someplace where they will get air circulation.  Allow them to cure for at least 4 weeks from when I made it before you use them.  The longer your bars cure, the harder they will become & the longer they will last.  If you cure intact as a loaf and then cut, allow bars to dry at least an additional week before you use them to make a harder, longer lasting bar.\r\n\r\nLead time is 2-3 weeks - this is to ensure I have the supplies on hand and to allow time for one week of curing.\r\n\r\nPlease indicate which scent you want in your transaction. Available scents:\r\n\r\n*Amazingly Grace\r\n*Blackberry Almond\r\n*Dragon's Blood\r\n*Grace\r\n*Lavender\r\n*Lemon Verbena\r\n*Lemongrass\r\n*Lily of the Valley\r\n*Naked Shampoo Bar\r\n*Oatmeal Milk & Honey\r\n*Oatmeal Stout\r\n*Orange Patchouli\r\n*Patchouli\r\n*Peppermint Tea Tree\r\n*Raspberry Patchouli\r\n*Sandalwood\r\n*The Perfect Man\r\n*Under My Spell\r\n*Wake Me Up Before You Go Go\r\n*Ylang Ylang\r\n\r\n***other scents may be available if I have the fragrance on hand - I no longer special order fragrances for this listing***\r\n\r\nPLEASE DO NOT USE ANY COUPONS WITH THIS PURCHASE!!!!\r\n","options":[{"id":29151632,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":41.0,"amount_with_others":41.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":12.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":60.0,"amount_with_others":60.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91567982/-/Whole_Loaves_Homemade_Soap__5_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91567982/-/Whole_Loaves_Homemade_Soap__5_.jpg","width":720,"height":960},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91567886/-/Whole_Loaves_Homemade_Soap__1_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91567886/-/Whole_Loaves_Homemade_Soap__1_.jpg","width":720,"height":960},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91567898/-/Whole_Loaves_Homemade_Soap__2_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91567898/-/Whole_Loaves_Homemade_Soap__2_.jpg","width":720,"height":960},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91567922/-/Whole_Loaves_Homemade_Soap__3_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91567922/-/Whole_Loaves_Homemade_Soap__3_.jpg","width":720,"height":960},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91567970/-/Whole_Loaves_Homemade_Soap__4_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91567970/-/Whole_Loaves_Homemade_Soap__4_.jpg","width":720,"height":960}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4568372,"name":"Gifts Sets/Value Packs","permalink":"gifts-sets-value-packs","url":"/category/gifts-sets-value-packs"}]},{"id":14193180,"name":"Add On Item - Soap Loaf Cutting","permalink":"add-on-item-soap-loaf-cutting","position":81,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/add-on-item-soap-loaf-cutting","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-15T16:14:24.000Z","description":"Add this item on if you are purchasing a full loaf of soap from me and want me to cut it.\r\n\r\nI will cut 1/2\" off either end and they remaining loaf into 17 - 1\" bars.\r\n\r\nDo not purchase this item unless you are purchasing a full loaf of soap from me!\r\n\r\nNow that your soap is cut, do you want me to shrink wrap each individual bar & put a full ingredient label on it?
