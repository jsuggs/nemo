The hull shares its DNA with our 14' racer. The entry cleanly displaces the surface water and transitions to a flat bottom. The bottom is extremely hard off the rails for clean release of surface tension, low drag and quick planing. NSP durability makes the 12'6 a good value too. As a daily trainer, these long boards take a lot of abuse going to and from the water and we know it. 10 years of refining our construction methods means your investment in the NSP 12'6 is a win-win proposition.

Shaped exclusively for us from G10 Epoxy (for unsurpassed durability), this 35mm shape provides exceptional grip for it\"s size whilst still allowing the board to slide through the water when tricks demand it.\r\n\r\nPad: \r\nStrapless riding is demanding enough so the Waterbird features a full coverage thermo moulded EVA pad. Using the same super tacky top surface as our Twin Tip pads this covering is guaranteed to stop your feet slipping no matter where you put them. Each end is lifted with a 5cm tail kick to allow more drive during Pops and Ollies\r\n\r\nCore: \r\nWhat's inside your board will make a huge difference to how it performs. There is a lot of talk about flex but the mount of flex is just the tip of the iceberg, what\"s more important is where the board flexes and how fast it responds after that flex. Each Shinn twin tip has a carefully engineered core that optimizes these characteristics and enhances them for the target rider. Core materials, glass layup and mould shaping are all factors that help us in this area but the heart of every Shinn twin tip is comprised 'mostly' of an Albasia wood core. No other core material offers the same blend of consistent flex over extended periods of time, feather light weight and near indestructible durability. We say mostly because there are some other secret materials in there but we\"re not going to give away all of our tricks!\r\n\r\nFeature: \r\nThere are few boards that can match a skimboard for light wind fun. Extreme width and flat rockers provide the ultimate in early planning and upwind ability. The Shinn Waterbird is not just a kiteboarding specific skimboard but takes the concept to the next level, it\"s twin tip outline and rocker not only increase the “trickability\" of the board but also make it radically easier to use. 90cm of rocker flat and 51cm of width ensure that the planning is on a par with conventional skimboards however increasing the radius of the outline into the tips allowed us to make a board that is exceptionally stable in a straight line yet carves smoothly and effortlessly.","options":[{"id":36432927,"name":"120 x 51","price":499.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/113686866/-/shinn_waterbird_2011.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/113686866/-/shinn_waterbird_2011.jpg","width":350,"height":350},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/113686962/-/waterbird_ashley_review.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/113686962/-/waterbird_ashley_review.jpg","width":1000,"height":664}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5455671,"name":"Shinn Kiteboards","permalink":"shinn-kiteboards","url":"/category/shinn-kiteboards"}]},{"id":11549463,"name":"Shinn Monk Forever","permalink":"shinn-monk-forever","position":4,"price":829.99,"default_price":829.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/shinn-monk-forever","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-03T17:16:01.000Z","description":"You know you've done something right when your board is described by independent testers as Board of the Year. We tweaked, we fettled and we honed and now we bring you the Monk Forever; re-defining the board that re-defined the genre. Grippier, \"slashier\", speedier... what more could you want? If you're idea of kiteboarding is ripping, gouging and all round high speed action then look no further.\r\n\r\nFins:\r\nAll our boards are supplied with 1st Quality, high pressure/temperature formed G10 fins, proved many times over to be the best material for both durability and stiffness. Hi-visibility red pigment makes finding your board in the water a breeze. All fins are supplied with A4 grade INOX bolts and our bespoke foxes glacier mint\" fin washers.\r\n\r\nRocker:\r\nConventional rockers have multiple radiuses however our constant curve from tip to tail bucks the trend. As power increases and you naturally transfer more weight to your back foot, thecc rocker contact with the water remains constant (unlike multiple radius versions) no matter how your balance is distributed between your feet. The result? Reassuringly constant grip and  power in all conditions.\r\n\r\nCore: \r\nBi-axial Glass, Exotic woods and composite fibres are all employed to ensure the Monk Forever performs straight out of the box and equally importantly continues to perform into the future. Flex, durability and weight need to be strictly controlled to bring you the finest performing kiteboards known to man (and women) kind\r\n\r\nFlex & Mould: \r\nSince it's first appearance on the Monk, our Squoval mould has become synonymous with comfort and performance. By allowing bi-lateral flex through the tips of the board whilst maintaining the form around your feet intact we can produce boards that appear to absorb all chop with out slowing you down and without an energy-sappingly soft feel.\r\n\r\nProgressive Concave: \r\nEarly planing (due to the flatter central rocker section), Enhanced control and Increased torsional stance rigidity (resulting from the 3 dimensional shaping under the stance area) are all benefits of our Progressive Concave.
