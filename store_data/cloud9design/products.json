Are you preggers and proud? This is the shirt for you! ;)\r\n\r\nI created this shirt, and my “Haute Mama, Baby & Beyond” Collection to answer the need I saw while shopping when I was pregnant. I coudn’t find any clothes that showed how happy I was to be creating a little human being inside of me. I just wore regular clothes in larger sizes to fit my belly.\r\n\r\nMaternity clothes were just plain UGLY! So, I set out to create a line that will showcase the glowing mamas with cute baby bellies, and make women feel GOOD about being pregnant. I print on only the softest, most-comfy fabrics, with longer lengths, and hip styles.\r\n\r\nI was a glowing mama when I was preggers. I really enjoyed it. And I hope that my collection will make mamas feel as pretty and amazing as they are!!!!\r\n\r\n*****\r\n*Available in: M/L ONLY at this time\r\nThis is a wonderfully soft size Medium/Large,and fits like a Medium.
