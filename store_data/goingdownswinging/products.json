You’ll meet Pavlichenko, the most successful female sniper in history; a Japanese whaler losing himself at sea; a guy struggling with psychedelics at a funeral; and real people who believe they’re mythical creatures trapped in human bodies.\r\n\r\nAll this is threaded together by our commissioned artist Darren Song, who produces intricate embroidery work on paper. For this project Darren chose eight spreads from vintage editions of Going Down Swinging and embroidered them with his response to the writing in No. 35. The results are beautiful and surprising.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying audio album features new stories and spoken word from the likes of Anis Mojgani, Angie Hart, Benezra, Adam Gibson, and The Herd's rhythm section playing as Bass Elefant. You can get the album as a digital download, or a stamped CD with a risograph poster case.\r\n\r\nThe edition comes with a radical new look and feel courtesy of design studio Holiday.","options":[{"id":49465881,"name":"(with album download)","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50184432,"name":"(with CD and risograph poster)","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.9,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":12.8,"amount_with_others":10.2},{"amount_alone":9.75,"amount_with_others":9.75,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":10.8,"amount_with_others":9.7,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":10.5,"amount_with_others":9.4,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128531088/-/GDS_35_Cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128531088/-/GDS_35_Cover.jpg","width":400,"height":560}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2180452,"name":"Anthologies","permalink":"anthologies","url":"/category/anthologies"}]},{"id":10481113,"name":"Going Down Swinging #34 Digital","permalink":"going-down-swinging-34-digital","position":6,"price":12.99,"default_price":12.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/going-down-swinging-34-digital","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-11T11:12:11.000Z","description":"Going Down Swinging No. 34 is a multimedia literary journal interweaving narratives in words, pictures, sound, and motion. Available as a tablet app or a desktop download, No. 34 has the work we can't possibly put in print, with interactive comics from Mike Baylis, fiction for the eye and ear from Laura Jean McKay, and historical mystery solving from Lachlan Plain (with a special guest appearance from Michael Cathcart), all bundled in a stunning and innovative digital design by Vanessa Hughes.\r\n\r\n<strong>Should I buy the App or the Online version?</strong>\r\n\r\nNo.34 comes in two flavours - an iOS App for iPads and iPhones, and the Online version for all other platforms. \r\n\r\nThe Online version works on desktop computers and mobile devices, including phones and tablets (Android and Apple). All you need is an internet connection and the right browser (see below).\r\n\r\nThe Online version is available now from this page. The App version will be available from the Apple App Store in a few more days, by searching for No.34.\r\n\r\nYou can have both, if you like - you only pay for the edition once. If you have bought the App and want access to the online version, simply email us and we'll provide access details.\r\n\r\nIf you have bought the online version and subsequently want the App, purchase the App through the App Store, then email us to refund your first transaction.\r\n\r\n<strong>Can I view this book?</strong>\r\n\r\nNo.34 uses HTML5 and CSS3 liberally as well as some other ingredients. Internet browsers don't always play ball with websites, so we strongly recommend you use either Chrome (PCs and Macs) or Safari (Macs) to view it.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Firefox you will also need Adobe Flash installed. We don't recommend you view the book in Internet Explorer.\r\n\r\nAll this software is free.\r\n\r\nIf you are using this software, but the book isn't displaying properly, it's possible your browser is old and needs to be updated, or that your operating system (such as Windows or OS X) is out of date. Again, we strongly recommend you update your operating systems to be sure to experience the book at its best.\r\n\r\n<strong>How long after I buy it until I can read it?</strong>\r\n\r\nDigital delivery is much faster than the post, however it may take up to one working day for you to receive your secure login to the online version. Login information and instructions will be emailed to whatever email address you use to buy the book - so make sure it's correct.\r\n\r\nApp customers can view as soon as you purchase and download.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ___________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nTo help us avoid fees, the best payment method is direct deposit to our bank account.

GDS sent audio teams to all of Overload’s shows in 2009, committing them to the electronic record, and selecting the best offerings to feature on the GDS #29 CD.\r\n\r\nThe result is an extraordinary range of work from local and visiting performers. There’s live material from The Bedroom Philosopher’s Songs from the 86 Tram; the entirely spellbinding closing monologue from American jazz poet L. E. Scott; heartaching rural snapshots from Cate Kennedy; an extract from Nathan Curnow’s Ghost Poetry Project; award-winning indigenous writer Ali Cobby Eckermann’s tales of family; Anthony O’Sullivan’s ebullient Nirvana tribute written for Liner Notes; and a future GDS commission writer in Felix Nobis seeing a storm coming in.\r\n\r\nThe book contains the wonderful graphic novella ‘Where the Wild Things Aren’t’, by Oslo Davis, along with work from Chris Flynn, Simon Cox, Josephine Rowe, and New York writer Cristin O’Keefe Aptowicz.\r\n\r\nPublished 2009\r\n\r\n\r\n  ___________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nTo help us avoid fees, the best payment method is direct deposit to our bank account.

Steve Grimwade, Lisa Greenaway\r\n\r\nGoing Down Swinging’s most extraordinary print production was the extra-special hardback version of #26.\r\n\r\nWhere the paperback included prints of intricate stencil art from five of Melbourne’s best street artists, these special editions included originals of the same artworks at four times the size. The variation in colouring and technique means that each book is distinct from the next. Hand-bound and individually numbered, these are collector’s items in the truest sense of the term.\r\n\r\nOnly two copies remain.\r\n\r\nAs the prospectus stated at the time, “This is an unprecedented opportunity to collect the work of HaHa, Vexta, Tom Civil, Miso and Ghostpatrol – artists whose works normally adorn the laneways of Melbourne, but who now, for the first time, can be collected in this unique publication.”\r\n\r\n“Only thirty copies of this hardback edition have been created. Each issue has been lovingly hand-bound by Irwin & McClaren Bookbinders in law buckram with a clear foil stamp. Each issue features five limited edition artworks – one from each artist. Each artwork is tipped in, so that it folds out effortlessly from the hardback binding.”\r\n\r\n<strong>If you wish to purchase the Limited Edition, please email us at <a href=\"mailto:info@goingdownswinging.org.au\">info@goingdownswinging.org.au</a>, rather than purchasing through the shopping cart.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe special edition of Going Down Swinging #26 had only 15 copies offered for sale.\r\n\r\nThe books are bound in law buckram hardcover with a foil-stamped cover motif, with hand-cut and hand-bound pages, and inserts of the original hand-made poster-size prints of the artworks and stencils featured in the issue. The paints and techniques change from work to work, so every one of the fifteen copies is unique.\r\n\r\nPublished 2008\r\n\r\n\r\n  ___________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nTo help us avoid fees, the best payment method is direct deposit to our bank account.

These contain the content of the regular #26 edition, with prints of the street art section, rather than the five original artworks offered in the limited edition hardcover #26 also available on our site.\r\n\r\nEditors: Steve Grimwade, Lisa Greenaway\r\n\r\nWith #26 began what are now known as the Greenaway years – five editions with a clear, consistent format, and an aesthetic that placed elegance first. Going Down Swinging was remade in trade paperback size, with textured cover stock, high GSM paper, uniform font and masthead, luscious cover images, and a sleeved CD held in a sliced cover-fold.\r\n\r\nInside the ‘Shhhh’ cover by design star Tom Civil, this issue focused on street art from Melbourne’s laneway walls. It reproduced artworks from Civil, Vexta, HaHa, Miso, and Ghostpatrol.\r\n\r\nThere was an epic desert narrative from a young Anna Krien, whose book Into the Woods would go on to win prizes at the Queensland and Victorian Premiers’ Awards; and a story from Leanne Hall, whose would win the Text Prize for her novel This is Shyness.\r\n\r\nThere was audio work from electronic music legend David Thrussell, Ian McBryde’s collaboration as The Still Company, and Citizen Tom’s new alter ego Thomas, Jack of Hearts.\r\n\r\nIt also featured the first contribution from Hawaiian writer Eric Paul Shaffer, who would go on to become a GDS regular over subsequent issues, as would Fiona Wright, who has her second publication here.

Going Down Swinging was remade in trade paperback size, with textured cover stock, high GSM paper, uniform font and masthead, luscious cover images, and a sleeved CD held in a sliced cover-fold.\r\n\r\nInside the ‘Shhhh’ cover by design star Tom Civil, this issue focused on street art from Melbourne’s laneway walls. It reproduced prints from Civil, Vexta, HaHa, Miso, and Ghostpatrol.\r\n\r\nThere was an epic desert narrative from a young Anna Krien, whose book Into the Woods would go on to win prizes at the Queensland and Victorian Premiers’ Awards; and a story from Leanne Hall, whose would win the Text Prize for her novel This is Shyness. \r\n\r\nThere was audio work from electronic music legend David Thrussell, Ian McBryde’s collaboration as The Still Company, and Citizen Tom’s new alter ego Thomas, Jack of Hearts.\r\n\r\nIt also featured the first contribution from Hawaiian writer Eric Paul Shaffer, who would go on to become a GDS regular over subsequent issues, as would Fiona Wright, who has her second publication here.

The editorship of Steve Grimwade, Lisa Greenaway, Klare Lanson, Ella Holcombe, and Nathan Curnow produced large-format editions, with full-colour covers, colour artwork selections, and more.\r\n\r\nTracing backwards from #24, we find the grittier, punkier aesthetic of GDS through the Grimwade/alicia sometimes/Adam Ford era, with its bold artwork and innovative format. Books from #18 to #22 were matched to the size of the CDs that came with them, as they began the spoken word legacy that GDS carries on to this day. They're also a fascinating early look at some now-familiar names. \r\n\r\nIf you're interested in more than one of these back issues, consider our Deluxe Box Set, containing all issues from #18 to #29 at a much discounted price.\r\n\r\n(Issues before #18 are scarce, and some are unavailable, but we may be able to help - enquire direct at info@goingdownswinging.org.au)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  ___________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nTo help us avoid fees, the best payment method is direct deposit to our bank account.
