It was the real all- rounder and helped ensure Allied air superiority from early 1944.\r\n\r\nYou've got to pay credit where credit is due and so we doff our flying cap to the French for this one. Beautiful mustard taste with a bit of kick is what we wanted... and it's what we got. Sublime on a sausage, magnificent in mayonnaise. Delicious served with roast beef and all types of sausages.  It is an excellent choice for those that enjoy mustard, but don’t want it to be too spicy.","options":[{"id":25288638,"name":"190g jar","price":8.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/78725841/-/Mustang_Dijon_Mustard.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/78725841/-/Mustang_Dijon_Mustard.jpg","width":784,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4009689,"name":"Mustards & Horseradish","permalink":"mustards-horseradish","url":"/category/mustards-horseradish"}]},{"id":8010807,"name":"The Lancaster Seeded Mustard 190g jar","permalink":"the-lancaster-seeded-mustard-190g-jar","position":18,"price":8.95,"default_price":8.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-lancaster-seeded-mustard-190g-jar","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-15T10:59:38.000Z","description":"The Lancaster Seeded Mustard 190g jar\r\n\r\nFlying and crewing an Avro Lancaster was not for the faint of heart. It was cramped, uncomfortable and dangerous. The achievements of the ‘Lanc’ and the brave men of Bomber Command who flew it have been widely acclaimed. First flown in 1941, the Lancaster proved itself not only as the finest British bomber of WW2, but also as one of the most successful aircraft of all time.\r\n\r\nSome people love the more rustic look of a seeded mustard. We do too! But what we really love is the way the mustard seeds seem to pop in the mouth with every bite. Not too spicy we use it on roast lamb, roast beef, and we mix a spoonful into our homemade salad dressing.This mustard has the beautiful texture of whole mustard seeds and like all the others is wonderful served with roast beef, corned beef, sausages, and with other meats.","options":[{"id":25288746,"name":"190g jar","price":8.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/78726705/-/Lancaster_Seeded_Mustard.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/78726705/-/Lancaster_Seeded_Mustard.jpg","width":784,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4009689,"name":"Mustards & Horseradish","permalink":"mustards-horseradish","url":"/category/mustards-horseradish"}]},{"id":8010813,"name":"The Hurricane Horseradish 190g jar","permalink":"the-hurricane-horseradish-190g-jar","position":19,"price":8.95,"default_price":8.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-hurricane-horseradish-190g-jar","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-15T11:01:10.000Z","description":"The Hurricane Horseradish 190g jar\r\n\r\nUndeservedly the Hawker Hurricane’s reputation is somewhat overshadowed by the Spitfire, but the Hurricane’s role in the Battle of Britain was legendary.
