I've made you an array of SIX POLYMER IMITATIVE BEADS, like those shown here: real amber, coral, lapis, turquoise, agate, and jade.

Same quality as in permanent museum collections like the MFA Boston, the Museum of Art and Design in NYC, and the Racine Art Museum.\r\n\r\nSpecial extras:\r\n• An actual example of properly baked translucent polymer to calibrate your oven. Thermometers are not reliable for polymer's temperature sensitivity. This is.\r\n• An actual example of properly made, baked, and finished imitative ivory in polymer, so you never have to worry if you are doing it right.\r\nPlus\r\n• Email backup for the first six months or so.
