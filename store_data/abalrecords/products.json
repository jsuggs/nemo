Pragmatophobia\r\n\r\nCommercial Info ...\r\n\r\n\"MALAK, the hottest new act to emerge from Florida have signed with Abal Records. The Florida Quartet, who bring a fresh take to the prog/tech metal genre will be releasing their self titled debut EP in March 2010.\r\n\r\nMALAK, have emerged from Florida as a leader in their genre and a band which many of their peers look upto. With their blend of  Prog/Tech Metal, not so disimilar with big names such as Between The Buried and Me, and Mastodon, MALAK present a collection of technical riffage, harmonious guitars, groove ridden drums and gruff but at times clean vocals which is bound to please fans old and new.\r\n\t\r\nThe short but impressive self titled EP confirms that Malak are not only a group of skilled musicians and gifted performers, but also that they are interested in furthering themselve's and the realms of hard rock and heavy metal. Disconnect yourself from what you have perceived as logic and reality, close your eyes and step inside your own limitless psyche and join us on the journey that MALAK are about to take. \"","options":[{"id":5698671,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/14669491/-/Malak-CD.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/14669491/-/Malak-CD.jpg","width":900,"height":820}],"artists":[{"id":27041,"name":"Malak","permalink":"malak","url":"/artist/malak"}],"categories":[{"id":846621,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":1920791,"name":"Black Polaris - This City Falls - PRE ORDER","permalink":"black-polaris-this-city-falls-pre-order","position":4,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/black-polaris-this-city-falls-pre-order","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-03-11T20:57:08.000Z","description":"PRE ORDER NOW !!!\r\n\r\nBlack Polaris - This City Falls\r\n\r\n1.
