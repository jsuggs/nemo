Make it up in no time at all.  I make my crib size quilts so you don't have to piece the backing.  This quilt is also easy because the border is built-in. When you sew the diagonal rows together, you are also sewing on the border fabric at the same time.  No more wavy borders to deal with!\r\n\r\n\r\n#415\r\n \r\n","options":[{"id":11210245,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/32034509/-/Picture1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/32034509/-/Picture1.jpg","width":914,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1898419,"name":"Quilt Patterns","permalink":"quilt-patterns","url":"/category/quilt-patterns"}]}]
