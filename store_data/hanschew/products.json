Like how the waning south of old has given way to the new, his tale is a coming-of-age-story of narrowly averted self-destruction and painful resurrection. This theme is woven musically and thematically throughout the album as Chew pays homage to his southern beginnings, a lineage that includes tobacco farmers and methodists, bluegrass musicians and evangelists, gamblers and alcoholics. Chew’s skill as a multi-instrumentalist (he takes the reigns on most of the playing on the entire record) adds tremendous intimacy to his ability to fully relay the album’s stories with a singular voice. Chew is supported on selected tracks by a stellar cast of players, including some of his past and/or present band mates in D. Charles Speer & the Helix, such as Dave Shuford (No Neck Blues Band, Enos Slaughter), Marc Orleans (Sunburned Hand of the Man, Enos Slaughter) and Jason Meagher (No Neck Blues Band, Coach Fingers). Meagher also doubled time as the album’s engineer at his own Black Dirt Studio. <i>Tennessee & Other Stories…</i> was mixed by Clint Steele and mastered by Glenn Schick Mastering.\r\n\r\nSome words about the music:\r\n\r\nThe “Tenneessee trilogy” – &quot;Old Monteagle & Muscadine&quot;, &quot;Carry Me, Bury Me,&quot; and &quot;I Would There Was a Train&quot; – start <i>Tennessee & Other Stories…</i> off with a bang and quickly immerse the listener into the album's dark and introspective mood. This song trio firmly focuses on death and rebirth, and provides a backward glimpse into the narrator’s life left behind in the old south, set to a soundtrack of acoustic and electric guitars, pedal steel, banjo, mandolin and organ. Piano is the album’s instrument of choice, and numbers like &quot;New Cypress Grove Boogie&quot; and &quot;Forever Again&quot; both demonstrate the deep attraction and magic that drew Chew, like so many previous practitioners, to the eighty-eights. Both of these tracks demonstrate Chew’s talents within two of multiple schools of piano boogie: &quot;Forever Again&quot; utilizes a Tulsa-oriented piano-funk as the central basis of its gospel-blues choral promise of death, while &quot;New Cypress Grove Boogie&quot; serves up more of a New Orleans styled jaunt. While <i>Tennessee & Other Stories…</i> as a whole demonstrates Chew’s formidable songwriting skills, the album also offers listeners a singular cover: the Tim Rose penned &quot;Long Time Man,&quot; here presented as a darkly southern gothic re-interpretation of Nick Cave’s arrangement. <i>Tennessee & Other Stories…</i> is an extremely strong and confident record from start to finish, one that establishes Hans Chew as both a unique addition to, and significant voice within, America’s current outsider scene.. </p>\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>","options":[{"id":9470239,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25923368/-/TLR085COVERforBIGCARTEL.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25923368/-/TLR085COVERforBIGCARTEL.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":324278,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"},{"id":324289,"name":"Music","permalink":"music","url":"/category/music"},{"id":324290,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":416336,"name":"Hans Chew - \"New Cypress Grove Boogie\" - 7\" Single, Picture Disc","permalink":"hans-chew-new-cypress-grove-boogie-7-single","position":2,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/hans-chew-new-cypress-grove-boogie-7-single","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-10-04T06:44:52.000Z","description":"<body>\r\n<h1><a href=\"http://www.hanschew.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hans Chew</a></h1>\r\n<h3>A Side - &quot;New Cypress Grove Boogie&quot; <br/>(Black Dirt Mix)<br/>\r\n</h3>\r\n<h3>B Side - &quot;Forever Again&quot; <br/>(Alt.
