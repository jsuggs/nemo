Song titles like ‘Sex in the morning (I’m coughing, you’re yawning)’ and ‘The Keith Disaster Fund’ reveal the band’s dry Scottish humour and location - imagine a poppier Aidan Moffat. The album is proceeded by the first single to be lifted from the record, the joyous ‘You Look Like I need a Drink’.","options":[{"id":13906985,"name":"Default","price":7.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":59,"name":"Bangladesh","code":"BD"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":9,"name":"China","code":"CN"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":18,"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HK"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":19,"name":"Iceland","code":"IS"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":208,"name":"Soviet Union (former)","code":"SU"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":228,"name":"Ukraine","code":"UA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41209255/-/TDIAGED.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41209255/-/TDIAGED.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":43227,"name":"Prince Edward Island","permalink":"prince-edward-island","url":"/artist/prince-edward-island"}],"categories":[{"id":1502111,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":2554545,"name":"Humber Dogger Forties","permalink":"humber-dogger-forties","position":2,"price":7.99,"default_price":7.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/humber-dogger-forties","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-05-01T00:53:56.000Z","description":"Humber Dogger Forties <br><br>\r\n\r\nJohn Mouse releases second solo album to critical acclaim<br><br>\r\n\r\nJohn Mouse (ex-singer/songwriter JT Mouse) releases his second solo album on Crocfingers, containing the singles 'The last great Rhondda romance' -
