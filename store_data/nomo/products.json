The club was officially incorporated on December 31, and the original golf course was opened on July 29, 1911. It was a nine-hole course, and was designed by Willie Watson, a well-known course architect of the time. George Sargent, who won the 1909 U.S. Open and was later president of the PGA of America, was the head professional for a few years.\r\n\r\nIn 1919, the club decided to redesign the course. The new 18-hole course, which is largely the same today, was designed by Donald Ross and opened in 1921. Robert Trent Jones made some alterations in 1963, and Geoffrey Cornish renovated it in 1986. The course is consistently ranked Golf Digest's list of the 100 best courses in the United States (#44 in 2005, #62 in 2007), and #1 in Minnesota. The course is about 6,900 yards long, and is a par 72.\r\n\r\nThe first major tournament held at Interlachen was the Western Open in 1914. In July 1930, the club was the site of the U.S. Open championship. Bobby Jones had already won the British Amateur and the British Open that year, and continued his run by winning at Interlachen by two strokes over Macdonald Smith. Jones completed his unprecedented Grand Slam by winning the U.S. Amateur later in the year. The club was scheduled to host the 1942 U.S. Open, but the event was cancelled after the outbreak of World War II.\r\n\r\n\r\n24\" x 24\"\r\n4-Color Screenprint\r\nSteel Blue 100# Construction Cover by French Paper Co.\r\n\r\nAll posters are shipped in crush proof recycled cardboard tubes.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #CCC; font-weight: 10; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Disclaimer:  Not a product of or associated with Interlachen Country Club, USGA, PGA, sponsors, owners or licensees.</span>","options":[{"id":45423231,"name":"Default","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126591519/-/Interlachen_NEW.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126591519/-/Interlachen_NEW.jpg","width":2880,"height":2880},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126592797/-/Interlachen.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126592797/-/Interlachen.jpg","width":2880,"height":2880}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4350122,"name":"NEW","permalink":"new","url":"/category/new"},{"id":4748594,"name":"Golf Course Series","permalink":"golf-course-series","url":"/category/golf-course-series"}]},{"id":10593748,"name":"Merion Golf Club Screenprint","permalink":"merion-golf-club-screenprint","position":6,"price":55.0,"default_price":55.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/merion-golf-club-screenprint","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-17T03:12:57.000Z","description":"Merion Golf Club is a private golf club located in Haverford Township, Pennsylvania, 11 miles west of Philadelphia.

Muirfield, however, was amongst the first courses to depart from this arrangement and is arranged as two loops of nine holes, one clockwise, one counterclockwise.

However, at the time golf was a relatively new sport in America, and as popularity of the sport grew, so did the country club. By 1921 Oak Hill had doubled in size and had a new clubhouse, so when the University of Rochester proposed a land swap in 1921 it was a tough decision for members.

It was ranked the number one course in Golf Magazine's 100 Top Courses in the U.S. and the World in 2012.\r\n\r\nPine Valley was founded in 1913 by a group of amateur golfers from Philadelphia. They purchased 184 acres (0.7 km²) of rolling, sandy ground deep in the pinelands of southern New Jersey, and gave George Arthur Crump, who knew the area from hunting expeditions, the opportunity to design the course. This was Crump's first and only golf course design, and he set himself some idiosyncratic principles: no hole should be laid out parallel to the next; no more than two consecutive holes should play in the same direction; and players shouldn't be able to see any hole other than the one they were playing. He also felt that a round of golf on his course should require a player to use every club in the bag.\r\n\r\nPine Valley later spread to 623 acres (2.5 km²), of which 416 acres (1.7 km²) remain virgin woodland. Since Crump's death, alterations have been made by several other leading golf course designers. The club also has a ten hole short course designed by Tom Fazio and Ernest Ransome III.

Since opening in 1959, it has been the home of the Daytona 500, the most prestigious race in NASCAR. In addition to NASCAR, the track also hosts races of ARCA, AMA Superbike, Grand-Am and Motocross. The track features multiple layouts including the primary 2.5 miles (4.0 km) high speed tri-oval, a 3.56 miles (5.73 km) sports car course, a 2.95 miles (4.75 km) motorcycle course, and a .25 miles (0.40 km) karting and motorcycle flat-track. The track's 180-acre (73 ha) infield includes the 29-acre (12 ha) Lake Lloyd, which has hosted powerboat racing. The speedway is owned and operated by International Speedway Corporation.\r\n\r\nThe track was built in 1958 by NASCAR founder William France Sr. to host racing that was being held at the former Daytona Beach Road Course. His banked design permitted higher speeds and gave fans a better view of the cars.

Jackie Stewart nicknamed the old track \"The Green Hell,\" and it is widely considered to be the most demanding and difficult purpose-built racing circuit in the world.[1]\r\nOriginally, the track featured four configurations: the 28.265 km (17.563 mi)-long Gesamtstrecke (\"Whole Course\"), which in turn consisted of the 22.810 km (14.173 mi) Nordschleife (\"North Loop\"), and the 7.747 km (4.814 mi) Südschleife (\"South Loop\"). There also was a 2.281 km (1.417 mi) warm-up loop called Zielschleife (\"Finish Loop\") or Betonschleife (\"Concrete Loop\"), around the pit area.[2]\r\nBetween 1982 and 1983 the start/finish area was demolished to create a new GP-Strecke, and this is used for all major and international racing events.
