Help keep our gallery program running through 2014!\r\n\r\nSince 2010 the gallery program at Booklyn Artists Alliance has birthed a series of group exhibitions dedicated to providing self-publishing artists, who generally share their work through printed matter and other ephemeral media, with a platform for exhibition, experimentation and exploration outside of the printed format. Moving into 2014 our exhibition program will grow and change to focus on a year-long series of solo-exhibitions dedicated to providing under-represented yet extremely prolific Brooklyn based self-publishing individuals with technical, conceptual and monetary support in furthering the scope of work of their work. \r\n\r\nAll donations will go directly to supporting and evolving our gallery space located at 37 Greenpoint Ave, 4FL. Your donation will help cover exhibition zine printing costs, advertising, general gallery maintenance + paint, installation supplies, track lights, opening reception costs and much more! \r\n\r\n<b>Sponsor an Exhibition & Receive Rewards:\r\n\r\nFor a $50 donation you will receive a copy of the first THREE 2014 Exhibition Zines and our heartfelt gratitude. \r\n\r\n$75 Donation includes: First THREE Exhibition Zines + Limited Edition Gallery Tote Bag\r\n\r\n$100 Donation includes: THREE Exhibition Zines + Limited Edition Gallery Tote Bag + 10% OFF Artworks in upcoming exhibitions or your next online store purchase.\r\n\r\n$200 Donation includes: A Zine Subscription to all exhibition zines published between January - December 2014 (Mailed Monthly) + Tote Bag</b>\r\n\r\nFor more information on our gallery program please visit our <a href=\"http://booklyn.org\">website</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also accept donations in the form of free rent, free storefront spaces, art supplies, beverage sponsors, and printing equipment.

Given these startling statistics, illiteracy is undoubtedly a matter that affects not only individuals, but our entire society. Graphic novels are affordable, portable, and thereby an accessible format for establishing collective awareness and heightened visibility of artwork.\r\n\r\nCaptured through Wheatley's sequential drawings of \"life observed\" at Literacy Volunteers are the socially devastating realities of illiteracy and its interrelationship with levels of freedom, self-esteem, poverty, and crime. Beyond this expository function, the book serves as an emotive testament to our ability to listen and empathize with one another's personal experiences through recognition of our universal contentionfor survival or, as the artist describes, \"that feeling that makes us go RAWR.\"\r\n\r\n— Cori Wolff, Curator of Buffalo Arts Studios Galleries, Buffalo, NY","options":[{"id":25879887,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/80738373/-/ABC_30Buffalo.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/80738373/-/ABC_30Buffalo.jpg","width":670,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/80738517/-/ABC_30Buffalo_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/80738517/-/ABC_30Buffalo_1.jpg","width":654,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/80738805/-/ABC_30Buffalo2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/80738805/-/ABC_30Buffalo2.jpg","width":668,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/80738937/-/ABC_30Buffalo_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/80738937/-/ABC_30Buffalo_2.jpg","width":648,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/80738973/-/ABC_30Buffalo_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/80738973/-/ABC_30Buffalo_3.jpg","width":683,"height":954}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4086525,"name":"Booklyn Chapbooks","permalink":"booklyn-chapbooks","url":"/category/booklyn-chapbooks"},{"id":5491392,"name":"**Sale**","permalink":"sale","url":"/category/sale"}]},{"id":8212443,"name":"ABC No. 9: Idaville - Emily Blair","permalink":"abc-no-9-idaville-emily-blair","position":26,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/abc-no-9-idaville-emily-blair","status":"sold-out","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-11-26T17:28:54.000Z","description":"ABC ISSUE NO. 9:\r\nIdaville \r\nby Emily Blair\r\npublished by Booklyn Artists Alliance, 2010 \r\n6.25 x 9.25\"\r\n44 pages \r\nletterpressed cover, offset interior. \r\nnumbered edition of 750 copies.\r\n\r\n\r\nIdaville is an illustrated short story about a boy detective who never grew up and a girl who did.

unfolds to 140ft\r\n9 x 9 x 4 inches\r\n380 pages \r\nLimited edition of 500 copies.\r\nPublished by Evil Twin Publications.\r\n\r\nFor 6 years, artist Fritz Haeg opened his Los Angeles home to events, happenings, gatherings, meetings, pageantry, performances, shows, stunts and spectacles framed and affected by his unique house which includes a subterranean cave, a geodesic dome, and a series of garden spaces. This special artists book documents the Sundown Salon events and also shares participants reflections on the idea of salons and the nature of viewing and making art communally and for a domestic space.\r\n\r\n<b>The Sundown Salon Unfolding Archive</b> is both a book and an exhibition: It is printed as one long accordian-fold paper. The text can be flipped through and read like a book, and the pictures can be unfurled to a 140 foot long art piece. The book has been conceived by Fritz in collaboration with Evil Twin Publications' Stacy Wakefield. The covers will vary, with 5 different combinations being created from drawings made by salon participants.\r\n\r\n<b>ABOUT THE SUNDOWN SALONS:</b>\r\nOver 30 events and hundreds of participants, the salons grew increasingly elaborate. Each salon was catalyzed by a friend with an idea, an inspiration. Knitting, boys, a dance, deliveries, a meeting, animals, haircutting, fashion, political ennui and it grew from there. Participants included My Barbarian, Pipilott Rist, Knitknit, Trinie Dalton, Los Super Elegantes, K48, Bedroom Walls, Assume Vivid Astro Focus, Deadlee, Anna Sew Hoy, D'Argento, Amy Adler, Jeff Ono, Yoshua Okon, Dean Sameshima, Alice Konitz, Graft, Pae White, Bon & Ging, Jeff Burton, Feral Childe, Alexis Rochas, Ponce de Leon, Bordermates, Lesbians to the Rescue (LTTR), Robbinschilds, Slava Mogutin, Eve Fowler, Katie Grinnan, Eileen Myles, Liz Larner, Chris Abani and Janfamily among many others.

It stands out from other perzines for a number of reasons. A lot of zines will take you to a time or place in a persons life and show you what was there. Artnoose tends to take you to a place in personal ethics and ask you what you think. For this reason, every issue has the potential to be a new adventure and the reader may find it quite rewarding.\r\n\r\nKer-bloom! was one of the zines selected for the 2003 tour of North America by Mobilivre-Bookmobile, the travelling library of independent publications.

Topics over the past eight years include: bicycles, love lost, substitute teaching, zine conferences, anarchism, and domestic violence. Each issue is set letter by letter in lead type and printed on a Vandercook flat-bed printing press. Due to the labor-intensiveness of the endeavor, each issue is only eight quater-size pages long. But what Ker-Bloom! lacks in size it more than makes up for in passion!\r\n\r\nKer-bloom! has been featured in The Utne Reader, clamor, Morbid Curiosity, The Zine Yearbook, and the \"Invisible Ink\" radio show on KALW FM. It's available at Bound Together Bookstore (SF), City Lights (SF), Powell's Books (Portland), Needles & Pens (SF), Reading Frenzy (Portland), The Long Haul Infoshop (Berkeley), Left Bank Books (Seattle), and through Parcell Press Distribution. The diligent and charming Booklyn Artists' Alliance has landed Ker-bloom! in public and private academic collections across the country, including UCLA,  the New York MOMA, and University of Michigan's Labadie Collection, one of the largest collections of radical literature and ephemera in the world. As if that wan't enough, Booklyn has also two volumes bound as brick-like hardcover books.","options":[{"id":26342874,"name":"Default","price":275.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/82465833/-/PA224967.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/82465833/-/PA224967.jpg","width":809,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/82321587/-/PA224968.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/82321587/-/PA224968.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/82321665/-/PA224969.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/82321665/-/PA224969.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/82321713/-/PA224971.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/82321713/-/PA224971.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/82323885/-/PA224965.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/82323885/-/PA224965.jpg","width":867,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2441903,"name":"Artists Books","permalink":"artists-books","url":"/category/artists-books"},{"id":5491392,"name":"**Sale**","permalink":"sale","url":"/category/sale"}]},{"id":8281506,"name":"Kottie Paloma \"XOXO\"","permalink":"kottie-paloma-xoxo","position":41,"price":65.0,"default_price":65.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kottie-paloma-xoxo","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-29T22:03:20.000Z","description":"Kottie Paloma \"XOXO\"\r\n104 Pages\r\nPerfect Bound Softcover\r\n21 x 28 cm\r\nFull Color Offset\r\n\r\nWith essays by John Dwyer (Thee Oh Sees) and Chris Sollars.","options":[{"id":26089443,"name":"Default","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81421821/-/Kottie_Cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81421821/-/Kottie_Cover.jpg","width":744,"height":903},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81421893/-/kottie-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81421893/-/kottie-2.jpg","width":1000,"height":691},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81421989/-/kottie3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81421989/-/kottie3.jpg","width":1000,"height":702},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81422313/-/kottie-4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81422313/-/kottie-4.jpg","width":1000,"height":699},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81422478/-/kottie5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81422478/-/kottie5.jpg","width":1000,"height":698}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2441903,"name":"Artists Books","permalink":"artists-books","url":"/category/artists-books"}]},{"id":8849891,"name":"Esmerelda Tree Cat / Lonely Bear - Christine Shields","permalink":"esmerelda-tree-cat-lonely-bear-christine-shields","position":42,"price":600.0,"default_price":600.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/esmerelda-tree-cat-lonely-bear-christine-shields","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-01-08T22:36:06.000Z","description":"Esmeralda Tree Cat / Lonely Bear\r\nPictures and story by Christine Shields\r\n\r\n5-Color Screenprint W/ Hand-Coloring\r\nBook measures: 9.25 x 12.25 inches\r\nEncased in a 11x14 in. fake fur pouch with glo-cord and toggle closure. \r\nLap-case bound with navy bonded leather spine onto wood panel covers.  24 pages.\r\nEdition of 50\r\n2008\r\n\r\nIncandescently silk-screened in 5-colors by Kayrock Press.

The Occuprint website is meant to connect people with this work, and provide a base of support for print-related media within the #Occupy movement. http://occuprint.org/. Occuprint showcases posters from the worldwide Occupy movement, all of which are part of the creative commons, and available to be downloaded for noncommercial use, though we ask that artists be given attribution \r\nfor their work. Our Print Lab is collaboration with the Occupy Wall Street Screen Printing Guild. The OWS Screen Printing Guild is an official working group within the OWS General Assembly. It is an open working group that regularly incorporates new members into its process and can be contacted at owsscreenguild(at)gmail(dot)com.

It's you. And you're going to steal your own girlfriend, smoke all your weed, and not even have the decency to help pay your rent. You might be a moster. You might be the best thing that's ever happened to yourself. \r\n\r\nScott Too by Victor Giannini, magical realism set in Brooklyn, is a novella about living with your \"better\" self, who slowly begins to appropriate your past until you feel like you no longer truly exist. Hey, what can go wrong?\r\n\r\n\"Victor Giannini's Scott Too is a tour de force that echoes the best speculative fiction of Philip K. Dick and the magical realism of Jose Saramago. In this brilliant short novel, Scott Alvin comes home one day after almost getting killed in a drive-by shooting, to find his double also named Scott relaxing on his living room couch, talking to his roommate. Scott struggles to maintain his identity as Scott Too asserts his personality in ways that do not get with Scott's sense of self. Giannini's fantastic world forces us to tackle our own questions of identity, responsibility, and free will. Scott Too ultimately serves as a philosophical mirror, not only for Scott Alvin, but for ourselves.\" - Kaylie Jones","options":[{"id":32628703,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102412633/-/Scan_2.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102412633/-/Scan_2.jpeg","width":644,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":10044385,"name":"Secret Wars 3 - Adams Puryear ","permalink":"secret-wars-3-adams-puryear","position":61,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/secret-wars-3-adams-puryear","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-20T02:30:57.000Z","description":"Secret Wars 3 by Adams Puryear\r\n5 1/8 x 5 1/8 inches\r\n24 pages\r\nFull color reprodcutions of sculptural installations and accompanying drawings\r\nPrinted by Ginny's, Austin Texas\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Their buffet of influences reads like a list of all the sub and sub-sub cultures globalized modernity has to offer: Dada, Neo-Dada, Punk, the Situationists and comic books, popular treatises on the occult and stop-motion animation, zines and contemporary graffiti and sixteenth-century memento-mori, ceramic history and eighties video games.

Alike in their willingness to participate, the artists nonetheless work in varied styles and media; their submissions range from 150 photocopied prints to series of 150 unique drawings.\r\n\r\nEach porfolio includes:\r\n<b>\r\n1 original print by Sam Kalda\r\n1 original painting by Annemieke Beemster Leverenz\r\n1 copy of an original drawing by Andrew Liang\r\n1 Xerox minizine by Aimee Lusty\r\n1 Xerox print by Becca McCharen\r\n1 original drawing by Asa Osborne\r\n1 original watercolor by Jan Razauskas\r\n1 Xerox print by Jason Roy\r\n1 original work by Ryan Jacob Smith\r\n1 original work by Crystal Stokowski\r\n1 folding print by Christine Buckton Tillman\r\n1 silkscreen print by Erin Womack</b>\r\n\r\nSizes vary, all housed within sealed 7 x 7 inch clear plastic record sleeve.

We hope you enjoy the latest book and will join us on our newest ventures.\"\r\n- Scott Massey, RRR Project","options":[{"id":26336328,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/82297779/-/RRR-cover.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/82297779/-/RRR-cover.jpeg","width":658,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/82297845/-/RRR-2.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/82297845/-/RRR-2.jpeg","width":1000,"height":733},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/82297923/-/RRR-3.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/82297923/-/RRR-3.jpeg","width":1000,"height":749},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/82297965/-/RRR-4.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/82297965/-/RRR-4.jpeg","width":1000,"height":727},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/82298025/-/RRR-5.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/82298025/-/RRR-5.jpeg","width":618,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2441901,"name":"Zines","permalink":"zines","url":"/category/zines"},{"id":5491392,"name":"**Sale**","permalink":"sale","url":"/category/sale"}]},{"id":7118153,"name":"Possibility For A Swear Word- Jon Bocksel ","permalink":"possibility-for-a-swear-word-jon-bocksel","position":81,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/possibility-for-a-swear-word-jon-bocksel","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-08-31T20:33:19.000Z","description":"Possibility For A Swear Word by Jon Bocksel\r\n22 pages, Color\r\n8.5 x 5.5 inches\r\nEdition of 100\r\n2011\r\n\r\nThe Possibility for a Swear Word series has engrossed some 20 small works on paper and has migrated into larger incarnations, including enamel work on canvas.\r\n\r\nThis zine is a selection of these works created 2009-2011.\r\nExcerpt From The Order of Things- An Archaeology of the Human Sciences, Michel Foucault 1966.\r\n","options":[{"id":22523669,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70103865/-/JB_Poss_Zine.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70103865/-/JB_Poss_Zine.jpg","width":700,"height":592},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70104249/-/JB_Poss_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70104249/-/JB_Poss_2.jpg","width":925,"height":693},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70104271/-/JB_Poss_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70104271/-/JB_Poss_3.jpg","width":925,"height":693}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4086528,"name":"Booklyn Art Gallery","permalink":"booklyn-art-gallery","url":"/category/booklyn-art-gallery"},{"id":2441901,"name":"Zines","permalink":"zines","url":"/category/zines"},{"id":5491392,"name":"**Sale**","permalink":"sale","url":"/category/sale"}]},{"id":13264614,"name":"NEW Space for Rent #3 -

A coinciding zine from the Booklyn performance will be published and available later this Summer. \r\n\r\nSURPRISE!!! is a recurring, roving performance project, created in 2009 by artists Aaron Wojack and Calder Zwicky. Each SURPRISE!!! event is a site-specific occurrence, taking place in vastly different environments including art galleries, boats, tents, and more. Coinciding with the performance event will be a retrospective group exhibition featuring three years of photography, ephemera, and artwork by collaborators and zine contributors: Aaron Anderson, Gabe Dikel, Keith Mendak and Angelo Zwicky. In addition, we will be releasing two brand new issues of SURPRISE!!! Each performance is a catalyst for the next issue, so photographs from this event will be published in the next issue of SURPRISE!!! along with a new selection of guest artworks.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/booklynartgallery/sets/72157630767331706/\">More info...</a>","options":[{"id":21599581,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66805333/-/suprise_6.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66805333/-/suprise_6.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66805357/-/suprise6_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66805357/-/suprise6_2.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66805403/-/suprise6_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66805403/-/suprise6_3.jpg","width":925,"height":693}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4086528,"name":"Booklyn Art Gallery","permalink":"booklyn-art-gallery","url":"/category/booklyn-art-gallery"},{"id":2441901,"name":"Zines","permalink":"zines","url":"/category/zines"}]}]
