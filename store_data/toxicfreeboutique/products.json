MEZAYA polishes do not have the potent smell usually associated with nail polish. Conventional nail polish contains large amount (typically around 60- 70%) of chemical solvents such as toluene, acetates and alcohol. These solvents have odours that can be offensive to adults, children and even to animals MEZAYA colors are formulated using water as the main base ingredient, not harsh solvents.\r\nThis makes us different from all mainstream nail polish brands, including those that advertise themselves as (so called) 'chemical free', '3 free' (DPB/Formaldehyde/Toulene), 'eco - friendly' or 'natural'.\r\n\r\nPlease note, If a nail polish is to work on human nails, it can not be 100% 'natural'. If you enjoy wearing nail polish, and want to keep them as 'free from' as possible, MEZAYA is one of the most gentle, water-based polishes available on the market today.\r\n\r\n<!-- AddThis Button BEGIN -->\r\n<a class=\"addthis_button\" href=\"http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&amp;username=xa-4bf65c7a3f4516c4\"><img src=\"http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/v2/lg-share-en.gif\" width=\"125\" height=\"16\" alt=\"Bookmark and Share\" style=\"border:0\"/></a><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=xa-4bf65c7a3f4516c4\"></script>\r\n<!-- AddThis Button END -->\r\n","options":[{"id":6004221,"name":"Default","price":8.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.99,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":6.95,"amount_with_others":0.6}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/22967371/-/white.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/22967371/-/white.jpg","width":354,"height":510},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/15643641/-/vic_015_copy_edit_ice_white.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/15643641/-/vic_015_copy_edit_ice_white.jpg","width":150,"height":205},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/20226711/-/ice_white.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/20226711/-/ice_white.jpg","width":731,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1003011,"name":"MEZAYA WATER BASED NAIL POLISH","permalink":"mezaya-water-based-nail-polish","url":"/category/mezaya-water-based-nail-polish"}]},{"id":1643771,"name":"*NEW IMPROVED FORMULA* Mezaya Essential base/ Topcoat Sealer","permalink":"topcoat-sealer","position":24,"price":8.95,"default_price":8.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/topcoat-sealer","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-02-18T17:49:45.000Z","description":" <a href=\"http://www.toxicfreeboutique.bigcartel.com/essential-mezaya-faqs\">For ingredients and essential product information click here\r\n</a> \r\n\r\n*New Improved Formula* Base/ Top Coat Sealer  - translucent\r\n\r\nAn absolute must for prolonging the life of your manicure/ pedicure.
