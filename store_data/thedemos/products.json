In the whole tug-o-war between melody and balls it's a tie, thanks to the band's Everly-esque harmonies and classic 1970's AM radio pop. Cool and casual, The Demos create a type of on-stage rock fervor that gets 'em squealin'. This is truly what pop music should sound like, and the new album seems more like a continuation than a progression or departure from the previous two. That's a good thing: it ain't broke, but it will definitely break hearts.\" - Frank De Blase, Rochester City Newspaper\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n1. I Gotta Know\r\n2. Never Gonna Let You Go\r\n3.

The harmonies are sensational as they bounce off the jangle and bop. I'm tempted to call this a kind of retro pop; these kids have apparently taken a dip in the Liverpool. Granted, the band members aren't as old as my sense of déjà vu, but this is the kind of music that crackled out of little transistor radios when I was a kid in a world of muscle cars and tube tops. I don't think there's another band in this town that just about every music fan could fall in love with. This is my new favorite band.
