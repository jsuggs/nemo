We have continued to push ourselves to better understand our vineyards and Mother Nature in order to produce a unique expression of the terroir. We believe the endeavor has been worthwhile; this 2001 vintage has a beautifully integrated, complex personality that is worth getting to know. The wine is dark, deliciously complex, rich and polished. It is loaded with layers of spicy and earthy currant, blackberry, pencil lead, mocha and cedary flavors, with a hint of anise, sage, herb and leather. It finishes with ripe, textured and well-integrated tannins.\n\n","options":[{"id":2192,"name":"Default","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/4076/-/300.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/4076/-/300.gif","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":687,"name":"Wine","permalink":"wine","url":"/category/wine"}]},{"id":660,"name":"2001 Cabernet Sauvignon (Library), case (10% discount)","permalink":"2001-cabernet-sauvignon-library-case-10-discount","position":2,"price":648.0,"default_price":648.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/2001-cabernet-sauvignon-library-case-10-discount","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2006-02-16T22:18:31.000Z","description":"Our 2001 Cabernet Sauvignon is a truly intriguing vintage that showcases the premium fruit grown in our estate vineyards.
