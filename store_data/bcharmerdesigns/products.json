This one is basically the \"everything but the kitchen sink\" type of bag, but with style so that you look hip, not haggard. \r\n\r\nFeatured are two pleated pockets on either end, two sleeve pockets on the back,three sleeve pockets under the flap and a big zippered pocket, also under the flap. Inside there are three sleeve pockets to organize your life. A swivel hook inside keeps your keys from the abyss.\r\n\r\nThis bag is fully interfaced for stability, and the strap is made from nylon \"seat belt\" webbing. It is made from Anna Maria Horner's beautiful home decor weight fabric as well as some sturdy canvas and ticking. Here's what I put in mine: a book, my journal, my daughter's diapers, a sippy cup, extra clothes, checkbook wallet, small card wallet, cell phone, ipod, keys, snacks, sunglasses, and whatever else I need for an outing. This bag holds more than you'll want to carry! The strap is adjustable so that you can wear it messanger style or over your shoulder. \r\n\r\nMeasurements: 14 inches (35.5 cm)wide, 11.5 inches (29 cm) tall, and 5 inches (12.5 cm)deep.\r\n\r\nThis bag should be hand washed in warm water and hung to dry. Use a hot steam iron to press back into shape (but don't iron the strap, it will melt!).\r\n\r\nPlease allow 2 weeks for me to make your bag and get it in the mail.\r\n","options":[{"id":9274771,"name":"Made To Order","price":180.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":11.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":30.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25242462/-/TessaBag_008.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25242462/-/TessaBag_008.JPG","width":1000,"height":817}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1566333,"name":"Bags","permalink":"bags","url":"/category/bags"}]}]
