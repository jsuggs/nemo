(B!176)\r\n\r\nBLOODYMINDED is a heavy electronic band that was formed in New York, in 1995, after the dissolution of the early American industrial noise group Intrinsic Action, founded by Mark Solotroff in 1984. The group’s live shows are extremely energetic, characterized by layers of screeching analog synthesizer, aggressive vocals, and a copious amount of feedback.  While BLOODYMINDED operate within the noise scene, their sound is broadly informed by their industrial forbearers, NYC pre-punk and noise rock, and British hardcore and grindcore.  BLOODYMINDED has performed with diverse artists covering noise, power-electronics, experimental, avant-garde, death-rock, industrial, hardcore, metal and punk.  Although currently based in Chicago, members also live in Brooklyn, New York, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Toulouse, France.\r\n\r\n“Within The Walls” is the band’s fifth full-length studio recording and the first to be issued since their 2006 album, “Magnetism.”  Numerous false starts led to the band entering the studio with acclaimed doom metal producer, Sanford Parker, to finally commit the new set of songs to tape (no, computer).  The album is based on the concept of “love and loss in a time of great sadness,” and it follows themes established by members Isidro Reyes and Mark Solotroff in their offshoot band, The Fortieth Day.  Reyes and Solotroff closely collaborated on the lyrics, working in both Spanish and English.  Released on LP, CD and digital, this marks the first BLOODYMINDED full-length on vinyl.  In addition to basic black, a special edition of 100 copies will be released on white vinyl, with a silk screen print based on the front cover artwork, printed by Erin Page of Kill Hatsumomo Prints.\r\n\r\nAlong with core members Xavier Laradji, James Moy, Isidro Reyes, Pieter Schoolwerth and Mark Solotroff, select guest musicians were drafted to assist with the album.  Longstanding BLOODYMINDED family member, David Reed (Envenomist, Luasa Raelon), who has played live with the band on numerous occasions, was brought in to create an atmospheric opener for the album.  He was aided by Blake Edwards (Vertonen), Solotroff’s ex-band mate in Anatomy of Habit and Animal Law.  Edwards created a collection of metal-on-metal textures that add to the disquieting feel of “All The Cities Are Occupied.”  Along with co-producing, Sanford Parker played lead synthesizer on the album closer, “Inverted Ruins,” a remake of the Locrian song – which Solotroff originally sang on – from that group’s 2010 album, “Territories.”  Edwards reprised his dark metallic drones for the uncharacteristically melodic song.  What happens in between those two songs is a bombastic, high-fidelity assault of electronic noise, screams, feedback and purgation.\r\n\r\nDuring the long gap between albums, the members of BLOODYMINDED were hardly idle.  Laradji stepped up his role as a publisher, releasing increasingly lavish editions of art and negative-culture books under the Timeless banner.  Moy established his reputation as a true death-industrial force, with solo work under the charming Anal Hearse moniker.  Reyes remained exceptionally busy, performing live and releasing over a dozen full-length albums with The Fortieth Day, and in 2012, he released his first solo work through the esteemed Mexican label, Ruido Horrible.  Based in Brooklyn, Schoolwerth continues his successful painting career, and until early 2013, he helmed Wierd Records, releasing numerous acclaimed recordings of minimal-synth, cold wave and challenging electronic music.  His weekly parties under the Wierd name brought hundreds of dark music artists to eager, debauched, late-night audiences in NYC.  Solotroff worked closely with Reyes in The Fortieth Day and he recorded and toured in the synth trio Nightmares (with David Reed and Jonathan Canady), while also joining the doom band Animal Law and later co-founding the group Anatomy of Habit.  He has made guest appearances, live and/or recorded, with Alma Negra, The Atlas Moth, Brutal Truth, Consumer Electronics, Indian, Locrian, Rabid Rabbit, etc.  Although his solo microphone-feedback performances have become infrequent, he has also been recording and performing with Thrill Jockey artists Wrekmeister Harmonies, since late-2011. Solotroff continues to oversee the noise, synth and metal label, BloodLust!, which he founded in 1994.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n01. “All The Cities Are Occupied” (9:06)\r\n02. “Within The Walls” (2:16)\r\n03. “Night Strikes” (5:13)\r\n04. “Token 3” (0:58)\r\n05. “Disintegration” (6:26)\r\n06. “Token 4” (0:34)\r\n07. “Fatal Breath” (6:27)\r\n08. “Token 5” (1:18)\r\n09. “Circular Relations” (3:36)\r\n10. “Token 6” (1:06)\r\n11. “Token 7” (0:08)\r\n12. “Outside The Gate” (3:03)\r\n13. “Inverted Ruins” (6:49)\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 200px; height: 661px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3215484760/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e32c14/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://bloodyminded.bandcamp.com/album/within-the-walls\">Within The Walls by BLOODYMINDED</a></iframe>\r\n","options":[{"id":41058702,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123351549/-/B!176_CD_Front-web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123351549/-/B!176_CD_Front-web.jpg","width":540,"height":480}],"artists":[{"id":49145,"name":"BLOODYMINDED","permalink":"bloodyminded","url":"/artist/bloodyminded"}],"categories":[{"id":1754881,"name":"Compact Discs","permalink":"compact-discs","url":"/category/compact-discs"}]},{"id":13844907,"name":"B!176 BLOODYMINDED \"Within The Walls\" LP (LIMITED EDITION)","permalink":"b-176-bloodyminded-within-the-walls-lp-limited-edition","position":2,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/b-176-bloodyminded-within-the-walls-lp-limited-edition","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-28T16:26:04.000Z","description":"NOW AVAILABLE FOR PRE-ORDER\r\n\r\nTest pressings were approved on 11/27/13 and orders are expected to ship beginning on 01/06/14\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhite vinyl version of new BLOODYMINDED full-length \"Within The Walls\" LP\r\n\r\nIncludes a silk screen print based on the front cover artwork, printed by Erin Page of Kill Hatsumomo Prints\r\n\r\nLimited to 100 copies\r\n\r\nExclusive to the BloodShop!

The recording took place during a late night session at WLUW on Loyola University’s campus for Phil von Zweck’s “Something Else” radio show on November 29th, 2009.\r\n\r\nThe group created these six tracks live using guitar, bass, synthesizers, and vocals. The live recordings were then processed in Milan, Italy by P.NG5361.B. The group uses these instruments to create burned out industrial drones made up of looped feedback, percussion throbs and the sounds of machines dying. Hypnotizing repeating layers tactfully shift into blasts of angular high-pitched mechanical frenzy. There are implicit melodies in the chaos. Strong material from this unique collaboration.\r\n\r\nFrom The Inarguable:\r\n\r\nA massive collaboration within itself, it isn't hard to imagine The Fortieth Day (Mark Solotroff and Isidro Reyes from Bloodyminded), Sshe Retina Stimulants, and Terence Hannum (Land of Decay co-proprietor and Locrian analog wizard) meeting up in WLUW 88.7 FM's studio. The product of a group of like minded musicians, the Advent tape is a work based in juxtaposition, suddenly changing from soft, deep drones and quiet drum machine mantras to complete, utter chaos. Synthesizers do relentless battle with atonal guitar work and crumbling laptop noise, sometimes not letting up for extensive periods of time before entirely disappearing without any cue or warning. To be a fly on a wall in that studio, sheesh.\r\n\r\n\r\nStream here:\r\n<iframe width=\"150\" height=\"450\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 150px; height: 450px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=314965662/size=tall2/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=cb1a1c/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"http://thefortiethday.bandcamp.com/album/the-fortieth-day-sshe-retina-stimulants-terence-hannum-advent\">The Fortieth Day + Sshe Retina Stimulants + Terence Hannum &quot;Advent&quot; by The Fortieth Day</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":32889571,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103197406/-/Advent-Jewelbox-front.PNG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103197406/-/Advent-Jewelbox-front.PNG","width":486,"height":427},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103197463/-/Advent-Jewelbox-inner.PNG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103197463/-/Advent-Jewelbox-inner.PNG","width":441,"height":425},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103197484/-/Advent-Jewelbox-back.PNG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103197484/-/Advent-Jewelbox-back.PNG","width":486,"height":429},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103197532/-/Advent-Jewelbox-disc.PNG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103197532/-/Advent-Jewelbox-disc.PNG","width":486,"height":422}],"artists":[{"id":49151,"name":"The Fortieth Day","permalink":"the-fortieth-day","url":"/artist/the-fortieth-day"},{"id":56542,"name":"Terence Hannum","permalink":"terence-hannum","url":"/artist/terence-hannum"},{"id":49147,"name":"Locrian","permalink":"locrian","url":"/artist/locrian"},{"id":49669,"name":"Isidro Reyes","permalink":"isidro-reyes","url":"/artist/isidro-reyes"},{"id":49165,"name":"Sshe Retina Stimulants","permalink":"sshe-retina-stimulants","url":"/artist/sshe-retina-stimulants"}],"categories":[{"id":1754881,"name":"Compact Discs","permalink":"compact-discs","url":"/category/compact-discs"}]},{"id":10056397,"name":"B!173 Sshe Retina Stimulants and Neil Jendon \"A Brutal Case Of Glacial Blasphemy\" CD","permalink":"b-173-sshe-retina-stimulants-and-neil-jendon-a-brutal-case-of-glacial-blasphemy-cd","position":14,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/b-173-sshe-retina-stimulants-and-neil-jendon-a-brutal-case-of-glacial-blasphemy-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-20T23:46:31.000Z","description":"B!173\r\nSshe Retina Stimulants and Neil Jendon\r\n\"A Brutal Case Of Glacial Blasphemy\" CD\r\n\r\nExclusive new studio recordings from the dream team. \r\n\r\nNeither of these artists needs much introduction to people who follow BloodLust! -- Sshe Retina Stimulants has been here from the very start and Neil Jendon has been a part of the live and recorded extended family for several years now, joining some particularly memorable live bills with BLOODYMINDED, The Fortieth Day and Anatomy of Habit.  He also has two previous releases on BloodLust!  Recently, Neil has joined another band with an LP on the label, Rabid Rabbit, adding his synth skills to their doomy, dark psychedelic sound.\r\n\r\nI am not sure, exactly, when the thought occurred to me that Paolo and Neil should record and/or play together, but when I introduced them and watched them converse at a show in Chicago, maybe two or three years ago, the idea certainly clicked.  They are, individually, two of my favorite electronic musicians -- and although Paolo continues to investigate increasingly spartan digital set-ups, and Neil always dazzles me with his very analog modular rig -- the two share a sensibility that makes them a great match.  Both men frequently take a rather minimalist approach to their sound, and both often exploit a range of isolated frequencies that solidified the concept of their pairing in my mind.\r\n\r\nThey bring these varied elements together on this collaboration, offering a wide range of electrical sounds, beautifully blended, at times testing and straining the low-end response of the listener's speakers and demanding the that one pay very close attention to their array of inhuman crystalline tones and frequencies.\r\n\r\nThe two finally played live together, in Chicago, in late November of 2012 (see pictures next to this description), quickly throwing subtlety to the wind and blowing the roof off the performance space.

This is the LP version of the CD that Relapse released in late 2011.  \"Artificial Madness\" represents a momentous step in the progression of this very accomplished Chicago-based, Scottish-born musician, offering a suite of contemporary, heavy, high-energy rock songs that reveal measured lyrics paired with meticulously crafted songs.  While Chris has certainly delivered beautiful records in the past, the maturity of this album may surprise some fans who have followed his prolific, diverse and rather hedonistic career in music.\r\n\r\nLyrically, the album offers a set of narratives that seem to accurately define a truly dystopian landscape, setting stories in invented locales, in which the inhabitants lead a dark, dehumanized and anxious existence.  Stylistically, \"Artificial Madness\" sounds very modern, even as it draws from an arsenal of heavy post-punk music elements that Chris has built upon since the mid- to late-1980s, whether solo, with Ministry or Revolting Cocks, or with current and former members of Killing Joke and Public Image Limited.\r\n\r\nThis album also happens to feature numerous friends of mine.  Perhaps Chris needs no further introduction, but his impact on the world of dark and heavy music, both in Chicago and beyond, should not be underestimated.  And for those who think his “electronic” work is limited to the Wax Trax! style of industrial music – as if such as thing was that easy to classify – let me tell you about a very memorable 1989 show at Dreamerz, when Chris opened up for the still-new My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult, shocking (most of) the crowd with a vicious, assertive, straight-up power-electronics set.  On a label-related note, Chris previously sang on the Plague Bringer \"Burning Inside\" CD single box set (B!155, 2010), an exclusive Record Store Day release that featured a cover version of a well-known song by one of his former bands, Ministry.\r\n \r\nAnd for this album, Chris assembled a veritable who’s who of heavy-hitters from Chicago.  Sanford Parker (keyboards, engineering and production) is known from the bands Buried At Sea, Minsk, Twilight and Nachtmystium, and he previously played alongside Chris in The High Confessions.  Sanford also recorded the forthcoming BLOODYMINDED album, \"Within The Walls,\" and he recorded and played synth alongside me on the imminent Wrekmeister Harmonies album, \"You've Always Meant So Much To Me.\"  Will Lindsay (bass) is a good friend, who has also sat in on bass with Anatomy of Habit, while I have contributed live synth and vocals to Will's band, Indian.  Will is also known for his work with bands including Nachtmystium, Wolves in the Throne Room and Middian.  Dallas Thomas (guitar) is known for his band The Swan King and he also happens to be playing with the celebrated group Pelican, these days.  His amazing guitar style and tone is unmistakable on this LP.  Noah Leger (drums) has recently been helping out on drums with Anatomy of Habit and he is known from a number of diverse local groups, including Electric Hawk, Head of Skulls, Tight Phantomz, and Milemarker.  Noah most recently joined the exciting Chicago group Disappears.

Chris Connelly's Artificial Madness was arguably one of the most overlooked records of 2011.  Originally released on CD by purveyours of heaviness Relapse Records, Artificial Madness gets some serious hometown love in 2012 by Chicago based BloodLust! Records.  BloodLust! has been steadily releasing outstanding records by the likes of Anatomy Of Habit, Sun Splitter, Arriver and Rabid Rabbit.  We've dropped drooling praise on their previous releases and now to finally get our grubby hands on Chris Connelly wax has us over the moon to say the least.  Artificial Madness is first and foremost a rock record, which it being released on Relapse might lead one to believe this is a metal release but Connelly eschews his time spent in such legendary industrial bands as Revolting Cocks and Ministry and instead plows straight forward into thick muscular post apocalyptic rock with his warming croon over top of some punishing rhythms and walls of guitar majesty; we're hearing echoes of Killing Joke, Wire and even some Public Image Limited tinges here and there, but like they put all those influences in a blender then blasted it out of a cannon.  High octane, high energy dark jams from start to finish is what you'll get on Artificial Madness; after it's all said and done see what remnants of your mind are left.  Connelly enlisted some of Chicago's finest to fill out his band of outsiders featuring members of Nachtmystium, Indian, The Swan King, and Electric Hawk giving Artificial Madness a walloping heft that is yet to be matched.   Fans of Total Control, Pop 1280 and the paranoia-stricken sci-fi roster of Sacred Bones Records should definitely take note on this one.  Mega Recommended.\r\n\r\n- Permanent Records, Chicago\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nTo call Artificial Madness a comeback for Chris Connelly might be overstating the case. Some such as this critic were enthralled by the Scottish singers first three solo recordsWhiplash Boychild (1991), Phenobarb Bambalam (1992), and Shipwreck (1994)only to gradually drift away as Connelly indulged an ever more diffuse artistic muse inspired by the avant-garde, latter-day work of his hero, Scott Walker.  But this new release from the former member of Ministry and Revolting Cocks is a most welcome development.\r\n\r\nArtificial Madness is driven by a shit-hot, driving rhythm section and some alternately grinding, chiming, jagged, and shoegazer-like guitar textures (the backing unit includes members of metal doomgazers Wolves in the Throne Room and Minsk). The music takes up where one might have expected Connelly to head around the time following Phenobarb Bambalam, the record in his oeuvre closest to this one. To speak plainly, Connelly rocks out here, kicking ass like he hasnt allowed himself to do in years, and the result is liberating for both the singer and his audience.\r\n \r\nInspired by a loose theme based on the alienating effects of modern technology, Artificial Madness takes off like a 747 with the pounding, pulsating title track, which then morphs into the even more intense Wait For Amateur, the best 1-2 punch this writer has heard on any album this year. Throughout, Connelly draws upon various vocal personae from his career to this point: he alternates a David Bowie-esque croon with a Scottish-brogue inflected, spoken-word approach on the shifting, doomy The Paraffin Hearts (the only way to tell us apart / you have to take a flame to our paraffin hearts/ And whichever one decides to ignite/ Decadence won't make it right).  On the blazing The Goner, Connelly briefly evokes his Ministry/Revolting Cocks days with some dirty, distorted vocals.\r\n \r\nWith bands like Public Image Limited, Killing Joke, and Connellys own Damage Manual as sonic reference points, excellent tracks like Classically Wounded and Compatibility evoke the early days of alternative music while simultaneously sounding fresh and inspired. The Subjects, meanwhile, starts with a poppy electric guitar riff that soon morphs into a full scale punk rock assault. The more romantic rocker Imperfect Star would have sounded at home on Shipwreck, while The Modern Swine seethes with the singers dislike for our overly wired world.\r\n \r\nOverall, Artificial Madness is an exhilarating ride. If you ever loved the early solo work of Chris Connelly, but thought that guy was gone forever, think again. This one will thrill you and make you care once more.\r\n \r\n- Johnny Gutter Walker\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nFans of local-based Wax Trax! Records and Revolting Cocks-era Chris Connelly haven't had much to latch onto in a bunch of years music-wise. Folks up in West Town that have been visiting the Scottish transplant (knowingly or not) at the Reckless Records store he manages can usually find such vintage Connelly discs. But now twenty years have passed since his nearly flawless debut Whiplash Boychild was unleashed. I had wondered whether were we ever to here industrial's answer to David Bowie again. Well, get ready to rock out with your, well, you know. The tempo and blood gets pumping on the sensational Classically Wounded,. That track is maybe the best song has ever done, and the album is his most dynamic and special, at least, With other standout tracks like Cold Blood And Present Company, The Goner, and the positively wonderful Imperfect Star, Connelly reinvents himself by taking a fresh approach to the past. The approach is simple but louder than he has been in ages. The strangest part in all this to me is that Artificial Madness is being released on Relapse Records. It does not fit in with their roster of metal heavies. But based on that, I'm willing to bet this is the one of the most diverse albums in their catalog. I know I have thoroughly enjoyed it.\r\n\r\n-  David Musto, The Big Takeover\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe one and only time I had the privilege of watching Chris Connelly perform was in 2002 or 2003 at The Roxy in Boston when he was again touring with Pigface. He opened the Pigface set by coming out alone and doing an acoustic cover of his former band The Damage Manuals The Peepshow Ghosts. If I wasnt a fan of his already, that opening song wouldve sold me for sure.\r\n \r\nIf youre already a fan of Mr. Connelly then Artificial Madness, his latest, is sure to excite you. It manages to encapsulate all that he is in a nice little 40 minute package. Theres elements of Ministry and RevCo, his solo releases, and especially the aforementioned mighty Damage Manual.\r\n \r\nArtificial Madness is another one of those crazy albums where the sum of all the people just dont add up on paper but after hearing the finished output, the listener is pleasantly surprised. You have the former singer of industrial juggernauts Ministry, Revco, and Pigface paired with a backing band featuring members of Nachtmystium, Wolves In The Throne Room, Minsk, and Indian and an album produced by Sanford Parker whos also a member of some of the already mentioned bands. And its on Relapse. Is it a metal album? Not really. Dont get me wrong, its heavy but to simply categorize it under one genre would be a great disservice to Artificial Madness and the artists who worked so hard to make it what it is.\r\n \r\nSo what is Artificial Madness? Its an album that transcends metal. It transcends industrial. It transcends hard rock. Itssomething else.\r\nMadness starts off with swirling guitars and Connellys familiar croon easing you in to a false sense of security until that hypnotic chorus reminds you of all those nights you stared at the ceiling wide awake as that guy who sang on Ministrys Cannibal Song used his voice as a weapon to drive you mad. Or was that just me?\r\n \r\nWait For Amateur sounds like some throwback between old U2 and new school brit-rock a la Maximo Park. Cold Blood In Present Company drills you with a fuzzed out bass for 30 seconds before Connelly in his best Bowie swagger massages your ear buds. Imperfect Stars subtle electronics accent the cacophony of the guitar and cymbal crashes just right. The screaming wail and industrial backbeat of Classically Wounded might be the song that sums up all of Artificial though with its driving song structure, incredible riffage, and Connellys voice that is, to this day, one of the most unique and distinct out there still.\r\n \r\nArtificial Madness is truly a treat for old school fans. It takes everything thats made Connelly great over the years and takes it to the next level. It goes above an beyond continuously and should appeal to fans of everything hes done so far. With a duet on Meshell Ndegeocellos latest album Weather in the can as well, the time is definitely right for Chris Connelly to be in the publics hearts and minds once more.\r\n\r\n- Metal Monday / Pop! Blerd\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nBefore I can start reviewing the latest album from Chris Connelly, I have to share something with you that completely set the scene for me. Two nights before I got the album, I had a dream that I was writing a review of the album in a very large old Victorian style home without windows. It was dark and rainy outside, giving way to a very chilly interior, although I didnt seem to mind. I was sat at a very old, dilapidated desk in front of a notepad and pencil and I was staring at a giant bowl of candy setting on the desk. Now, Im not sure what the candy has to do with anything, but the rest of the setting really seemed to fall into place once I heard the album. The dream itself had this sci fi feeling of impending doom yet an overwhelming sense of excitement and adventure. Once I put pencil to paper, I couldnt stop writing.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what happened once I listened to the album. I was overcome with this inability to narrow it down and only write a simple review. I was transported both backwards and forwards in time (despite not owning a TARDIS). So how do I narrow this all down and make this review even remotely to the point without going on and on and on and seeming a bit too overenthusiastic? Well, Im going to try. Bear with me.\r\n\r\nMy first impression of Artificial Madness, the 15th solo album from Chris Connelly was one of being thrown back to some of his older work. Its heavier, more ragey and has a poetic backbone. It is very different than his last few works and, not that I didnt appreciate the last few works, but I was definitely ready for this from him. After seeing him perform with Luc Van Acker and Paul Barker in April at the Wax Trax 33 1/3 Anniversary in Chicago, I was so ready to hear him with something big and heavy again. This is it!\r\n\r\nFrom the get go, the fact that it is heavier is obvious. The title track crashes in without warning and throws you into a frenzy of guitars, words and beats. There is a steadiness of the beat that aids the feeling of being warned that comes through on this album. It is as though it is beating out a message to you, telling you to beware. Interestingly enough, Chris had mentioned in an interview that the third song, Classically Wounded is a cautionary tale. I know the author or artist has their meaning behind their work, but I think the audience also takes what they get out of it and to me, this entire album sounds like a cautionary tale. In the case of this track, it feels as though it is warning us that the very thing that propels us to be who we are can destroy us.\r\n\r\nIt is the whole album though. The tone. The atmosphere feels so much like a film. Like a film that is warning us about some impending apocalypse and the dystopia we are destined to live in afterward. While listening to it, I could see a film playing in my head that was paced in such a perfect way that it maintained a sense of urgent excitement, a dangerous game of chance and car chases through dark, damp desolate city streets. I dont think an album has caused my heart to pound nearly as much as this one has inwell, forever. Chris Connelly has a way with words that has yet to be beaten in my book. When it is combined with the intensity of rock guitars and frantic synthesizer panic, you cant stop listening. You want to know what happens next. I dont think he meant for this to be a concept album, but I can honestly see a story played out in my mind with every track.\r\n\r\nTrack six The Modern Swine channels David Bowie both stylistically and vocally, with a primal futuristic sound warning us about what we are doing to ourselves and what we are about to become (or maybe some of us have already become). The poetry of The Paraffin Hearts brings a level of emotion to the record that softens us up just in time for The Subjects to build us up to an explosion of angsty guitars spiraling out of control and leading directly into The Goner, where we end up feeling a fear almost like one of being outnumbered and vulnerable. By the time this album ends, I feel like Ive been on a rollercoaster ride through a post-punk apocalyptic world of road warriors and bad guys and I love it. I get back on and ride again.\r\n\r\nThis album is so aptly named, Artificial Madness, and I mean that in a very good way. It takes you into a world, experiencing this art not just with your ears but with every emotion and sense you own. Take this ride. Im not kidding.\r\n\r\n- Twisted Peppermint\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen Chris Connelly first announced the upcoming release of Artificial Madness back in May, he promised the album would be a lot harder, acknowledging his former band Ministry in certain ways.\r\n\r\nWhile perhaps equally well known for his role in another Al Jourgensen-backed band, The Revolting Cocks, Connelly's solo career has always seemed mired down in that it was never hard enough compared to his \"formative years.\" But this album proves that his formative years are not behind him.\r\n\r\nFor years, he has continually progressed as a poet and songwriter, among the most underrated on the alternative scene as he drops in and out of other bands and side projects. In fact, even when his music has taken a turn toward folk, Connelly has always seemed to cover more ground as a musician on his own.\r\n\r\nArtificial Madness has everything it needs to become essential.\r\n\r\nHis upcoming album, Artificial Madness, is no exception. The songs are harder, picking up hints of post-modern rock indicative of a traditional four-piece lineup but with pop and post-punk undertones in his delivery as a singer. As a lyricist and songwriter, he wants bands to ask harder questions. He does.\r\n\r\nThe album is meticulously crafted, put together and produced by Sanford Parker, who is quickly becoming one of the most sought-after producers for underground music. He was the right fit to work on the album, being able to balance consistency and chaos throughout, much like he did for Yukaza.\r\n\r\nIt probably didn't hurt that he has always been conformable with Connelly's lineup, having worked with them before. They include guitarist Dallas Thomas (Swan King), bassist Will Lindsay (Nachmystium), and Noah Leger (Tight Phantomz). Together, this band sounds like they've played with Connelly for years.\r\n\r\n- Liquid Hip\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe blasting electronic rock rip that begins Artificial Madness shows that, regardless of Chris Connelly's explorations over the years toward the quiet and contemplative, he can still happily rock out when he chooses too -- in some ways, his Fini Tribe and Ministry/RevCo years have never left him, even while he perfected his beautiful croon of a voice. One listen later in the album to \"The Modern Swine\" and its fast-paced motorik clip shows just as clearly that those Krautrock roots that David Bowie celebrated in his own fashion not only still have a relevance but, in Connelly and company's hands, have a just as enjoyable energy still. The fact that the title track can shift into \"Wait for Amateur\" almost without losing a beat, and while sounding a bit like the same song, helps establish the immediate feeling throughout, but Connelly also keeps an ear out for variety and sudden striking moments. It can be the chiming slash of the lead guitar on \"Compatibility,\" a cover of a song by Visitors, an early Connelly inspiration from the immediately post-punk days; or the conclusive wooze \"A Career in Falsehood,\" a reverb-heavy (on the vocals) and zoned-out crunch; or something else again. If anything, there's a weird timeliness to this kind of post-punk aggro return -- \"Classically Wounded\" could almost be a royally pissed-off early U2 number musically, minus Bono-esque bleatings -- while the brisk jauntiness and tight, nervous vocal delivery of \"The Subjects\" and the slightly slower feeling of \"The Paraffin Hearts\" are two other strong moments on a great blast of a record.\r\n\r\n- Ned Raggett / Allmusic.com\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nIts not like hes been gone all this time.\r\n\r\nArtificial Madness , when it was released in late 2011, was Chris Connellys first album in one year. As a matter of fact, hes released a new album with his name on it in every calendar year since 2007. The difference between this album and those albums, however, is the approach. These are songs, songs with huge, screaming guitar parts and loud, thumping drums, songs that sing of exile and madness and terror. These are songs that begin out of nowhere and end just as suddenly, songs whose only subtlety lies in Connellys delivery of his typically literate lyrics.\r\n\r\nIn other words, its bound to remind people of Ministry, or Revolting Cocks, or Pigface.\r\n\r\nDespite a sizable solo oeuvre that has very little to do with any of those bands, Connelly tends to be most often associated with them. Its not even that he was a particularly large part of Ministry or Pigface, nor that Revolting Cocks were ever anyones idea of a serious band, its just that his contributions to those bands are so varied and memorable as to be some of the most memorable moments of those bands respective discographies. That he would create an album that, on the surface, could be so appealing to fans of those bands bodes well for the exposure of the album, and its worth the listen, not only for Connellys vocals but for the impressive instrumentation he has surrounded those vocals with.\r\n\r\nWhile the one-two punch of the title track and Wait for Amateurnearly indistinguishable in their use of oom-pah beats and chugging guitarsgets things off to an energetic start, it is the soaring Classically Wounded in which the album begins to soar. Dallas Thomas guitars get plenty of play here as they fill in the silent spaces with searing solo work, effectively breaking up Connellys tale of, as he tells it. a violinistimpaled on his/her own violin bow. Its told in more abstract terms than that, of course.\r\n\r\nWhile the album never flies higher than that track, it continues to be a consistent listen throughout, full of big guitars and high-tempo drums, occasionally slowing down to make a statement about something or other. It is generally these slower moments that make the most lasting mark on the listener. Their slower tempo doesnt lessen the volume of the guitars or the intensity of Connellys poetry; if anything, slowing down for a bit allows Connelly to show off a singing voice thats two parts David Bowie, one part Ian Curtis, though admittedly nowhere near the level of those two legends. Imperfect Star is a lovely little tune that could have been a B-side of Bowies Reality, loud guitars and a repetitive melody that actually come together to offer a pleasing drone effect. Where it doesnt quite work is in the largely spoken word The Paraffin Hearts, where Connellys understated delivery veers just a little too close to boredom.\r\n\r\nClosing with A Career in Falsehood is a strong statement; where many artists would mitigate an album with so much despair with a closer that offers hope. Connelly instead laments the fakery of humankind. The folding of the letters / The framing of an outsized ghost / The sinking of salvation / Youre getting far too close, he speaks, his words coldly and mechanically echoed at every turn. Its a harrowing slow-burn of a finish, and its effective enough to make you want to start the journey of Artificial Madness again, perhaps hoping for a different ending to the tale the next time around.\r\n\r\nThere are no outright classics on the album, though Classically Wounded comes close. It is an obscure little thing with an appealing sheen that never quite lets its guard down long enough for the listener to really connect with it. Still, Connellys approach is consistent and intriguing, and it really is the perfect entry point for those listeners familiar with his previous associations to see what hes been up to of late. Artificial Madness screams, it squeals, it drowns in despair, and it does so with a semblance of grace.\r\n\r\n- Mike Schiller / PopMatters\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nChris Connelly has been a staple of the Chicago music scene since the late 1980′s when he moved here to do time with Ministry and Revolting Cocks after leaving the band he was in prior to that, Fini Tribe. Since his relocation he padded his musical resume with some really impressive work with Pigface, Murder Inc., his own solo work (his Whiplash Boychild album on the Wax Trax label ranks among my favorite albums that label ever released), and most recently with The High Confessions. Not one to rest on his laurels, he has returned once again with a new solo album.\r\n\r\nArtificial Madness features Chris best songwriting since his debut solo  album and is a breath of fresh air with its familiar influences. This is not a return to industrial rock music for Connelly, nor is it an acoustic album. Artificial Madness is firmly rooted in the punk/post-punk category and his writing and singing style is a perfect match for this style of music. The title track starts off the album and it is a fast-tempo number with an early Pil/Killing Joke vibe. It has loud guitars and a driving beat and Chris vocals are melodic and smooth as butter. He always had a great singing voice and this time out is no different. When the chorus kicks in the guitars get more aggressive as does his singing. Its an interesting contrast and quite catchy. Wait for Amateur is one of the best songs on the album and is another fast tempo number with early PiL inspired angular guitar lines. Clocking in at two minutes the song leaves you wanting more and will earn multiple repeat listens.\r\n\r\nCold Blood in Present Company is another standout with its meaty bass line, catchy synth and melodic verses that really show off Chris singing voice which at times is Bowie-esque. Compatibility sounds like a lost PiL outtake that was recorded between their first two albums. The rest of the album features mostly Killing Joke/PiL influenced post-punk/punk with a few more melodic numbers and every song on this thing is a real gem making for an extremely solid and satisfying listening experience from start to finish.\r\n\r\nIts great that Chris Connelly is still writing and recording music, its even better that not only hasnt he lost the magic, but his magic has grown stronger than ever with Artificial Madness which is one of the surprise best albums of 2011 and required listening for any music fan with at even a modicum of good taste.\r\n\r\n- The Punk Vault\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------","options":[{"id":25519533,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/79511925/-/B_172-Chris_Connelly-Artificial_Madness-LP-Front.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/79511925/-/B_172-Chris_Connelly-Artificial_Madness-LP-Front.jpg","width":364,"height":364}],"artists":[{"id":153867,"name":"Chris Connelly","permalink":"chris-connelly","url":"/artist/chris-connelly"}],"categories":[{"id":1754931,"name":"Records","permalink":"records","url":"/category/records"}]},{"id":9586513,"name":"Peter Sotos \"Tool\" Book (Nine-Banded Books)","permalink":"peter-sotos-tool-book-nine-banded-books","position":16,"price":12.99,"default_price":12.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/peter-sotos-tool-book-nine-banded-books","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-22T00:51:15.000Z","description":"Peter Sotos\r\n\r\n\"Tool\"\r\n\r\nIncludes new essay: \"Mine/Kept\"\r\n\r\nPublisher: Nine-Banded Books\r\n\r\nRelease date: February, 2013\r\n\r\nSoftcover (\"gatefold\" cover with inner flaps)\r\n4.5 x 7\r\n146 pp\r\nISBN: 1616583495\r\n\r\nIn 1985, Peter Sotos was arrested. He was charged with obscenity for publishing a magazine and was later convicted for possession of child pornography. After his trial, he kept a low profile. He worked for a meat distribution company and struggled to pay down his legal bills. He underwent mandatory counseling. Then, in the late 1980s, he began writing a manuscript that, once published, would signal the mature arrival of one of the most disquieting and original voices in English literature. That manuscript was called Tool.\r\n\r\nOpening with an excruciating set piece inspired by the crimes of Ian Brady, Tool unfolds through a sequence of vivid metafictional narratives that rain hard light on the blackest recesses of a Sadean abyss, limning a ferocious tableau vivant thronged with victims and whores and jaded cops, with grief-stricken mothers, writhing AIDS casualties, and abased gloryhole habitués. In one deeply resonant chapter, Sotos renders a coruscating account of his fateful arrest and interrogation.\r\n\r\nWritten in lean, exacting prose, Tool stands as a deftly structured, pornographically sifted psycho-literary inquest, a pneumatic masterpiece marked by preternatural acumen, stark verisimilitude, and implacable emotive gravity. Originally published by Jim Goad in the 1996 omnibus, Total Abuse, the text has since appeared in the Creation Books collection, Proxy. This is the first stand-alone edition. It is presented with a publisher’s introduction and a new closing essay (Mine/Kept) by Peter Sotos.\r\n\r\nPeter Sotos is one of those rare writers who can say, 'The words I write are me,' or at least as close as anyone can come to communicating who they are in words.\r\n--Thomas Ligotti\r\n\r\nWe do not find in Sotos the customary delusions about childhood misery and wounded lives. For this latter-day homo sacer, wounds are not to be healed but poked and worried until they bleed. Sotos is literature's outcast, carrying stigma like a rat carries plague.\r\n--Mikita Brottman, author of Thirteen Girls\r\n\r\nI don't think Peter Sotos' work needs to be upgraded or explicated by anyone, me included, and I think its inability to present the details and factors and signals that would facilitate an argument for its value as literature is one of the reasons it's among the most important writing being done today. It is scary, intense, ugly, honest, original, problematic, profoundly challenging stuff. It's also highly intelligent, refined, and kind of a masterful example of writing at its most rendered and self-investigating, all the more so because its art refuses to give an inch to readers who need something conventionally beautiful, however offbeat and subtle that beauty, to justify a book's assault.\r\n--Dennis Cooper\r\n","options":[{"id":29988457,"name":"Default","price":12.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94200643/-/PS-Tool.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94200643/-/PS-Tool.jpg","width":244,"height":380}],"artists":[{"id":50683,"name":"Peter Sotos","permalink":"peter-sotos","url":"/artist/peter-sotos"}],"categories":[{"id":1824265,"name":"Books + Zines","permalink":"books-+-zines","url":"/category/books-+-zines"},{"id":1755073,"name":"Distributed Titles","permalink":"distributed-titles","url":"/category/distributed-titles"}]},{"id":9173042,"name":"AOH3 Anatomy Of Habit \"Anatomy Of Habit\" CD","permalink":"aoh3-anatomy-of-habit-anatomy-of-habit-cd","position":17,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/aoh3-anatomy-of-habit-anatomy-of-habit-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-28T00:51:52.000Z","description":"AOH3\r\nAnatomy Of Habit\r\n\"Anatomy Of Habit\"\r\nCD\r\n\r\nRelease date: January 2013\r\n\r\nFour-song compact disc compilation of Anatomy Of Habit LP and EP\r\n\r\nHoused in a six-panel digipak designed by Jonathan Canady/Malsonus (malsonus.com)\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n1. \"After The Water\" (7:24)\r\n2. \"Overcome\" (16:50) \r\n3. \"The Decade Plan\" (11:17)\r\n4. \"Torch\" (17:14)\r\n\r\nStream in full here:\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"150\" height=\"450\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 150px; height: 450px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1889822573/size=tall2/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=d72523/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"http://anatomyofhabit.bandcamp.com/album/anatomy-of-habit-cd\">Anatomy of Habit (CD) by Anatomy of Habit</a></iframe>\r\n","options":[{"id":28725026,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90137738/-/AOH3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90137738/-/AOH3.jpg","width":900,"height":900}],"artists":[{"id":49153,"name":"Anatomy of Habit","permalink":"anatomy-of-habit","url":"/artist/anatomy-of-habit"}],"categories":[{"id":1754881,"name":"Compact Discs","permalink":"compact-discs","url":"/category/compact-discs"},{"id":1755073,"name":"Distributed Titles","permalink":"distributed-titles","url":"/category/distributed-titles"}]},{"id":6587181,"name":"AOH2 Anatomy of Habit \"Anatomy of Habit\" EP","permalink":"aoh2-anatomy-of-habit-anatomy-of-habit-ep","position":18,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/aoh2-anatomy-of-habit-anatomy-of-habit-ep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-01T04:09:41.000Z","description":"[INCLUDES LINK FOR DOWNLOAD VIA BANDCAMP]\r\n\r\nThe new 12-inch EP from Anatomy of Habit\r\n\r\nA: “After The Water” (7:24)\r\nB: “The Decade Plan” (11:17)\r\n\r\nAnatomy of Habit is pleased to announce the follow up to their well-received, self-titled LP of 2011, which made many “best of” lists in the heavy metal and alternative music communities. Working hard in the live arena, the band has continued to present new songs and to build and diversify their audience, playing with a wide range of artists including Scratch Acid, Iceage, Secret Chiefs Three, Russian Circles, Yob, Martial Canterel and Pelican, among many others.\r\n\r\nTheir new EP contains two “shorter” pieces, by Anatomy of Habit standards, at least, titled “After The Water” and “The Decade Plan.” Both tracks continue in the band’s often-praised and characteristic melding of power, heaviness, and delicacy, while exploring new sonic textures and composition. Novel to this record is the inclusion of grand piano and string synthesizer, which blend in with the group’s increasingly well known drum and percussion rig coupling, and their melodic and swelling bass and hypnotically looping and caustic guitar parts.\r\n\r\nThe new songs were recorded by John McEntire at Soma Electronic Music Studios in Chicago. McEntire is well known as both a recording engineer and as the drummer in the band Tortoise, and his expertise and dexterity in the studio helped the band fully realize their vision for this release. The record was mastered and the lacquers were cut by Bob Weston at Chicago Mastering Service. Weston, who correspondingly worked on Anatomy of Habit’s first record, is also well known as the bassist in the band Shellac.\r\n\r\nThe two-part sleeve, which includes the group’s “five nails” logo as a die-cut, follows the design format of their first record, but it also adds a sense of color and heightened beauty that is meant to echo the tone of the new songs. The striking design was once again executed by Jonathan Canady. To further solidify the concept for this release and to distinguish it from its precursor, the records were pressed in white vinyl.\r\n\r\nBlake Edwards (percussion), Dylan Posa (drums), Kenny Rasmussen (bass, piano, synthesizer), Greg Ratajczak (guitar), Mark Solotroff (vocals) ","options":[{"id":20955571,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64696093/-/AOH2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64696093/-/AOH2.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":49153,"name":"Anatomy of Habit","permalink":"anatomy-of-habit","url":"/artist/anatomy-of-habit"}],"categories":[{"id":1754931,"name":"Records","permalink":"records","url":"/category/records"},{"id":1755073,"name":"Distributed Titles","permalink":"distributed-titles","url":"/category/distributed-titles"}]},{"id":4499755,"name":"AOH1 Anatomy of Habit \"Anatomy of Habit\" LP","permalink":"anatomy-of-habit-anatomy-of-habit-lp","position":19,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/anatomy-of-habit-anatomy-of-habit-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-09-24T13:41:03.000Z","description":"[INCLUDES LINK FOR DOWNLOAD VIA BANDCAMP]\r\n\r\nThe long awaited first LP from Anatomy of Habit!\r\n\r\nThe stunning LP package was designed by Jonathan Canady/Malsonus, with a black and white die-cut sleeve (the \"five nails\" logo represents the die-cut) that holds a metallic silver and black heavyweight Euro-style innersleeve.

With less than 20 intense shows under their collective belt since their mid-2009 debut, Anatomy of Habit recently finished work on their first recordings, working with Andrew Ragin of The Atlas Moth at Phase Recording Studios. The band mastered the mini-LP in late-June 2011, with Bob Weston of Shellac, at Chicago Mastering Service. After their initial outings, people have mentioned diverse groups, including Joy Division, Swans, Einsturzende Neubauten, Killing Joke, Unsane, Bauhaus, My Bloody Valentine, Black Sabbath, The Cure, Jesu, The Sisters of Mercy, Death in June, and even The Doors, when attempting to describe the band. Part post-punk, part death-rock, part early-industrial, part noise-rock, part shoegazer, and part full-on doom-metal, this list of bands at least begins to describe where the powerful five-piece group might be coming from.","options":[{"id":14746049,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/44063611/-/AoH_LP_Comp_FullSize.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/44063611/-/AoH_LP_Comp_FullSize.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":49153,"name":"Anatomy of Habit","permalink":"anatomy-of-habit","url":"/artist/anatomy-of-habit"},{"id":49149,"name":"Mark Solotroff","permalink":"mark-solotroff","url":"/artist/mark-solotroff"}],"categories":[{"id":1754931,"name":"Records","permalink":"records","url":"/category/records"},{"id":1755073,"name":"Distributed Titles","permalink":"distributed-titles","url":"/category/distributed-titles"}]},{"id":3003905,"name":"BLOODYMINDED \"PHASES : THREE\" 3x7-inch Box Set (Rococo Records)","permalink":"bloodyminded-phases-three-box-set-rococo-records","position":20,"price":14.99,"default_price":14.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bloodyminded-phases-three-box-set-rococo-records","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-12-09T21:34:38.000Z","description":"Box set includes three (3) white vinyl 7-inch singles in individual silkscreened sleeves, double-sided 7\" x 7\" inset, edition number slip, housed in custom made lidded boxes.\r\n\r\nEdition of 300\r\n\r\nI know what you are thinking, “What is this thing?” Or maybe, “Why does it exist?” Why does such a beautifully packaged triple white vinyl 7-inch set, housed in individual silkscreened sleeves and custom-made boxes, and containing some of the rawest BLOODYMINDED tracks ever captured on tape, or MiniDisc, in this case, even fucking exist? And lord knows, there are a few preceding raw BLOODYMINDED live recordings, that much is certain. And why are these four basement bruises bookended by such seemingly high-fidelity studio fuckery? Well, let’s talk about it, for a minute. The band went out on tour in August 2006, in support of our “Magnetism” CD, along with some friends: Demons, Graveyards (sometimes Burning when C. Spencer Yeh would appear), and Lambsbread. Each night, we played four songs off of the then-still-new album. Those would be the middle four cuts that appear here. The strange thing about those “Magnetism” tracks (and boy, did they ultimately prove to be ultra-magnetic the night in question, but who knew?), unlike most core BLOODYMINDED songs, is that they have no discernable lyrics, per se, so that always leaves a lot of room for vocal improvisation… or a bunch of screaming, moaning, shrieking, and whatnot. In this particular case, these four works of art were recorded live on August 8, 2006, at Spooky Action Palace, in Saint Louis, Missouri. We had played there before and we were as comfortable as you can get in the humid basement of a house in a Midwestern town, during a tour that saw 100-degree temperatures pretty much every day. That particular night was special, as BLOODYMINDED, which has members scattered not just around the country, but across the globe, had a pretty extraordinary line-up. Über-fan Nicole Chambers had been brought into the fold to play synth and to handle the live mix for that tour. Xavier Laradji flew in from Toulouse, France, to play synth, to add some Froggy vocals, and to take in as much Americana as he could that summer. Isidro Reyes, who could not go with us on that tour due to “other commitments,” made the marathon there-and-back drive from Chicago to Saint Louis, just for this one god damned show. Pieter Schoolwerth was on loan from New York, specifically to break synths, to snap microphone cables, and to keep things as lively as possible. And me, Mark Solotroff, I drove the car, I screamed, moaned, shrieked, sweated, etc. Weird, indeed. Three guys who are among my very closest friends and brothers, and one chillingly silent girl, putting on some mileage and attempting to stir things up, night after night (except Isidro on all but this one night. Damn.). Again, why did this thing get made? Why these songs? Because, it is absolutely the most pure example of how out of control this thing could get, given all of the right/wrong circumstances: a heat-wave; vintage analog synthesizers getting beat to hell on a nightly basis; non-existent PA systems; wound-up audiences of various sizes; blood, sweat, and maybe some tears. And basements. Basements do make a difference. So, what about the first and the last track? Well, following the pattern set with the “PHASES : ONE” cassette and the “PHASES : TWO” CD – and I do love patterns, of course – the “PHASES : THREE” parts seek to offer a different process, whereby songs, audience outbreaks, and incidental moments during a show, find their way into a disorienting mixture of sound and texture, blended up and damaged, as if run through an audio In-Sink-Erator, and then get lovingly re-assembled for maximum fidelity (almost). And why “Magnetism,” why these song titles, and why the moon imagery? I have answered that before. My mom – and – it all really happened. Do we learn? Apparently not. For the record, lest you think that this is some sort of low-fidelity mess more suited for a vomit-encrusted cassette tape, the studio processing on \"PHASES : THREE (PART ONE)\" and \"PHASES : THREE (PART TWO)\" and pre-production for all six songs was completed at Conservatory, Chicago, Illinois, September 2007, and mastering was skillfully completed by Salvatore Dellaria at Eightysevenwest Recording, Chicago, Illinois, September 2007. Trust me, crank it up and you will feel like you are in that basement at that show.

Surprisingly released little more than a year after their previous full-length, \"Gift Givers\" [B!045, 2005], this album demonstrated a disturbingly updated approach to the band’s sound.  It is comprised of fifteen feedback-drenched tracks -- ten of which are relatively full-length songs and five of which are the band’s trademark blast songs, although track length lines may be a bit blurred in the greater context of the album.  Some listeners might equate the sound of \"Magnetism\" to the band’s often urgent and turbulent live sound -- certainly more so now, as the group has focused on several of these songs in the live setting over the past four years.  This album features much more abstract, eccentric, and guttural vocals, which encompass screaming, howling, yelling, moaning, etc., and without a doubt, it strongly divided listener opinion.  \"Magnetism\" ultimately became the foundation for a suite of related work, and it was followed by the \"PHASES : ONE\" cassette [B!063, 2006], the \"PHASES : TWO\" CD [B!074, 2007], and the \"PHASES : THREE\" triple 7-inch box set on Rococo Records [2009].  The final chapter in this obsessive, lunar-themed grouping, the \"PHASES : FOUR\" 12-inch, is recorded and mastered and is now awaiting release.  As with \"Gift Givers,\" \"Magnetism\" was co-produced by Brian Joseph Gaynor and Mark Solotroff, this time utilizing a new studio, Slang Musicgroup, which was primarily known for prominent Chicago hip-hop and house music recordings.  Megan Emish, ex-founding band member, and ongoing designer, created the handsome Digipaks that house the discs.

The recording took place during a late night session at WLUW on Loyola University’s campus for Phil von Zweck’s “Something Else” radio show on November 29th, 2009.\r\n\r\nThe group created these six tracks live using guitar, bass, synthesizers, and vocals. The live recordings were then processed in Milan, Italy by P.NG5361.B. The group uses these instruments to create burned out industrial drones made up of looped feedback, percussion throbs and the sounds of machines dying. Hypnotizing repeating layers tactfully shift into blasts of angular high-pitched mechanical frenzy. There are implicit melodies in the chaos. Strong material from this unique collaboration.\r\n\r\nFrom ninehertz.co.uk\r\n\r\nWhat is on offer is an alternating cauldron of subtle, soft drones and field recordings of machines whirring and what sounds like trains pulling into stations as well as more conventional feedback workouts. The effects sometimes blur into nothingness, only to come back and haunt with ghosts of echoes being replayed and sounds lurch towards you like gap-toothed tramps in the city.\r\n\r\nIt's both mysterious and overwhelming at the same time and you can feel there is a hell of a lot of collaborative energy being pooled here, nothing strikes it's own path, it buzzes together like a cloud of flies. More going on than you first suspect, it's not an easy listen, but you should probably give it a go. \r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"150\" height=\"450\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 150px; height: 450px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=314965662/size=tall2/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=e01014/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"http://thefortiethday.bandcamp.com/album/the-fortieth-day-sshe-retina-stimulants-terence-hannum\">The Fortieth Day/Sshe Retina Stimulants/Terence Hannum by The Fortieth Day</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":19016603,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58336743/-/LOD27-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58336743/-/LOD27-1.jpg","width":185,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58336751/-/LOD27-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58336751/-/LOD27-2.jpg","width":300,"height":192},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58336759/-/LOD27-3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58336759/-/LOD27-3.jpg","width":300,"height":225}],"artists":[{"id":49151,"name":"The Fortieth Day","permalink":"the-fortieth-day","url":"/artist/the-fortieth-day"},{"id":56542,"name":"Terence Hannum","permalink":"terence-hannum","url":"/artist/terence-hannum"},{"id":49669,"name":"Isidro Reyes","permalink":"isidro-reyes","url":"/artist/isidro-reyes"},{"id":49149,"name":"Mark Solotroff","permalink":"mark-solotroff","url":"/artist/mark-solotroff"},{"id":49165,"name":"Sshe Retina Stimulants","permalink":"sshe-retina-stimulants","url":"/artist/sshe-retina-stimulants"}],"categories":[{"id":1754883,"name":"Cassettes","permalink":"cassettes","url":"/category/cassettes"},{"id":1755073,"name":"Distributed Titles","permalink":"distributed-titles","url":"/category/distributed-titles"}]},{"id":6766373,"name":"B!171 Sun Splitter \"III\" LP","permalink":"b-171-sun-splitter-iii-lp","position":25,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/b-171-sun-splitter-iii-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-23T02:08:33.000Z","description":"Catalog Number: B!171\r\nArtist: Sun Splitter\r\nTitle: \"III\"\r\nFormat: LP, White vinyl; Edition of 500\r\n\r\nIncludes download code for digital files hosted by Bandcamp.\r\n\r\n(STREAM BELOW)\r\n\r\nChicago-based Sun Splitter has created a monolithic hybrid of doom, industrial-metal, drone and noise with this new 50-minute, five-song collection for BloodLust!\r\n\r\nThis LP is closest in style to the ancient \"Thanatos Descends\" CD (B!013, 1996) by Dead World, and fits very nicely in the heavy Chicago scene with Anatomy of Habit, Rabid Rabbit, Arriver, The Atlas Moth, Pelican The Swan King, Oyarsa, Russian Circles, Locrian, Indian, Beak, etc.\r\n\r\nThe heavy drum machine-driven foundation, dark electronics, layers of distorted-yet-melodic guitars, and echoed-out vocals will appeal to fans of doom, sludge, psychedelic, experimental noise and forward thinking metal groups such as Jesu, Neurosis, Nadja, The Human Quena Orchestra, Godflesh, Halo, (early) Pitchshifter, Sonic Violence, (early) Scorn, Dead Times, Floor, etc.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\nA1: \"Eye Of Jupiter\" (5:46) \t\r\nA2: \"Parasitic Machine\" (10:54) \t\r\nA3: \"\tThe Serpent's Golden Death\" (7:12) \t\r\nB1: \"\tInto The Broken Lands\" (7:56) \t\r\nB2: \"\tTwo Cold Oceans\" (16:00) \t\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nRecorded by Matt Talbott at Great Western Record Recorders during a blizzard in January 2011.

Essak, Francis C. Hays \r\n\r\nReviews:\r\n\r\nAnti-Gravity Bunny:\r\n\r\nHow these Chicago dudes aren’t as well known as Locrian is beyond me. Sun Splitter have just as must genre blending as Locrian, just a different blend. They’ve got this incredible black industrial psych doom thing with some dark ambient noise/drone and even a little HANL style gloomgaze tossed in. I think III is their first vinyl (limited to 500, white, sexy, etc) and it’s monolithic & pure fucking evil. Seriously, this is just monstrous in every way. The riffs are skull crushing, a wall of reverb and distortion sounding like napalm melting your core, drum machines hitting harder than any human could, explosive blasts that level cities, with an abusive assault of rapid-fire fury for the second half of “The Serpent’s Golden Death” where the individual hits coalesce into a waterfall of insanity, static vocals that roar their way to the surface, guitars that chug & rattle, at home only in Hell’s scorched valley, crusted under the black sun. These guys get in a groove and don’t let up until they’ve reached total devastation, the drum machine locked in a loop, sealing their fate as endless riff demons. If you need some fucking heavy in your life, this is where you should be looking. This is the fucking best and most original metal. And with killer artwork by band member Anthony A. Dunn, you would be doing yourself a major disservice by passing this up.\r\n\r\nCVLT Nation:\r\n\r\nI’m covered in sun right now, but my whole world is a bright grey, because I’m blasting the new Sun Splitter record entitled III, out now on BloodLust. To say that I’m excited about this album would really fucking be an understatement! Sun Splitter have created a record that will be spun at least twice a week for the rest of my existence on this planet. This collection of songs will open doors in your imagination that you didn’t know existed. Play their track “The Serpent’s Golden Death” and you will hear pounding dirge that will pick you up off the earth and have you looking into the eyes of your eternal madness. The thing that is so radical about the way this band writes songs is that they are able to bury harsh noise in a beautiful grave where deranged sonic flowers grow. Sun Splitter are the perfect balance between ancient organic sounds and machine-like audio rain that crashes against your skull. It’s not about what you are hearing on the surface – this band’s magic is hidden under layers of ethereal feedback and aggressive distortion. They are brilliant at conjuring up whirlpools of cryptic rhythm. They weave melody into their own tapestry of angst that I want to cloth myself in. The closing track, “Two Cold Oceans,” is a 16-minute-long stellar example of how this band manifests magic. The riff in this tune is catchy as fuck, but it’s the way that the song melts into a lake of moving noise that keeps your attention. I really don’t care what kind of music you are into, Sun Splitter should be heard, and when you are done, tell a friend so that they can share the knowledge of this killer band! Even this review can’t speak to the heights that Sun Splitter can take you – on the real, they are my brand new high.\r\n\r\nHammer Smashed Sound:\r\n\r\nLet it be said that Chicago's Sun Splitter is a really good band. And as really good bands do, they have continued to evolve and grow their sound as time has passed. A relatively young band whose first releases came out just last year,  it's still clear that they have worked hard to define their sound and enhance their songwriting. 2011's 7\" split with Bridesmaid and the II cassette on Land of Decay saw the band emerge with a heavy industrial-metal sound that was familiar but not easily traced back to any one influence or sound in particular. The band's new LP, out now on Mark Solotroff's BloodLust! label, sees Sun Splitter continuing with that same sound, yet taking it in a darker, heavier, and harsher direction.\r\n\r\nThe 5 songs on this LP, which make up almost 50 minutes of music, are blistering, droning, heavy pieces of industrial metal that sound like so much more than just the typical release from that sub-genre. These songs are aggressive yet well-written hymns to darkness and intellectual, psychological violence. Drenched with reverb and droning feedback, the songs are still complex enough and rich in melody. The psychedelic elements can be overwhelming, but they provide a another layer to the band's dense, full sound that is almost kraut-ish at times. The dark sonic bliss that this record dives into is incredibly heavy, and it feels like there is so much going on that III could in fact be in the process of splitting the sun.\r\n\r\nThis is also an album that is likely to grow on you. While that can be said of the band in general, I've found it to be especially true for this record; at first it comes across as good, but not great - but you still want to go back after that first listen because you know there's more to it, more to be found and explored. And that proves to be very true. As I said, it's a more complex record that they've done before, and that really won me over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStream the record:\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"150\" height=\"450\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 150px; height: 450px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=760672044/size=tall2/bgcol=030202/linkcol=9fa1a3/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"http://sun-splitter.bandcamp.com/album/iii\">III by Sun Splitter</a></iframe>\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":21493345,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66436277/-/B_171-Sun_Splitter-III-LP.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66436277/-/B_171-Sun_Splitter-III-LP.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[{"id":52237,"name":"Sun Splitter","permalink":"sun-splitter","url":"/artist/sun-splitter"}],"categories":[{"id":1754931,"name":"Records","permalink":"records","url":"/category/records"}]},{"id":5697337,"name":"B!170 Arriver \"Tsushima\" LP","permalink":"b-170-arriver-tsushima-lp","position":26,"price":16.0,"default_price":16.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/b-170-arriver-tsushima-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-03-15T03:20:47.000Z","description":"Artist: Arriver\r\nTitle: \"Tsushima\"\r\nFormat: 150 gram black vinyl LP housed in a seven-color silk-screened gatefold sleeve with color insert and dropcard\r\nCatalog Number: B!170\r\nGenre: Progressive Metal / Thrash / Technical Death Metal / Doom\r\n\r\nIn 1904 the Japanese and Russian navies met in the Sea of Japan. This was the climax of the Russo-Japanese War, but only one point in the Japan's march to become the most dominant military force in Asia. Barely 50 years prior, Japan had been a feudal, agrarian society, willfully isolated from the encroaching world. Now it had provoked one of the world's largest, if out-dated, navies to circumnavigate Europe, Africa and Southeast Asia to do battle. A year's journey ended 12 hours after the Japanese spotted the Russians. The Russian Navy was destroyed and 4000 sailors dead. Japan was the uncontested ruler of East Asia. On TSUSHIMA, ARRIVER tells this story.\r\n\r\nVeterans of the Chicago rock scene, ARRIVER has both the chops and versatility to pull off this epic concept album without collapsing under what could be a portentous slog in less capable hands. Deftly weaving myriad influences of Metal's subgenera, as well as rock's more interesting and abrasive edges, TSUSHIMA uses historical narrative as a basis for its diverse song cycle, each composition standing on their own while contributing to the larger story. The stately fanfare of \"Winter Palace War Council\" leads to chaotic grind in both \"Togo, Son of a Samurai\" and \"Dogger Bank\". \"Around the Cape\" builds over a churning, massive riff while the relentless precision \"Dark Clouds Above the Fleet\" relates the abject misery of life at sea. \"Singapore\" pays tribute to the Russians' successful journey around the globe followed by the equally ambitious, if darker, \"Tsushima: Trilogy\". Finally, the unabating \"Quadrogy\" serves as a fitting epilogue.\r\n\r\nARRIVER has employed narrative in their previous releases: the debut album Vanlandingham and Zone (2006) created a mythology based on randomly generated text from voice recognition software, the Simon Mann EP (2009) retold the true-life story of an ex-mercenary's failed coup attempt in Equatorial Guinea, and Center Down (2010, 7\" split w/ Chicago comrades The Swan King) tells the story of Nantucket Whalers cast adrift in the Pacific, forced to cannibalism in order to survive. Despite the carnage and crushing defeat, Russian Admiral Rozhestvensky became a hero to the people and the gestating revolution--a man who put his duty and honor first. His survival became an act of defiance in the face of the Czar's arrogant, bloated aristocracy. The improbable journey of the Russian fleet was a victory unto itself and is the main driving force of TSUSHIMA.\r\n\r\nTSUSHIMA is available from BloodLust! on March 13 on 12-inch vinyl (with incredible packaging designed and screen-printed by Crosshair and featuring an illustration by acclaimed artist Tom Sciloi) and digital download.\r\n\r\nDan MacAdam- Guitar & Vocals\r\nRob Sullivan- Bass & Vocals\r\nDan Sullivan- Guitar & Vocals\r\nJoe Kaplan- Drums\r\n\r\nARRIVER formed in summer 2004 in Chicago, Illinois, by Dan Sullivan (guitar) and Rob Sullivan (bass) (both ex-contributors to Songs: OHIA and Magnolia Electric Co.), and Dan MacAdam (guitar/ ex-Viza Noir). Over time, they honed a sound that seamlessly blends classic and modern strains of rock, metal, and prog into a uniquely vicious hybrid. With the amicable departure of Bill Murphy, ARRIVER brought in long time comrade-in-rock Joe Kaplan (ex-Viza Noir) to drum. With Joe, ARRIVER began pushing tempos and time more aggressively. Vocals evolved to match and what has emerged is a decidedly harder sound. ARRIVER shows confidence in their craft and willingness to bulldoze sub-genres of metal and hardcore.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Dan Sullivan also plays guitar in Rabid Rabbit, whose newest LP, \"Czarny Sen\" (B!169), was released on BloodLust! in late 2011.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\nA1:Winter Palace War Council (4:29)\r\nA2: Togo: Son of Samurai (4:01)\r\nA3: Dogger Bank (1:56)\r\nA4: Around the Cape (5:05)\r\nA5: Dark Clouds Above the Fleet (1:39)\r\nB1: Singapore (6:22)\r\nB2: Tsushima Trilogy (10:32)\r\nB3: Quadrogy (6:48)\r\n\r\n\r\nLinks:\r\nhttp://www.arriverchicago.com/\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/ARRIVER/199232604256\r\nhttp://www.myspace.com/arriver\r\n\r\nFull artwork/layout visible here:\r\nhttp://www.arriverchicago.com/ARRIVER-TSUSHIMA.pdf\r\n\r\n<object height=\"245\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1601602&amp;show_comments=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_playcount=false&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;color=273033\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"245\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1601602&amp;show_comments=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_playcount=false&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;color=273033\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>   <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/arriver/sets/tsushima\">Tsushima</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/arriver\">ARRIVER</a></span>","options":[{"id":18297309,"name":"Default","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55927807/-/Arriver_-_Tsushima_-_LP_-_front.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55927807/-/Arriver_-_Tsushima_-_LP_-_front.jpg","width":480,"height":451}],"artists":[{"id":111135,"name":"Arriver","permalink":"arriver","url":"/artist/arriver"}],"categories":[{"id":1754931,"name":"Records","permalink":"records","url":"/category/records"}]},{"id":5063021,"name":"B!169 Rabid Rabbit \"Czarny Sen\" LP - LIMITED EDITION","permalink":"b-169-rabid-rabbit-czarny-sen-lp-limited-edition","position":27,"price":17.0,"default_price":17.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/b-169-rabid-rabbit-czarny-sen-lp-limited-edition","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-12-12T17:21:32.000Z","description":"OUT NOW!\r\n\r\nSpecial edition version: Black vinyl records are housed in heavyweight metallic silver on white pro-printed LP jackets, with silkscreened tar-paper outer wraps, sealed with red wax \"RR\"s, Limited to 100 copies.\r\n\r\n\"Czarny Sen (BloodLust!), the second full-length from local quartet Rabid Rabbit, has been long awaited around these parts—Reader music editor Philip Montoro wrote back in August about how great the album is.

With this record, Ryan Oppermann -- A.K.A. The Rotbrain -- who also records under the names Fabrico Incubo, Klinikal Skum, Narcoleptic Ward, Neuntöter Der Plage, Post-Mortem Junkie, and Xombie -- has raised the Redrot moniker to a heightened level of savage necro-nihilism.  As with the aforementioned single, \"Psycho Bondage\" straddles a hazy line between death-industrial, power-electronics, crust/sludge, and a more ferocious take on minimal synth.  Early industrial culture echoes strongly throughout the album, yet Oppermann evolves a new sonic architecture over the lineage that he has previously traced, from S.P.K. - to Nekrophile Rekords - to Brighter Death Now and the early Cold Meat Industry acts - and to Atrax Morgue and the core Slaughter Productions roster.  On this album, the more passive, eerie menace that he has previously traded in is further left to his other incarnations, allowing Oppermann to focus on a bass-heavy amalgamation of vicious power and pure, seething aggression.

Solotroff is also known as the vocalist in the doom/shoegaze band Anatomy of Habit. In The Fortieth Day, Reyes and Solotroff utilize guitar, bass, drum machine, and analog synthesizer to create epic, blackened, psychedelic-industrial drone soundscapes, likened to \"sustained, withering blasts of high-pitched noise that are as distinct from one another as spotlights sweeping across the night sky; jackhammer clatter, jet-engine whines, and forlorn keyboard melodies dart in and out of those huge sounds with the grace and impunity of plovers picking a crocodile's teeth\" [Bill Meyer, Chicago Reader]\r\n\r\nThe latest release from The Fortieth Day builds upon the evolution of their expansive two disc set, \"Constantinople: 746 AD,\" further demonstrating the shift of post-production responsibilities from Mark Solotroff to Isidro Reyes.   On \"Tenochtitlan: 1520 AD,\" Reyes has decided to shift his editing focus to create shorter songs -- by the band's standards, at least.  While the end result is a cohesive set of six densely populated songs, each built from numerous recording sessions over a one year period, the presentation of multiple tracks gives the listener a greater variety of tones, beats, patterns and frequencies to work with.  While the signature sound of The Fortieth Day is unmistakeable here, one might detect the effect of repeated listens to the group's recent collaboration with Sshe Retina Stimulants and Locrian's Terence Hannum, at least as far as album structure and track sequencing goes.\r\n\r\nThese are professionally duplicated CDs, with single panel, double-sided inserts, featuring black and white artwork; in jewel boxes with shrinkwrap; released in 2013.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n1.

They have played shows with Anatomy of Habit, BLOODYMINDED, and me (Mark Solotroff) solo, and now I am pleased to stock their new split single.\r\n\r\nBridesmaid / Sun Splitter – Bridesmaid / Sun Splitter \r\n\r\n7-Inch\r\nLabel: Bastard Sloth Records\r\nCatalog number: BS004 \r\n\r\nIncludes a bonus small silk-screened black on white/natural cloth Sun Splitter patch\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\nA: Bridesmaid \"Vilkin' It For All It's Worth\" \t\t\r\nB: Sun Splitter \"Plum Blossom\"\r\n\r\nBridesmaid side \"Engineered by Andrew Rahman and mixed by Cory Barnt with loving guidance from Brian Simakis of Capital City Studjoe.

Their half here stands up proudly with that tape, which is no easy feat, and the Bridesmaid side is no slouch either.\r\n\r\nBridesmaid, who I was not really familiar with are definitely sailing similar waters to Sun Splitter, but still put their own unique spin on things. \"Vilkin' It For All It's Worth\" is a fully instrumental piece that initially conjures up images of smoke and bong water, with its overdriven bass and garage band drums that are just the right amount of messy. It’s an unrelenting headbanging delight until the final 30 seconds or so, where it just goes full bore into grindcore assault, shattering the comfortable repetition that preceded it violently.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, \"Plum Blossom\" by Sun Splitter is cut from the same cloth as their tape. Opening with a robotic cymbal passage into their wonderfully diverse Sabbath riffs, the track is pure noisy bliss. While the song doesn’t quite transform into as many odd configurations as some of their other songs, it does carefully balance a repeated vocal mantra with big, caveman riffs and more complex guitar notes, dissolving into screams and noise in the middle segment. Subtlety is tossed out the window at the end, when the drum machine is programmed for \"machine gun\" and the guitar is pure death metal.\r\n\r\nPaired together, they both highlight different aspects of the sludgy, post-doom metal scene. The contrast between Bridesmaid's ramshackle drums and Sun Splitter's digital precision is especially noticeable since both are matched with heavy, fuzzed out bass guitars, but neither is better than the other, they're just different: different, but equally badass.\" ","options":[{"id":13677746,"name":"Default","price":4.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/40416392/-/BridesmaidSunSplitter.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/40416392/-/BridesmaidSunSplitter.jpg","width":320,"height":320},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/40416552/-/SunSplitter-Bridesmaid2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/40416552/-/SunSplitter-Bridesmaid2.jpg","width":320,"height":157}],"artists":[{"id":74286,"name":"Bridesmaid","permalink":"bridesmaid","url":"/artist/bridesmaid"},{"id":52237,"name":"Sun Splitter","permalink":"sun-splitter","url":"/artist/sun-splitter"}],"categories":[{"id":1754931,"name":"Records","permalink":"records","url":"/category/records"}]},{"id":3910038,"name":"Bee Mask v.

Envenomist split | 12” edition of 400, 2011\r\n\r\nThe final installment in the ASR “Versus” split series brings together two of my personal favorite artists for the first 12” vinyl release from A Soundesign. Side A finds Philadelphia sound artist (and Cleveland export) Chris Madak crafting a rich and versatile interlacing culled from seven years worth of electro-acoustic recordings. “In the Mise en Abîme” is a Bee Mask masterwork composed from the same sessions that produced the “Canzoni dal Laboratorio del Silenzio Cosmico” LP released on Spectrum Spools earlier this year. Side B bestows three deeply pensive pieces on the listener by Columbus synth auteur David Reed (Luasa Raelon / Brittle Foundries / Nightmares). Envenomist consistently produces a lush mixture of contemplation and distress evoking Abstract Expressionism and industrial decay. The artwork is a simplistic and ethereal delight designed by Chicago artist Daniel G. Baird. Included within the package is a fragment of metallized polyethylene terephthalate formed into a topographical land map. The listener is encouraged to manipulate the form as a tactile exercise adding to the synesthetic experience of the record.

CD from 2010, released by the might UK label At War With False Noise, with whom BloodLust! co-released the Locrian \"Territories\" LP.\r\n\r\nLimited edition of 500 copies.\r\nBlack vinyl.\r\nReleased in 2011.\r\n\r\nThe Guilt Of... is a new and extremely fruitful collaboration between Mike Williams [Eyehategod, Outlaw Order, Arson Anthem] and Ryan McKern [Wolvhammer]. This disc quickly follows their recent split 10-inch with Ivs Primae Noctis [2010, Trips und Träume] and their new split LP with Merzbow [2010, Chrome Peeler]. Williams' last BloodLust! appearance was on the BLOODYMINDED \"Gift Givers\" CD [B!045, 2005], on the track \"Ten Suicides.\" In 2009, Chrome Peeler released a Mike Williams 7-inch that featured Ryan McKern's soundscapes under Williams' spoken passages on the A-side, and a new remix of \"Ten Suicides\" by Mark Solotroff on the B-side. That release seemed to set the stage for the emergence of this new TGO... CD on BloodLust! Also of note is a live collaboration between Williams, McKern, Joey LaCaze [Eyehategod, Outlaw Order], and three members of BLOODYMINDED - James Moy, Isidro Reyes, and Mark Solotroff - who performed at Chicago's Reckless Records as Ten Suicides on June 20, 2010. Thus, the time certainly seemed right to unleash this hard-to-classify new group's music on BloodLust! Equal parts experimental noise, early industrial, sludge-metal, and crust-punk, the six tracks that make up this album hark back to a forgotten point in time, when labels like Relapse, Earache, Roadrunner, and Pathological were releasing weird hybrid records by groups such as Malformed Earthborn, Thorn, Candiru, Techno Animal, Dead World, etc. At the time, it seemed like the worlds of metal, punk, and industrial would forever go on to intermingle and reconfigure in continually evolving new forms - but things did not quite work out that way. Some innovative artists and musicians of the period, such as Williams, continued to keep an open mind and never allowed themselves to be easily pigeonholed. With The Guilt Of..., Williams has the perfect outlet for his singular, dark world view, building upon the narratives created for his metal and punk incarnations, and seen in his groundbreaking book \"Cancer as a Social Activity: Affirmations of World's End\" [Southern Roots Publishing, 2005]. With McKern's instrumental expertise and his own wide range of tastes, Williams has just the right partner with whom he can spew his thought provoking, Manson-obsessed, Burroughsian cut-up writings.\r\n\r\nAWWFN description: Debut full-length from Mike Williams (Eyehategod, Arson Anthem) and Ryan McKern (Wolvhammer). This is very different to Mike's usual output and provides him with the perfect outlet for his singular, dark world view. Early industrial, punk, electro and noise are all references here and are tied together by Williams' distinctive vocal style. This is some very dark stuff and definitely has the feel of Eyehategod even though it's got a totally different sound. Reference points: (early) Skinny Puppy, Throbbing Gristle, Suicide, Head Of David. Equal parts primitive industrial, noise and punk; most certainly their most fully-realized recording to date by some way. \r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n1: \"A Federal Bail To Poverty\" (4:28) \t\r\n2: \"Remorse For The Liar\" (5:03) \t\r\n3: \"Allergic To The Infamous Healer\" (5:35) \t\r\n4: \"Void Of Void Of Regression\" (5:08) \t\r\n5: \"Mechanics Of The Unheard Catalyst\" (4:05)\t\r\n6: \"Words Of The Given Past\" (6:34)\r\n","options":[{"id":13016782,"name":"Default","price":12.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":6.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38119244/-/TGO-LP1.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38119244/-/TGO-LP1.jpeg","width":800,"height":644},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38119252/-/TGO-LP2.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38119252/-/TGO-LP2.jpeg","width":415,"height":350}],"artists":[{"id":49161,"name":"Eyehategod","permalink":"eyehategod","url":"/artist/eyehategod"},{"id":49157,"name":"The Guilt Of...","permalink":"the-guilt-of","url":"/artist/the-guilt-of"},{"id":52305,"name":"Ten Suicides","permalink":"ten-suicides","url":"/artist/ten-suicides"},{"id":49159,"name":"Mike IX Williams","permalink":"mike-ix-williams","url":"/artist/mike-ix-williams"}],"categories":[{"id":1754931,"name":"Records","permalink":"records","url":"/category/records"},{"id":1755073,"name":"Distributed Titles","permalink":"distributed-titles","url":"/category/distributed-titles"}]},{"id":3910122,"name":"Merzbow/The Guilt Of… – Oh Lucy!!!/Tipping Foul Into The Dirt - split LP (Feat.

The title of this zine derives from Mark Solotroff's inimitable lyrics to the song \"Genital Panic\" from the album Gift Givers and seeks to link the zine's process with its subject one of removal and excision.\r\n","options":[{"id":11628930,"name":"Default","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/33529712/-/ablation3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/33529712/-/ablation3.jpg","width":413,"height":550},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/33529728/-/ablation2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/33529728/-/ablation2.jpg","width":413,"height":550},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/33529744/-/ablation1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/33529744/-/ablation1.jpg","width":650,"height":488}],"artists":[{"id":49145,"name":"BLOODYMINDED","permalink":"bloodyminded","url":"/artist/bloodyminded"},{"id":56542,"name":"Terence Hannum","permalink":"terence-hannum","url":"/artist/terence-hannum"},{"id":49147,"name":"Locrian","permalink":"locrian","url":"/artist/locrian"}],"categories":[{"id":1824265,"name":"Books + Zines","permalink":"books-+-zines","url":"/category/books-+-zines"},{"id":1755073,"name":"Distributed Titles","permalink":"distributed-titles","url":"/category/distributed-titles"}]},{"id":3669116,"name":"Locrian \"The Crystal World\" LP","permalink":"locrian-the-crystal-world-lp","position":43,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/locrian-the-crystal-world-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-04-28T15:27:32.000Z","description":"Locrian's follow-up to their critically acclaimed \"Territories\" album.\r\n\r\nReleased on vinyl by Utech Records in 2011 in an edition of 500 copies.\r\n\r\n150g vinyl, heavyweight jacket, and heavy printed inner sleeve.\r\n\r\nLacquers cut at Chicago Audio Mastering, Chicago, IL\r\n\r\nFeatured on numerous music site/blog year-end \"best of\" lists in 2010.\r\n\r\nArtwork by the black ink warlock known as Vberkvlt (AKA Justin Bartlett).\r\n\r\nA marked change had come over the forest, as if dusk had begun to fall. Everywhere the glacé sheaths which enveloped the trees and vegetation had become duller and more opaque. The crystal floor underfoot was occluded and gray, turning the needles into spurs of basalt. The brilliant panoply of colored light had gone, and a dim amber glow moved across the trees, shadowing the sequined floor. At the same time it had become considerably colder.\r\n\r\n\"The Crystal World,\" the third studio album from Locrian, is an epic journey. Titled after JG Ballard’s 1964 novel that tells the story of a physician who specializes in leprosy sent to a remote African outpost to discover a jungle that is slowly crystallizing and encroaching upon everything it touches. Disc one comprises six tracks while disc two consists of one extended piece, \"Extinction,\" that picks up on the intensity of disc one and sustains it for close to an hour. On \"The Crystal World,\" Terence Hannum, and André Foisy, are joined by Steven Hess (Haptic, On, Pan American, Ural Umbo) on percussion and electronics.\r\n\r\nHess’ contribution pushes Locrian deeper into the abyss of despair rendering a sound that is darker, bleaker, and engulfing than any of the group’s previous releases. Locrian continue\r\nthe conceptual trajectory of blackened drone that the group initially embarked on during their first studio album \"Drenched Lands\" (2009). Masters of layering, \"The Crystal World\" finds the group manipulating tones and textures that transport the listener to an apocalyptic wasteland. At times, the layers are serene and somber, at other times they are chaotic.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\nA-1 - Triumph Of Elimination (5:28) \t\r\nA-2 - At Night's End (7:19) \t\r\nA-3 - Pathogens (Instrumental) (11:01)\r\nB-1 - The Crystal World (Instrumental) (5:37) \t\r\nB-2 - Obsidian Facades (7:36) \t\r\nB-3 - Elevations And Depths (10:44)","options":[{"id":12295682,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35687364/-/Locrian-TCW_F.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35687364/-/Locrian-TCW_F.jpg","width":360,"height":360}],"artists":[{"id":49147,"name":"Locrian","permalink":"locrian","url":"/artist/locrian"}],"categories":[{"id":1754931,"name":"Records","permalink":"records","url":"/category/records"},{"id":1755073,"name":"Distributed Titles","permalink":"distributed-titles","url":"/category/distributed-titles"}]},{"id":3557070,"name":"Locrian \"Drenched Lands\" CD","permalink":"locrian-drenched-lands-cd","position":44,"price":10.99,"default_price":10.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/locrian-drenched-lands-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-04-07T04:16:18.000Z","description":"CD version of the LP released on BloodLust! in 2009.

Keeler\r\n\r\nFrom Still Single:\r\nIt looks like a one-man USBM 7”, alright, but the elitist fans of that terminally limited boys club will be giving this one the cold shoulder in no time. Sure, some of those records are pretty challenged when it comes to dynamics, but there’s usually a drum-kit nearby and an egomaniacal cobweb-crotch to sit behind it, who will likely fail at delivering what the chosen genre demands. This … this is a drone record, and not the type of drone that happens when drums are barely played and mixed super-low into the sub-cardboard box realm. Yep, befitting the cover art and, I guess, the band’s logo, it’s a pretty dark strain of drone, but drone nonetheless, especially the A-side’r, “She Walks the Night.” Percussion-less, and with instrumentation of unknown type (probably some kind of keys), the Goth-literate tone is suitably creepy and not at all cheapened by the cheapest chill-tactic of them all: Wilt greets listeners within a few seconds is a public-domain recording of a wolf howling. Thankfully, it only happens once. Assisting the creep-out factor is the regular sound of what could be a woman walking, with heels on, over a concrete floor. Whether or not this is occurring at night is anyone’s guess. Or it could be the sound of someone disassembling and reassembling a rifle……or rummaging through the family’s token “junk” drawer in the kitchen. On the flip we get two more tracks, and both work a lot better than the A-side. It should be mentioned that this is in fact a single-person affair (James P. Keeler), and considering I’ve heard much less and much more mediocre crap credited to full bands, Mr. Keeler deserves the attention of those who gobble up Coil, Current 93, Mortiis, and jailhouse-era Burzum. He is joined by a guest on “Cold Grave,” and I’m going to go out on a limb here and guess that those noises came from a human’s mouth. On “Haunting the Chapel” (if this is the Slayer song, someone needs to win 2010’s Best Deconstructionist award), an ominous bass-line moves the guitar and Wolf Eyes-ish “folding table of noise” along at a crawl, and I’m left patting myself on the back for scrapping the habit of hitting the diggity-dank right before bedtime.

He currently records under his own name and has two other active solo projects, Luasa Raelon and Envenomist. Envenomist is sourced solely using synthesiers to produce dark ambience heavily influenced by Maurizio Bianchi while bringing a lot of Tangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze into the mix. He is also a member of Starlight Fleecing with Larry Marotta and Ryan Jewell. Other activities include playing in the Larry Marotta Group, the Avant Collective, and as part of the Rocco DiPietro Ensemble.\r\n\r\nThe Helix was recorded over the fall and winter of 2007. Using analogue synthesizers as the sound source, the intent was to create a series of transmissions from space. Not in the narrative sense, rather as a series of abstracted visions or moods from a lone traveler attempting to come to grips with the sublime.\r\n\r\nEven the softest hammers make a sound. German scape-makers Tangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze are cited as influence points to David Reed's Envenomist project. On The Helix, long, occasionally pulsating drones cloud all audible space, creating a suffocating dirge of microwave hums and almost-melody. \"Heptadecagon\" is like an apocalypse accordion—one or two notes inhaling and exhaling while humanity is offed. \"Gyres\" is way more suggestive, however. The sound of the Borg's vibrators on high. One in the \"p.\" One in the \"a.\" - Chris Dick, Decibel\r\n\r\nColumbus, Ohio-based David Reed issues material under his own name as well as Luasa Raelon and Envenomist. Under the latter, Reed works exclusively with analogue synthesizers to sculpt dark ambient settings that, at least in the case of The Helix, suggest lonely transmissions emanating from the farthest reaches of space. Tangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze are cited as reference points but the Envenomist sound is darker and rather more terrifying. Recorded over the fall and winter of 2007, The Helix aligns dissonant synthesizer chords burning as if on fire with humongous masses that shimmer and shudder by turn. Imagine the shock and awe the sole surviving member of a space crew might experience as the ship, incapable of returning to earth, travels ever deeper into the cosmos, and you'll have some idea of the sonic character of the five pieces Reed presents on this enhanced CD (also included are artwork by Reed and MP3s of \"Apparition\" and \"Glacial Drift\"). With gargantuan slabs and crushing drones colliding in slow motion, \"Final Frontier\" and \"Bestowal\" are as nightmarish as their titles suggest while \"Gyres,\" broiling and seething like some massive fireball, ratchets the intensity up a notch. All told, The Helix is stupefying, but in a good way. - Textura\r\n\r\nThe coolest thing I can say about Envenomist is that The Helix scares my cats. Every time I started up a track from this album, with its droning bass and screechy overtones, both cats would scurry for the nearest cover, hiding for several minutes until they adjusted to the creepy sounds coming out of my speakers. Envenomist is a full-on synthesizer project from David Nathan Reed, who has done a lot of other dark industrial-style music with a bunch of different names including his own, Starlight Fleecing, Avant Collective and Luasa Raelon. The material on The Helix consists of minimalist, slow-moving, unsettling soundscapes. It's interesting stuff, at least for a little while. Reed makes no attempt to make anything on the album resemble natural instruments, and there's nothing approaching a beat on any of the five tracks. This album is really just a collection of creepy soundscapes, like the soundtrack to some art-house horror film that never existed. The formula is relatively simple: Most tracks start with a low-bass sound and add high overtones that seem to scrape across each other as they pass. Sometimes it's a single tone, but most often several dissonant high sounds clash against each other, coming in slowly and leaving gradually. In the midrange, other sounds come and go, adding more atmosphere as the tracks flow glacially along. This is all very effective at first. The first two tracks, \"The 11th Hour\" and \"Heptadecagon\" use these elements quite well and are sort of fascinating to hear. It's a bit unnerving to hear these sounds push against each other like thick oil or some other viscous fluid. But by the third track, \"Final Frontier\", it's clear that this is the only trick Reed has up his sleeve. Every one of these five soundscapes sounds essentially the same and even after listening to the album many times, listeners will be hard-pressed to identify one track from the next. \"Gyres\" leaves out most of the highest tones, while \"Bestowal\" pumps up the dissonance a bit, but it's not enough to make any one chunk stand out from the next. Essentially The Helix sounds like one big 35-minute experiment in dark sound collages. And the novelty wears off after about 10 to 12 minutes, so either Envenomist intended this as a full-length album piece, or he thought the tracks would stand on its own. Either way, there isn't enough here to keep things interesting for the length of the album, which is too bad because Envenomist has the potential to be something quite exciting. It leaves you wishing David Nathan Reed had changed things up a bit throughout the course of the album. This is possibly the pitfall of having your hand in too many projects at once. You tend to compartmentalize your ideas to the point where the music within one project sounds too similar because you're saving ideas for another project. - Chris Conaton, PopMatters\r\n\r\nHoly shit is this Killer Pimp label kicking our ass. First the recent Dead Letters cd that we made Record Of The Week, then the gorgeous Aidan Baker / Thisquietarmy collaboration, before that there was the A Place To Bury Strangers record, and now this new Envenomist disc! (There are a few others on deck too, to be reviewed soon we hope). Pretty bad ass for a first batch of releases we think. We'd been dying to hear more from Envenomist, who we haven't heard from since we reviewed the Black Bile tape way back in 2007. Sonically very little has changed, extended soundscapes of shimmery metallic buzz over deep low end thrum, layered into softly undulating sonic swells, ominous and haunting and so cinematic. As we most certainly have mentioned before, movie makers should be looking to the underground music scene for truly original, and in the case of Envenomist, truly frightening music for their films. The sounds of Envenomist are noisy, but the noise is blurred and smeared, muted and dulled, a soft noise that is so evocative, of ashen skies, burning wastelands, cold barren landscapes, mysterious otherworlds, lost planets, underground caverns, these sounds are so subtly harrowing and haunting, conjuring a sense of doom, of loneliness, of death and destruction, of sadness and sorrow, the long tones build tension, creating a sense of an impending end, to life, to everything, but while creating this palpable sense of dread, Envenomist manages to create a sound that is also beautiful, perhaps blackly beautiful, but beautiful nonetheless, hypnotic and mesmerizing, mysterious and truly creepy, but again, soothing and meditative, a sort of doom-ic new age perhaps, whatever you call it, it's pretty fantastic, and has been a constant late night listen since we first got it in. And another winner from Killer Pimp... - Aquarius\r\n\r\nDavid Reed is the dark and mangled mind behind Envenomist, and his distinct breed of dark ambient, drone works are absolutely cavernous. This disc is, of course, no different, and the quality of production only deepens the effect. Opening with \"The 11th Hour,\" The Helix starts down and never gets up. Thick and immense swells of tone rise and fall, dispersing into each other deep into the invisible tunnels they inhabit. With a special ear for a certain level of monolithic, prehistoric mammoth soundtracking, Reed draws a cautious line between craftsmanship and noise, always opting to air on the side of mood over movement. These are carefully wrought crevices that are each distinct in their own right. \"Heptadecagon\" creeps outward on its fingers as it finds ears, the quickest route to the brains it feasts on. Overboard animalization? Perhaps, but the feel is there. Elsewhere, as on \"Final Frontier\" and \"Bestowal,\" Reed takes analmost sci-fi approach, which rich swirls of synth comingling in a hum of static. Never one to clutter, Reed's works always pervade a certain spatial conception, but whether its as open a space as explored on \"Bestowal\" or as closed a one as on \"Gyres,\" it is never a welcoming locale. Luckily there are enough creepy and undiscovered insects to keep you occupied until the wolves come. It's a real burner for sure, static in all the right ways and, more than anything, quite simple in its blatant exploration of tonal landscapes.

The withdrawn sounds of a ruined mind, slowly marching towards the imminent end. Is the objective to reintegrate or assimilate? Included here are five treatments involving a decisive pathology of analogue synthesizer and corroded electronic devices, simultaneously subdued and unsettling in their inflicted balance of tone and texture. Patient development leads to gradual debilitation, providing deep results. With a heavy nod to the Slaughter Productions approach to morbid electronics, this is diseased death industrial from Ryan Oppermann (REDROT, NEÜNTOTER DER PLAGE, POST-MORTEM JUNKIE, ETC).\r\n\r\nFrom: http://troa2.blogspot.com/\r\n\r\nKlinikal Skum is one of several solo projects from the prolific Ryan Oppermann, who also works under such monikers as Redrot, Fabrico Incubo, Narcoleptic Ward, Neuntöter Der Plage, Post-Mortem Junkie, and Xombie. A sneak peek listening session in a car, earlier this year, made it clear that this album was going to be 100% up my alley… not that I had any doubts. The “influences” section of the Klinikal Skum MySpace page pretty much spells things out unequivocally: “medical-fetish pornography, dirty nurses, inpatient visits, psychiatric hospitals, the negative aspects of psychiatric treatment, social isolation, sexual frustration, insanity, disease, Maurizio Bianchi, S.P.K., Atrax Morgue, Premature Ejaculation.” These descriptors act like a manifesto for “Chosen Powerless,” but Oppermann’s work is never just the sum of his inspirations. I share the opinion with others whose judgment I trust that among any artists working in the death-industrial field these days, Oppermann is at the head of the class, as regards quality of sound, carefully conceived concepts, execution and delivery, and conviction of purpose. “Chosen Powerless” is an extremely oppressive album filled with sharp, piercing synthesizer work, contrasting rotting electronics, and voice samples that delve into dark territories such as mental health, human social disconnection, and chemical therapy. The sounds on “Chosen Powerless” skillfully give the listener a sense of breathing room, space, and depth, while at the same time never feeling as Spartan as one of the fundamental predecessors in this field, Atrax Morgue. And while a pioneer such as M.B. expressed mental anguish primarily through sound, Oppermann also offers additional clues via carefully selected vocal snippets and uncomfortable imagery. While not as forceful as prime S.P.K., as he leaves that terrain to the more beat-driven and vocally-punishing Redrot, the Australian industrial icons definitely play a part in Oppermann’s evolution, particularly through a shared interest in dissonant electronics and deviant medicine, such as the master and slave relationship between a doctor and a patient. Another sonic point of reference might be the most unhealthy atmospheres created by Brighter Death Now, furthering the point that Oppermann has assimilated the many high-water marks of his true lineage. Labels can of course be limiting, and over the years, Oppermann and his many guises have maintained a rather cult (read KVLT) standing. This is exceedingly dark music that deserves to be seen in a broader context, beyond restrictive subgenres such as death-industrial, dark ambient, power-electronics (where Redrot sometimes fits), and the like, but the depressive nature of Oppermann’s work will likely keep him in a more sub-underground arena.

These two words embody the sonic, visionary, and aesthetic experience that is Chicago's industrial metal duo, PLAGUE BRINGER. Featuring guitarist/drum programmer, Greg Ratajczak and vocalist Josh Rosenthal, PLAGUE BRINGER is an ever-evolving project whose mission to be as progressive as it is aggressive, has garnered comparisons across the 'heavy' music spectrum from TOOL to GODFLESH to PIG DESTROYER. 'Life Songs in a Land of Death', PLAGUE BRINGER's sophomore release and their first for HeWhoCorrupts INC, is the product of over two years of creative fervor, merciless judgment, and obsessive attention to detail both artistically and conceptually. The album satisfies the duo's selfish need to create intelligent, relevant, and personal art which also aims to captivate listeners by drawing them into a ferocious and uncomfortable yet rewarding and uplifting sonic experience. Thematically, the album addresses ideas of self realization through adversity, the death of the impassioned, and the search and discovery of beauty beneath filth. The album was mastered by Scott Hull at Visceral Sound and is the follow up to 2005's acclaimed debut full length, 'As the Ghosts Collect, The Corpses Rest' (Seventh Rule Recordings/Lo Fi Violence). PLAGUE BRINGER formed in December of 2002, shortly after Ratajczak's work at Clava Studios with producer/engineer BRIAN DECK and MODEST MOUSE on \"The Moon and Antarctica\". Ratajczak asked long time friend and artistic collaborator, Rosenthal, to contribute his unique writing style to the project and provide lyrics that when read and reflected upon, unveil deeper layers of meaning to the reader. Ratajczak began the project with and has chosen to continue using the drum machine, which is just as significant to the PLAGUE BRINGER sound, both live and in the studio, as either human member. PLAGUE BRINGER has established a strong presence in the metal underground. Consistent shows throughout the Midwest and several tours to the East coast afforded the group the opportunity to share stages with the likes of BRUTAL TRUTH, PIG DESTROYER, DEICIDE, the BLACK DAHLIA MURDER, KHANATE, the RED CHORD, and RUSSIAN CIRCLES.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n1.

Probably better described as mechanized death metal than frenetic grindcore, the riffs are fat, the blasting sadistic, and the screeching of Josh Rosenthal (accented with the death growls of, I would assume, guitarist/programmer Greg Ratajczak) blood thirsty and maniacal.\r\n\r\nRather than mere noise and chaos, there is a definite rhyme and a reason to these arrangements, the duo somehow able to maintain a restless grindcore vibe with song structures that actually go somewhere, albeit in a MINISTRY-on-meth kind of way. Though what is heard is largely the sheer ferociousness of Ratajczak's riff bludgeoning and the extreme crush of the drum programming, light electronics serve to put a chill into the arrangements. The riffing on \"Burn Ward Whore\" (song title of the year?) may melt flesh, yet is also composed in such as a way as to inject slivers of melody and appealing nuance into the mix. The clean picking lulling one into a false sense of security on \"No Such Nothing\" ultimately gives way to more machine gun bursts and shrapnel blasts. And still the duo incorporates tempo breaks and chunkiness in just the right place. The song is but one example of an album that no one would ever claim to be easy on the central nervous system, and yet the songs are not simply mindless exercises in purposeful annoyance (though you may want to ask the neighbors about that after they've endured the album a few times).\r\n\r\nOf course, \"As the Ghosts Collect, The Corpses Rest\" would be nothing without the apocalyptic vibes and constant sense of danger one feels while being beaten bloody by this soundtrack to man's ultimate demise. The boys seem to possess that indefinable \"it,\" and I have a feeling that we have not even begun to experience this band's true potential for sheer audio terror.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n1.

This stunning LP is the long-awaited follow-up to his brooding and dark 2009 CD, \"Chiarascuro\" (Entropic Tarot), and it continues down the path of magisterial, sombre, and menacing analog synthesizer composition.  Hydeman's previous release on BloodLust! was as one-third of the extreme power-electronics group Twodeadsluts Onegoodfuck (\"Champagne and Biological Women\" 7-inch, B!116, 2009), but this solo work exists in a completely different reality.  \"Madison's Fence\" is far closer to labelmates such as Envenomist, Angel of Decay, Nightmares and Wilt, artists who create unsettling and epic dark ambient journeys.  Even the longform experimental compositions of Sleep Museum are a fair point of reference for Hydeman's current synth work.\r\n\r\nFor the tracks on \"Madison's Fence,\" Hydeman employed a selection of early-1980s vintage gear, such as the Korg Mono/Poly and the Roland Juno 6, combining their classic synth sounds with contemporary boutique modular gear, specifically the Flower Electronics Original Synthesizer.  He also seamlessly wove in guitar and an array of effects and electronics, bringing to mind the gear set-up of another former BloodLust! artist, Mammal.  In this case, however, Hydeman steers clear of any rock or blues structure and focuses solely on tense soundscapes, ranging in length from under three minutes to over twelve minutes.\r\n\r\nIn an era of synth exploration that approaches an uncomfortably close boundary with new age music and the softest sides of Krautrock and the first wave of ambient, Hydeman's taste for all things dark guarantees that his recordings never lose their dangerous edge, even if he arrives at this this place of dread via a completely different route than his brutal power-electronics work had navigated in the past.\r\n\r\nBeyond his sonic endeavors, Hydeman is also a caver, exploring the challenging caves and volcanoes of the Pacific Northwest, and his own photographs adorn this striking record jacket, which was masterfully designed by Jonathan Canady (Malsonus) of Angel of Decay, Dead World, Deathpile, Nightmares, etc.  The style of the graphic execution is a fitting follow-up to Canady's work on the Redrot \"Psycho Bondage\" LP (B!162, 2011) and it offers a perfect, yet open-ended, visual representation of the music's abyssal atmosphere.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\nA1: “Madison’s Fence” (2:30)\r\nA2: “Ash Covered Field” (12:23)\r\nA3: “Karen’s Slip” (7:37)\r\nB1: “Deadhorse” (10:01)\r\nB2: “Ghost Town” (4:08)\r\nB3: “Volcano” (8:55)\r\n\r\n\r\nLinks:\r\nhttp://www.myspace.com/thejoshhydeman\r\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Josh+Hydeman\r\nhttp://www.discogs.com/artist/Josh+Hydeman\r\n\r\n\r\n<object height=\"225\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1746029&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_playcount=true&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;color=273033\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1746029&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_playcount=true&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;color=273033\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>   <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/bloodlustchicago/sets/josh-hydeman-madisons-fence-lp\">Josh Hydeman \"Madison's Fence\" LP</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/bloodlustchicago\">BLOODLUSTCHICAGO</a></span>","options":[{"id":18297191,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/57758917/-/J_Hydeman_LP_Jacket_ART-sm.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/57758917/-/J_Hydeman_LP_Jacket_ART-sm.jpg","width":983,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55927215/-/J_Hydeman_LP_Jacket_LP-2-Back-small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55927215/-/J_Hydeman_LP_Jacket_LP-2-Back-small.jpg","width":336,"height":343}],"artists":[{"id":111133,"name":"Josh Hydeman","permalink":"josh-hydeman","url":"/artist/josh-hydeman"},{"id":49217,"name":"Twodeadsluts Onegoodfuck","permalink":"twodeadsluts-onegoodfuck","url":"/artist/twodeadsluts-onegoodfuck"}],"categories":[{"id":1754931,"name":"Records","permalink":"records","url":"/category/records"}]},{"id":3005797,"name":"B!157 Locrian \"Territories\" CD","permalink":"b-157-locrian-territories-cd-new","position":74,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/b-157-locrian-territories-cd-new","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-12-10T02:39:02.000Z","description":"BloodLust! and Small Doses are pleased to announce their co-release of \"Territories,\" the second studio full-length from Locrian.  The album was recorded in January 2009, at Phantom Manor Studios in Chicago, IL, and it features a group of collaborators including Blake Judd (Nachtmystium, Twilight), Bruce Lamont (Yakuza), Andrew Scherer (Velnias), and Mark Solotroff (Anatomy of Habit, BLOODYMINDED).  André Foisy and Terence Hannum have spent the last several years honing the Locrian sound and they have taken elements from noise, power-electronics, drone, and black metal to come up with a truly unique approach that reflects the sprawling urban decay that surrounds them in Chicago.  After nearly two dozen releases, they have found themselves in the world of \"Territories.\"  For this release, Locrian has pulled out all of the stops and they have fleshed out the band with the help of Mark Solotroff on vocals and synthesizer, Blake Judd on guitar, Bruce Lamont on saxophone and vocals, and Andrew Scherer on drums. The results of this massive collaborative effort are apparent from the moment that the album starts.  The textures run darker and deeper; the vocals -- sometimes three layers deep -- seem to be conjured from the decrepit muck of a failed civilization; the feedback takes on a more pronounced presence; and the augmented line-up allows for full-on black metal assaults that burst out of the tortured drones that Locrian have come to be known for.  Truly a case of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts, \"Territories\" may well be the most fully realized form of Locrian’s dystopian vision.  As with their previous album, \"Drenched Lands\" (2009, At War With False Noise and Small Doses - CD; BloodLust! - LP),  \"Territories\" was skillfully mastered by Jason Ward at Chicago Mastering Service, and the sound could not be more monumental.  The limited edition LP version of \"Territories,\" released in March 2010, garnered extremely strong critical attention (see selected reviews below) and we expect to reach even more ears and eyes with this new, handsome six-panel digipak compact disc edition.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n1. \"Inverted Ruins\"\r\n2. \"Between Barrows\"\r\n3. \"Procession of Ancestral Brutalism\"\r\n4. \"Ring Road\"\r\n5. \"Antediluvian Territory\"\r\n6. \"The Columnless Arcade\"\r\n\r\nSelect reviews:\r\n\r\nFrom: Animal Psi\r\nAnd then they were a band. With huge contributions by Mark Solotroff (Bloodyminded), Bruce Lamont (Yakuza), and Blake Judd (Nachtmystium), the pair of Foisy and Hannum are joined by drummer Andrew Scherer for three of the six tracks to fully realize the metal fetish which informs their distinct brutalism. Assembled by four labels, ‘Territories’ is not only a high watermark for Locrian but a remarkable good-faith gesture by several of the scene’s most vital patron-labels. Akin to the darkest of Coil’s private press, “Inverted Ruins” begins the disc with a single blade of head-splitting feedback quickly offset by a watery melody of synthesizer strain - the maneuver then reversed, reciprocated, cauterized into arbitrary chunks by a Whitehouse laser – and tattered, immediate percussion, all while Solotroff adds a wonderfully-dissembled John Balance sermon (lyrics included in the liner notes). Lamont’s saxophone smoothes out with sustained tones and murmuring strings in the cold-ass passage “Between Barrows”, a magnificent deception leading into the twin central peaks of “Procession of Ancestral Brutalism” and “Ring Road”: the former a deteriorating black metal of sheet-metal crash and howling vocals ala Wolves in the Throne Room, sooty with tape effects, its ten minutes are matched by the latter, a busy erasure of heat-swollen synth sequences and distorted guitar phased in trick wall of sound texture. Clean lines of guitar noir form the disc’s second interlude like a test track leading into the crackling transmissions which begin “The Columnless Arcade”, accumulating layers of noisy curtain which part midtrack to expose, like a secret less shameful than indulgent, a belligerent prog-metal of pull-offs, sustains, and woven notes - Hannum’s shredded vocals like a wraith beneath the glassy finish of whole tones of Locrian guitar and synthesizer which finally reveal themselves in full. It’s exceedingly rare to anticipate an album exploding onto the scene without some jaded sense of fluke connections or passing fancies but only by an essential power and brilliance which cannot be confused. ‘Territories’ is one of those moments, and it couldn’t happen to a more deserving outfit. And if this isn’t the moment which does it for Locrian, I’m probably not alone in feeling relief that they’ll be ours for a little longer. On black vinyl, limited to 500 copies. Highest recommendation.\r\n\r\nFrom: Anti-Gravity Bunny\r\nWhere the fuck do you start with a record like this? I guess the first thing I should mention (in case you didn't notice) is that Territories is too much of a monolithic beast to be contained by individual labels or continents. It took FOUR labels to put this thing out. That right there should clue you in as to how fucking massive this record is.  Then there's the fact that this isn't just André & Terrence playing, like most Locrian releases. Nope, they've recruited, like, every awesome metal dude around. Mark Solotroff (of Bloodyminded) on vocals and synths, Blake Judd (of Nachtmystium) on guitar, Bruce Lamont (of Yakuza) on sax and vocals, and Andrew Scherer (of Velnias) on drums. DUDES. We get it. You're trying to make to most badass record ever. No need to go overboard (just kidding, always go overboard please).  What Locrian usually go for is black. You know, black metal, blackened ambience, black doom, black noise, all the black one record can handle. But combine their entire discography's blackness and you still can't muster even a half hearted fight against the epic black hole that Territories.  This record is fucking incredible. It opens with a super textured lurching hunchback of a song, with piercing squelches of feedback over a gurgling swamp of vocals and noise. The next song chills out a bit with some not-too-scary low end drone played by a mourning sax and commiserating synths, accentuated by spurts of crashing cymbals. But the third song is where they fucking kick it into gear. All out black metal fury that totally fucking annihilates in the most gorgeous way possible. I don't think I've heard them delve this far into the BM yet, and it's so. fucking. good. It's not especially fucked or twisted that way I normally like my black metal, but it's not too straightforward either. They balance the blast beats and wall of buzz with droning static and plodding thunder in a way that makes me think \"Why don't they always do this? It's unbelievable.\" But then I listen to the rest of the record and remember why.  Territories finishes with 3 more songs that really get into some true terror, blackened rumbling, traipsing thrumming, soaring static, and more of that torturous feedback. Clouds roll in and shit gets dark, heavy, and scary as fuck. Helicopters flying in launching tear gas rockets to stop the rioting masses, decrepit malfunctioning machines topple, rusted tetanus infections, doomsday alarms, the demise of our society. And it all culminates with a black metal march of triumph over the decay, proof that even in the Future American Dystopia, no matter how debased and degenerated we have become, it's still going to be fucking beautiful.\r\n\r\nFrom: Aquarius Records:\r\nWith every single release these guys get better and better, their sound, a constantly evolving, ultra dense blend of abstract black metal and deep ambient dronemusic, the early records were more about energy and vibe than execution, still eminently listenable, heavy and atmospheric, black and brutal, but their skills as composers and arranges have definitely made leaps and bounds, arriving finally at Territories, the latest sprawling epic from this Chicago duo, here, aided and abetted by a whole bunch of guests, including Blake Judd from Nachtmystium, Andrew Scherer, drummer for black metallers Velnias, and Mark Solotroff, power electronics maestro, and man behind Bloody Minded and the BloodLust! label. And the guests make their presence felt right away, on opener inverted ruins, a smoldering doomic plod, more power electronics than black metal, with Solotroff ranting over a sea of swirling buzz and skree, glitched out electronics, and some simple stripped down drumming. Over the course of the track, it begins to coalesce into a more ominous creep, shedding noise as it goes, before finally slipping into a deep shimmering drone, which introduces the next track, a lush, slow building cinematic dronescape, constantly shifting layers, drifting through clouds of cymbal shimmer and blackened buzzing strings. It's not until nearly the end of side one that black metal rears it's ugly head, a flurry of manic riffing, and they're off, a pounding midtempo blast of raw feral blackness, insane shrieked vocals, chaotic drums, muted riffs, all blurred into a blackened haze, lo-fi and muddy, but also epic and intense.  The flipside opens with another bout of power electronics, dueling synths unfurl undulating layers of wheeze and warble and buzz, laced with shimmering overtones and fragmented melodies, a churning black sonic sea, that eventually fades out leaving, a smoldering stretch of shadowy guitar, of blissed out ambience, a short stretch of crystalline chiming guitars laid over a warm whir, shoegazey and blissed out, which finally leads into the closing track, the weirdest of the bunch, with organ and saxophone, acoustic guitars, and pretty much all the gusts present and accounted for, a bleak buzzing driftscape, sort of post industrial, keening melodies over fractured buzz, and deep rumbles, creaks and skree and groaning low end, finally explode into full on melodic black metal, martial drumming, epic riffing, more tortured vokills, cool tangled woozy minor key melodies, a swirling druggy ambience, weirdly catchy and otherworldly, but still heavy and psychedelic, maybe our favorite track, and the perfect way to wind down this serpentine blackened outsider drone metal journey...\r\n\r\nFrom: Bad Year Media\r\nFUCK... BEFORE I SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE LP I HAVE TO SAY THAT LISTENING TO THESE SONGS PAINTS THE SAME PICTURE AS READING THE CORMAC MCCARTHY BOOK THE ROAD. AN ASHEN DEAD WORLD THAT HAS BEEN BURNED TO THE GROUND WHERE NOTHING LIVES. TERRITORIES IS EQUAL PARTS DRONE, BLACK METAL, DEVASTATING FEEDBACK, INCORPORATING MORE DRUMS, VOCALS. THESE...SONGS ARE INCREDIBLE. DIFFERENT FROM DRENCHED LANDS IN A GOOD WAY. IN A WAY THERE IS MORE TO THE TRACKS, MORE LAYERS THAT SEEM TO COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER.\r\n\r\nFrom: Blastitude\r\nShowing a continued intent to develop and reinvent themselves, Locrian augment their duo lineup with various key guests from Chicago’s metal, experimental, and experimental/metal scenes. The result is as solid and satisfying as all of Locrian’s releases have been, but given several fresh twists, which we hear right off the bat on “Inverted Ruins,” featuring Mark Solotroff of Bloodyminded doing a killer job singing bleak lyrics and Andrew Scherer of Velnias playing kit drums, I believe a first for Locrian. Other temporary members include Bruce Lamont of Yakuza on vocals and saxophone, and perhaps most notably Blake Judd of Nachtmystium on guitars and vocals. All four of these ringers appear throughout the album, in different combinations, but not on every track… though only one track (”Antediluvian Territory”) is by the original Locrian duo lineup, there is also only one track (”Procession of Ancestral Brutalism”) that features all six musicians. Not surprisingly, it explodes out of the middle of the album as the most raging and traditionally black metal sounding track on here, though I might prefer the nearly 10-minute Solotroff/Locrian trio cut “Ring Road.”\r\n\r\nFrom: Brainwashed\r\nLooking back, it has only been a bit over a year since the Greyfield Shrines LP, my first exposure to these guys, yet in that year I’ve heard as significant amount of development and change in their work. While that release was reminiscent of the intentionally minimalist drone of Sunn O))), subsequent work has brought in greater elements of noise, electronic music, and post-punk alternative. This LP is perhaps the ultimate culmination of that, being released by no less than four labels and featuring guest appearances from members of Bloodyminded, Nachtmystium, Yakuza, and Velnias.  The change and evolution of their sound is immediate once \"Inverted Ruins\" launches. The carefully controlled feedback of Andre Foisy’s bass guitar and the simple echoed stabs of Terence Hannum’s synths could be on any of their releases, but the addition of live drums from Velnias member Andrew Scherer and the distant, disgusted vocals of Bloodyminded’s Mark Solotroff push the sound closer towards rock territory, while synthesizer drones and digital noise pull it in the opposite direction. The song slogs along at the pace of stoner rock, but there’s far more noise experimentation going on for it to drift into caveman riff-heavy Sabbath territory.  The long \"Procession of Ancestral Brutalism\" embraces the squall of black metal, but with a distinct sound and structure that contradicts the genre’s infatuation with muffled flatulent production and cookie monster vocals. Aided by Nachtmystium’s Blake Judd on vocals and guitar, it’s not surprising that it conjures images of black metal, but the complex layering of guitars over Hannum’s almost prog-rock synth lines and Scherer’s freak out drumming, all with a cavalcade of vocal parts sounding like Mayhem and Can battling it out with neither side dominating the other.  The closing \"The Columnless Arcade\" features the same line-up, with the addition of Yakuza’s Bruce Lamont on saxophone. The screamed tortured vocals and rapid staccato guitar also give a metallic sheen to the proceedings, but there is a greater aridness to the track, a bit more light let in. Shades of the post-punk guitar sound that appeared on the recent 7\" split with Harpoon are here as well, giving a purer tone and color than other artists are usually able to muster.  Between these longer pieces linger a few shorter, more sparse instrumental bits that are no less captivating. The sustained organ and insect saxophone of \"Between Barrows\" have a meditative quality that fits well between the louder, more boisterous tracks. Similarly, \"Antediluvian Territory,\" which sits as the penultimate track, is a sparse duet of organ and guitar, which soars and rings on with a melancholy beauty that calls to mind, at least in mood, some of the best moments of the Cure’s Seventeen Seconds for some reason.  This time last year I thought these guys were doing something different in the field of drone metal, which has continued to be an overly cluttered genre, but I wasn’t sure exactly what that difference was. While I have been concerned at their prolificness over the past year, their output has never been superfluous or unnecessary. Territories stands as the full realization of the tapes, EPs, and split 7\" singles that the band has issued in this time, perfectly encapsulating their dark, dystopian sound with the ideal balance of pure heaviness and pensive drone. Topping this one will be tough, but I’m thinking they will be able to do it in time.\r\n\r\nFrom: Compulsion\r\nLocrian's previous album Drenched Lands was an impressive combination of guitar and keyboard improvisations carrying elements of drone, noise and pitch-black industrial ambience together with a slight nod towards black metal. With Territories the core duo Andre Foisy and Terence Hannum further develop their blackened atmospherics aided by an expanded line-up, featuring fellow Chicago based musicians including Mark Solotroff (Bloodyminded and proprietor of BloodLust! label), Blake Judd (Nachtmystium), Bruce Lamont (Yakuza) and Andrew Scherer (Velnias).  Right from the off you're surrounded by the controlled feedback squeals and electronic pulses of 'Inverted Ruins'. It carries over the Locrian sound of Drenched Lands but the presence of the collaborators is obvious; in the distant holler of Solotroff and the simple rock styled drum pounding from Andrew Scherer. The doom pace is filled with stuttering synthesiser howls and industrial ambience ebbing out on pulselike throbs. The static buzz drone of 'Between Barrows', punctuated by short bursts of crashing cymbal rolls, is accompanied by some restrained sax blurt and further on it picks up some sustained tense organ drone.  Drenched Lands featured some stark and skeletal guitar work and that makes a welcome reappearance on 'Antediluvian Territory', the only track restricted to the core duo of Andre Foisy and Terence Hannum. Here spiralling shards of guitar are played off against ominous organ drone. It is wonderful stuff and way too brief. It's an approach I hope they pursue on future releases.  And while there's elements of noise throughout Territories there's a definite power electronics feel to the opening minutes of 'Ring Road' with Solotroff's haranguing holler over wavering shrill feedback and monstrous low-end roar. It doesn't stay too long in power electronics mode as it gradually leads into dense churning electronics, with some guitar improvisation and crackling textures.  One of the pivotal tracks of Territories, 'Procession of Ancestral Brutalism' starts quietly with feint feedback squeals and industrial ambience before upping the stakes with scorching black metal riffing, powerhouse drumming and screamed black hole aggro vocals spat out by Solotroff, Judd, Lamont and Hannum. 'Procession of Ancestral Brutalism' is inspired and dynamic like black metal filtered through the noise-rock of Zeni Geva or something. It may be black metal but with Locrian it is direct and resolutely shorn of the ideology or cliché.  I guess much will be written about the black metal influenced tracks on Territories but the focus of Locrian remains very much on improvisation. If it's black metal you're seeking then I'm afraid you're gonna have to wade through a lot of black atmospherics to get there. Just listen to the shared guitar improvisations that comprise the opening minutes of 'The Columnless Arcade' before it cuts to the surging metal riffing, martial snare drum rolls and distant tortured screamed vocals. As ever it doesn't wallow too long in one place as Locrian cast their net wide trawling through wigged out terrain casting off elements of black metal with post-rock tunings into dense psychedelic murk.  Given the amount of collaborators here Locrian never lose their identity; their sound is never engulfed by the collaborators. Territories is very much a Locrian record. All the hallmarks of their sound, as evidenced on their previous Drenched Lands release, can be found here. This time though with the aid of the collaborators they've been able to further explore areas only tentatively pursued before. Anyone interested in drone/doom sonics and noise/power electronics would be foolish to miss this as Territories is something of an avant metal drone fest. It's also a blast. As prolific as they are Locrian are running on a very low shit quotient and I'm already looking forward to wherever they go next. Great stuff. Released via the labels At War With False Noise, Basses Frequences, Bloodlust! And Small Doses on vinyl in an edition of 500 copies in and now on CD.\r\n\r\nFrom: Electric Voice Phenomenon\r\nThe dark recesses visited by Locrian are all too familiar to those who have grappled with their inner demons with accompaniment by doom metal and industrial acts for the past quarter-century. The dark cloud that looms over Territories, the latest LP from Locrian, finds the group delving into the bottomless abyss of uncertainty.  Album opener “Inverted Ruins” straddles the line of between industrial’s past and doom’s present. The vocals are gnarled and venomous, scratching out their story into the ebon ember melody. The slow and heavy pace is counterpointed by sharp, high-pitched screeching; the clawing of our hapless victim desperately attempting to dig his way out from under the endless layers of dirt in which he is buried. The trip into darkness is one Locrian has taken many times, yet one that will leave listeners deeply affected by the scorched tones in which they are repeatedly baptized.  It’s this fearlessness that drives André Foisy and Terence Hannum’s vision. The combination of white noise, variable static, low-end tunings, and spatial arrangements turn Territories into a viscous mix of tar, oil, and mud that is unwashable. The machine gun guitar of “Procession of Ancestral Brutalism” mimics the frantic scrubs of Lady Macbeth unable to rinse the blood of her evil deeds away; the anguished screams represent her confrontation with her sins; the crashing cymbals the thunder claps of the gods passing their stern judgment upon her. Territories is all these and more. An album as complex and theme-heavy as classic literature and as technologically integrated as human flesh meeting cybernetic parts, Territories captures the malaise of modern living in its onyx-tinted Petri dish. As we swim around, confused by the blackness of our surroundings and confounded with how to clear up our messes, Locrian hovers in the disconnected netherworld capturing every emotion in its medieval ooze to cast us in plaster for ever more.\r\n\r\nFrom: Evening of Light\r\nLocrian‘s discography keeps growing at a steady pace, and with releases like this year’s Territories filling up the ranks, that is nothing to be ashamed of. The solid base of tearing guitars, drones, subtle synths and screeching noise is still here, but this time around, Andre Foisy and Terrence Hannum are joined by a variety of guest musicians, adding drums and other elements into the dystopian music.  “Inverted Ruins” starts off slow, with plodding drums and ear-piercing high frequencies accompanying slowly descending chords and raw, dirty vocals. “Between Barrows” is a subtle layered ambient piece with organs and cymbal swells. The A-side closes with a short noisy guitar soundscape that morphs into a raw black metal track, opening new vistas for the band.  The second half of the album has a similar curve, with “Ring Road” and “Antediluvian Territory” exploring melodies and drones, and the excellent final track, bringing more black metal after an otherworldly dual-guitar intro, and ending with some great melodic guitar leads over slower drums.  This Territories LP is yet another example of the fascinating music of Locrian. It’s not quite metal, not quite ambient, but something in its own right: urban, industrial, raw, visionary, and dystopian. Genre-crossing music for the 21st century.\r\n\r\nFrom: KEXP 90.3 FM Seattle\r\nAs major labels continue to exist behind the times, artists and labels with little capital and lesser reputations are producing some of the most innovative, interesting, and inspiring music. Whether it’s creating a new niche in digital technology or looking to once obsolete formats, Agitated Atmosphere hopes to pull back the curtain on a wealth of sights and sound from luminaries such as Locrian.  The dark recesses visited by Locrian are all too familiar to those who have grappled with their inner demons with accompaniment by doom metal and industrial acts for the past quarter-century.

It’s hard to attach a sub-genre to these guys, they incorporate a wide range of influences into a very cohesive whole, but that whole is definitely grey, oppressive and depressing (that’s a good thing if you like this kind of music). Totally nihilistic music made my two very nice gentlemen, Territories also includes contributions from members of Nachtmystium and Yakuza, among others.\r\n\r\nFrom: The One True Dead Angel\r\nHere we have an album so immense, so blackened, and so heavy that it required four separate labels to lift it off the ground and cram it down your throat. Part of what makes this one so heavy is the additional firepower they bring to the game -- their diabolical fusion of noise, drone, and black metal is augmented by additional sonic death courtesy of guests Andrew Scherer (Velnias) on drums, Blake Judd (Nachtmystium) on guitar, Bruce Lamont (Yakuza) on sax and vocals, and Mark Solotroff (Bloodyminded, Anatomy of Habit) on electronics and guitar. With the duo of Locrian backed by a full band, the result is a sound that's louder, thicker, and goes off in more directions than ever before. The opening track, \"Inverted Ruins,\" makes this clear from the beginning, with plodding drums, bowel-scraping noise, and a serious commitment to skin-crawling dissonance. \"Between Barrows\" opens with an ominous cyclotron drone that could have been lifted from one of their earlier albums, but soon it is overlaid with eerie cymbal washes straight out of the Book of Khanate and more power-electronics hum, and as the piece progresses, the drone and crackling noise are embellished by dark ambient washes and eerie feedback drones, all playing out in languid but anguished fashion, like an unsettling prelude to violence. That violence finally arrives in \"Procession of Ancestral Brutalism,\" where -- after an uneasy introduction of vaguely atmospheric ambient noise -- a buzzing guitar, pounding drums, and pained howling swaddled in mountains of reverb usher the album firmly into pure, antagonistic black metal territory. \"Ring Road\" returns to the more familiar pleasures of grinding, near-industrial tones and screech-laden power electronics, a deliberately grating sound that evolves into a dark, throbbing drone made even more threatening by the alienated noises that rise and fall in the background; the song eventually dissolves into a swirl of static and devolved black metal guitar wailing, like a lost soul disappearing down a rabbit hole. \"Antediluvian Territory\" is not quite so sinister but every bit as eerie, with a plinking guitar figure creeping across a burnt ambient soundscape of fogged-out noise and cryptic tonal dread, while \"The Columnless Arcade\" ends the album with an orgy of noise fed through enormous amounts of delay and echo as huge, shuddering drone action threatens to topple the entire sonic architecture into a cold, poisoned ocean... and then the pounding drums, treble-heavy black metal guitar, and hellish vocals burst forth without warning and the sonic destruction REALLY begins. What a way to end a completely filler-free album. Heavy, heavy stuff, o my brothers and sisters, heavy stuff indeed. If you haven't been smart enough to worship Locrian yet, you really should pick this up and get with the program.\r\n\r\nFrom: Rock-A-Rolla\r\nThis is the point where Locrian's train picks up a shitload of devotees - the record that takes what's gone before and vaults it.  The atoms of ambient, noise/drone, power electronics and black metal have been split and reconfigured in these six tracks.  On Territories, the core of Andre Foisey and Terence Hannum may well be collaborating with other players, but this still feels like a truly Locrian record.  Again they've scratched out a view of the world that's negative/dystopian/ugly, but infused the music with a metallic, detached sheen.  Territories isn't a polished production by any stretch, but there are clean lines of Gristilised thought in amongst the jarring synths and gobbets of noise.  With a handful of collaborators on drums, saxophone, guitars and vocals, it's Bloodyminded's Mark Solotroff who sounds most integral to Territories.  His vocals are in turn brutal, lost, ugly and completely vital.  An absolutely flooring album in an age where such things matter less and less.  - Scott McKeating\r\n\r\nFrom: Stereogum\r\nLocrian’s Territories ends with the torrentially uplifting “The Columnless Arcade.” The Chicago duo of André Foisy and Terence Hannum still create plenty of dark, crumbling, murky washes and spacious Prurient-on-Loren Mazzacane Connors noisescapes, but since their last collection Drenched Lands (and a handful of shorter 2009 releases), they’ve added a rock layer to the bleak ambiance. The assistance comes via a well-curated cast of Chicago-area metal/extreme music regulars:  On the aforementioned closer and 11-minute mid-collection epic “Procession of Ancestral Brutalism,” the guys are joined by Nachtmystium’s Black Judd on guitars (plus vocals on “Procession”), Yakuza’s Bruce Lamont on saxophone, and Velnias‘ Andrew Scherer on drums. (Elsewhere, Bloodyminded’s Mark Solotroff shreds his vocal cords and affixes dense synth drone.) Last July I booked Locrian on an intentionally weirdo bill with three different kinds of grindcore groups (Anal Cunt, Fuck The Facts, and Compremesis) and a more straightforward progressive Opeth-style crew (Gwynbleidd). At time the time, Foisy and Hannum’s electric, spacious sheets of synthesized/looped noise and dense smoke machines created a gorgeous, religious-seeming swerve from the rest of the bill. A year later they’d still be the odd-men out, but they’d also be creating blackened anthems that’d give just about anyone a run for their blast beats. You get a bit of both worlds in “The Columnless Arcade.”  Territories is out now on LP via At War with False Noise, Basses Frequences, Bloodlust!, and Small Doses. (It takes a nation.) It’ll be out on CD in August. More details on that soon. In the meantime, make room on your year-end lists.\r\n\r\nFrom: Stereokiller\r\nEventually, it all comes back to noise. Every peak, every height, every genre inevitably gets broken down and reduced to its most primitive and minimalist essence, allowed to start anew, begin again, rise from the ashes… whatever. Proven time and time again, it’s the noise factor that allows for creative growth, its foundation suitable to build something cohesive.  It makes sense, once you consider this, that the first decipherable statement to screech from the analog slump of “Inverted Ruins,” introductory track from ambient metal duo, Locrian, is “Tradition has failed.” Although more of an indictment of conventional wisdom, or the human tendency to allow habit to automatically dictate behavior, it’s also reason enough to create something unusual. Obviously.  As constructors of their own brand of Avant noise metal, Locrian members André Foisy and Terence Hannum spend a lot of time fashioning aural dwellings, the amps kicking out less a form of music than a form of abstraction. Last year’s Drenched Lands was essentially a cassette playing back some nightmarish creations, bookended by six-string sorrow. Their new album, Territories, brings more music to the creepscape, “Inverted Ruins” a slow and steady blender of industrial squeal, garage percussion and synthesizer. The swelling science fiction tone of “Between Barrows” leads into “Procession of Ancestral Brutalism,” which is probably the album’s most straightforward moment. Guitars blaze, drums shatter, screams are buried under the weight of static and other obscuring noise pollutant.  Stormy avalanches, industrial catastrophe, perpetual pulsations… “Ring Road” essentially breathes as guitars grind their way through the sonic murk, a hissing valve the suitable backdrop for loose guitar play in “Antediluvian Territory.”  With “The Columnless Arcade,” Locrian generate a four-minute chorus line of machined drone before turning to their instruments for the song’s remaining length. Screams are cold and far off, the music itself surprisingly passionate. Melody gets some attention, Territories an attempt at building more out of Locrian’s dark expanses while not completely abandoning that part of their persona.\r\n\r\nFrom Womblife:\r\nEven more satisfying is the newer Territories, a Locrian big band affair that features members of Bloodyminded, Nachtmystium, Velnias and Yoakuza along with the core of Andre Foisy and Terrance Hannum. As a result things definitely get opened up in terms of dynamics and diversity. \"Inverted Ruins\" offers a lurching funeral march of murky electronics and feedback beneath vocal howls that grow more intense and pissed off with each cycle across its 8 plus minutes. \"Procession of Ancestral Brutalism,\" with Blake Judd on guitar and vocals, is a straight up black metal howler the likes of which his own band (Nachtmystium) has never conjured before -- atonal, screeching, howling at the bottomless black void metal -- designed to make your head explode before your soul crumbles into a ball of ash. How fun! Combine this with the more spectral hypnotic vibe of earlier Locrian disks, and you have something that's hard to ignore in the experimental drone metal realm. Territories comes in an edition of 500 on black vinyl, so don't dilly dally, you doom fixated dregs.\r\n\r\nFrom: Yellow Green Red\r\nIf it takes four record labels to put out one album, so be it, so long as it’s as nicely produced as Locrian’s Territories. Continuing in the spirit of cooperation, this one features a number of guest players, including none other than BLOODYMINDED’s Mark Solotroff on vocals and synthesizer, the type of collaboration any Chicago-based freak would envy. Speaking of synths, Territories has a lot of them, practically dominating the landscape where metallic guitars once reigned. There are still some fierce black metal guitar riffs here, which make for a nice balance, but my money’s on the synth-drone mood pieces; there might be just a little too much china cymbal for my tastes on the thrashing metal tracks. Their metalwork here is better than I am recalling, it’s just that when a track is credited to Solotroff’s synth and vocals, a bass guitar and another synthesizer, how can anything top that?\r\n","options":[{"id":10351495,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29133869/-/B_157_Locrian_Territories_CD_front.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29133869/-/B_157_Locrian_Territories_CD_front.jpg","width":400,"height":400}],"artists":[{"id":49147,"name":"Locrian","permalink":"locrian","url":"/artist/locrian"}],"categories":[{"id":1754881,"name":"Compact Discs","permalink":"compact-discs","url":"/category/compact-discs"}]},{"id":3003527,"name":"B!156 The Guilt Of... \"S/T\" CD (Feat.

This disc quickly follows their recent split 10-inch with Ivs Primae Noctis [2010, Trips und Träume] and their new split LP with Merzbow [2010, Chrome Peeler].  Williams' last BloodLust! appearance was on the BLOODYMINDED \"Gift Givers\" CD [B!045, 2005], on the track \"Ten Suicides.\"  In 2009, Chrome Peeler released a Mike Williams 7-inch that featured Ryan McKern's soundscapes under Williams' spoken passages on the A-side, and a new remix of \"Ten Suicides\" by Mark Solotroff on the B-side.  That release seemed to set the stage for the emergence of this new TGO... CD on BloodLust!  Also of note is a live collaboration between Williams, McKern, Joey LaCaze [Eyehategod, Outlaw Order], and three members of BLOODYMINDED - James Moy, Isidro Reyes, and Mark Solotroff - who performed at Chicago's Reckless Records as Ten Suicides on June 20, 2010.  Thus, the time certainly seemed right to unleash this hard-to-classify new group's music on BloodLust!  Equal parts experimental noise, early industrial, sludge-metal, and crust-punk, the six tracks that make up this album hark back to a forgotten point in time, when labels like Relapse, Earache, Roadrunner, and Pathological were releasing weird hybrid records by groups such as Malformed Earthborn, Thorn,  Candiru, Techno Animal, Dead World, etc.  At the time, it seemed like the worlds of metal, punk, and industrial would forever go on to intermingle and reconfigure in continually evolving new forms - but things did not quite work out that way.  Some innovative artists and musicians of the period, such as Williams, continued to keep an open mind and never allowed themselves to be easily pigeonholed.  With The Guilt Of..., Williams has the perfect outlet for his singular, dark world view, building upon the narratives created for his metal and punk incarnations, and seen in his groundbreaking book \"Cancer as a Social Activity: Affirmations of World's End\" [Southern Roots Publishing, 2005].  With McKern's instrumental expertise and his own wide range of tastes, Williams has just the right partner with whom he can spew his thought provoking, Manson-obsessed, Burroughsian cut-up writings.

This release features a recording of our set from the Northeast Noise & Power Electronics Festival II, November 7, 2009, in Boston, MA.  For that very special show, we played our debut CD \"Trophy\" in its entirety, minus the 20+ minute long song \"Overdrive.\"  Why?  Because a trip to Boston demands a fucking very special BLOODYMINDED set.  Especially if it is a return to a completely over-the-top event like the Northeast Noise & Power Electronics Festival, which for the second year in a row, included a devastating line-up of the best-of-the-best in this scene.  And particularly, when the boys in Twodeadsluts Onegoodfuck have brought you out their to play.  And, as it turns out, Boston is city where \"Trophy\" has taken on a certain importance.  The folks in that scene have embraced the album in a particular way that somehow caused the idea to perform it seem like a really clever concept.  Was it?  Yes and no.  As the show approached, I realized that from the 46 songs on tap, BLOODYMINDED had never even performed several of the songs on \"Trophy\" live, while other tracks had only had a small number of live airings since 1995.  And let's be frank, I am not exactly known for my great memorization skills.  But this was not a crowd that could be let down, so a minor mental miracle had to occur.  And let's also factor in the distractions.  While James Moy was tasked with holding down synth and mixer duties, as well as adding vocal leads and fills [if and when I stumbled], I had Pieter Schoolwerth and Xavier Laradji flying around me and accosting me throughout the set --- not to mention an extremely excited, physical, and verbal audience that was not content to observe the edge-of-the-stage boundary.  It was an endurance test, it was a battle, and it was three-quarters-of-an-hour of pure jubilation.  Here then, are the results, in all of their glory.  The recording is presented as one continuous track, with all of the atmosphere of the occasion completely remaining intact.

This heavy and disquieting noise work is the creation of Sergio Sanchez, who many in the noise scene will know from his Spanish language review blog, Ruido Horrible, as well as the vital label of the same name.  When BLOODYMINDED went down to Mexico City in 2007 to play the r4wb1t5 Macro Fest, a week long multi-disciplinary cultural arts festival, we also wanted to play a show that was more closely tied to the small but dedicated noise scene there.  So we made plans through a still relatively new contact, Señor Sanchez.  The time that we spent with Sanchez and his group of friends was a wonderful added bonus to all of the great people that we had already met through r4wb1t5.  Following an ultra-high-energy Friday night BLOODYMINDED festival show -- and an even higher-energy, adrenalin-fueled, high-speed police chase that involved the car that we were in, which was returning us to our hotel at dawn -- Sanchez had us meet him and his cohorts on a hot and sunny Saturday afternoon at El Chopo, the famous, sprawling outdoor mercado that caters to the heavy-metal, punk, and gothic scenes.  It was an amazing day, even in our rather delicate state.  Needless to say, we have stayed in contact with the Ruido Horrible crew, and we have enjoyed the flow of music that has been making its way up from the D.F. since then.  After I asked Sanchez to consider a Los Heraldos Negros release on BloodLust!, he simply told me that when a worthwhile piece of music was ready to be shared, he would send it along.  I knew exactly what that meant, so I waited patiently.  The striking and wholly satisfying results are \"Vivir Mejor,\" which roughly translates to \"have a better life,\" borrowed from the campaign slogan of Felipe Calderón, the current President of Mexico, who many feel has delivered the country into a bloody, full-scale war between drug traffickers and army and police forces, particularly in northern Mexico.  This outstanding recording sonically parallels a certain mood within the country, deftly moving from sustained harsh noise sections to more unsettling, atmospheric passages, still adding a human element by skillfully and subtly weaving in what appear to be field recordings, which never become obvious or intrusive, but which function as a fully integrated part of the overall sound palette.

On offer are eight startling and strong compositions that straddle the lines between harsh noise, synth noise, and death-industrial - somewhere in the neighborhood of a vocal-less Pharmakon, as a starting point, at least.  But let's not start some East Coast - West Coast rivalry here.  And let's also not overlook how curiously Masturbatory Dysfunction sits next to Climax Denial, another sonic point of reference, to some degree.  The young woman behind this solo project had been in touch with BloodLust! for a while, before news of her recordings reached the label.  Once her unique concept and methodology had been revealed, there was no question that a release was in order.  Amazingly, these recordings were exclusively made during business hours - lunch hour, typically - at a leading national music equipment retailer.  The artist behind MD would take a recording device into the store with her - typically a digital video camera - and she would proceed to try out the synthesizers that were available to customers for demonstration - at high-volume, no less.  Without trying to be sexist here, if a typical noise guy tried to do this they would definitely be asked to leave the store.  But MD, as we shall call her from now on, managed to repeatedly push the limits of how long, how loud, and how frequently she could blast away at the store, capturing a sizable body of work in the process.  Tracks were then transferred to computer, edited for time, mastered for maximum sonic potency, and selected for this, her first collection.  The term \"Getting Caught\" functions on multiple levels for MD, both in the obvious sense, as well as in her sexually and criminally based themes.  It all works so nicely on multiple levels, which makes this such a powerful debut and such a pleasure to release.  These are professionally duplicated CDs, with single panel, double-sided inserts, featuring color artwork; in jewel boxes with shrinkwrap; released in 2010.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n1: \"Think It Through\" (3:10)\r\n2: \"Getting Caught\" (2:29)\r\n3: \"It Was A Mistake\" (3:20)\r\n4: \"Remnants Of Rape\" (6:05)\r\n5. \"Me Encountering Myself\" (3:35)\r\n6: \" Late Night Filth\" (3:02)\r\n7: \"You Blew It\" (5:27)\r\n8: \"Bye Mom\" (5:06)\r\n","options":[{"id":10346353,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29113995/-/B_152-Masturbatory_Dysfunction-Getting_Caught-CD-Mock-Up-Front.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29113995/-/B_152-Masturbatory_Dysfunction-Getting_Caught-CD-Mock-Up-Front.jpg","width":480,"height":424},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29114015/-/B_152-Masturbatory_Dysfunction-Getting_Caught-CD-Mock-Up-Traycard.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29114015/-/B_152-Masturbatory_Dysfunction-Getting_Caught-CD-Mock-Up-Traycard.jpg","width":479,"height":421},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29114035/-/B_152-Masturbatory_Dysfunction-Getting_Caught-CD-Mock-Up-Insert_Back.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29114035/-/B_152-Masturbatory_Dysfunction-Getting_Caught-CD-Mock-Up-Insert_Back.jpg","width":436,"height":411},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29114043/-/B_152-Masturbatory_Dysfunction-Getting_Caught-CD-Mock-Up-Disc.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29114043/-/B_152-Masturbatory_Dysfunction-Getting_Caught-CD-Mock-Up-Disc.jpg","width":483,"height":422}],"artists":[{"id":49173,"name":"Masturbatory Dysfunction","permalink":"masturbatory-dysfunction","url":"/artist/masturbatory-dysfunction"}],"categories":[{"id":1754881,"name":"Compact Discs","permalink":"compact-discs","url":"/category/compact-discs"}]},{"id":3004089,"name":"B!151 Neil Jendon \"Cities In Flight\" CD","permalink":"b-151-neil-jendon-cities-in-flight-cd","position":80,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/b-151-neil-jendon-cities-in-flight-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-12-09T21:59:26.000Z","description":"BloodLust! is pleased to announce the new Neil Jendon CD, \"Cities In Flight,\" the striking follow-up to his 2008 release for the label, \"Invisibility\" [B!117].  On this new album, Jendon steers his Doepfer Analog Modular System through three carefully constructed and arranged electronic music compositions, commencing with a startling throb-throb, and working his way through loud, noisy and aggressive passages and more subtle, thoughtful, tempered segments.  Jendon is a veteran of the Chicago music scene, who has shifted between roles as a psychedelically-driven guitarist in the early-90s alternative band Catherine [TVT Records], a more experimentally-minded guitarist in the avant-garde group Zelienople, and as half of Abduction [with Michael Miley], through which I first witnessed Neil's vivid modular synthesizer playing.  I originally came to know Jendon in the early 1990's in his pop music guise, and after losing touch with him for a long measure of time, I have seen and heard much more of Neil's work over the last several years.  I have happily witnessed a number of his excellent sets, where he has delivered the goods on bills with diverse artists including Consumer Electronics, Cadaver In Drag, Locrian, The Golden Sores, Anal Hearse, Martial Canterel, Hive Mind, BLOODYMINDED, The Fortieth Day, and Super Eight Loop.  It comes as no surprise that \"Cities In Flight\" emerges as a pre-eminent document of where Jendon's performances have been heading lately.

Ten years later, and after BLOODYMINDED [and myself, solo, etc.] has played numerous shows on the same bill as Vertonen, Edwards is now my band mate in Anatomy of Habit [we were also previously in Animal Law together], and in AoH he is charged with even more ferocious and often more beautiful metal-on-metal scrape and bash.  When he is not wielding rusty bits of amplified scrap metal, Edwards may sometimes be found behind the controls of a hulking Russian Polivoks analog synthesizer.  Over the years, his infrequent synth-based performances have become a favorite of mine in Chicago, and when I began thinking about a Vertonen release on BloodLust!, I knew that it had to focus on that beast of a synth.  \"Cresting\" is comprised of five medium-length compositions that run across 40-minutes of chrome tape, ranging from the more exploratory to the more abrasive; Housed in clear “Norelco” style cases with folded black and white photocopied j-cards.

(USA), and Small Doses (USA) are pleased to announce the co-release of \"Territories,\" the second studio full-length from Locrian.  The album was recorded in January 2009, at Phantom Manor Studios in Chicago, IL, and it features a group of collaborators including Blake Judd (Nachtmystium, Twilight), Bruce Lamont (Yakuza), Andrew Scherer (Velnias), and Mark Solotroff (Anatomy of Habit, BLOODYMINDED).  André Foisy and Terence Hannum have spent the last several years honing the Locrian sound and they have taken elements from noise, power-electronics, drone, and black metal to come up with a truly unique approach that reflects the sprawling urban decay that surrounds them in Chicago.  After nearly two dozen releases, they have found themselves in the world of \"Territories.\"  For this release, Locrian has pulled out all of the stops and they have fleshed out the band with the help of Mark Solotroff on vocals and synthesizer, Blake Judd on guitar, Bruce Lamont on saxophone and vocals, and Andrew Scherer on drums. The results of this massive collaborative effort are apparent from the moment that the album starts.  The textures run darker and deeper; the vocals -- sometimes three layers deep -- seem to be conjured from the decrepit muck of a failed civilization; the feedback takes on a more pronounced presence; and the augmented line-up allows for full-on black metal assaults that burst out of the tortured drones that Locrian have come to be known for.  Truly a case of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts, \"Territories\" may well be the most fully realized form of Locrian’s dystopian vision.  As with their previous album, \"Drenched Lands\" (2009, At War With False Noise and Small Doses - CD; BloodLust! - LP),  \"Territories\" was skillfully mastered by Jason Ward at Chicago Mastering Service, and the sound could not be more monumental.  The LP is pressed in a black vinyl edition of 500 copies, is housed in heavyweight, full-color, true LP sleeves, and it includes an 11\" x 11\" double-sided, full-color insert.

This release is connected to three previous Atrax Morgue releases on the label.  The a-side, \"Omicidio,\" was originally submitted to BloodLust! by Marco Corbelli [April 3, 1970 - May 6, 2007] as an alternate b-side to the \"Her Guts\" 7-Inch [B!039, 2005], but at the time, \"Sinfonia Per Un Sadico,\" which Marco was still unsure of, seemed far too unique and unsettling a track to replace, so I championed its inclusion.  \"Omicidio\" was unfortunately shelved for future use, and was left untouched until after Marco's death.  I chose to resurrect the piece because it is the type of vocal-driven Atrax Morgue song that I so enjoy, and it reminds me of his excellent one-and-only USA show, a BloodLust! event held at Pyramid in New York City, on November 25,1996.  For the b-side of this single, I drew from Marco's \"Autoerotic Death\" recording for the label.  One of the earliest releases on BloodLust!, the first version was released in an edition of 50 copies in 2006 [B!006, C-30] and it sold out immediately .  A second version called \"Extended Autoerotic Death\" [B!025] was released later that year, and the title \"extended\" denotes the b-side remix work that Marco asked me to do to add new material to the original recording and to lengthen the release to 60-minutes.  For the b-side of this record, I went back to Marco's original recording and I found a choice segment of heavy, dark analog synth work to edit and remix.  I believe that the two tracks work very well together and I am happy that the unreleased song will finally see the light of day.  The records were pressed in multicolor marble vinyl that varies slightly from copy to copy, but in general, they tend to look more like dark bruises, or maybe the sick bile spit up by a dying plague victim.

The two also record primitive minimal-synth music, exclusively for Wierd Records [NYC], as A Vague Disquiet.  In The Fortieth Day, Reyes and Solotroff utilize guitar, bass, and synth to improvise \"sustained, withering blasts of high-pitched noise that are as distinct from one another as spotlights sweeping across the night sky; jackhammer clatter, jet-engine whines, and forlorn keyboard melodies dart in and out of those huge sounds with the grace and impunity of plovers picking a crocodile's teeth\" [Bill Meyer, Chicago Reader].\r\n\r\nThis CD contains the remastered, 58-minute-long version of the \"Pelusium: 540 AD\"  recordings, previously released in 2007 on cassette by Cipher Productions [Australia], in a handsome limited edition of 100 copies.  Drawn from the last of the first wave [2005-2007] of recording sessions made by Reyes and Solotroff, this release sees the duo delving deeper into a heavier drone mode, allowing thick walls of bass and guitar noise to envelop the mix, creating a contrast for the occasional loop, melody, or slothful beat to rise to the surface.  These recordings were re-mastered for the digital platform but allowing for true cassette saturation to work its magic.

The sound on this new album takes a far more confrontational approach, compared to the single, which had a darker, more death-industrial feel to it.  \"Your Messiah Will Fail\" is certainly one of the most straightforward power-electronics recordings that BloodLust! has released in quite some time, and it falls somewhere alongside the high-fidelity assault of the recent Twodeadsluts Onegoodfuck 7-inch and the classic P.E. approach of Slogun -- all the while maintaining its own personality and style.  Now expanded to a venomous two-piece group, as Andrew Grant [AKA The Vomit Arsonist] has joined Peter Lee [also the head honcho of the Force of Nature label] since the aforementioned single was released, the sound on this disc thoroughly defines what power-electronics means -- accosting the listener with a combination of harsh-yet-nuanced electronic sounds and potent vocals that feature prominently in the mix.  Have no doubts, this is a deliberate, carefully conceived and expertly executed album.  Something unusual for BloodLust! -- but certainly not exclusive to the label, based upon the anti-war stance of the upcoming Kriminaaliset Metsänhaltijat \"Koskemattomuus\" CD -- is the political nature of this release.  These songs were written prior to the last presidential election in the United States of America, and it provided Bereft main-man Peter Lee an opportunity to vent about, how in his opinion, the country was going in the wrong direction.  The lyrical content of \"Your Messiah Will Fail\" was directed at then-Presidential candidate Barack Obama, and the exceedingly \"star\" or \"godlike\" status placed upon him by the public, and how in Lee's opinion, no man or woman should ever have such exceedingly high standing in the political world.   Lee makes a vehement cry against the current two-party political system, and the ever-changing system of support that offers too many politicians the ability to often never have to take responsibility for their actions.

Canady is known for his dark analog synth fueled solo project, Angel of Decay, while power-electronics fans know him for his truly brutal band, Deathpile. Although possibly less-known in the noise world, it is likely that his most widely heard project is the industrial-metal band Dead World. He also founded the Malsonus label. Reed has a musical personality that is finely split into two distinct-yet-related solo projects: the analog synth-driven Envenomist and its dark electronic alter-ego, Luasa Raelon. Reed has also recorded under the name Brittle Foundries, and occasionally using his own name. He also runs the prolific Snip-Snip label and the newly launched Fatal Beliefs label. Solotroff has recorded lo-fi analog synth music under the name Super Eight Loop, which dates back to 1993. He released 100 hour-long missives and performed a single live show as S8L, before retiring the name in January 2009. Solotroff is also known for his bands BLOODYMINDED, The Fortieth Day, A Vague Disquiet, Intrinsic Action, Animal Law, and the newly formed Anatomy of Habit. As a synth player, Solotroff has also played live and/or in the studio with diverse artists including Brutal Truth, Consumer Electronics, and Wilt. He also runs the BloodLust! label. The three members have long, entwined histories together, dating back to the early 1990s, when Canady and Solotroff first met up. When Canady’s band Dead World was on Release/Relapse Records, Solotroff brought the group to New York City to play an infamous 1993 show with Intrinsic Action and Whitehouse. Solotroff also organized several shows with Deathpile and Angel of Decay, and his BloodLust! label went on to release numerous compact discs, 7-inch singles, and cassettes by Dead World, Deathpile, and Angel of Decay. Canady returned the favor by including what became a universally despised BLOODYMINDED song, “Moonwalker,” on the groundbreaking Malsonus power-electronics compilation CD, “The Sound of Sadism.” Canady has also overseen the graphic design of six Intrinsic Action compact discs and his design skills frequently keep the BloodLust! gears rolling smoothly. Reed and Solotroff first crossed literal paths in September 2004, at a rare show at Chicago’s Viaduct Theater, when BLOODYMINDED played with the touring projects Hive Mind, Luasa Raelon, and Redrot. The two met up again at the March 2005 edition of No Fun Fest in Brooklyn, NY, when Luasa Raelon and BLOODYMINDED both played on the Chondritic Sound stage. It was not long before Envenomist releases on vinyl, compact disc, and cassette, began appearing on BloodLust! Solotroff has organized several more Luasa Raelon and Envenomist shows in Chicago, and Reed even began sitting in on synth at key BLOODYMINDED shows. Reed and Solotroff previously toured the Midwest together in October 2007. Most recently, the three members of Nightmares all found themselves on the landmark “Wierd Compilation Volume II : Analogue Electronic Music 2008” – a four LP set that was released by BLOODYMINDED member Pieter Schoolwerth, on his New York-based Weird Records imprint. Canady appeared as Angel of Decay, Reed as Envenomist, and Solotroff – with BLOODYMINDED and The Fortieth Day member, Isidro Reyes – as A Vague Disquiet. With their long history of dark analog synth music, the three members of Nightmares have united to develop their own type of aural sleep disruption, characterized by frightening psychological content and aiming to provoke a strong feeling of imminent physical danger and a sensation of being trapped or suffocated.

The members of this shadow group of old-school industrial acolytes originally hail from Finland and from Karelia -- a region and an autonomous republic of northwest Russia, between the Gulf of Finland and the White Sea.  To paraphrase some of the band's own dogmatic yet oblique statements and manifestos, Kriminaaliset Metsänhaltijat quite accurately claim to have built their sound on the bones of such groups as S.P.K. and Throbbing Gristle, through a prism of Japanese harsh-noise and Finnish hardcore-punk, spewing out a nihilistic nightmare of diffused synth hiss, commanding metal percussion, waves of harsh-noise, anarcho-punk attitude, and dissident power-electronics.  This \"new\" album, which the band actually recorded in 2001, furthers the group's association with the anarcho-punk scene [CRASS, et al] by presenting a fiercely grim anti-war statement.  By conjuring the disasters of war, both historic and contemporary, the group lays the blame for the death of so many innocent civilians squarely on the shoulders of greedy politicians and big business.  Kriminaaliset Metsänhaltijat weave their aggressive, dark industrial-noise style with segments of traditional, romantic Finnish war songs from World War II, as well of impassioned battlefield vocal segments, creating a complex and compelling tableaux that should appeal to a broad group of listeners, including fans from the martial music, minimal synth, crusty punk, and noise scenes.

In the planning stages for over two years, this series of CDs cover all of Solotroff's solo output, released under his own name in 1995 and 1996.  All of these recordings were originally released on cassette by a small group of labels, including BloodLust!, G.R.O.S.S. [Japan], Less Than Zero [Italy], Old Europa Cafe [Italy], and Slaughter Productions [Italy]. Each release includes bonus material, consisting of either compilation tracks from the same labels, or newly created remixes. At the time that these recordings were made, Solotroff had switched gears between Intrinsic Action and BLOODYMINDED and he had recently completed the recording of the first 50 analog synthesizer-based Super Eight Loop cassettes. This small body of work gave Solotroff the opportunity to rely less on his synths and to try something different. In 1995, the idea of using guitar effect pedals as ones primary \"instrument\" in making heavy noise was still fairly novel, and Solotroff made use of an arsenal of distortion, delay, flanger, phaser, and other pedals, running either radio frequencies [scanner or shortwave] or his voice through the complex chain of FX. The results fit squarely into what was, at the time, being discussed as a new American noise style that was developing away from the power-electronics scene, and which eventually evolved into the harsh noise subgenre of today.\r\n\r\nFor the seventh entry in the series, the first two tracks are taken from Solotroff's 1996 cassette on BloodLust!, \"Sexual Homicide\" [B!008], his second solo recording for the label, released in a numbered edition of 50 copies, as part of an extensive cassette series on BloodLust!  The third track is a new re-mix/edit from the same release.  Hand-written notes and diagrams that were saved indicate that Solotroff employed a variety of equipment in the main recording sessions, including a battery of effect pedals and a scanner.  No synths were employed on this recording.  The material on \"Archive07\" is characterized by crumbling walls of mid-range frequency noise, anchored by rumbling bass, and punctuated by higher-end shards of sound. The packaging for these releases is based upon the format established with the two Mark Solotroff + Sshe Retina Stimulants CDs that were released by BloodLust! in 2008 [B!101 + B!102], and the entire series followed this unifying template.

In the planning stages for over two years, this series of seven CDs will cover all of Solotroff's solo output, released under his own name in 1995 and 1996.  All of these recordings were originally released on cassette by a small group of labels, including BloodLust!, G.R.O.S.S. [Japan], Less Than Zero [Italy], Old Europa Cafe [Italy], and Slaughter Productions [Italy]. Each release will include bonus material, consisting of either compilation tracks from the same labels, or newly created remixes. At the time that these recordings were made, Solotroff had switched gears between Intrinsic Action and BLOODYMINDED and he had recently completed the recording of the first 50 analog synthesizer-based Super Eight Loop cassettes. This small body of work gave Solotroff the opportunity to rely less on his synths and to try something different. In 1995, the idea of using guitar effect pedals as ones primary \"instrument\" in making heavy noise was still fairly novel, and Solotroff made use of an arsenal of distortion, delay, flanger, phaser, and other pedals, running either radio frequencies [scanner or shortwave] or his voice through the complex chain of FX. The results fit squarely into what was, at the time, being discussed as a new American noise style that was developing away from the power-electronics scene, and which eventually evolved into the harsh noise subgenre of today.\r\n\r\nFor the fifth entry in the series, the first four tracks are taken from Solotroff's 1996 cassette on G.R.O.S.S. (Japan), \"In The Mind Of A Monster\" [GRE210], the fifth track is a new reworking of the original recordings, and the sixth track is a previously unreleased song that was recorded for a Beast 666 Tapes (Japan) compilation that never saw the light of day.  Hand-written notes and diagrams that were saved indicate that Solotroff employed a variety of equipment in the main recording sessions, including a battery of effect pedals, in conjunction with scanner and analog synth [Roland SH-101 and Moog MG-1]. Unlike the hypnotic, bass-heavy drone at the core of \"Archive04,\" this latest entry in the series presents a full frequency spectrum that is in more squarely in attack mode. The packaging for these releases is based upon the format established with the two Mark Solotroff + Sshe Retina Stimulants CDs that were released by BloodLust! in 2008 [B!101 + B!102], and the entire series will follow this unifying template.

Unlike previous entries in the series, the two core tracks on this CD focus on bass, exploiting the low-end rumble as far as possible, without letting the master go beyond the point of no return.  Thus, the focus is less on brutal volume and more on maintaining the bass-driven wall of noise.  The compilation track, however, offers variety in the form of crisp higher-end noise that is delivered at suitablly high volume, so as to shock anyone back to reality, should the rumble have caused them to drift too far away.

These are professionally duplicated CDs, with single panel, double-sided inserts, featuring color artwork; in jewel boxes with shrinkwrap; released in 2010.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n1.  45 Minutes Of Rape And Murder (44:57)\r\n2.

This four-song disc compiles a selection of both previously released and currently unreleased songs, which offer the listener an opportunity to discover the music of Pharmakon.  The selection yields a concise and vivid glimpse into the mind of musician Margaret Chardiet, a young New York-based noise artist who is gaining increased attention, based upon her spectacularly vehement live performances.  Chardiet is a part of the vital Far Rockaway, Queens, experimental-noise scene that includes such groups as Yellow Tears, Halflings, Hands Rendered Useless, Teeny Bopper, Tension Fields, and more.  She also performs in the group Throat, with Ryan Woodhall of Yellow Tears, etc.  On this disc, Chardiet delivers a one-woman hailstorm of cold analogue electronic terror, both violently bewitching and pushing the boundaries of the darkest and the heaviest death-industrial music.  The brutal opening track, \"Xia Xinfeng,\" was previously included on a self-titled, self-released CD-R in 2007.  The more brooding \"Decline One\" is currently unreleased, and it will be included on the upcoming cassette, \"Backsliders and Prodigal Sons,\" to be released by City Mortuary in 2009.  The harsher \"Mound of Flesh, Cavern of Fluids\" was previously included on \"Inside and Out\", a split/collaborative double-cassette with Pharmakon and Hands Rendered Useless, released by Callow God in 2009.  Finally, the dark and threatening \"Locusts and Honeyblood\" is a sneak peek excerpt from a new full-length recording that will be released later this year.

I was so captivated by the first raw and visceral recordings that I heard by them that I immediately requested to hear more of their music, and casual contact between the band and BloodLust! quickly escalated into discussions about both archival and future releases.  The members of this shadow group of old-school industrial acolytes originally hails from Finland and from Karelia -- a region and an autonomous republic of northwest Russia, between the Gulf of Finland and the White Sea.  To paraphrase some of the band's own dogmatic yet oblique statements and manifestos, Kriminaaliset Metsänhaltijat quite accurately claim to have built their sound on the bones of such groups as S.P.K. and Throbbing Gristle, through a prism of Japanese harsh-noise and Finnish hardcore-punk, spewing out a nihilistic nightmare of diffused synth hiss, commanding metal percussion, waves of harsh-noise, anarcho-punk attitude, and dissident power-electronics.  This exciting and satisfying EP should act as an excellent introduction for those who are unfamiliar with this band, and in the coming months, BloodLust! will be releasing an all-new compact disc titled \"Koskemattomuus.\"  These are professionally duplicated CDs, with single panel, double-sided inserts featuring color artwork; in jewel boxes with shrinkwrap.\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nKM1 - tape, vinyl, percussion, synth, guitar, vox, field recordings\r\nKM2 - percussion, feedback, synth, drum machine, tape, vox & lyrics\r\nKM3 - percussion, guitar\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n1. \"Maailmanloppu\" (3:17)\r\n2. \"Kaaos\" (4:24)\r\n3. \"Maitosuu\" (7:03)\r\n4. \"Anarkkia\" (5:05)\r\n5. \"Uskonnonvastainen Enkeli\" (4:25)\r\n6. \"Vihan Mustat Enkelit\" (4:35)\r\n","options":[{"id":10349071,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29123381/-/B_129-KM-AKM-CD-Front.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29123381/-/B_129-KM-AKM-CD-Front.jpg","width":489,"height":427},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29123413/-/B_129-KM-AKM-CD-Back.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29123413/-/B_129-KM-AKM-CD-Back.jpg","width":486,"height":429},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29123453/-/B_129-Kriminaaliset_Metsanhaltijat-AKM-CD-insert-back-v3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29123453/-/B_129-Kriminaaliset_Metsanhaltijat-AKM-CD-insert-back-v3.jpg","width":1000,"height":992},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29123461/-/B_129-KM-AKM-CD-Disc_in_tray.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29123461/-/B_129-KM-AKM-CD-Disc_in_tray.jpg","width":494,"height":442}],"artists":[{"id":49183,"name":"Kriminaaliset Metsänhaltijat","permalink":"kriminaaliset-metsanhaltijat","url":"/artist/kriminaaliset-metsanhaltijat"}],"categories":[{"id":1754881,"name":"Compact Discs","permalink":"compact-discs","url":"/category/compact-discs"}]},{"id":3004823,"name":"B!128 The Fortieth Day \"Syria: 638 AD (The Complete Recordings)\" CD","permalink":"b-128-the-fortieth-day-syria-638-ad-the-complete-recordings-cd","position":102,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/b-128-the-fortieth-day-syria-638-ad-the-complete-recordings-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-12-10T00:08:09.000Z","description":"The Fortieth Day is the duo of Isidro Reyes and Mark Solotroff, both key players in the power-electronics outfit BLOODYMINDED, a unit known for its confrontational live shows. The two also record primitive minimal-synth music, exclusively for Wierd Records [NYC], as A Vague Disquiet.  In The Fortieth Day, Reyes and Solotroff utilize guitar, bass, and synth to improvise \"sustained, withering blasts of high-pitched noise that are as distinct from one another as spotlights sweeping across the night sky; jackhammer clatter, jet-engine whines, and forlorn keyboard melodies dart in and out of those huge sounds with the grace and impunity of plovers picking a crocodile's teeth\" [Bill Meyer, Chicago Reader].\r\n\r\nThis CD contains the remastered, 61-minute-long version of the complete recordings from the \"Syria: 638 AD\" sessions.  Diophantine Discs previously released an abridged version of these recordings [approximately 36-minutes in length] as a deluxe, white vinyl LP, housed in a black and silver, screen-printed, die-cut sleeve, limited to 300 copies.\r\n\r\nFor \"Syria: 638 AD,\" the duo took a different approach than on their previous releases, channeling their shifting and disorienting psychedelic and blackened noise into sustained walls of bass-heavy sound, knowing that the material would be pressed into deep vinyl grooves.  Not unlike Solotroff's six-hour-long 1996 collaboration with Sshe Retina Stimulants, \"Excellent Manipulation of Distorted Tape Death\" [re-visited on two related BloodLust! CDs in 2008], which has been re-evaluated by some noise fans as a direct precursor to the militantly static harsh noise walls [HNW] subgenre, the \"Syria: 638 AD\" sessions saw the duo take full advantage of available bass frequencies, creating monumentally glacial sweeps of low end, highlighted by analog synth sequences and distorted guitar washes that slowly surface in the mix.\r\n\r\nRe-mastered by Salvatore Dellaria for the digital platform; professionally duplicated CD, single panel, double-sided insert; black and white artwork; in jewel box with shrinkwrap; released in 2009\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n1. \"Part 1\" (30:30)\r\n2. \"Part 2\" (30:33)","options":[{"id":10349443,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29125173/-/B_128_The_Fortieth_Day-Syria_638_AD-CD-insert-front.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29125173/-/B_128_The_Fortieth_Day-Syria_638_AD-CD-insert-front.jpg","width":1000,"height":992}],"artists":[{"id":49151,"name":"The Fortieth Day","permalink":"the-fortieth-day","url":"/artist/the-fortieth-day"}],"categories":[{"id":1754881,"name":"Compact Discs","permalink":"compact-discs","url":"/category/compact-discs"}]},{"id":3005885,"name":"B!127 Locrian \"Drenched Lands\" LP + 3-inch CD","permalink":"b-127-locrian-drenched-lands-lp-+-3-inch-cd-sold-out","position":103,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/b-127-locrian-drenched-lands-lp-+-3-inch-cd-sold-out","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-12-10T02:58:59.000Z","description":"BloodLust! is extremely pleased to release the deluxe vinyl edition of “Drenched Lands,” the new Locrian album, which is the band’s first studio-recorded full-length. “Drenched Lands” finds Locrian effortlessly synthesizing music styles, all the while shrugging off easy genre descriptions, as they create an album that combines drone, black metal, and noise elements to portray qualities of beauty, sadness, radiance, and horror. Following the already acclaimed compact disc version that was recently co-released by At War With False Noise (Scotland) and Small Doses (USA), BloodLust! and Locrian worked closely together to conceive this handsome new record. Pressed in an edition of only 200 copies in clear vinyl, this record is housed in a handsome letter-pressed two-fold sleeve, printed at Chicago’s Dexterity Press. The inner flap of the sleeve holds a bonus 3-inch compact disc that contains music that will remain exclusive to this edition. LP recording and mixing were completed by Steve Beyerink at Phantom Manor, Chicago, while mastering and cutting duties were executed by Jason Ward at Chicago Mastering Service. The 3-inch CD was recorded by Philip von Zweck in January 2009, at WLUW 88.7 FM, on the Something Else broadcast, and it was mastered by Jason Soliday at Enemy, Chicago.

The group began as an exploratory collaboration between software engineer, visual artist, and composer Steve Fors [unseen|unknown, United Steelworkers Union, blstr] and schoolteacher, label proprietor, and experimental musician Chris Miller [Number None, Th’ Exceptional Child, REBIS] in 2007. Bound by a shared love of red wine, the Kranky aesthetic, and the eclectic recordings of off-beat Christian Rock visionaries Daniel Amos [aka D. A., Dä], the two began their musical partnership in the \"pop-drone\" group Flux Bouquet. After several well-received live shows, an EP, and a scrapped full-length, Fors and Miller began to indulge their more experimental impulses, giving birth to The Golden Sores. Utilizing a combination of electric and lap steel guitar, salvaged thrift store keyboards, pedals [both broken and boutique], obscure analogue synthesizers, and other obsolete noise-making esoterica, Fors and Miller have forged deep into the realms of drone -- continuing to pursue the perfect marriage of harsh and beautiful sounds, simple melodies, and song structures through spontaneous and ecstatic improvisation.  While I [Mark Solotroff, of BLOODYMINDED, etc.] have played a number of shows in Chicago with some of Fors and Millers' other groups, it was while listening to the excellent debut full-length by The Golden Sores - \"Ashdod to Ekron\" - that the idea first popped into my mind to discuss a release with them.  Seeing them play live a while after receiving that CD definitely helped to seal the deal for me.  And when a mysterious copy of \"A Peaceable Kingdom\" landed on my doorstep, I knew that it was certainly time.  The new CD, which was mastered for total sonic purity by Carl Saff, sits comfortably amidst both \"lighter\" and \"heavier\" BloodLust! releases by Chicagoans Haptic, Locrian, Neil Jendon, and The Fortieth Day, as well between other artists on the label like Envenomist and Culver.  Professionally duplicated CD, single panel, double-sided insert; color artwork; in jewel box with shrinkwrap.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n1. \"Double Gyres\" (9:06)\r\n2. \"The Awful Rowing Toward God\" (8:06)\r\n3. \"Klonopin\" (6:10)\r\n4. \"We'll Wield Fire\" (9:23)\r\n5. \"Ondine\" (5:28)\r\n6. \"A Vision\" (8:15)\r\n\r\nFrom: Brainwashed\r\n\r\nAlong with the likes of label mates (and fellow Chicagoans) Locrian, The Golden Sores have taken a modernized approach to drone, away from the traditional academia of La Monte Young and the like, but also diverging from the metal leanings of Sunn O))) into its own realm of ambience and electronic sensibilities.  Like Locrian, The Golden Sores lean heavily on synthesizers and electronics, though the two projects are quite unique in their own way. For the most part, even with the occasionally harsher moments of this disc, it never leads into metal riffing, and when it does begin to encroach on harsher sounds, there is usually a softer ambient underpinning that keeps the dissonance reigned in.  Opener \"Double Gyres\" begins with organ-like opening tones that slowly drift on, an opaque wall of sound that stays static as shrill guitar feedback cuts around. The guitar tone and texture is extremely raw, but not overly harsh or aggressive, but instead provides a great counterpoint to the otherwise peaceful electronic ambience. \"The Awful Rowing Toward God\" is similar in its presentation with the jagged guitar shrikes, though here with lower end buzzing amp noise and a simple, but buoyant bassline that keeps the song drifting along, occasionally resembling the more electronic dub oriented Main tracks, though here the guitar slides into raw noise territory about midway though before retreating back to a more purely ambient coda.  Living up to its title, \"Klonopin\" is a more subdued affair. There is the cutting guitar buzz here, but it is more mellow and a bit lower in the mix. It never fully disappears or becomes ignored, but it definitely allows for more of the ambient textures to shine through, and is at its core a more subdued work than the previous two, but never falling into overly boring or mundane territory. \"Ondine\" also keeps the fuzzed out guitar noise reigned in, focusing instead on slower gentle notes and slow-motion sheets of sound.  The closer, \"A Vision,\" distills much of the album down for an appropriate conclusion, combining the brittle guitar shriek with drifting synthetic ambience, though here it remains a relatively sparse mix that, while not harsh, instead has a cold, dark sense of isolation about it. The guitar swells to a buzz-saw level of noise before retreating, closing the album on a somber, restrained note.  This duo has created one of those kind of works that manages to maintain that tenuous balance between reflective ambient soundscapes and grinding, coarse guitar noise in a way that never feels like an unnecessary contrast, but instead mutually inclusive extremes that captivate for both the whisper and the roar that appear. (Creaig Dunton)\r\n\r\nFrom: The Chicago Reader\r\n\r\nIn a note he sent me with my copy of A Peaceable Kingdom, Steve Fors of the Golden Sores describes his duo with Chris Miller as an “ecstatic drone band.” How much sense that makes probably depends equally on which definition of ecstatic you’re using and your serotonin levels. If you’re imagining a noise version of the Polyphonic Spree, try again—this is more like watching the thin scrim of reality torn to shreds in front of your eyes, soundtracked by a pile of electronics and amps. “The Awful Rowing Toward God,” named after a collection of Anne Sexton’s poetry, combines sheets of harsh, granular electronic noise and swooping howls of guitar feedback to evoke a divinely inspired vision with an inconceivably unhappy ending. But on the next track, aptly titled “Klonopin,” the Golden Sores sound much more mellow: clean, sustained tones and washes of delay ebb and flow tidally, creating a subtly dynamic drone. (Miles Raymer)\r\n\r\nFrom: Anti-Gravity Bunny\r\n\r\nAlright guys. This is it. The one you've been waiting for. The drone record to come from some new band you've never heard of and completely kick every other drone record's ass. And where did they come from? Chicago. Duh.  By now, everyone has become supersaturated with drone. It seems like every kid these days is mashing the keys on their thrift store synth and burning it onto a CD-R in about as much time as it takes me to eat my morning bowl of Kashi's Honey Sunshine. But The Golden Sores know the virtue of patience and quality. This is their second record (the first, Ashdod To Ekron, I reviewed on diskant and is available as a free download) and sweet Jesus they've already made their masterpiece. I mean, Ashdod was amazing and all, but where the hell are they gonna go after A Peaceable Kingdom? I can't really imagine them making anything better.  The drone on Kingdom is made of the kind of heavenly tones that are essentially instrumentless. It could be coming from a guitar or a synthesizer (and, in fact, comes from both) but you'd never know and it doesn't even fucking matter. It's the kind of unwavering/wavering blissful static that keeps you turning up the volume every 2 or 3 minutes as your ears adjust, gently demolishing your eardrums.  I can't heap enough praise upon The Golden Sores and what they're doing for the drone community. Not only are they showing all the impostors how it's fucking done but they're giving us euphoria seeking music obsessors some of the highest quality shit out there. This record is so good the Sores could break up right now and it would hardly even matter.\r\n\r\nFrom: Aquarius Records\r\n\r\nRecord number two from these Midwestern dronelords, with some loose connection to black ambient soundscapers Locrian, even if it doesn't go much beyond playing together and living in the same city. That said, if you dug the Locrian record from a few lists back, odds are you'll dig this to.\r\nThere's no black metal woven into the Golden Sores' sound, instead they offer up more of a spaced out krautdrone, ethereral, ephemeral, but somehow still dense and thick and HEAVY. Not sure what the instrumentation is, we'd like to think there are some guitars in there, but it hardly matters, it's what comes out of the speakers that matters, not what goes onto the tape. And what is coming out of our speakers right now is some gloriously heavy, throbbing, pulsating buzzing psychedelic dronemusick. The first track is just some totally divine spaced out new age kosmiche drone, the second is a wall of crumbling blown out distorted buzz, like taking the primordial ooze of Earth or Sunn, and hurling it into the heart of a dying star. The tracks shift after that from deep cavernous rumbles, to billowing clouds of blackened shimmer, to muted snarling buzzscapes, to glimmering outer space druggy drifts, and finally, to a gorgeously sprawling expanse of low end throb, crank the bass on your stereo and you'll have things vibrating right off your shelves, a sound so phsyical, after it's over, merely hearing music without actually feeling it, barely seems like enough.\r\nDefinitive deep drone listening for sure, recommended for those of you who gravitate toward the heavier, spacier side of the low end spectrum, as previously explored by the likes of Expo 70, Locrian, Vulture Club, Fear Falls Burning, RST, To Blacken The Pages, Karl Bosmann, Pussygutt and the like.\r\n\r\nFrom: A Future In Noise\r\n\r\nEvery once and awhile, music arrives in my inbox (and in the case of the Golden Sores, in my mailbox, too!) that is exactly the kind of music I'm questing after. After becoming immersed in Natural Snow Buildings, I was recently investigating the music of La Monte Young and the Theatre of Eternal Music, and here come the Golden Sores, a duo comprised of Steve Fors and Chris Miller, who \"utilizing a combination of electric and lap steel guitar, salvaged thrift store keyboards, pedals (both broken and boutique), obscure analogue synthesizers, and other obsolete noise-making esoterica...have forged deep into the realms of drone\". Indeed- this is the very science of what drone is at work, the 'quintessence'. The six tracks of A Peaceable Kingdom (streamable in part on Last.fm and and Virb) may all be upwards of 5 minutes, though time just slips on by without notice throughout, from glittering surrealism (\"Double Gyres\"), what it might sound like if Wooden Shjips and Sun O))) collaborated on an instrumental track (\"The Awful Rowing Toward God\"), to channeling some nearly-spiritual energy (\"We'll Wield Fire\" and \"Ondine\")- very, very much recommended (see also BloodLust! album/ordering information for the Golden Sores)! Their previous release Ashdod to Ekron is available for free download in full on Last.fm (have a listen to \"Arphaxad\").\r\n\r\nFrom: Landschaft\r\n\r\nTowers of considered noise, shards of upward pointing glass bisecting the clouds. Think the fractured cathedrals of Lionel Fieninger. Repetition is TGS’s modus operandi, a device they employ to wondrous effect, with a pulsing living throb counterbalancing the higher pitches. I put the album on in the rain, thunder and lightning beating up the sky, a perfect moment for the pages of the music to enfold me. The tones shimmer and glide with fragile harmonics cutting across the darker, warmer tones. As with Ashdod, the Old Testament references hang over this work; a knife over the sacrificial lamb’s throat, each piece scratching and clawing it’s way into ones senses, and achieving a rare success from a wholly instrumental work – dialogue; a dialogue of texture, architecture and culture.\r\n\r\nFrom: Noisenoisenoise\r\n\r\nSometimes the problem with many drone records is that there can be a lack of, well, much at all really. Take Birchville Cat Motel’s Seventh ruined Hex. That CD almost stood still there was so little going on. When drone is done right it is a pretty awesome thing to behold. So here I introduce you to the Golden Sores, a duo of Chicago drone scenesters and mates of the better known Locrian. What The Golden Sores have done on A Peaceable Kingdom is to make drone not only transcendent but also remarkably interesting. There is a fair bit crammed into the repetitive drone landscapes that the duo create. My particular favourite is the awesome We’ll Wield Fire which is founded on a bedrock of droning noise much akin to a cello being played by a robot but made somehow beautiful. But is is also the top layer of the music which sets Golden Sores apart from many thinking they do this stuff well. There is texture in the sound created by several layers of drone effects and compositional tweaks. I mean this is just awesome and if you have been a sucker for Kevin Drumm’s unbelievably majestic Imperial Distortion (I’ll post on that soon) then I suggest that you would be wise to track this down. We all need beauty in our lives and although the Golden Sores may be the most inappropriately named band I’ve heard of in some time, they certainly create beuatiful music. I’m not sure if it is readily available yet but A Peaceable Kingdom can be ordered from Bloodlust!.\r\n\r\nFrom: I Heart Noise\r\n\r\nGS is a Chicago-based “ecstatic drone” duo of Steve Fors and Chris Miller. “Peaceable Kingdom” is their second release (a follow-up to 2008 “Ashdod To Ekron”, which came out on Drone Cowboy label) and their first for BloodLust!.  “Kingdom” is all about an exploration of the sonic state which exists between the aforementioned ecstatic drone, trippy ambience and even noise (although latter makes appearance only on the second track, “The Awful Rowing Toward God”).  In general it reminds me much of Zoviet-France / Nocturnal Emission work circa 80s – plenty of smooth, flowing sonic textures, surreal loops and sounds that were most likely generated electronically but resemble a whole multitiude of things from bells to electric sparks dancing around the edges of listeners speakers.  The album closer (”A Vision”) is akin some of the untitled tracks on Richard D. James/Aphex Twin 1994 opus “Selected Ambient Works Vol. 2″ – it starts out with a minimal synth line and unfolds slowly throughout its 6 minutes of duration.  With all of the tracks on “Kingdom” being more than 5 minutes long, this CD could’ve easily overstayed its welcome, but its saved by a huge diversity between tracks and countless shapes, textures and variations that Golden Sores were able to come up with on this record.\r\n\r\nArtist website (with music): http://virb.com/goldensores","options":[{"id":10349003,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29123205/-/TGS-APK-mock-up-FRONT_copy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29123205/-/TGS-APK-mock-up-FRONT_copy.jpg","width":505,"height":440},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29123245/-/TGS-APK-mock-up-BACK_copy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29123245/-/TGS-APK-mock-up-BACK_copy.jpg","width":507,"height":448},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29123277/-/B_126-peaceable_insert_back.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29123277/-/B_126-peaceable_insert_back.jpg","width":1000,"height":992},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29123285/-/TGS-APK-mock-up-Disc_in_tray.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29123285/-/TGS-APK-mock-up-Disc_in_tray.jpg","width":484,"height":449}],"artists":[{"id":49187,"name":"The Golden Sores","permalink":"the-golden-sores","url":"/artist/the-golden-sores"}],"categories":[{"id":1754881,"name":"Compact Discs","permalink":"compact-discs","url":"/category/compact-discs"}]},{"id":3006449,"name":"B!125 Mauthausen Orchestra \"High Opinion of Oneself\" 7-inch","permalink":"b-125-mauthausen-orchestra-high-opinion-of-oneself-7-inch-sold-out","position":105,"price":14.0,"default_price":14.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/b-125-mauthausen-orchestra-high-opinion-of-oneself-7-inch-sold-out","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-12-10T04:31:20.000Z","description":"Pressed in a numbered edition of 100 copies; blue vinyl; royal blue labels with silver text; professionally-printed, color, fold-over sleeves; 33 RPM.

On his fourth 7-inch single for the label, Zoppo finds new corners of the austere, unsettling, and dark analog synth world to discover, despite the fact that many of his listeners are still left in the choking dust of his legacy of violent and raw power-electronics, as recently hinted at within the grooves of the vital Broken Flag box set released by Vinyl-on-demand in 2007.

Taking full advantage of the cavernous music and art space, the trio unleashed -- for the first time in front of an audience -- their distinctive tri-vocal approach, utilizing both treated and pure voice.  The combination of styles included Lamont's looped deep chants, Right-Eye Rita's spellbinding electrified wails, and Solotroff's feedback-laced drones.  Bruce Lamont  is best known for his band Yakuza, one of the metal world's truly avant-garde and forward-thinking groups.  Lamont also performs solo and with a diverse selection of experimental and improvising musicians.  Right-Eye Rita is a Chicago musician and artist who performs solo and with a variety of kindred spirits.  The magazine STOPSMILING described her performances as being “like Lydia Lunch drenched in absinthe.\"  Mark Solotroff is a Chicago musician and artist known for his bands BLOODYMINDED, The Fortieth Day, Intrinsic Action, etc.  Solotroff has a particular obsession with high-pitched feedback, which he actually managed to temper a bit during the performance on this CD.  This release is recommended for fans of experimental vocal work, true original industrial music, dark rituals, and artists such as Diamanda Galas, Abruptum, and the earliest moments of Current 93 and Coil.

Not only was Lee beyond accommodating about letting us piggyback on the Inseminoid/Fecalove tour, but he was kind enough to also drive us around the U.K. for several days. I returned to the States with a thick stack of Culver CDs, which took some time to get through. I was most pleased that I enjoyed the music on the CDs as much as I enjoyed meeting and spending time with Lee, himself. After hearing more and more Culver recordings, as well as a few excellent psychedelic/noise CDs by Stokoe's band Marzuraan, I was convinced that I needed to release something by him. \"Sugar Tip\" is that thing, packaged in handsome collage artwork created by Stokoe for this release. One of the main things that I have noticed about this CD is that it feels like the air gets sucked out of the room when I listen to it. While it is far denser and more complex a sound than Damion Romero's work, the two share the odd ability to move air around with sound in a fairly unsettling way. \"Sugar Tip\" is definitely heavier than drone, but it is definitely not simple harsh noise. I might refer to it as blackened psychedelic noise. Oh, and do not forget that this guy plays in Skullflower, these days, too.

This shadowy period was prior to the band's mutation into a filthy, free-sludge-doom-psychedelic behemoth, as heard on their critically acclaimed album \"Raw Child\" [2007, Animal Disguise Recordings], an Aquarius Records record of the week and hailed by Julian Cope on his Head Heritage website.  The first two tracks on this new disc come from the landmark \"Abuse\" CD [2005, Husk Records], which completely blew me away when I first heard it, and which to this day remains a key post-Millennial noise recording for me.  Only 100 copies of that CD were released upon a mostly unsuspecting public.  \"Breathing Sewage\" [2005, Animal Disguise Recordings] is the A-Side of the ultra-limited-edition tour-only cassette of the same name.  A mere 20 copies of that tape were initially produced, although thankfully, ADR made it available again later on.  The sinuous and turbid connection between these three affiliated tracks comprises lurking danger, darkness, discomfort, dissonance, deviance, and dread.  The fourth and final track is a long-discussed collaboration between Cadaver In Drag and myself [Mark Solotroff of BLOODYMINDED, The Fortieth Day, Anatomy of Habit, ex-Super Eight Loop, ex-Animal Law, ex-Intrinsic Action, etc.] and it functions as a true melding of this earlier C.I.D. noise style with what feels like the most straightforward power-electronics song that I have worked on in several years.

I originally came to know Neil in the early 1990's, and if I recall correctly, we bonded over the U.K. band, Loop. But maybe that was his band mate, Jerome?  In any case, after losing touch with each other for a long measure of time, I have seen and heard much more of Neil's work in the last two years - and more recently - after seeing him destroy a small local venue with a live solo modular synth set - I knew that it was time to talk to him about a release for BloodLust! Neil's skill as an improviser may come into play on \"Invisibility,\" but at the core of these recordings there is what seems to be a familiarity with the palette of early industrial music, be it Maurizio Bianchi, Lustmord, instrumental Throbbing Gristle [grittier than \"After Cease to Exist,\" certainly], etc. Neil recently played an excellent set, opening up for Consumer Electronics, in Chicago, and it struck me how well his flavor of synth sits with other types of noise and experimental music, even if I know that on one hand, he comes from a more psychedelic, shoe-gazer-aware place.

Throughout the 2000s, this Boston band (Shane Broderick, Ted Sweeney, and Joshua Hydeman [now of Portland, OR]) has been evolving through the worlds of grindcore, violent power-electronics, and confrontational performance art.  I was handed a copy of their \"P.T. Barnum's Gallery Of Masturbatorial Disenchantment\" CD at No Fun Fest, a few years ago, and after I listened to it, I pretty much knew that TDS OGF and BLOODYMINDED had an enigmatic connection that was worth pursuing, even if I was rather thrown off the scent by their particular brand of humor -- which prevails to this day, as evidenced by the cringeworthy title of the fourth track on this single.  An October 2007 Chicago show totally sealed the deal for me.  Not since Slogun had I witnessed such a believably violent outburst from a power-electronics group.  And TDS OGF had the sound to back up their attitude.  The tsunami that rushed out of the massive Suffering Bastard PA that night was every bit as potent as their stage presence.  At that point, I knew that a BloodLust! release had to happen.  Finally, In March 2008, BLOODYMINDED went to Boston to play the TDS OGF-curated Northeast Regional Noise and Power Electronics Festival (they do like their wordy titles, don't they?), and the necessary bonding was completed.  Take that how you will.  Band member Ted Sweeney created the two amazing collages that grace the front and back covers, and similar to their excellent 12-inch on Apop Records, this single was mastered by James Plotkin (of Khanate, Khylst, OLD, etc.) for maximum sonic potency.  I had no doubt in my mind that they would deliver a concise and ferocious monster.

Their unique sound is derived from the use of a variety of instruments, ranging from samplers to ethnic instruments, and guitar synths to shortwave generators. In addition to their extensive musical output, Sigillum S also works in the areas of visual art and text.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n1. \"Terror Auto-Obstetrics\" (6:00)\r\n2. \"Transkathartick Endoscopy\" (6:55)\r\n3. \"Suck Inside Thee Ov Bulb\" (7:53)\r\n4. \"Purulence Peaks, Hairy Knobs, And Death Disturbances\" (6:50)\r\n","options":[{"id":10351959,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29136009/-/B_108-Sigillum_S-Terror_Auto-Obstetrics-front_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29136009/-/B_108-Sigillum_S-Terror_Auto-Obstetrics-front_cover.jpg","width":1000,"height":991},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29136045/-/B_108-group_photo-old.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29136045/-/B_108-group_photo-old.jpg","width":787,"height":535},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29136187/-/SIGILLUMS-2-sm.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29136187/-/SIGILLUMS-2-sm.jpg","width":1000,"height":700}],"artists":[{"id":49163,"name":"Sigillum S","permalink":"sigillum-s","url":"/artist/sigillum-s"},{"id":49165,"name":"Sshe Retina Stimulants","permalink":"sshe-retina-stimulants","url":"/artist/sshe-retina-stimulants"}],"categories":[{"id":1754881,"name":"Compact Discs","permalink":"compact-discs","url":"/category/compact-discs"}]},{"id":3006155,"name":"B!107 The Fortieth Day \"III\" CD","permalink":"b-107-the-fortieth-day-iii-cd","position":123,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/b-107-the-fortieth-day-iii-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-12-10T03:42:22.000Z","description":"CD edition of out-of-print cassette, originally released in a numbered edition of 50 copies in 2006; The Fortieth Day is the duo of Isidro Reyes and Mark Solotroff, both key players in the power-electronics outfit BLOODYMINDED, a unit known for its confrontational live shows.

The cassette was housed in a white vinyl clamshell case with a black and white cover that featured a very timely raccoon-eyed picture of Karla Homolka, on the front, and the now infamous yearbook photograph of Homolka's deceased sister, Tammy Lyn, on the back.  Trainspotters may also want to take note of the title of track six --  and while you are at it, check into track four -- and then dig very deep regarding the title of track three...  Like the first four re-issue CDs in the set, the audio for this re-mastered version was skillfully prepared in Lille, France, by Jerome Nougaillon, while John Balistreri's graphic design follows the standard that he created for the ongoing series.  \"The Angels Are In Pain...\"  True Crime Electronics - FTW.

The 60-minute recording is characterized by a mixture of spoken voices, heavy screaming, audience member participation, out of control synthesizers, feedback, rumbling, sudden \"rushing\" sounds, screeching, etc., all vying for the listener's attention. These professionally duplicated CD-Rs are limited to 200 numbered copies and they are packaged in black and white, printed, fold-over sleeves. Released in 2007.\r\n\r\nThese recordings were made in November 2006, by Mark Solotroff (for Bloodyminded), at Conservatory, Chicago, Illinois - solely utilizing live versions of songs from the \"Magnetism\" CD that were recorded live during the August 2006 Bloodyminded tour - as source material. Live recordings were made at: Skylab Gallery, Columbus, OH, August 3; Reversible Eye Gallery, Chicago, IL, August 4; The Church, Minneapolis, MN, August 5; Hall Mall, Iowa City, IA, August 6; Valhalla Gallery, Kansas City, MO, August 7; Spooky Action Place, St. Louis, MO, August 8; The Frowny Bear, Lexington, KY, August 9; Red Room, Kalamazoo, MI, August 10; Behind The Green Door, Detroit, MI, August 11. For this tour, Bloodyminded was Nicole Chambers, Xavier Laradji, Pieter Schoolwerth, and Mark Solotroff; with Ed Knigge (Chicago), Chris Mack (Chicago), and Isidro Reyes (St. Louis). The digital transfer and the mater were made in December 2006, by Jason Soliday, at Enemy, Chicago, Ilinois. Thanks to our touring parters in (Burning) Graveyards, Lambsbread, and Demons.

Detroit chapter, this time coming from Aaron Dilloway. For this single, Dilloway (Hanson Records, Wolf Eyes, The Beast People, Miscarriage, Violent Ramp, etc.) offers up two unique pieces of unsettlingly dark electronics. The creeping, slow-paced A-Side is highlighted by its underwater synth style and its insistent-yet-mysterious vocals. The B-Side starts off with a much harder, oscillating impact, and it evolves into something akin to what might be the final sounds heard before a psychedelic death. Fans of early 1980s synth, industrial, and power- electronics (e.g. Maurizio Bianchi, Lustmord, Esplendor Geometrico, Kraang) will surely bask in the decayed, anxiety-inducing sound of this record. private series number thirteen\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\nA: White Hair \t\t\r\nB: Amputation\r\n","options":[{"id":10355939,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29152683/-/B_-private_series_7-inch.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29152683/-/B_-private_series_7-inch.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29152707/-/B_073-Aaron_Dilloway-7-Inch-insert_image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29152707/-/B_073-Aaron_Dilloway-7-Inch-insert_image.jpg","width":866,"height":595}],"artists":[{"id":49209,"name":"Aaron Dilloway","permalink":"aaron-dilloway","url":"/artist/aaron-dilloway"},{"id":49211,"name":"Wolf Eyes","permalink":"wolf-eyes","url":"/artist/wolf-eyes"}],"categories":[{"id":1754931,"name":"Records","permalink":"records","url":"/category/records"}]},{"id":3007635,"name":"B!069 Slogun \"Hunting Humans\" CD","permalink":"069-slogun-hunting-humans-cd","position":149,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/069-slogun-hunting-humans-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-12-10T08:52:04.000Z","description":"This is the fourth release in the \"History of Violence\" re-issue campaign. \"Hunting Humans\" was originally released on cassette, in 1996, by the now-defunct Italian label, Less Than Zero (LTZ022) - in over-sized, folded, A5 packaging, with a handsome vellum overlay.
