Was $22.95!!\r\n\r\nThis may well be one of the strangest books you'll want to own. Take a journey back in time to an alternate reality where charmingly creepy characters exist comfortably within crumbling walls, where bugs are beautiful and mystery is around every corner. Each page is full of strange images from the mind of HaggisVitae, the alter ego of artist Julie Miller. Meet Starboy of the Oceans Blue, Tobias Waddlecrock and his unreasonably large insect friends, a pair of avian hats who refuse to get along, a supreme whirling dervish master who writes Haiku--to name but a few. Fall down this beautifully illustrated, full-color rabbit hole and find you never want to return. If you love illustrated novels, the charming darkness of Tim Burton, the wit of Edward Gorey, the object lessons of The Brothers Quay, then you might just enjoy this journey into humor, madness, magic, mayhem and a rather large dollop of science-y goodness. Pour a cup of tea and get ready for a very odd adventure. And away we go!</BR> </BR>\r\n\r\n\"you have grabbed an aspect of the fictioneer's art, magnified it, and inflected a whole fresh set of art fictions from it.

Avery is a misfit child, to her parents, teachers and classmates. Her struggle is to hold her ground, survive the conventional world, and keep herself terribly alive in a place where true magic is said to exist only in books, not in real life. \r\n\r\nThis is a tale of courage and of being proud of your differences and true to yourself. \r\n\r\nHow far would you go to follow your dreams? \r\n\r\nSuitable for age 10+ (adults love this book as well!)\r\n\r\nThe Girl Who Read To Birds is a full-color, lushly illustrated book that will be treasured by young and old alike.
