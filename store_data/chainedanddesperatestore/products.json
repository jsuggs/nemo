No mistake should be made however; CHAINED AND DESPERATE’s style is as original as it can get with the band members’ influences ranging from Bathory and Death to Candlemass, Manilla Road and Manowar.\r\n\r\nThis release is also the first of the ‘BLACKEST PITCH SERIES’. All releases under this series will feature an “eclectic” blend of black metal with the first pressing always strictly limited to 333 numbered copies housed inside a unique digipack with an aesthetic befitting of the music contained within. Silver metallic printing on black glossy background and a loose insert with the album’s cover included inside will make each B.P.S. release a unique item for the truly die-hard black metal fan","options":[{"id":16517469,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49974201/-/CD-cover-low-150x150.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49974201/-/CD-cover-low-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2714781,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
