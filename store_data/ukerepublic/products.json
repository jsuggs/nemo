The extended scale length greatly improves intonation over similar models and allows for an acoustic volume loud enough to enjoy without plugging into an amplifier.  The sloped ergo-glide top makes this instrument extremely comfortable to hold.

The back is a round-back or bowl shape made of alternating staves of sheesham rosewood (Dalbergia sissoo) and lacewood (Platanus orientalus). The neck is solid sheesham rosewood and features a nut width of 36mm (1 7/16 inch) with a bone nut. This instrument is outfitted with lute-style ebony friction pegs. The bridge, also made of sheesham rosewood incorporates a genuine bone saddle. Overall size: 23 x 7.5 x 4 inches.  An end-pin strap button is standard.\r\n\r\nThe Baroq-uleles™ come in 3 sizes including Soprano, Concert and Tenor. Each size is graced with its own unique rosette design, each of which is taken from museum examples from the 16th and 17th centuries. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the three sizes, the Baroq-ulele™ is also available with 3 types of woods for the back: sheesham rosewood, lacewood (chenar) or variegated with alternating staves of rosewood and lacewood. Finally, ensuring that you will find an instrument that best fits your needs, these instruments are also available with two types of tuning keys: Baroque-style ebony tuning pegs or standard ukulele friction tuners.\r\nPlease inquire about other woods & tuners at:\r\nsailorjim@ukerepublic.com\r\n\r\nSoprano, Concert & Tenor Sizes available.\r\n\r\nContact us for International Shipping Rates.","options":[{"id":12304184,"name":"Default","price":249.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.95,"amount_with_others":9.99,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35714244/-/P1050833.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35714244/-/P1050833.JPG","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35714212/-/P1050828.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35714212/-/P1050828.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35714236/-/P1050830.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35714236/-/P1050830.JPG","width":1000,"height":502},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35714220/-/P1050829.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35714220/-/P1050829.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35714260/-/P1050843.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35714260/-/P1050843.JPG","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1571153,"name":"Ukuleles","permalink":"ukuleles","url":"/category/ukuleles"},{"id":1592319,"name":"Pineapple & Unique Ukuleles","permalink":"pineapple-unique-ukuleles","url":"/category/pineapple-unique-ukuleles"},{"id":1583322,"name":"Soprano Ukuleles","permalink":"soprano-ukuleles","url":"/category/soprano-ukuleles"},{"id":1630853,"name":"MidEast Ukuleles","permalink":"mideast-ukuleles","url":"/category/mideast-ukuleles"},{"id":1583384,"name":"NEW!!!","permalink":"new","url":"/category/new"},{"id":1584404,"name":"Padded Uke Bag/Foam Case Included","permalink":"padded-uke-bag-foam-case-included","url":"/category/padded-uke-bag-foam-case-included"},{"id":1584581,"name":"Satin/Matte Finishes","permalink":"satin-matte-finishes","url":"/category/satin-matte-finishes"}]},{"id":3451556,"name":"Makai Kahakai Mahogany Cutaway Tenor Ukulele","permalink":"makai-mahogany-cutaway-tenor","position":196,"price":189.99,"default_price":189.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/makai-mahogany-cutaway-tenor","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-03-19T06:17:32.000Z","description":"Makai TK-65 Mahogany Cutaway Tenor Ukulele\r\nGreat player with Belcat pickup and built in tuner.  \r\nCut-away to reach those extra frets.

Concert, Variegated, Pegs (Item Code: UBCVP) Based on the round-back guitar found in Germany, the Baroq-uleles™ are one of the most option-rich lines of instruments we carry. This Concert-sized instrument is based upon a 375mm (14 3/4 inches) scale. It features a European spruce soundboard with a four-point rosette design taken from a 17th century lute. The back is a round-back or bowl shape made of alternating staves of sheesham rosewood (Dalbergia sissoo) and lacewood (Platanus orientalus). The neck is solid sheesham rosewood and features a nut width of 36mm (1 7/16 inch) with a bone nut. This instrument is outfitted with lute-style ebony friction pegs. The bridge, also made of sheesham rosewood incorporates a genuine bone saddle. An end-pin strap button is standard. A soft case is included.\r\n\r\nThe Baroq-uleles™ come in 3 sizes including Soprano, Concert and Tenor. Each size is graced with its own unique rosette design, each of which is taken from museum examples from the 16th and 17th centuries. In addition to the three sizes, the Baroq-ulele™ is also available with 3 types of woods for the back: sheesham rosewood, lacewood (chenar) or variegated with alternating staves of rosewood and lacewood. Finally, ensuring that you will find an instrument that best fits your needs, these instruments are also available with two types of tuning keys: Baroque-style ebony tuning pegs or standard ukulele friction tuners.
