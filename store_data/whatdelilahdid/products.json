with individual crosses ready to stitch over, this large cushion kit is perfect for beginners, people with poor eyesight, those who prefer not to count their stitches, and awesome folks who just appreciate good design. At around 15 hours stitching time it is also significantly quicker to complete than the average embroidered cushion.\r\n\r\nIt is entirely washable* so you needn't be afraid to use it when it's finished, and it travels well too - the perfect project to pop into your bag for a cheeky little holiday stitching session, should you be so inclined.\r\n\r\nThe kit is a doddle to put together and makes a large (16\"/41cm) square cushion cover with an envelope back - no backing fabric, zip or sewing machine needed.
