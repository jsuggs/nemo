After their weak demo the group reconsidered their views on Dark Art and recorded a really killing album indeed. Marshy, dank, autumnal, foggy Black Metal masterpiece from abyss of Kryvian underground. For SLAGMAUR, LIFELOVER and BEHERIT fanatics. Wimps who don't know such groups can go to …myspace for acquaintance and dribbling. You are dissatisfied? We don't give a fuck... Only devil-may-care attitude to others' opinions, trends and scene can generate Black Diamond! Only Individuality and Scorn to communities is a straight way to universal Hatred!...Indeed! Possession statements were and (will always be) pompous and heartfelt and they show reality precisely.
