I took my inspiration from record covers:  the Ramones and the Ultra Magnetic MCs. What fascinated me right away about graffiti was how, with few resources, you could conquer the attention of many people:  a spray can or a rock to scratch the glass could make people talk about you&#8230;fantastic! Now, at 31, I still want people talking about me.  While I writing less, my statements have become all the more provocative. Now behind me, aside from a crooked back from scoliosis and slouching, I have had exhibitions, trouble with the law, debts, the mayor of Milan that won&#8217;t leave me alone, a sizable fan club, my friend Lele Saveri that follows me everywhere taking pictures of all I do and a book (DUMBO: Acts of Vandalism and Stories of Love). While in front of me, aside from many confused ideas about what is truly good in this life, I have all of my new projects to show you as soon as I have the chance.\r\n\r\n\tI met DB at a stoop sale he was doing.  I stopped to look through all the used and new cds that he was selling. And then we started a conversation&#8230;...Are you a musician? My answer was confused: No&#8230; I&#8217;m a vandal, I mean, I was a vandal; that was my job until my son was born&#8230;wait, I still do vandalism but in a different way&#8230;but that&#8217;s another story, forget it. And then the conversation moved more into art and we discovered that the same person who wrote the preface of my book had sold him 5 or 6 painted bottles. I bought 3 cds from him for 6 dollars, 2 new and 1 used. Hey, I love music.\r\n\r\n\tDumbo&#8217;s new book can be found at \r\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Dumbo-Acts-Vandalism-Stories-Love/dp/8889431954\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dumbo on Amazon\"> Amazon </a>\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":529023,"name":"GIRLS / Medium / Red","price":24.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":297747,"name":"Medium / Red","price":24.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":297748,"name":"Large / Red","price":24.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":335211,"name":"X-Large / Red","price":24.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":529024,"name":"GIRLS / Medium / White","price":24.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":335212,"name":"Small / White","price":24.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":335213,"name":"Medium / White","price":24.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":335214,"name":"Large / White","price":24.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":18.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2240985/-/live_city.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2240985/-/live_city.jpg","width":537,"height":537}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":75591,"name":"Dumbo","permalink":"dumbo","url":"/category/dumbo"},{"id":52772,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":60567,"name":"Praying Cow","permalink":"praying-cow","position":2,"price":24.0,"default_price":24.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/praying-cow","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2007-12-14T16:16:29.000Z","description":"by <strong>Norik</strong>\r\n\r\n\tBetween connecting with his scandinavian roots via lutefisk, compulsively checking his Facebook, and playing Mortal Kombat, Norik enjoys adorning people’s torsos with silkscreened mutant cows and rosaries.\r\n\r\n\tApparel design is not Norik’s only fancy.
