The day is always that little bit brighter when you're wearing your favourite shoes, isn't it?\r\n\r\nThis is an original, hand-pulled print from a limited edition of 250 that is signed and numbered.\r\n\r\nI originally made this piece for a Gocco exhibition and printed a small edition in burgundy and light green. I liked it so much, I decided to make a second edition in one of my favourite colour combinations - red and pale blue (I love red shoes!).\r\n\r\nIt's printed on an absolutely beautiful 230 gsm recycled, acid-free card stock which is a lovely eggshell colour with little blue & red flecks - it really does resemble a speckled egg. The print could easily be matted for an 8x10 inch frame or larger, or trimmed down to fit a 5x7 inch frame.\r\n\r\nPrint Gocco is a small-format Japanese screen-printing system that creates unique effects different to conventional screen-printing; kind of a cross between a screen and relief print, with beautiful textures and variations. \r\n\r\n<em><strong>Details:</strong></em>\r\nSheet size 5.85x8.25 inch (A5 148.5x210 mm)\r\nPrint area 4.2x5.8 inch (106x147 mm) approx.\r\nEdition size: 250\r\nSigned and numbered on the front\r\n\r\n<em>Please note:</em> due to the fact that they are hand-printed, there may be some minor variations between prints.\r\n\r\nEach print is packaged with foam-core backing in a clear resealable cello sleeve.\r\n\r\nTake a look at <a href=\"http://shop.magicjelly.com.au/products?search=Favourite+Shoes&search_submit=Go\">other products in this range</a>.\r\n\r\nAll designs are unique, original and exclusive to Magic Jelly, and handmade in South Australia.\r\n\r\n<div style='display:none'>Favorite Shoes</div>\r\n<div style='display:none'>screenprint</div>","options":[{"id":24678429,"name":"Default","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":9,"name":"China","code":"CN"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":18,"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HK"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":126,"name":"Indonesia","code":"ID"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":27,"name":"Malaysia","code":"MY"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":182,"name":"Philippines","code":"PH"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76799472/-/Fave-Shoes-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76799472/-/Fave-Shoes-1.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76948728/-/Fave-Shoes-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76948728/-/Fave-Shoes-2.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":22379,"name":"Gocco Prints","permalink":"gocco-prints","url":"/category/gocco-prints"},{"id":2447613,"name":"$15 to $50","permalink":"15-to-50","url":"/category/15-to-50"}]},{"id":7291707,"name":"Magic Girl Drink Coaster","permalink":"magic-girl-drink-coaster","position":2,"price":8.5,"default_price":8.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/magic-girl-drink-coaster","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-19T08:47:12.000Z","description":"A 3.5 inch (89 mm) cork-backed drink coaster featuring <em>Magic Girl</em>, faithful companion of <a href=\"http://shop.magicjelly.com.au/product/jelly-the-cat-drink-coaster\">Jelly the Cat</a>.\r\n\r\nDrink coasters are usually sold in sets, but I've chosen to package mine individually to allow you the flexibility to purchase assorted designs in any quantity, or to collect them one at a time.

For this pendant I have chosen a lightly textured 100% cotton rag fine art paper that delivers rich colour and fine, crisp detail.\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Details:</strong></em>\r\nResin-filled oval pendant 1.6x.1.2 inch (40x30 mm)\r\nSilver-plated flattened long-short link chain\r\nChain 18 inch (45.5 cm) from clasp to loop\r\nSterling silver findings\r\nGift box 3.2x2.2x1 inch (57x80x25 mm)\r\n\r\n<em>Please note:</em> this is a hand-crafted item so there may be slight variations between the pictured pendant and the one you purchase. Part of the nature of hand-poured resin is that it may sometimes contain small bubbles, but this will not detract from the appearance and quality of the finished piece.

It hangs from a waxed cotton cord with sterling silver findings.\r\n\r\nThis jewellery range is an expression of my passion for paper and ink. I love the way the resin magnifies the paper textures and printed images, transforming them into shining little gems preserved within the resin's glassy depths.\r\n\r\nWith a background in digital art and printmaking, I'm focused on the quality of my printed artwork, and choose beautiful fine art papers to suit the style and printing process of each piece. For this pendant I have chosen a lightly textured 100% cotton rag fine art paper that delivers rich colour and fine, crisp detail.\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Details:</strong></em>\r\nResin-filled oval pendant 2.2x.1.7 inch (55x43 mm)\r\nWaxed cotton cord 18 inch (45.5 cm) from clasp to loop\r\nSterling silver findings\r\nGift box 3.5x3.5x1 inch (90x90x25 mm)\r\n\r\n<em>Please note:</em> this is a hand-crafted item so there may be slight variations between the pictured pendant and the one you purchase.
