These extra channels can be included in the scan sequence of normal CB channels. \r\n\r\nPerformance - the full 5 Watt output power combined with a super sensitive receiver (-123 dBm threshold), gives maximum range when transmitting and receiving.\r\n\r\nConstruction - the backbone of the TX6200 is a one piece solid die-cast frame enclosing a single printed circuit board. The front cover is manufactured from a thick polycarbonate ABS blend. The cover also includes a rubber 'standout' to protect the LCD window against scratching, making the TX6200 an extremely durable, rugged and robust handheld.\r\n\r\nPower Management - Incorporated into the design of the TX6200 is an advanced 'battery Save' and 'Sleep Mode', offering prolonged battery life. This feature combined with the standard Nickel Metal Hydride large capacity battery (1200 mAh) vastly increases talk time. Another useful feature is the battery pack's own charging socket so the battery can be trickle charged at home or in a vehicle* without being attached to the radio (*optional vehicle charger BCV001 required).\r\n\r\nOperation - The TX6200 is one of the most simple and versatile units on the market today. The menu driven software and multiple function keys enable quick and simple customisation and user setup. Extra listening frequencies can be added from the keys without the need of external computer programming.\r\nLess....\r\nFeatures\r\n5/1 Watt switchable RF output Selectable priority channel. 1200 mAh NiMH battery pack. 19 extra receive channels (user programmable).

Designed in Australia, this decoder ticks all the boxes for both the home user and the traveller. The first thing you'll love about this unit is its size.  Measuring a mere 220 mm wide it will fit in any entertainment cabinet at home or on a shelf in a caravan.  Being powered by an external transformer (included), the unit can be operated from a 240V AC socket at home or via a cigarette lead (not included) - click HERE to purchase the 12V lead.  Power consumption is a mere 9 watts so it is economical to run whether from the transformer or from the battery of your van. Better still, the Satking DVBS2-800CA is PVR ready so you can record the programs direct to a USB stick or drive (not supplied) !\r\n\r\nOn the rear panel, you'll find:\r\n\r\nSingle satellite input with a LOOP OUT.  This is particularly useful for connecting multiple decoders together.\r\nHDMI socket - the preferred method of connection to your TV. \r\nUSB port for connection of a hard drive or USB memory stick - this will enable you to record direct to the drive.\r\nAV composite video output - analog connection of video and audio cables to your TV if you have no HDMI ports.\r\nRGB component video output - a high definition analog connection to your TV (if you don't have HDMI inputs)\r\nIR sensor input (i'll go into more detail on this below)\r\nRF input/output - you can feed an analog TV signal in and out to multiple TV's so you can watch the same channel.\r\n12V DC input from either the transformer or cigarette lead.\r\nEthernet port for network connection - we haven't tested this one as yet.\r\nSP/DIF and coaxial digital audio output for connection to surround sound systems.\r\nHaving an external IR sensor port means that the 800CA can be mounted in an overhead cupboard in the van or in an enclosed entertainment unit yet still operate from the remote control.  This is achieved by plugging in the external sensor cable (purchased separately and not yet available but coming soon) and mounting the sensor in a visible location such as on the front of the cabinet or anywhere in view of the remote control signal.  All functions of the remote control can be used this way without the need to open the cupboard.

Take it hunting. Take it on the water. Montana 650t features a bold 4 in. colour touchscreen dual orientation display and TOPO Australia & New Zealand maps, supports multiple mapping options like BirdsEye™ Satellite Imagery and it has a 5 megapixel camera to boot. Montana has key features for the outdoors such as a 3-axis tilt-compensated compass and a barometric altimeter. Buy the auto mount and a City Navigator map, and it'll give you spoken turn-by-turn driving directions. It's big. It's versatile. It's tough. It earned the name Montana - the ultimate in touchscreen toughness.\r\nSee the Big View\r\n\r\nMontana: See it in Action\r\n\r\nMontana 650t features a vast 4 in., sunlight-readable touchscreen display that offers crystal clear enhanced colours and displays high-resolution images. Its easy-to-use interface means you’ll spend more time enjoying the outdoors and less time searching for information. Both durable and waterproof, Montana 650t is built to withstand the elements. Bumps, dust, dirt, humidity and water are no match for this rugged navigator. No matter the setting – on the boat, in the RV or on an ATV – Montana is right at home.\r\nTake Geotagged Pictures\r\n\r\nCapture locations and memories with Montana 650t’s 5 megapixel digital camera. Each photo is geotagged automatically with the location of where it was taken, allowing you to navigate back to that exact spot in the future. Snap and view pictures in landscape or portrait orientation. To keep track of your photos and show their location on a map, simply connect Montana 650t via USB and use Garmin’s free BaseCamp™ software. For more storage, insert a microSD™ card; you can even view pictures from other devices on microSD with Montana's picture viewer.\r\nGo Anywhere\r\n\r\nWith an array of compatible mounts, Montana 650t is designed for use on ATV’s, in boats, as a handheld or in your car as a personal navigator. Use the auto mount with City Navigator maps for spoken, turn-by-turn driving directions, or the rugged mount for your motorcycle or ATV. Wherever you think you might take Montana, it has the mapping and mounts to get you there.\r\nBirdsEye™ satellite image\r\nGo Everywhere\r\n\r\nAdding more maps is easy with Garmin's wide array of detailed topographic, marine and road maps. With its microSD™ card slot, Montana 650t lets you load TOPO Australia & New Zealand maps and hit the trail, plug in BlueChart® g2 preloaded cards for a great day on the water or City Navigator map data for turn-by-turn routing on roads (see maps tab for compatiblity). Montana 650t also supports BirdsEye Satellite Imagery (subscription required), that lets you download satellite images to your device and integrate them with your maps. In addition, Montana is compatible with Custom Maps, free software that transforms paper and electronic maps into downloadable maps for your device.\r\nShare Wirelessly\r\n\r\nWith Montana 650t you can share your waypoints, tracks, routes and geocaches wirelessly with other compatible Garmin GPS users. So now your friends also can enjoy your favourite hike or cache – simply press “send” to transfer your information to similar units, and let the games begin.\r\nKeep Your Fix\r\n\r\nWith its high-sensitivity, WAAS-enabled GPS receiver and HotFix® satellite prediction, Montana 650t locates your position quickly and precisely and maintains its GPS location even in heavy cover and deep canyons. The advantage is clear — whether you’re in deep woods or just near tall buildings and trees, you can count on Montana 650t to help you find your way when you need it the most.\r\nNavigate with Ease\r\n\r\nMontana 650t has a built-in 3-axis tilt-compensated electronic compass, which shows your heading even when you’re standing still, without holding it level. Its barometric altimeter tracks changes in pressure to pinpoint your precise altitude, and you even can use it to plot barometric pressure over time, which can help you keep an eye on changing weather conditions.\r\nDouble Your Power\r\n\r\nMontana 650t features a one-of-a-kind dual battery system. You’ll have the option of using the rechargeable lithium-ion pack or traditional AA batteries – whichever suits your needs better.\r\nFind Fun\r\n\r\nMontana 650t supports geocaching GPX files for downloading geocaches and details straight to your unit. Visit OpenCaching.com to start your geocaching adventure. By going paperless, you're not only helping the environment but also improving efficiency. Montana 650t stores and displays key information, including location, terrain, difficulty, hints and descriptions, which means no more manually entering coordinates and paper print outs! Simply upload the GPX file to your unit and start hunting for caches. \r\n\r\n\r\nEasier to Customize\r\n\r\n    Creates shortcuts so you can easily streamline your process. Whether it’s loading an application, navigating to a waypoint, switching your profile or customising specific settings to your needs, “advanced shortcuts” lets you combine these functions to create a custom-tailored experience. Each Montana comes with pre-loaded shortcuts – Go Home, Track Log On/Off and Stop Navigation – to get you started.\r\n    Increases your ability to multi-task by creating more dashboards in more places. With 1 touch of the power button, you can pull up a multi-orientation dashboard from anywhere – your map, home screen, compass, trip computer, status page and more.\r\n    Brings what you need to your home screen and leaves lesser used items one touch away in the “drawer.” Whether you go somewhere often, continually change settings or create shortcuts, Montana’s fully customizable home screen allows you to bring up to 16 items from Where To?, Setup and Shortcuts to your home screen so you can easily access them without having to click between screens.\r\n    Keeps you from scrolling. Reorder any menu however you like with this new feature, which keeps you from constantly scrolling to the bottom of a long list.\r\n    Switches profiles based on the mount being used. Montana’s “smarter profiles” feature remembers which profile you were using, based on the mount, so when you’re off-roading or trying to find a bike shop, it will put you in the right frame of mind so you can get you on your way quickly.\r\n    Provides options for your menu screen and controls. Don’t like the way something is set up? No worries. With a tap of a button, you can configure your applications easily and quickly. Have to mount on the right handle bar? No problem. Montana can accommodate left- or right-handed setups based on the screen orientation.\r\n\r\nBig and Tough – Goes anywhere, everywhere\r\n\r\n    Uses map data to display your “full track view” so you know what you’re up against\r\n    Logs everything (waypoints, tracks, caches, etc.) on your calendar so you can review (or brag) about your accomplishments later\r\n    Changes to “night mode” automatically so your eyes stay focused even when the sun goes down\r\n    Includes a QWERTY keyboard so you can find what you need and take notes faster\r\n    Helps you keep your bearings straight by letting you to lock your screen to keep it from shifting directions (portrait to landscape or vice versa)\r\n    Includes a 5 megapixel camera;

And just like the popular eTrex, this little yellow wonder combines an intuitive interface and a rugged exterior into a lightweight handheld that fits in the palm of your hand.\r\n\r\nEnjoy Clear Reception\r\n\r\nWith its high-sensitivity, WAAS-enabled GPS receiver, eTrex H locates your position quickly and precisely and maintains its GPS location even in heavy cover and deep canyons. The advantage is clear — whether you’re in deep woods or just near tall buildings and trees, you can count on eTrex H to help you find your way when you need it the most.\r\n\r\nBuilt for Adventure\r\n\r\nYou can operate your eTrex H with just one hand using five buttons, which are located on either side of eTrex H within easy reach of your fingers. Thanks to its bright yellow case, eTrex H is easy to find in your boat or backpack. And, eTrex H is IPX7 waterproof, so it can take an accidental splash or dunk in the water and still continue to perform.\r\n\r\nFind It and Go\r\n\r\nWith eTrex H, your adventure can last and last — up to 17 hours on just 2 AA batteries. While you roam, you can store up to 500 waypoints in memory for easy retrieval. Just enter the point you want to go to, and eTrex H points you to your destination (no street or terrain maps).

Despite being manufactured in China, they are definitely suitable for harsh Australian conditions.\r\n\r\nOur Powertech solar panels are among the best to come out of Asia, and we are not alone in our beliefs! Our supplier has been producing solar panels for the large European market for several years, including manufacturing the panels for a 100kW solar plant in Greece & a 300kW solar plant in Spain.\r\n\r\nWhen we visited their factory we were amazed at the high level of quality control. Each individual cell is tested and measured before assembling, and then each and every panel is tested and measured to IEC standards before shipping them out. Unlike most of the Asian solar panel suppliers, our factory actually performs the silicon doping process in-house, which provides further quality control over the end product as they are in control of the whole process from start to finish.\r\n\r\nEach panel is also uniquely identified with a barcode serial number for traceability and warranty purposes, and the test results for each panel are logged with that serial number - so you can rest assured our factory means to ensure they supply a quality product and will stand by their claims of performance with our 25 year limited warranty.\r\n\r\n25 year limited warranty\r\nAll Powertech monocrystalline solar panels are covered by a 25 year limited warranty.

If you already have the older Aurora system (Imparja, Seven Central, ABC and SBS), all you need to do is disconnect the old satellite decoder and replace it with the new VAST satellite decoder.  The VAST service can be broken down into 2 main channel groups - Eastern region and Western region. \r\n\r\nEASTERN REGION - viewers in all states EXCEPT WA\r\n\r\nABC1, ABC2/4, ABC NEWS24\r\nSBS HD, SBS2\r\nSEVEN CENTRAL (SEVEN NETWORK), 7TWO, 7MATE\r\nIMPARJA (NINE NETWORK), GO, GEM\r\nTEN CENTRAL (TEN NETWORK), ONE HD, ELEVEN\r\nREGIONAL NEWS FEEDS\r\n\r\nWESTERN REGION - WA viewers only\r\n\r\nABC1, ABC2/4, ABC NEWS24\r\nSBS HD, SBS2\r\nGWN (SEVEN NETWORK WA), 7TWO, 7MATE\r\nWIN (NINE NETWORK WA), GO, GEM\r\nTEN WEST (TEN NETWORK), ONE HD, ELEVEN\r\nREGIONAL NEWS FEEDS\r\n\r\nThis exciting new service offers the viewer the full suite of digital channels via satellite.  \r\n\r\nWho can get VAST ?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThose of you living in remote parts of Australia (WA excluded - see bullet point 2 for WA) can access the VAST service straight away (be sure to check eligibility at www.myswitch.digitalready.gov.au ).  Poor or no signal areas are indicated in yellow on the map below.Anyone who lives in a blackspot area, anywhere in Australia, who has an active, official Aurora smartcard that has been registered for all channels in their current address can convert to the VAST service immediately.\r\n\r\nAnyone living anywhere in WA who has an active Aurora smartcard that has been approved for commercial channel access can convert to the VAST service immediately. Please call/email us if you live in a remote area of WA and do not have an active Aurora smartcard.\r\nAnyone living anywhere in Australia that is in a blackspot area AND who currently watch TV via an Aurora smartcard and satellite decoder can convert to the VAST service straight away (providing the smartcard is registered at the current TV blackspot address).\r\nTravellers and grey nomads can access the VAST service very easily too.  Simply purchase a VAST decoder from us and activate the smartcard online.  Once activated, you'll have 6 months of access.  Prior to the expiry of this access certificate, simply jump back online and renew your certificate by entering your name and smartcard number...easy.\r\nTo check your eligibility visit www.mysattv.com.au and click on the Satellite Decoder online Registration button.  You will then be directed to the DigitalReady website. Enter your address, click on Go and check satellite eligibility.

After the 6 months, simply re-apply.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAltech UEC have released an upgrade pack that enables the DSD4121 satellite decoder to record your favourite shows direct to a hard drive thus making it a personal video recorder (PVR) - requires an external harddrive or USB flash drive (not included).  The upgrade pack includes a new design PVR remote control and serial number to enable recording to an external drive.  Keep in mind that this decoder, being a single tuner, can only record one program at a time (whichever program the decoder is set to).  You cannot record a program while watching another.  You can however watch a recorded program while recording another channel so this is useful.  Of course, full PVR functions such as rewind, fast forward, pause etc are standard.  If you'd like this PVR option, please choose it from the option box above where the 'Add to cart' button is.  We also have available, 32GB flash drives which can hold up top 10hrs of HD recordings or up to 30 hrs of SD recordings.  If you'd like one of these brand name, quality flash drives, choose it from the options above as well.\r\n\r\nNOTE - For those of you who have already purchased a DSD4121 VAST decoder who would like to upgrade the decoder to enable the PVR functions, an upgrade pack is now available","options":[{"id":21440219,"name":"PICKED UP","price":299.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":31431601,"name":"DELIVERED","price":329.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66241637/-/images__1_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66241637/-/images__1_.jpg","width":259,"height":194},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66241653/-/images__2_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66241653/-/images__2_.jpg","width":300,"height":168},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66241661/-/images.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66241661/-/images.jpg","width":283,"height":178}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3476387,"name":"12V/240V TV","permalink":"12v-240v-tv","url":"/category/12v-240v-tv"}]},{"id":6747021,"name":"MiniMax 75 Portable Satellite Dish with LNB and Carry Bag","permalink":"minimax-75-portable-satellite-dish-with-lnb-and-carry-bag","position":191,"price":149.0,"default_price":149.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/minimax-75-portable-satellite-dish-with-lnb-and-carry-bag","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-20T04:54:03.000Z","description":"Our most popular dish has now been improved even further.  We brought the original MiniMax into Australia in 2008 and it's been a great hit with travellers (beware of copies).  The MiniMax 75 offers Australia wide satellite reception when connected to a VAST, Aurora or pay TV decoder.  Improvements include:\r\n\r\nZinc coated satellite dish offering better corrosion protection as well as increasing the thickness which has resulted in a more robust dish reflector.\r\nStainless steel bolts and nuts now replace the original zinc coated hardware.\r\nMUCH better powdercoating finish that looks great (better than the drab grey).\r\nElevation bar on the rear is now tubular and moves much more freely without friction.\r\nWe've eliminated the locking clip and replaced it with a locking pin which is a much better idea.\r\nOur padded bags now feature heavier duty zips and even more padding.\r\nEven if you already have a dish system, you'd have to agree that this type of dish is much more compact eliminating the need for a bulky tripod.  Measures 75 x 85cm (elliptical) and weighs a mere 4KG.  Includes padded bag and 10.700 LNB (device on the end of the dish).  We've also cabled the dish so you can connect your satellite finder at the rear.  You'll also get our charts of Australian towns showing the elevation, direction and LNB skew.

Designed to operate in the 156-163 MHz Marine band.\r\nIn many areas of the world, Europe and the USA in particular, all fixed mount VHF radios now are required to include a basic DSC capability. The 25 Watt GME GX600D however, goes well beyond this basic safety requirement and when interfaced with a GPS receiver will be able to transmit crucial vessel information, including position and the nature of the distress call whether it be fire, flooding, collision, grounding, capsize, sinking, adrift, abandoning, piracy or man overboard. In an emergency, one push of the ‘red button’ will send an automated digital distress alert containing your position and Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) number to rescue facilities and other DSC-equipped vessels within the area.\r\nCompeting products in this price range employ a single receiver to monitor both voice and data, the GX600D comes complete with a second receiver so both voice and data are monitored independently ensuring the user will never miss a DSC call. The GX600D DSC radio also provides boaters with a valuable range of non-emergency capabilities, permitting communication with another boat or group of boats using individual or group MMSI numbers. If interfaced to a GPS equipped chartplotter the radio can also send, receive and display each vessel’s position.\r\n\r\nThe GME GX600D, designed and manufactured in Australia, has been styled to complement GME’s expanding range of ingress protected marine products.\r\nLess....\r\nFeatures\r\nExceeds Class D European specifications for DSC operation.
