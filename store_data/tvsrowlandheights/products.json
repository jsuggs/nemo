The unique and elegant square design is manufactured to the highest standards by Innokin and has received great reviews since it's launch. The iTaste V3 Express Kit features a standard 510 connection w/eGo threads making it compatible with just about any tank/cartomizer with a 510 or eGo connection thus offering truly versatile performance!\r\n\r\nThis superb device is much more than just a battery and comes packed with useful features. It has a powerful 800 mAh polymer li-ion pass through battery design with the voltage adjustable at the press of a button in one volt increments from 3.3-5v, with the voltage displayed on a high quality mirror finish LCD display. Not only that, but the iTaste can measure and detect the resistance of just about any cartomizer and will suggest the optimum voltage range that should be used for best results and display the relevant information on the LCD screen - take the guesswork out of variable voltage vaping and find the sweet spot for any device with ease!\r\n\r\nThe new power feature introduced with the V3 is variable wattage mode.  This is the first device of this compact size to offer variable wattage from 6-11 watts in .5 increments.  Once you set your desired wattage level, no matter what resistance atomizer you attach, the iTase V3 will adjust the output automatically.\r\n\r\nAnd the features don't stop there, it also is equipped with a puff counter to monitor intake and measure the performance of the battery or your chosen cartomizer, a colour changing power button that indicates the remaining battery life, short circuit protection with 10 second cut off to prevent accidental discharge, 3 click on/off deactivation and pass through charging technology that allows you to charge the unit while vaping. Everything you need to enjoy your favourite flavour in your preferred tank/cartomizer and obtain optimum performance! \r\n\r\nThe iTaste V3 VV Express Kit includes 1 x 800 mAh VV li-ion battery and a retractable USB charger. eLiquid and tanks/clearomizers must be purchased separately.\r\n\r\nAvailable in 4 color choices:\r\nBlack (Smooth matte finish)\r\nChameleon (Black with metallic specks that change from purple to green in the light)\r\nPearl Chrome (Matte silver)\r\nWhite (Smooth finish)","options":[{"id":46037469,"name":"Black","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46037472,"name":"White","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46037475,"name":"Pearl Chrome","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46037478,"name":"Chameleon","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126046494/-/DSC_0326.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126046494/-/DSC_0326.JPG","width":1496,"height":1496},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126046512/-/DSC_0327.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126046512/-/DSC_0327.JPG","width":1496,"height":1496}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6455394,"name":"Variable Voltage & Mechanical Mods","permalink":"variable-voltage-mechanical-mods","url":"/category/variable-voltage-mechanical-mods"}]},{"id":14250276,"name":"Innokin iTaste MVP","permalink":"innokin-itaste-mvp","position":34,"price":70.0,"default_price":70.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/innokin-itaste-mvp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-18T00:46:44.000Z","description":"INNOKIN iTaste MVP 5-in-1 Voltage Adjustable Rechargeable 2600mAh Mechanical LCD Electronic Cigarettes Set\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n-Designed with detachable atomizer\r\n-Micro USB socket for charge iTaste MVP\r\n-USB 2.0 output socket, as a mobile power supply for external devices\r\n-The LED lights will show green, yellow or red to indicate whether there is full battery life, half capacity or charging needed\r\n-Voltage can be adjusted from 3.3-5.0 volts\r\n-The three most popular power connectors for iphone/iPods, mini USB (Motorola/Blacberry), a Micro USB(Motorola/Nokia/LG/Samsung)\r\n-Suitable for 510, RN4081, 901, 8105, Tidy etc, atomizer","options":[{"id":46037286,"name":"Blue","price":70.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46037289,"name":"Silver","price":70.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46037292,"name":"Black","price":70.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126046320/-/DSC_0322.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126046320/-/DSC_0322.JPG","width":1496,"height":1496},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126046335/-/DSC_0324.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126046335/-/DSC_0324.JPG","width":1496,"height":1496},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126046353/-/DSC_0325.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126046353/-/DSC_0325.JPG","width":1496,"height":1496}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6455394,"name":"Variable Voltage & Mechanical Mods","permalink":"variable-voltage-mechanical-mods","url":"/category/variable-voltage-mechanical-mods"}]},{"id":14250165,"name":"Volcano LavaTube VV","permalink":"volcano-lavatube-vv","position":35,"price":80.0,"default_price":80.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/volcano-lavatube-vv","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-10-18T00:41:41.000Z","description":"Lavatube 2200mah with LCD voltage display\r\n\r\nLava tube Specifications:\r\nLava tube battery capacity 2200mAh\r\nLava tube output voltage 3.0V to 6.0V\r\nCharging time 3-5hrs\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\n1.
