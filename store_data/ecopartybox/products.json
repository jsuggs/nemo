flags are thought to promote peace, compassion, strength, wisdom and good fortune\r\n\r\nIn Tibet, they are called “Lung-Tha,” which translates to “Windhorse,” and are traditionally hung around temples, and mountain tops as well as above homes and fields. \r\n\r\nThe Windhorse rides on the breezes and carries prayers to the universe, to benefit all beings on earth.\r\n\r\nThe colorful flags symbolize the five elements.\r\n\r\nAlong with the prayers, printed in Tibetan script, the flags include traditional images of supernatural animals, saints and deities.\r\n\r\nOur prayer flags are made from cotton and measure 4.5m long with each flag 20cm wide.\r\n\r\nThe flags are designed to dissolve and fray over time due to the impact of the sun, wind and rain.","options":[{"id":44920155,"name":"Default","price":12.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125327496/-/prayer_flags.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125327496/-/prayer_flags.jpg","width":372,"height":372}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2356963,"name":"Decorations,
