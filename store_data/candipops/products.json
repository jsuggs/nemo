Best of all they are the perfect size to slip into your back pocket or purse, so they are always there when you want to scribble a note.\r\n\r\nCustomers also use them for their art or fashion sketches( see the Bourbon, Pink Wafer & Party Ring jotters). The light ivory 100gsm paper is perfect for this as the page colour is inviting, not stark, and the weight of the paper means that the notebooks are suitable for pencil, charcoal, pastel or ink. They are versatile little things. \r\n\r\nAs you will find out whilst looking around my store, there is a story behind each of my products, and this little jotter is no exception. \r\n\r\nThe story\r\nI have a sweet tooth.

I chose the ivory paper for the inside pages to complement the covers and bound the books using a pamphlet stitch with a satin ribbon to complement the raspberry heart of the beloved jam ring. Finally the book was trimmed down and the corners of the books were rounded. (theres something exciting about rounded corners is there not?)","options":[{"id":29671454,"name":"Default","price":4.25,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":3.65,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/93243542/-/Jammy_d_book_on_bench.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/93243542/-/Jammy_d_book_on_bench.jpg","width":945,"height":842}],"artists":[{"id":176846,"name":"Candida for Candipops","permalink":"candida-for-candipops","url":"/artist/candida-for-candipops"}],"categories":[{"id":4540166,"name":"Stationary","permalink":"stationary","url":"/category/stationary"}]}]
