He produced a plate titled Nike Footwear (sic) and hung it in the museum while a friend filmed him in the act. The information accompanying it claimed it dated from 2800 BC and showed a man wearing trendy Nike footwear, \"made for pennies and sold for pounds\". The museum has insisted it was removed within a few hours, but Cartrain maintains it was on display for three days.
