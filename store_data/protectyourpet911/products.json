Artificial, chemical-filled flea & tick sprays work by interfering with the nervous system of insects. Basically, these products stop the normal action of neuro-transmitters, causing the insects to lose control of bodily functions, go into convulsions, dehydrate and ultimately die. Guess what happens when pets come in contact with such sprays and either ingest or inhale them? Naturals’ Flea & Tick Spray also interrupts a specific set of neurotransmitters found only in insects, resulting in a complete breakdown of the insect's central nervous system, but it does this with food-grade ingredients, making it extremely environmentally friendly. You may have to reapply Flea & Tick Spray on your pet a little more frequently than the dangerous chemical sprays, but you can feel confident that it is safe.\r\n\r\necoPure Naturals’ Flea & Tick Spray utilizes natural, safe, effective ingredients such as Castor Oil, Eugenol (Clove Oil) and Thyme Oil that have been used for decades as a defense against unfriendly pests. They are listed on the US EPA Biopesticide Active Ingredient Fact Sheet and the FDA GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) list.\r\n\r\nFlea & Tick Spray contains 9% active ingredients (Castor Oil, Thyme Oil and Clove Oil). Castor oil comes from the castor seed, thyme oil from the herb thyme, and Eugenol is oil derived from cloves. These active ingredients biodegrade quickly and come from a renewable energy resource - plants.\r\n\r\nFlea & Tick Spray also contains Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) which is derived from coconut oil. There have been many rumors on the internet claiming SLS is a carcinogen but that has been debunked. In fact, the American Cancer Society has confirmed that it was an urban legend. SLS acts as a foaming agent that breaks the surface tension of liquid to allow for easier spreading.\r\n\r\nFlea & Tick Spray also contains lecithins which help hold the ingredients together. It is a safe ingredient commonly found in food. Both SLS and lecithins are on the FDA’s Generally Recognized as Safe list.\r\n\r\nActive Ingredients: Castor oil - 3%, Eugenol (clove oil) - 3%, Thyme oil - 3%, Sodium lauryl sulfate - 3%\r\n\r\nInactive Ingredients: Water and lecithins - 88%\r\n\r\nMade in the USA. 4 oz.","options":[{"id":47976423,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127463913/-/Tick_Key_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127463913/-/Tick_Key_2.jpg","width":150,"height":150}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":14802192,"name":"Tick Key","permalink":"tick-key","position":7,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tick-key","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-12T20:55:12.000Z","description":"Tick Key Is The Easiest-To-Use Tick Remover On Earth!

Eggs, dairy products, fish and meat, especially organ meat like liver, are good sources of Vitamin B-12.

Scopolamine is known for its use to erase memory and render you incapable of exercising free will. Its properties suppress the body’s balancing mechanisms, which often cause children and the elderly, in particular, to react badly to the chemicals in the patch. Children, for example, can become hyperactive as a result of wearing the transdermal patch. And in older adults, the medicine can cause severe confusion, memory loss and conjure up strange dreams.\r\n\r\nThe Travel Aid patch is a “non-transdermal”, no medication (skin) patch that uses an energetic exchange that promotes the balance of inner ear activity, therefore no chemical effects. Motion sickness is believed to occur when this balancing system gets overwhelmed by contradictory messages sent from the eyes and inner ears. The resulting symptoms of motion sickness can include sweating, light-headedness, hyperventilation, nausea, vomiting and anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe Travel Aid patch is infused with energetic frequencies to influence the human auric field that counter acts the physical effects from motion sickness, vertigo and all their related issues. This “energy field” surrounds all life forms – and when fully functional, this field is far reaching. In fact, it can be influenced by this patch, similar to the techniques of acupuncture. When stimulated, energy flows through pathways known as (meridians). This stimulation activities your body’s ability to improve inner ear balance.\r\n\r\nAlphaBio Centrix, established in 2002 is known for its use of a special material that is sensitive to (RF) radio frequencies. This material is bonded to a non-latex woven medical pad manufactured by 3M Company.

Scientists at the Brudnick Neuropsychiatric Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Medical School have pinpointed specific areas in the brain that could be responsible for nicotine withdrawal symptoms like nausea, headaches, irritability and weight gain that make it so difficult to go cold turkey.\r\nAbout 69 percent of people surveyed said they want to quit their bad habits like smoking, but nicotine, the drug in tobacco products, may be as addictive as heroin and cocaine, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.\r\nWhen your body senses satisfaction from any stimulant such as; nicotine, sugar, alcohol or chemical substance it reaches the brain in about 10 to 20 seconds. This causes a chemical called dopamine to be released in the brain.\r\nDopamine provides a feeling of pleasure and satisfaction.
