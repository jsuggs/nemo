It runs on Windows and Apple Mac OSX.\r\n\r\nWe think it’s a must for anyone interested in improving their Welsh vocabulary – a major factor in reaching fluency after all.\r\n\r\nEach time you run the software the program generates 25 random questions from its bank of around 200 questions.\r\n\r\nSome questions ask you to select the correct Welsh word from a selection of three, often with a colourful picture to cement the word into your memory.\r\n\r\nOther questions ask you to match up a list of Welsh and English words or phrases. We believe that simply having to choose from a set of alternatives will help you learn quicker and smarter. And it’s a lot more fun than rummaging through a dictionary!\r\n\r\nFinally, you get a score, and the chance to review your answers to see where you succeeded and failed. You might like to think of it as your own personal vocabulary tutor. Ah, but what would a personal Welsh tutor cost?\r\n\r\nSoftware requirements: Windows 98 or above, Mac OSX.","options":[{"id":20990871,"name":"Default","price":14.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":1.75,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64779517/-/Vocab.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64779517/-/Vocab.jpg","width":353,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3397431,"name":"Welsh Courses","permalink":"welsh-courses","url":"/category/welsh-courses"},{"id":3397437,"name":"Software","permalink":"software","url":"/category/software"}]},{"id":6596627,"name":"Getting Quiet - Audio CD","permalink":"getting-quiet-audio-cd","position":3,"price":11.95,"default_price":11.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/getting-quiet-audio-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-02T17:47:46.000Z","description":"A short course to help quiet the mind, by Colin Jones.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F51648522&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=false&amp;color=2f3194\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nThere may be times when a quieter mind can give you a richer experience of life, a more direct connection with your world. It doesn’t matter what religion you follow, if any – we are concerned with your experience of the physical, everyday world.\r\n\r\nGetting Quiet comes from a simple idea – that by quieting our minds we can have a more direct experience of life.\r\n\r\nAs we go through life we tend to pick up mental baggage – opinions, habits, preconceptions and other thought patterns. Now there will be times when these thought patterns will be very useful – the fear of fire, for example. However, the mental noise which goes on in our heads can sometimes cloud our experience of our world.\r\n\r\nUsing Getting Quiet, when we choose to and when we are in a safe environment, we can begin to quiet the mind. By doing so we can experience our lives more directly, clearly and richly.\r\n\r\nGetting Quiet is a short, practical course (under an hour of audio recordings) which guides the listener along a clear path to a quieter mind. It requires no changes of belief, since it is only concerned with our direct experience of our environment.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, the course shows us our genius mind, but also our idiot mind – the voice which sometimes goes on for too long in our head.\r\n\r\nThen, through a series of practical exercises we begin to learn how to ‘turn the volume down’ on our thoughts, but only when we choose to.\r\n\r\nPlease listen to the recordings in a safe environment, where you can devote your full attention to them. Getting Quiet is not a replacement for any professional help or advice you may need.","options":[{"id":20993753,"name":"Default","price":11.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.75,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":1.6,"amount_with_others":0.9}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64788939/-/quiet1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64788939/-/quiet1.jpg","width":353,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3397433,"name":"Music and Audiobooks","permalink":"music-and-audiobooks","url":"/category/music-and-audiobooks"}]},{"id":6575293,"name":"Extra Course Book","permalink":"extra-cadw-swn-course-book","position":4,"price":13.95,"default_price":13.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/extra-cadw-swn-course-book","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-29T13:54:40.000Z","description":"Why not learn with a friend?
