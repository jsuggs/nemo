They are a three-piece item, the base is commonly decorated with floral motifs coming to a point that represents a flower bud. The second piece or the centrepiece also with floral motifs has two rectangular shaped sides that are usually strung with a chain or cord for it then to be suspended around the neck. \r\n\r\nThis piece is known as a Jangama lingam as inside would usually hold a sacred piece of carved stone that would be coated in a protective ash, clay and wax. The Lingayat people would wear this symbol their entire life, for it to be then buried with them in their left hand, as they believe it to be the only true symbol of Shiva. This piece however, dates approximately 18-19th century. It has been newly strung onto a chain and it is empty allowing you to put any keepsake inside.
