With his videos, animations, paintings, drawings, performances and installations related to graffiti and comic-culture, he gives an often mocking, ironic commentary on society. He works tirelessly and presents a rapidly expanding body of work that arose from the need to tell stories, developing characters and new worlds. Besides a caustic, sharp humor, his work also contains a childlike playfulness. Eilers began his career in the German graffiti scene. During his studies at the Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam (2001-2005) he broadened his horizons and began to experiment with other media such as video and animation. A clip from his graduation project, a short film called Elefantos earned award at the One Minute Awards in 2005, as Eilers managed to produce a full short film based on the main character, a sad, sensitive boy, growing up with an elephant’s head.\r\n\r\nWhen Eilers presented his work at the national academy in the end of 2009, it mainly consisted of sharp social criticism where drawings simultaneously evoked associations with the sensational nature of bad B movies. His handwriting is described as a “graffiti style developed by: hard, sharp lines and aggressive themes that sometimes nice spinning out. Disturbing, violent depictions of Ku Klux Klan among others-like figures, sado masochism, torture, and a fitness obsessive culture came together in this presentation.","options":[{"id":29599712,"name":"Default","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.9,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":8.9,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":12.9,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":12.9,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":12.9,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":137,"name":"Latvia","code":"LV"}},{"amount_alone":9.99,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":12.9,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":203,"name":"Slovakia (Slovak Republic)","code":"SK"}},{"amount_alone":12.9,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":204,"name":"Slovenia","code":"SI"}},{"amount_alone":12.9,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":12.9,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":73,"name":"Bulgaria","code":"BG"}},{"amount_alone":12.9,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":12.9,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":12.9,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":12.9,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":12.9,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":125,"name":"Hungary","code":"HU"}},{"amount_alone":12.9,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":12.9,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":143,"name":"Lithuania","code":"LT"}},{"amount_alone":9.99,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":12.9,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":12.9,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":12.9,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":12.9,"amount_with_others":12.9,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":21.5,"amount_with_others":21.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/93023534/-/Wayne_Horse.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/93023534/-/Wayne_Horse.jpg","width":700,"height":974}],"artists":[{"id":176663,"name":"Willehad Eilers/ Wayne Horse","permalink":"willehad-eilers-wayne-horse","url":"/artist/willehad-eilers-wayne-horse"}],"categories":[{"id":4591013,"name":"Prints & Posters","permalink":"prints-posters","url":"/category/prints-posters"},{"id":4556681,"name":"New Items","permalink":"new-items","url":"/category/new-items"}]},{"id":9507386,"name":"Shark 2 by Stefan Gross","permalink":"shark","position":14,"price":250.0,"default_price":250.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/shark","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-15T21:03:28.000Z","description":"Stefan Gross\r\n\r\n2011 \r\nOil, plastic,toy \r\nUnique \r\n17.5 x 16.5 x 12 cm\r\n\r\nBorn in Bendorf, Germany, from 1981 – 1990, Stefan Gross worked from apprentice to practitioner to master in the manufacture of stained glass.

The pitch black night with a wish to see. Each part of the image is made part by part with light, like time travel with a long exposure.

In his work we begin to understand that a camera is not something to be used, but something to be lived.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the subject matter or nature of the work, there is a strong recognizable style: photographer as narrator and not simply silent observer. This is the case, whether the image was taken on location or in the studio; whether he was occupied with a massive landscape or a minute still life.\r\n\r\nOne of Sweden’s most respected photographers, Vincent’s remarkable depictions of the then emerging snowboard scene, set his name on the world map in the early 90’s. Since then he has received numerous honors, been featured in galleries and art fairs, while professionally covering various areas of fashion, action sports, music and art.","options":[{"id":15072973,"name":"Edition 5","price":2530.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15785023,"name":"Edition 10","price":1400.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":137,"name":"Latvia","code":"LV"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":189,"name":"Romania","code":"RO"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":203,"name":"Slovakia (Slovak Republic)","code":"SK"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":204,"name":"Slovenia","code":"SI"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":73,"name":"Bulgaria","code":"BG"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":125,"name":"Hungary","code":"HU"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":143,"name":"Lithuania","code":"LT"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":65.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/45099425/-/06.11.07_Untitled_no10.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/45099425/-/06.11.07_Untitled_no10.jpg","width":1000,"height":789}],"artists":[{"id":177455,"name":"Vincent Skoglund","permalink":"vincent-skoglund","url":"/artist/vincent-skoglund"}],"categories":[{"id":3158337,"name":"Photographs","permalink":"photographs","url":"/category/photographs"}]},{"id":6063081,"name":"Riot Police by Isaac Cordal ","permalink":"isaac-cordal-riot-police","position":19,"price":245.0,"default_price":245.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/isaac-cordal-riot-police","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-30T04:24:42.000Z","description":"Isaac Cordal \r\n\r\n2012\r\nCement\r\n17 x 8 x 6 cm\r\nSigned, and numbered\r\nEdition of 100\r\n\r\nIsaac Cordal (Spain, 1974) studied Fine Art at the University of Vigo and earned an MA in Digital Arts at the Camberwell University of Arts in London.\r\n\r\nIn 2012 his work was exhibited across Belgium as well as in Latvia, Croatia, Austria, Italy, Spain and the United States, most of which featured his ongoing project: Cement Eclipses.\r\n\r\nReferencing the real estate boom and subsequent economic collapse, Cordal works with cement as a political material, creating site-specific installations that question scale, speculative reasoning and global social phenomenon.

His eclectic body of work includes film, collage, paintings, illustrations and installations.\r\n\r\nWorking independently since the early 1990’s, Lambert has appeared in an arm’s length of international publications, while his CV boasts ten years of solo and group exhibitions in cities such as Basel, Barcelona, Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Brussels.\r\n\r\nWith his work, Teenage Black Heart, we find Christophe Lambert amazed at improvements to photocopy technologies and sharing a series of 44 Black and White posters whose conception began during his last show, ‘Waiting For Better Times’ while he earned money working in a local copy shop.\r\n\r\nIn this body of work we recognize that Christophe isn’t waiting for anything, but is constantly scratching at the surface of

The pitch black night with a wish to see. Each part of the image is made part by part with light, like time travel with a long exposure. One image consists of stacked moments of sweeping light, creating an Photograph never visible during the making.\r\n\r\n2004\r\nDigital C-print\r\n125 x 100 cm \r\nSigned, numbered, shipped in a roll \r\nEdition of 5 + 2 AP\r\n\r\n\r\nDigital C-print\r\n60 x 48 cm \r\nSigned, numbered, shipped in a roll \r\nEdition of 10\r\n\r\n\r\nSince 1996, Vincent Skoglund has been continuously working on personal or purely experimental projects, as well as a string of strong commercial endeavors, developing an intimate and comprehensive relationship with his tools and a unique manner of bringing forward a story in a single image.

According to the editors, Moussism is a non-traditional community based movement, which is not limited to a period, place or classical notion of aesthetics, discipline, medium, ideology or style.\r\n\r\nArtists such as David Shrigley, Nomad, Will Barras, Jeroen Jongeleen (Influenza) and East Eric are selected within to illustrate the concept of Moussism for their emphasis on a gestural
