The photograph was taken on a trip to Death Valley to visit an archaeologist friend who showed me secret nooks and crannies and canyons and some of her very favorite hideaways. At dusk one night, we drank beers (which I rarely enjoy but couldn't help but appreciate in that moment) after squeezing through a tiny crevice beyond a rock fall. Driving home, the sun and clouds glowed at me in a way I couldn't help but turn the camera to.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nEach scarf measures 27 x 38 inches and is from a LIMITED EDITION of 50 scarves.

The photograph was taken on a ferry ride from mainland Ohio to a small island where people spend the summer floating in Lake Erie in inner-tubes, beers or flasks in hand, riding around on scooters from beach to beach, leisurely drinking brandy alexanders, or simply sitting in the humid warmth that is a Midwestern summer. That night on the ferry there was a bit of rain and a hope for thunderstorms, but the most dramatic element was the light on the water.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nEach scarf measures 27 x 38 inches and is from a LIMITED EDITION of 50 scarves.

The photograph was taken on a train ride from Chicago to Milwaukee, a ride I have taken many times between the two cities that I've called home most often in my life. At a specific point in the train ride the tracks run past the road I grew up on and I can catch a glimpse down the vanishing point of some miles of sun-bleached blacktop for a fleeting moment and know that I am close to the place that first shaped my life. I will never reach my childhood house from any train car, but of all of the photographs I've taken on that train route, this one feels the most like home.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nEach scarf measures 40 x 60 inches and is from a LIMITED EDITION of 50 scarves.
