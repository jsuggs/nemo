The urban landscape was physically transformed by graffiti artists who invented a new visual language to express both their individuality, and the voice of their community. In Style Wars, New York's ramshackle subway system is their public playground, battleground, and spectacular artistic canvas. Opposing them by every means possible are Mayor Ed Koch, the police, and the New York Transit Authority. Meanwhile, as MC's, DJ's and B-boys rock the city with new sounds and new moves, we see street corner breakdance battles turn into performance art. Style Wars has become an emblem of the original, embracing spirit of hip hop as it exploded into the world from underground tunnels, uptown streets, clubs and playgrounds. New York's legendary kings of graffiti own a special place in the hip hop culture, and the continuing struggle to keep its authentic spirit alive.","options":[{"id":1536459,"name":"Default","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3051721/-/Style_Wars_revisited.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3051721/-/Style_Wars_revisited.jpg","width":560,"height":464}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":287577,"name":"DVD's","permalink":"dvds","url":"/category/dvds"}]},{"id":384213,"name":"Dumbo - Acts of Vandalism & Stories of Love","permalink":"dumbo-acts-of-vandalism-stories-of-love","position":6,"price":45.0,"default_price":45.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dumbo-acts-of-vandalism-stories-of-love","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-09-01T03:23:47.000Z","description":"136 pages, hardcover- I dare anyone who has been to Italy, and especially Milan, in the past 10 years to claim that they have never seen the word 'DUMBO' written on the city walls.
