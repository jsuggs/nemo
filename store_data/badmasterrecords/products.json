Both have the word \"BAD\" in their name, so it had be done. Both bands also released stellar demos this past winter. This split 7\" compiles both demos on the ever-popular, 'penultimate' split 7inch Format (at least it's not a 10inch). Anyone could have released this as two separate records and price gouged the hell out of an already price gouged, record-buying public. We decided to save everyone some bucks and do it this way. Wanna fight about it? The \"Energy side\" is 5 songs of chaotic, weirdo hc, at just over 6min. The \"Side side\" is 6 songs of tight, fast hardcore, totaling 5min09sec.  Listen for yourself, using the link at the end of this announcement.\r\n\r\n300 pressed on purple-y-brown marbled wax. Black and white, heavy-stock jackets, and who knows... Maybe an insert of some kind, as well. We also have a couple copies of the 2 song Bad Side 7\" from Nervous Habits Records. Again, you can hear both sides, and purchase mp3s and whatnot at the link below.\r\n\r\n\r\nBad Energy:\r\nA1. Numbed -- 1:34\r\nA2. Mondo Cane -- 0:52\r\nA3. Live My Life -- 1:13\r\nA4. Community Creeper DFC -- 0:53\r\nA5. Mind Hole 1:46\r\n\r\nBad Side:\r\nB1. Looking For A Bad Time -- 0:47\r\nB2. I Can't Change -- 1:13\r\nB3. Rich Kids On THC -- 0:55\r\nB4. Bleak Future -- 0:59\r\nB5. Humiliator -- 0:49\r\nB6.

Satanized produce a truly great recording that captures everything that makes this band so awe-inspiring in a live setting.

Davey Harms, the lone Meatman, purports to be a failed techno electrogeek (he didn't have any gear), who haxx0rd his way into dance bliss using only guitar pedals (dude didn’t even have a computer). And while everyone from Black Dice to Gang Gang Dance to Growing makes Line6-boogie these days, Mincemeat foregoes the broken Kompakt beats and choppy scuzz and makes a beeline for Ibiza, trying to coat everything in a warm trance, barely focusing on the beat at all beyond a dull throb. In fact, the beat changes like four times—from engine purr to martial mosh to a noise mambo to a sparse gamelan patter. Maybe because Harms is a rhythm-layering savant, maybe because it's uncontrollable, as most of the beats are thuds made by mixer feedback.\" Paper Thin Walls\r\n\r\n\r\n\"[Drums Like Machine Guns] are so relentless on the on first listen this seems much more like an attack then music. Step away from confronting these tunes and the record listens pretty damn good.

Drums Like Machine Guns owes more to early Industrial noise than minimalism, but it to attempts to do more with less. Drums succeeds and build some pretty tremendous sounds.\"\r\n\r\nBM009 (2007)","options":[{"id":588430,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/663004/-/MM_side_thumb.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/663004/-/MM_side_thumb.gif","width":470,"height":473},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/663080/-/DLMG_side_thumb.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/663080/-/DLMG_side_thumb.gif","width":498,"height":473}],"artists":[{"id":3681,"name":"Mincemeat or Tenspeed","permalink":"mincemeat-or-tenspeed","url":"/artist/mincemeat-or-tenspeed"},{"id":3682,"name":"Drums Like Machine Guns","permalink":"drums-like-machine-guns","url":"/artist/drums-like-machine-guns"}],"categories":[{"id":123264,"name":"12\"s","permalink":"12s","url":"/category/12s"}]},{"id":123108,"name":"Tickley Feather 's/t' 12\"","permalink":"tickley-feather-s-t-12","position":10,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tickley-feather-s-t-12","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-07-08T05:06:12.000Z","description":"TICKLEY FEATHER\r\n'Self-Titled' 12\"\r\nLtd. to 500\r\n\r\n\"twenty track collection of naievty and lo-fi whimsy.

Lipson's songs shove the talents of a very musically skilled band into a pretty tight tube and give the playing focus. They have a turntable and use it as an instrument and not a gimmick.

By the time the locked-groove ending of “Anchorite” hits, it’s hard to not be at least a little impressed. \r\nThese four tracks offer a distinct and somewhat unique sound, although remaining firmly grounded in the hardcore punk echelon. Their advantage is mainly due to the voice of Alex Agran, who, when not using a wounded-dog scream, actually kind of sings. It genuinely connects Leather’s sound to classic hardcore punk (I’m thinking the American Youth Report compilation for reference), as Agran’s voice recalls a classic Keith Morris or Alec Mackaye, not one of today’s muffled and distorted dime-a-dozen hardcore screamers. “Prince of the Salon” takes that voice to its most intense degree, almost to an off-putting level, but a similar sensation was probably felt the first time anyone heard Darby Crash.\" -www.yellowgreenred.com\r\nReleased by Caesar Cuts 2010.","options":[{"id":9120947,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/24778771/-/leather_front.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/24778771/-/leather_front.jpg","width":302,"height":296}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":123265,"name":"7\"s","permalink":"7s","url":"/category/7s"}]},{"id":340685,"name":"Hot Guts 'S/t' 7\" SOLD OUT","permalink":"hot-guts-s-t-7","position":14,"price":5.5,"default_price":5.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/hot-guts-s-t-7","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-07-10T05:50:34.000Z","description":"Hot Guts Debut release.
