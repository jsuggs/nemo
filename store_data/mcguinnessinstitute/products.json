Secondly, the research aims to increase understanding of how these goals can both support and strengthen, and further advance the development of a National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS).\r\n\r\nThis area of study has resulted in the publication of two main reports, a background report and seven working papers, of which this report is the central document. Report 7 identifies shared Māori goals and issues related to the measurement of Māori goals and explores the capabilities of current institutions whose purpose is to implement the goals of Māori. It then goes on to examine the key challenges and opportunities, including; pursuing positive demographic change, responding effectively to new and emerging technologies, managing resources in light of climate change and the Treaty settlement process. We then synthesise our findings and form seven national priorities that need to be addressed in order for the shared goals of Māori to be supported effectively within national frameworks.\r\n\r\nThrough this research it has become apparent that a well-developed and implemented NSDS can assist iwi and hapū in the pursuit of shared goals.
