David Dalquist, co-founder of Nordic Ware. In around 1950, one Jewish-American society approached Dalquist asking if he could produce a modern version of a traditional ceramic Gugelhupf dish, a traditional European fruit cake. Nordic Ware made a small number of the pans trademarked under the name \"Bundt\". \r\nInitially, the Bundt pan sold so poorly that Nordic Ware considered discontinuing it. The product received a boost when it was mentioned in the New Good Housekeeping Cookbook in 1963, but did not gain real popularity until 1966 when a Bundt cake called the \"Tunnel of Fudge\" took second place at the annual Grand National Recipe and Baking Contest. The resulting scramble caused the Bundt pan to surpass the tin Jell-O mold to become the most-sold pan in the United States in the 1960s. \r\n","options":[{"id":30019921,"name":"Default","price":190.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":40.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":40.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":40.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":40.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96933715/-/CAKE_01a.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96933715/-/CAKE_01a.jpg","width":664,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96934339/-/CAKE_02.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96934339/-/CAKE_02.jpg","width":664,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98302255/-/CAKE_03.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98302255/-/CAKE_03.jpg","width":666,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4797469,"name":"Lighting","permalink":"lighting","url":"/category/lighting"}]},{"id":9865396,"name":"Bunny Rabbit Desk Lamp","permalink":"rabbit-desk-lamp","position":3,"price":135.0,"default_price":135.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rabbit-desk-lamp","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-11T23:15:56.000Z","description":"A large desk lamp with heavy concrete base.
