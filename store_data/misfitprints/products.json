spreads from his artist's books; plus interviews and essays by virtually every artist and author closely associated with LeWitt, among them Lucy Lippard, Rosalind Krauss, Mel Bochner, Dan Graham and Robert Smithson. \r\n\r\nOne of the most important artists of the twentieth century, LeWitt at last receives the definitive treatment of his work in this volume.\r\nIn his 1967 \"Paragraphs on Conceptual Art,\" Sol LeWitt set out the fundamental principle of his artistic practice: \"In conceptual art the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work.... \r\n\r\nThe idea becomes a machine that makes the art.\" From the first wall drawing in 1968 until his death in 2007, LeWitt never ceased to develop new \"machines,\" conceiving some 1,200 wall drawings and laying down the foundations of Conceptual and Minimalist art. \r\n\r\nLeWitt's wall drawings, always installed by assistants, eliminated any intermediary object (such as a canvas) between the work and its support, thereby dovetailing a sensuous material immediacy with a powerful Platonic detachment. His sculptural variations on grids, cubes and pyramids likewise project this moving simplicity and clarity.\r\n\r\nSol LeWitt (1928-2007) was born in Hartford, Connecticut, where he took art classes at the Wadsworth Atheneum. After receiving a BFA from Syracuse University he worked as a graphic designer in the office of architect I.M. Pei. In 1976, LeWitt cofounded the artists' book bookstore Printed Matter in New York, with Lucy Lippard.\r\n\r\n A retrospective of his wall drawings opened to the public in 2008 at MASS MoCA in North Adams, Massachusetts, where it will remain on view for 25 years.","options":[{"id":50065707,"name":"Default","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128973978/-/31neccV1b4L._SX258_BO1_204_203_200_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128973978/-/31neccV1b4L._SX258_BO1_204_203_200_.jpg","width":260,"height":304}],"artists":[{"id":256977,"name":"Sol Lewitt","permalink":"sol-lewitt","url":"/artist/sol-lewitt"}],"categories":[{"id":5873745,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":15393792,"name":"Tauba Auerbach - The Thing Quaterly Limited Edition Clock","permalink":"tauba-auerbach-the-thing-quaterly-limited-edition-clock","position":11,"price":400.0,"default_price":400.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tauba-auerbach-the-thing-quaterly-limited-edition-clock","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-07T11:40:54.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":50065638,"name":"Default","price":400.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128973912/-/images.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128973912/-/images.jpg","width":275,"height":183},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128973915/-/images-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128973915/-/images-1.jpg","width":104,"height":112}],"artists":[{"id":222336,"name":"Taura Auerbach","permalink":"taura-auerbach","url":"/artist/taura-auerbach"}],"categories":[{"id":5305743,"name":"Limited Edition Print","permalink":"limited-edition-print","url":"/category/limited-edition-print"}]},{"id":15393774,"name":"Marc Quinn - \"Eye Of History\" Limited Edition Print (Framed)","permalink":"marc-quinn-eye-of-history-limited-edition-print-framed","position":12,"price":900.0,"default_price":900.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/marc-quinn-eye-of-history-limited-edition-print-framed","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-07T11:37:07.000Z","description":"Artist:  Marc Quinn\r\nTitle:  \"Eye of History\"\r\n\r\nTHIS ARCHIVAL INKJET PRINT IS A LIMITED EDITION AND COMES SIGNED AND NUMBERED BY THE ARTIST. \r\n\r\nPRINTS COME FRAMED IN WHITE, 3/4\" WIDE FLAT FACE FRAME 1\" DEEP WITH UV ACRYLIC GLASS WHITE.

Available in a limited edition fine art print on paper and gallery-wrapped, stretched canvases in two sizes.\r\n\r\nAbout The Work -- Target Demo: Portraits of the late Christopher Wallace and Tupac Shakur\r\n\r\n“Biggie and 2pac will always be examples of how powerful music can be as a medium.  Their ability to translate the often grim, inner-city struggles to the masses had them both praised and vilified.  Played in the streets and targeted in the media - a marketing plan of rivalry set sights on their friendship, fans and the entire hip-hop community. A senseless tragedy over extraordinary talent, “Target Demo” is my tribute to both men.“ Tes One.\r\n\r\nAbout Tes One\r\n\r\nCombining traditional and non-traditional techniques, Leon \"Tes One\" Bedore creates contemporary works of art that contrast nature with technology, grime with grace. Allowing himself to find beauty in the mundane, he is able to juxtapose rejected landscapes with figurative illustrations, all the while identifying what is common between the conversing elements. These opposing forces coexist to create paintings that are both symbolic and metaphorical. \r\nSelect your art:\r\n\r\n Size \tType \tEdition \tPrice \t\r\n\r\n24x32 \tPaper \t50 \t      $250","options":[{"id":43661541,"name":"Default","price":125.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":20.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124428078/-/biggie_tesone_main.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124428078/-/biggie_tesone_main.png","width":600,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5305743,"name":"Limited Edition Print","permalink":"limited-edition-print","url":"/category/limited-edition-print"}]},{"id":12690069,"name":"Rostarr - Black Flagg Limited Edition Silkscreen","permalink":"rostarr-black-flagg-limited-edition-silkscreen","position":20,"price":500.0,"default_price":500.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rostarr-black-flagg-limited-edition-silkscreen","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-31T09:01:45.000Z","description":"Artist:  Rostarr\r\nSigned Black Flag Silkscreen Print\r\n16” x 20” in an edition of 35","options":[{"id":40374591,"name":"Default","price":500.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122084421/-/Rostarr-Print_1_medium.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122084421/-/Rostarr-Print_1_medium.jpg","width":240,"height":240}],"artists":[{"id":222300,"name":"Rostarr","permalink":"rostarr","url":"/artist/rostarr"}],"categories":[{"id":5305743,"name":"Limited Edition Print","permalink":"limited-edition-print","url":"/category/limited-edition-print"}]},{"id":13614045,"name":"NeckFace - Your Last Post","permalink":"neckface-your-last-post","position":21,"price":175.0,"default_price":175.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/neckface-your-last-post","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-17T05:20:47.000Z","description":"Artist:  Neckface\r\nTitle:  Your Last Post\r\n\r\n$225.00\r\n\r\nSize \t18 x 24 inches\r\nEdition \tLimited Edition of 75\r\nMaterials \tSeven-Color Hand Pulled Silk Screen on Coventry Rag, 100% Cotton Archival Paper\r\n\r\n\"YOUR LAST POST\" is a limited edition, six-color silkscreen print by Neckface.

In razor-sharp execution--which reveals her training as a sign painter--Auerbach's works on panel and paper update the abstract conceptual tradition, while retaining its intellectual rigor. \r\n\r\nUppercase Insides and Numeral Insides recall Russian Suprematism, and, upon further contemplation, turn out to be just what their titles call them.

Despite their international success, Hume abandoned the formal manoeuvering of the door series in the early 1990s, in favour of a simple, flat figurative and abstract paintings, featuring startling colourcombinations and appropriated images ranging from animals to celebrities to flowers.\r\n\r\nHume was nominated for the Turner Prize in 1996, represented Britain at the Venice Biennale in 1999, and was elected a Royal Academician in 2001. His work has been the subject of a number of monographic shows in UK and Europe.\r\n\r\nPublished to coincide with the Gary Hume exhibition at Tate Britain in June 2013, this book will include thirty paintings by Hume, encompassing works from almost twenty years of his career as well brand new pieces. \r\n\r\nIncluding an introductory essay by Katharine stout and an essay by US art writer Jack Bankowsky, this concise account of Hume’s work is a timely addition to the bibliography of this important British contemporary painter.\r\n\r\nKatharine Stout is Curator (Contemporary British Art) at Tate.","options":[{"id":40537992,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122201283/-/gary_hume_13787_large.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122201283/-/gary_hume_13787_large.jpg","width":650,"height":650},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122201292/-/photo.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122201292/-/photo.JPG","width":3264,"height":2448}],"artists":[{"id":219687,"name":"Gary Hume","permalink":"gary-hume","url":"/artist/gary-hume"}],"categories":[{"id":5873745,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":12736875,"name":"Testing Testing One Two Three:  Curtis Kulig","permalink":"testing-testing-one-two-three-curtis-kulig","position":30,"price":100.0,"default_price":100.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/testing-testing-one-two-three-curtis-kulig","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-02T12:28:34.000Z","description":"Author:  Curtis Kulig\r\nTitle:  Testing Testing One Two Three\r\n\r\nTESTING, TESTING, ONE TWO THREE IS AN ART BOOK WITH CURTIS KULIG'S PHOTOGRAPHY. \r\n\r\nALL COPIES ARE SIGNED BY THE ARTIST.

Following this torrid phase, he changed gears to produce the gargantuan Puppy, the 43-foot tall floral terrier that now resides at the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. \r\n\r\nKoons' exploitation of the banal, in the aggrandizement and/or embodiment of kitsch and pop imagery, has become his trademark; detractors may delight in their naysaying, but Koons s work commands millions at auction and his position at the forefront of contemporary art is indisputable.

First Edition. Out of Print. \r\n\r\nAt 17 Mike Brodie hopped his first train close to his home in Pensacola, FL thinking he would visit a friend in Mobile, AL. \r\n\r\nInstead the train went in the opposite direction to Jacksonville, FL. Days later, Brodie rode the same train home, arriving back where he started. Nonetheless, it sparked something and Brodie began to wander across the U.S. by any means that were free - walking, hitchhiking and train hopping. \r\n\r\nShortly after, Brodie found a Polaroid camera stuffed behind a car seat. With no training in photography and coke-bottle glasses, the instant camera was an opening for Brodie to document his experiences. As a way of staying in touch with his transient community,Brodie shared his pictures on various websites gaining the moniker The Polaroid Kidd. When the Polaroid film he used was discontinued, Brodie switched to 35mm film and a sturdy 1980s camera. \r\n\r\nBrodie spent years crisscrossing the U.S. amassing a collection, now appreciated as one of the most impressive archives of American travel photography. \r\n\r\nWhen asked about his approach to travel and photography Brodie has said: sometimes I take a train the wrong way or...whatever happens a photo will come out of it, so it doesn't really matter where I end up.

Abelow graduated with a BFA from Rhode Island School of Design in 1998 and an MFA in painting from the Cranbrook Academy of Art in 2008. According to the artist his “work is a kind of abstract, autobiographical storytelling. I use text, figuration, and geometric abstraction to piece together different narratives that are interconnected.” \r\n\r\nAbelow had solo exhibitions at Sorry We’re Closed, Brussels (2012); Brand New Gallery, Italy (2012) and Frieze New York with James Fuentes (2012). The artist will have his second New York solo exhibition with James Fuentes in the fall (2013). The artist lives and works in Brooklyn, NY.\r\n\r\nThis image is part of a series which depicts a dancing figure and uses Kazimir Malevich's \"Bather\" from 1911 as a point of reference. Abelow says, \"I think of my work as non-linear, autobiographical story telling.  I use text, figuration, and geometric abstraction to piece together different narratives that are interconnected. Many of the themes in my visual work are also found in my writing, as I am interested in the relationship between text and image. I'm thinking about the idea of the artist as performer.

The front-page newspaper spreads punctuating the book from the album’s release year (1977) and the year of the cabinets’ completion (1989) provide a context for reading James Frey’s story-poem, Fuck This and Fuck That, which describes the listless protest of a teenage waster. \r\n\r\nThe song titles and cabinet names - No Feelings, Liar, and Seventeen - resound with the frustrations of Thatcherite Britain and the violence borne out in daily uprest and anarchy, as depicted in the news: IRA MEN HELD IN BIG SWOOP; RIOT SHIELDS OUT AGAIN and DOCKS JOBS-FOR-LIFE TO BE AXED BY AUTUMN. \r\n\r\nHirst’s medicine cabinets have long been described as temples of medicinal hierarchies providing nothing more than a short-term cure in the face of death. Viewing the pervasive successes and exploitations of the pharmaceutical industry as a belief system in itself is evidence of our society's dependency and a form of escapism. \r\n\r\nHirst has commented: \"I’ve always seen medicine cabinets as bodies, but also like a cityscape or civilization, with some sort of hierarchy within it. It’s also like a contemporary museum of the Middle Ages. \r\n\r\nIn a hundred years’ time this will look like an old apothecary. A museum of something that’s around today.\"\r\n\r\nThe publication features a transcription of a radio conversation between Damien Hirst and Steve Jones, guitarist for the Sex Pistols, covering music, girls, money, drugs, drinks, and smokes. The book’s index lists every medicine cabinet ever made and the exhibition itself includes original Sex Pistols memorabilia including album sleeves and t-shirts.\r\n\r\n    Hardcover: 184 pages\r\n    Publisher: Other Criteria (February 1, 2011)\r\n    Product Dimensions: 9 x 0.9 x 7.5 inches \r\n\r\nSome retail sites have this rare edition price at over $4,000....and like anything Hirst that is signed and limited edition, the item, whatever it is, is sure to be nothing short of a sure thing investment.  \r\n","options":[{"id":36423027,"name":"Default","price":750.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/113669430/-/51gSi_qEofL._SL1024_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/113669430/-/51gSi_qEofL._SL1024_.jpg","width":1000,"height":706},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/113669478/-/Amazon_Pricing.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/113669478/-/Amazon_Pricing.jpg","width":1000,"height":371},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/113669742/-/08-007B.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/113669742/-/08-007B.jpg","width":525,"height":709}],"artists":[{"id":207012,"name":"Damien Hirst","permalink":"damien-hirst","url":"/artist/damien-hirst"}],"categories":[]},{"id":11548737,"name":"Greg Gossel - The Wedding Is Off (Purple) Ltd.

From the Alleged Press series curated by Aaron Rose, Deformer interweaves disciplinary letters from Templeton's grandfather and religious notes from his mother with sketches, snapshots, telling images and the occasional brutal tale, laying out an unresolved narrative that plunges readers headlong into Templeton's chaotic youth and his reliance on art and skateboarding to accommodate its stresses and joys. \r\n\r\nSkateboarding allowed me to travel the world, and that showed me that where I live is totally messed up, he observes. That perspective has fueled me and been a source for my art. Through photographs, stories and ephemera of all sorts from his youth and teenage years, Templeton offers readers an intensely close and personal look at an artist's coming of age. \r\n\r\nDeformer is also available in a boxed limited edition which comes with a signed and numbered photograph by Ed Templeton.\r\n\r\nEd Templeton, born in 1972, is a professional skateboarder, co-editor of the arts magazine ANP Quarterly, photographer and artist. His work was featured in the hugely successful traveling show Beautiful Losers. Title: Deformer.

His large scale trademark arrows were painted on roll down gates, trucks and storefronts with impressive coverage throughout the city. ABOVE is extraordinarily driven. \r\n\r\nTo paraphrase Radiohead, “ambition can make you look pretty ugly,” but in  ABOVE’s case, his ambition makes the streets look very engaging. I am very impressed by ABOVE’s diligence, but after I got to know him and his artwork more, I began to realize that his output is not evidence of selfish ego, but of a lust for life, a utopian life, where his generosity, and curiosity, and his pursuit of creativity and social-consciousness have led him around the world making more friends than enemies.\r\n\r\nABOVE made the time to act as tour guide for me and my wife and our two young daughters in a city he knows well and we didn’t.

ABOVE moved to Paris at the age of 19 where he started painting his trademark arrow (pointing above) all around the city. \r\n\r\nSince then ABOVE has been consistently traveling around the world doing many large self-financed \"tours\" with each tour exploring a new medium or style of artworks.

Yet even those who have marveled at Serra's intellectually rigorous and large works of sculpture may not be familiar with his equally intriguing drawings. This handsome book brings together for the first time Serra's drawn work, considering the artist's investigation of medium as an activity both independent from and linked to his pioneering sculptural practice.\r\n\r\nFirst working in ink, charcoal, and lithographic crayon on paper, Serra originally used drawing as a means to explore form and perceptual relations between his sculpture and the viewer. Over time, his drawings underwent significant shifts in concept, materials, and scale and became fully realized and autonomous works of art. \r\n\r\nThe grand, bold forms he created with black paintstick in his monumental Installation Drawings were designed to disrupt and complement existent spaces and eventually began to occupy entire rooms. In the late 1980s, Serra explored the tension of weight and gravity through layering, and his most recent work experiments with surface effects, using mesh screens as intermediaries between the gesture and the transfer of pigment to paper.\r\n\r\nThis FIRST EDITION was published in 2011 and was signed by the ARTIST and then repackaged in plastic wrap so as to ensure the continued integrity of the book would not be compromised.  \r\n\r\nYou will not regret getting this book; however, once part of a collection, it is unlikely to ever change hands again
