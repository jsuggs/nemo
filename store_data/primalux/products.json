Earrings are approximately 6 in/16 cm in length and are all hand cut, so there will be a small bit of variation in shape and size. The earrings consist of two pieces, one large \"feather\" of leather and a smaller \"feather\" of suede, in a single color. Due to natural variations in leather and suede the texture may be slightly different than what is shown in the pictures, depending on the hides I have available. You can choose either gold-tone or silver-tone for the rings and hooks of the earrings.\r\n\r\n**I will have other color options coming soon. If you are interested in a particular color before then, please contact me to see if I have it available** ","options":[{"id":45241155,"name":"Silver hooks/rings","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":45241158,"name":"Gold hooks/rings","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125474634/-/IMG_0110.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125474634/-/IMG_0110.JPG","width":1811,"height":2367}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2208045,"name":"jewelry","permalink":"jewelry","url":"/category/jewelry"},{"id":2208241,"name":"earring","permalink":"earring","url":"/category/earring"},{"id":6376362,"name":"leather","permalink":"leather","url":"/category/leather"},{"id":6376365,"name":"suede","permalink":"suede","url":"/category/suede"}]},{"id":10852218,"name":"Silver-leafed Bird Bone Choker","permalink":"silver-leafed-bird-bone-choker","position":2,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/silver-leafed-bird-bone-choker","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-29T23:51:39.000Z","description":"This choker is made from a bird vertebra, collected from nature, which has been silver-leafed in real sterling silver.
