This makes them more palatable, versatile, and blendable.\r\n\r\nDerived from herbs, roots, fruit, or plants, bitters are used to flavor cocktails and give them “body.” Serious mixologists and cocktail lovers consider them a defining ingredient in cocktails. Stirring's Blood Orange Bitters are the first to incorporate blood oranges with a secret blend of exotic ingredients, creating a mellower yet still powerful taste that's a little sweeter than other bitters. A modern interpretation of a classic.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIPLE-FILTERED WATER, CANE SUGAR, GENTION EXTRACT, BLOOD ORANGE EXTRACT AND OTHER NATURAL FLAVORS, CITRIC ACID, CARAMEL COLOR.
