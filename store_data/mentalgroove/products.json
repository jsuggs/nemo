Epic, catchy and yet singular in equal measure, “Pop Collection” is a versatile album that brings a colorful pallet of tracks defying the set boundaries of the pop music genre. \r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 280; height: 42px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1881668310/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/artwork=false/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://mentalgroove.bandcamp.com/album/pop-collection\">Pop Collection by Kadebostany</a></iframe>\r\n\r\nLead by charismatic president and gifted producer Kadebostan, the Republic of Kadebostany’s national band also notably comprises the enigmatic diva Amina, and some of the best musicians from this small but flourishing nation. Fresh from the success of their unavoidable debut single “Walking with a Ghost” which catapulted them into the spotlight, Kadebostany are set to further conquer the planet with their new album. “Pop Collection” consists of the most popular tracks played on the Kadebostanian radio, an armada of hit singles from start to finish that confirms the band’s fertile imagination and creativity, and their innate sixth sense to produce hits. \r\n\r\nDelicate and ominous in turns but always haunting, Amina’s precious voice ties together these most overpowering tracks merging propulsive electronics with nervous guitars, driving bass, shiver-inducing horns, and fragile piano lines. The memorable first single “Walking With A Ghost” was only an introduction to the string of hits that is to be discovered on ‘Pop Collection’, some are warm and sensual hymns, others are dancefloor magnets, yet all retain this special Kadebostanian touch that truly makes for a coherent album. All the traditional elements build unstoppably around cutting-edge electronic beats in a formula that only president Kadebostan masters, resulting in an album that is a forward thinking redefinition of what is popular pop music now. \r\n\r\nThe singular universe of Kadebostany translates magically to the stage where stunning mapping projections and an impressive light show complete the live experience, and the representatives of the republic, dressed in their national uniforms, use all means to put you in a trance and under a long-lasting spell. \r\n\r\nPop Collection’s many unique attributes amount to an album that stands out in a crowded climate.","options":[{"id":45105750,"name":"Default","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125414256/-/pop_collection.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125414256/-/pop_collection.jpg","width":1200,"height":1200}],"artists":[{"id":127725,"name":"*Mental Groove Records","permalink":"mental-groove-records","url":"/artist/mental-groove-records"},{"id":47722,"name":"Kadebostany","permalink":"kadebostany","url":"/artist/kadebostany"}],"categories":[{"id":205273,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":9614167,"name":"WAYNE PAUL - BETWEEN THE LINES - CD","permalink":"wayne-paul-between-the-lines-cd","position":3,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wayne-paul-between-the-lines-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-24T15:12:28.000Z","description":"WAYNE PAUL \r\nBETWEEN THE LINES \r\nCD\r\nMental Groove x Absinthe Music\r\n<p><p>\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"40\" src=\"http://official.fm/player?control=1&width=100%25&height=40&skin_bg=000000&skin_fg=FFFFFF&feed=%2F%2Fofficial.fm%2Ffeed%2Fplaylists%2FdrRu.json\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p><p>\r\n\r\nA true renaissance. The only way to describe Wayne Paul’s return. Lost in alcohol and drugs, drifting from incarceration bids to detox clinics, the British artist has been to hell and back. Fortunately he IS back.

Intense. \r\n\r\nWayne Paul, British by way of Jamaica, grew up fascinated by Gregory Isaacs, Dennis Brown, John Holt, Marvin Gaye, Motown, or the movement linked to the mysterious Jah Shaka – prince of heavy bass, sirens and echo effects. It’s no wonder he’s so comfortable expressing his feelings over dub, electro, jazz and hiphop created by Swiss master Christophe Calpini (Mobile in Motion, Stade, Alain Bashung, Dog Almond).

Airplane Man ‎– MJCR016 - LP\r\n\r\nMr. Airplane Man was a Boston duo, Margaret Garrett (guitar, vocals) and Tara McManus (drums, keyboards), who have been playing since 1996. They named themselves after a Howlin’ Wolf song. Friends since grade school, their obsession with rock and roll & blues music inspired the band. They began playing on the street and by 1999 they were voted Best New Local Act by readers of the Boston Phoenix.\r\n\r\nMargaret and Tara have created a unique niche for themselves, a raw & real hypnotic, mesmerizing sound that borrows equally from blues icons like Howlin' Wolf and proto-garage bands like Boston's The Lyres. They quickly won a whole string of heavyweight admirers, from Morphine's late Mark Sandman, who taught Margaret how to play guitar to Greg Cartwright of the Oblivians and the Reigning Sound. They released during first mid-2000s three full-length album on Sympathy for the Record Industry and played with bands like the White Stripes and the Strokes. John Peel discovered them and had them do several sessions. They toured all around America & Europe. Mr Airplane Man’s story ended up in 2006.\r\n\r\nThis album is a witness of their early days as a band. It captures their very first studio experience and the very deep & true essence of what Mr Airplane Man became later on. Partly produced & recorded by Mark Sandman. Originally self-released in 1998 on Cd by the band, it had to wait 15 years to finally be released on a proper vinyl. One time 1000 copies pressing. Silk-screened cover on tobacco cardboard.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\nA1. Baby\t\t\r\nA2. Moanin' For My Baby\t\t\r\nA3. You Left Me Cold\t\t\r\nA4. Highway\t\t\r\nA5. My Hand\t\t\r\nB1.

Slowing down the rhythm while singing in HUNX- and SHANGRI-LAS-tradition to the broken hearted, the fast Pogo-chaos changes into kissing lovebirds, lying on dirty beer-floors: Hands get lost, couples become sextets...\r\n\r\nIn 2009 Rickey Rocket & Doc Julius recorded three songs and let them get anonymously into their local garage promoter and played their first concert as “closing-band” for the legendary Englishmen-band THE MASONICS and impressed Garage-punk fathers Bruce HEADCOATS Brand and Mickey MILKSHAKES Hampshire: „I don’t think they can keep that high energy very long“. Since then their killer-song repertoire is still growing ad infinitum. They brought NOBUNNY to cut his feet by shards of beer glasses, they let forget the audience on a dirty saturday night that the main act THE MAGNETIX was missing, KING AUTOMATIC dreams since the two shows he shared with them of a whole band, they gave THE MONSTERS the shivers at their record release party and they also showed JACK OF HEART how to dress properly… In late 2010 SHADY & THE VAMP released their super limited 9-song cassette (so limited, not even numbered) on HIGH TIME records, which was followed in mid 2011 by their 7’’ Baby, I’m gonna make you mine on HIGH TIME/MONAVALE. It’s garage-punk in the way it should sound in this decade. Garage-punk loved by boys and adored by girls. Tim Warren himself, after having a listen to the 7\"  ordered the band 100 copies for the Crypt Records shop !\r\n\r\n2012 they went to Toulouse. During a weekend at LO’SPIDER’s studio they recorded a couple of songs. The result is a psyched silk-screen printed 10” you’ll hear soon on Moi J’Connais Records !

Guitar in hand, they sing their songs of wonder, distilling years of struggle into blissful and blithe melodies. And still their dry-but-mellow voices dance into the world...\r\n \r\nPrecious Bryant (4 January 1942 - ) and Algia Mae Hinton (29 August 1929 - ) have wandered through the century, singing lullabies to their children and grandchildren. Real, timeless, their music has travelled across the Atlantic, meandered between the Piedmont and the Blue Ridge Mountains, and settled into a style of fingerpicking a little reminiscent of Mississippi John Hurt, Jimmy Rodgers, or their buddy Elisabeth Cotton – of this particular sound that travelled all the way from Europe and collided with Africa.\r\n \r\nDeep in the rubble of a forgotten South West, far away from the Mississippi, both river and State, the two fine fingerstyle guitarists play, evoking the tingle of rain on sheet metal. Gentle and unobtrusive, unaffected by a half- century of changes, they have salvaged the precious and youthful feel of the timeless blues: an enthralling and beautiful sound, distinctly feminine, with major chords and melancholy textures.\r\n \r\nTheir more recent recordings have earned them some measure of success, and a few nominations and awards, and what you have here is a selection of works from both grandmothers – as a tribute to the “gran’mas I’ve never had”.\r\n \r\nPrecious Bryant was born in Talbot County, Georgia, in 1942. She was raised in a family of music-makers, in a village packed with stomping blues and spirituals. She soon developed her own inspired style of blues, away from the mainstream, with only her voice and her guitar. In the 1990s, she played the Newport Folk Festival as well as a few concerts in Europe – but mostly she stuck to Georgia and the surrounding areas. In 1967, she walked into a studio for the first time to record with Georges Mitchell. Three wonderful songs still remain from those sessions.\r\nHer music is simple, yet inspired, and speaks of daily struggles. Precious Bryant is one of the last living great blues women from the 20th century – and still living in her mobile-home in the deep woods of Georgia.\r\n \r\nAlgia Mae Hinton was born in Johnston County, North Carolina, on 29th August 1929, in a family of farmers. She was the youngest of 14 and was soon put to work in the fields. At the age of 9 already, her mother taught her the guitar. In 1965, after her husband’s death, she was left alone to raise her 7 children. Despite those circumstances, Algia still managed to impose the musical arts in her household and to pass them on to her children. Music provided the family and the whole community with crucial solace throughout their trials and tribulations. Algia Mae plays the 6-string guitar, the 12-string and the banjo. She’s also an accomplished singer and a fantastic Buck dancer.","options":[{"id":30078121,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94468615/-/granmas-ive-never-had-1.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94468615/-/granmas-ive-never-had-1.jpeg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94468639/-/granmas-ive-never-had.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94468639/-/granmas-ive-never-had.jpeg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":124625,"name":"*Moi J'Connais Records","permalink":"moi-j-connais-records","url":"/artist/moi-j-connais-records"}],"categories":[]},{"id":8404869,"name":"IV -  THE PLACE WHERE WE WERE HIDDEN (10\")","permalink":"iv-the-place-where-we-were-hidden-10","position":14,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/iv-the-place-where-we-were-hidden-10","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-06T16:10:31.000Z","description":"HORROR DISCO.\r\n\r\nDeux mots qui résument à merveille l'expérience musicale du duo parisien IV, quelque part entre le prog-rock de Keith Emerson et la death disco de John Carpenter & Alan Howart.

Improvised and recorded live to two track, the sounds are sourced from unwanted classical vinyl. This ambient music evolves from the plastic grooves morphing into something somber or sometimes joyous. The very material of the original carrier format is an intrinsic part of the music. \r\n\r\nThemes present themselves, only to be pushed back under the water, there are slabs of chord that grind until they release their hidden melodies, run out grooves create click/cut rhythms only to be dubbed out to a teasing piano line. \r\n\r\nLugano Fell has been playing live since November 2011 and will tour to support this release. \r\n\r\nFor fans of: Biosphere, Murcof, Fennesz, Type records, Touch records","options":[{"id":25808268,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/80478561/-/CAMILLE-085FR_arcxiconcover_f01_corrected.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/80478561/-/CAMILLE-085FR_arcxiconcover_f01_corrected.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":205273,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":8404935,"name":"LUGANO FELL - MG092 (12\")","permalink":"lugano-fell-mg092","position":17,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lugano-fell-mg092","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-06T16:15:58.000Z","description":"LUGANO FELL\r\n\r\nMENTAL GROOVE RECORDS\r\nMG092\r\nLIMITED to 33 x 12\" WHITE VINYL NO LABEL\r\n\r\n(NOT AVAILABLE ELSEWHERE)\r\n\r\nA–SIDE\r\nUNTITLED 1\r\n\r\nB–SIDE\r\nUNTITLED 2","options":[{"id":26443128,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/82649085/-/MG092.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/82649085/-/MG092.gif","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":123667,"name":"Lugano Fell","permalink":"lugano-fell","url":"/artist/lugano-fell"}],"categories":[{"id":205277,"name":"Vinyls","permalink":"vinyls","url":"/category/vinyls"}]},{"id":3616210,"name":"(The National Fanfare of) Kadebostany- Songs from Kadebostany (CD)","permalink":"the-national-fanfare-of-kadebostany-songs-from-kadebostany","position":18,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-national-fanfare-of-kadebostany-songs-from-kadebostany","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-04-18T14:34:11.000Z","description":"(The National Fanfare of) Kadebostany \r\nSongs from Kadebostany\t\r\nCD / Digital album\r\n\r\n(The National Fanfare of) Kadebostany is a project without precedent, multicultural, organic and uniquely eccentric. \r\n\r\n(The National Fanfare of) Kadebostany is the breathtaking outcome of electronic music genius Kadebostan's encounter with Belorussian acoustic chamber ensemble Rational Diet. Under the spell of their common love for discovering new ways of expression, they decided to create...a new country. Yes, a new country: Kadebostany! Entrusted with the mission of creating culture for this new land, The Fanfare enlisted the help of talented street musicians from neighboring countries to create a unique piece of music, an organically concocted mix of genres, influences and emotions tightly wrapped in an album with no frontiers.\r\n\r\nThe musical map of (The National Fanfare of) Kadebostany reads like a blueprint for non-electronic techno: hard-hitting yet welcoming like a village feast, cutting-edge yet simple like a long-anticipated hug. Violin, cello, piano, accordion, saxophone, bassoon, guitar, banjo, electronics, and the list goes on, there's no limit in this country!\r\n\r\nWhether it's ominous and bassy (Fast \"King Rashaa\" Mercedes, ode to the engine of big German cars in the streets of Kadebostany), sensual (the subtle strings of \"Kadebostany Mon Amour\"), bonfire inducing (\"Turisty Circus\" with vocalist Joy Frempong), or blue like a heartbreak (\"La Saeta\"), the first record to ever come out of Kadebostany always keeps its reassuring warmth, call it Kadebostanian hospitality.\r\n\r\nThe big hits are here too: \"Kazak Rules\" is relentless, club certified, and mind-freeing, \"Behind the Jajouka\" is a dancefloor magnet, and \"The Legend of the Tattooed Face Woman\" is as epic as its title suggests. These gems are bound to bring a lot of tourism to Ceyzeria, the capital town of Kadebostany.\r\n\r\n<iframe name=\"fairplayer\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"220\" height=\"380\" src=\"http://official.fm/tracks/233314?fairplayer=large&skin=2\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":12085120,"name":"cd","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36320922/-/tnfkweb.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36320922/-/tnfkweb.png","width":573,"height":569}],"artists":[{"id":127725,"name":"*Mental Groove Records","permalink":"mental-groove-records","url":"/artist/mental-groove-records"},{"id":47722,"name":"Kadebostany","permalink":"kadebostany","url":"/artist/kadebostany"}],"categories":[{"id":205273,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":7473453,"name":"Eduardo De La Calle \"SP0000\" ","permalink":"eduardo-de-la-calle-sp0000","position":19,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/eduardo-de-la-calle-sp0000","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-07T13:34:10.000Z","description":"Eduardo De La Calle \"SP0000\"\r\n\r\nLimited Edition of 50 red one sided 12\" served in a white innersleeve.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"150\" height=\"270\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 150px; height: 270px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1352283520/size=tall/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=ffffff/transparent=true/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"http://japon.bandcamp.com/track/eduardo-de-la-calle-sp0000\">Eduardo De La Calle - SP0000 by Civic Force Japan + Mental Groove + Villa Magica</a></iframe>\r\n\r\n\r\nTrack initially released digitally on:\r\n「A compilation for Japan」http://japon.bandcamp.com/\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":23621303,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/82980885/-/SP000-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/82980885/-/SP000-1.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/82980861/-/SP000-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/82980861/-/SP000-2.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73337525/-/spoooo.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73337525/-/spoooo.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73337493/-/spoooo_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73337493/-/spoooo_2.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":118323,"name":"Eduardo De La Calle","permalink":"eduardo-de-la-calle","url":"/artist/eduardo-de-la-calle"}],"categories":[{"id":205277,"name":"Vinyls","permalink":"vinyls","url":"/category/vinyls"}]},{"id":6035991,"name":"Eduardo De La Calle \"Analog Grooves #1\" ","permalink":"eduardo-de-la-calle-analog-grooves-1","position":20,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/eduardo-de-la-calle-analog-grooves-1","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-26T14:20:22.000Z","description":"Eduardo De La Calle (Analog Solutions – Spain) \r\n\"Analog Grooves #1\" \r\nMental Groove Records (MG084) \r\nDistr.

SINNER DC’s unique brand of overwhelming electronic music has left very few indifferent and gathered an avid following that’s certain to grow in number and grow fonder at a listen of Future That Never Happened, the new album planned for release this September on Mental Groove Records. \r\n\r\nA thread running throughout the album is the story of an imaginary teenage girl running away from home. The tracks unfold subtly and gain in intensity, telling an entire story through revealing atmospheric soundscapes supported here by dreamy vocal layers and there by addictive rhythms. Visions of crossing canyons, escaping a city’s aggressive neon lights, fainting in the desert to wake up to a forest fire, delving in thoughts of the worries caused to loved ones, finding refuge in a valley of greenery, and finally reaching the ocean for a symbolized rebirth, all sceneries and feelings imaginable pour through the speakers as the album plays, transcribed to perfection into a musical journey you can’t help but embark on. \r\n\r\nThe infallible formula behind SINNER DC’s music has grown even stronger, they merge electronic layers with organic elements to the best effect.

Sinner DC a exécuté pour la première fois, une version machine, cd, guitares et effets. Les compositions du groupe y ont été revisitées et ré-éthérées. Un mélange entre Spacemen 3 et The Field, entre electronica délicate et drone envoûtante.

Blending together enigmatic atmospheres with typically mental sound architectures of beatmaking, this new album showcases the versatile influences and rich musical background of one of the most promising producers around. \r\n\r\n“Advenir” redefines the electronic/beat genre, pushing its boundaries further out. With a radical approach, Micha Vanony manages to carefully merge hybrid sounds with bewitched beats, odd-tronica, mental hip-hop, deconstructed heavy bass lines, spasmodic keyboards and spatial soundscapes for a brilliant result. \r\n\r\nMicha Vanony is a beatmaker from Monte Carlo, France. Known as a unusual producer, over the years he has been involved in a wide range of music genres, for example in contemporary music where he worked with icons of the experimental music scene such as Pierre Henry or François Bayle. He rapidly left that hermetic circle to work on his own productions and sound installations. In 2010, he released his first record \"Devenir\", an exciting album displaying influences of hip-hop, funk, and futuristic and experimental visions of free jazz. Micha Vanony is also a sound teacher at the School of Fine Arts. \r\n\r\n“Advenir” is Micha’s rich and intelligent contribution to the new beat scene, and will please curious fans of electronic music. \r\n\r\nFor fans of: Flying Lotus, J Dilla, Mr Dibiase,…","options":[{"id":23621949,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73340143/-/pochette_micha_vanony_advenir.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73340143/-/pochette_micha_vanony_advenir.png","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":123665,"name":"Micha Vanony","permalink":"micha-vanony","url":"/artist/micha-vanony"}],"categories":[{"id":205277,"name":"Vinyls","permalink":"vinyls","url":"/category/vinyls"}]},{"id":6352321,"name":"Sox - Birth Etcetera (Limited copies of Japanese import CD)","permalink":"sox-birth-etcetera-limited-japanese-import-cd-pre-order","position":29,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sox-birth-etcetera-limited-japanese-import-cd-pre-order","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-03T14:56:38.000Z","description":"\r\nSox - Birth Etcetera\r\n<p><b>\r\nJapan only CD release - few copies available.\r\nAlso available directly via Disk Union Japan.\r\n\r\nTracklisting :\r\n1 - Birth \r\n2 - Awake \r\n3 - Her feat.Chicros \r\n4 - Belleville \r\n5 - La violence \r\n6 - Lala song feat.

He was known to friends simply as ahbe.\r\nAhbez composed the song \"Nature Boy,\" which became a #1 hit for eight weeks in 1948 for Nat \"King\" Cole and has since become a pop and jazz standard.\r\n\r\nLiving a bucolic life from at least the 1940s, he traveled in sandals and wore shoulder-length hair and beard, and white robes. He camped out below the first L in the Hollywood Sign above Los Angeles and studied Oriental mysticism. He slept outdoors with his family and ate vegetables, fruits, and nuts. He claimed to live on three dollars per week.\r\n\r\nIn 1959, he began recording instrumental music, which combined his signature somber tones with exotic arrangements and \"primitive rhythms\". He often performed bongo, flute, and poetry gigs at beat coffeehouses in the Los Angeles area. In 1960, he recorded his only solo LP, Eden’s Island, for Del-Fi Records. This mixed beatnik poetry with exotica arrangements. Ahbez promoted the album through a coast-to-coast walking tour making personal appearances, but it sold poorly.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful piece of unique music is now available again with a silk-screen handprinted new cover. The record has been remastered. In fine, « Surf Rider », an additionnal song from the original record session has been added to the B-side.\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":21628253,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66904581/-/MJCR014_front.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66904581/-/MJCR014_front.jpg","width":899,"height":898},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66904589/-/MJCR014_back.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66904589/-/MJCR014_back.jpg","width":895,"height":897}],"artists":[{"id":124625,"name":"*Moi J'Connais Records","permalink":"moi-j-connais-records","url":"/artist/moi-j-connais-records"}],"categories":[{"id":205277,"name":"Vinyls","permalink":"vinyls","url":"/category/vinyls"}]},{"id":6630571,"name":"OS BRAZÕES","permalink":"os-brazoes","position":58,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/os-brazoes","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-06T17:05:00.000Z","description":"NEW !!!!\r\n\r\nHere is an obscure slice of late-'60s killer Brazilian psychedelia ! Little is known about OS BRAZÕES except that they formed in Rio De Janeiro late in 1969 and that their main claim to fame was being picked by Gal Costa as her backing band when she was making her early, and hugely, influential forays into Tropicalia – her best and most psychedelic effort being the « Tuareg » song. It turns out her sidemen had a pretty great album in them as well; they created a synthesis of North American rock & roll and native Brazilian styles, with results similar to those being explored by Tropicalia ringleaders Os Mutantes, Gilberto Gil, Jorge Ben, whom the band cover on this record.\r\n \r\nBuzzing fuzz guitars, pop vocals, space-out effects and exotic percussions : the band blend ethnic rhythms with some jazzy, western-influenced pop-rock before launching into weird euphoric space trips!\r\n\r\nMiguel de Deus (vocals, rhythm guitar & arrangements), Roberto (vocals, lead guitar & arrangements), Taco (vocals, bass & arrangements), Eduardo (drums & arrangements) and Mandrake (percussion).\r\n \r\nFor the first time on vinyl again since original 1969 RGE release with a new cover, hand-silk-screen printed. Original copies are long time impossible to find, even in Brazil. All tracks have been remastered. A very special red feather is inserted in each sleeve. \r\n\r\n<iframe name=\"fairplayer\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"40\" src=\"http://official.fm/playlists/90966?fairplayer=small\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":21089211,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65110157/-/OS_BRAZOES.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65110157/-/OS_BRAZOES.jpeg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65110141/-/OS_BRAZOES-1.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65110141/-/OS_BRAZOES-1.jpeg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":124625,"name":"*Moi J'Connais Records","permalink":"moi-j-connais-records","url":"/artist/moi-j-connais-records"}],"categories":[{"id":205277,"name":"Vinyls","permalink":"vinyls","url":"/category/vinyls"}]},{"id":5336157,"name":"Jessie Mae Hemphill \"\"Best Of\"\" (MJCR011)","permalink":"jessie-mae-hemphill-best-of-mjcr011","position":59,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/jessie-mae-hemphill-best-of-mjcr011","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-01-26T23:12:01.000Z","description":"Moi J’Connais Records are really proud to reissue for the first time on vynil some of the early works of Jessie Mae Hemphill.

Her grandfather (Sid Hemphill) was also a fiddle player and bandleader who recorded for Alan Lomax and George Mitchell. Members of the older generation of Hemphills, in a way anticipating Jessie Mae's own musical career, were multi-instrumentalists.\r\nJessie Mae played guitar and drums, wrote and sang her own songs in the primal northern Mississippi hill country blues traditions. She was considered as the Queen of the Guitard Boogie. As one of the earliest successful female blues musicians, Hemphill has been an influential and pioneering artist.\r\n\r\nLimited 180gr Lp with silk-screen printed cover. Including an inside booklet containing biography, interview of Jessie Mae and rare pictures.\r\n\r\n<iframe name=\"fairplayer\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"40\" src=\"http://official.fm/playlists/85746?fairplayer=small\"></iframe>\r\nmoi j'connais","options":[{"id":17256091,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":4.0},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/52397787/-/MJCR011_20front.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/52397787/-/MJCR011_20front.jpeg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/52397815/-/MJCR011_20back.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/52397815/-/MJCR011_20back.jpeg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":124625,"name":"*Moi J'Connais Records","permalink":"moi-j-connais-records","url":"/artist/moi-j-connais-records"},{"id":7903,"name":"Mama Rosin","permalink":"mama-rosin","url":"/artist/mama-rosin"}],"categories":[{"id":205277,"name":"Vinyls","permalink":"vinyls","url":"/category/vinyls"}]},{"id":2681542,"name":"Blind Blake And The Victoria Royal Hotel Calypsos","permalink":"blind-blake-and-the-victoria-royal-hotel-calypsos","position":60,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/blind-blake-and-the-victoria-royal-hotel-calypsos","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-08-02T02:47:12.000Z","description":"BACK IN STOCK !!\r\n\r\nA reissued very limited of the great band and great singer of Calypso from Bahamas!\r\n\r\nA 180gr vynil, silkscreen ultra limited, still strongly smelling ink !!!!\r\n\r\nWith inside … an original postcard of blind Blake at the Royal Victoria Hotel!\r\n\r\nThe very best selection for the first time in LP since the 50's.\r\n\r\nA calypso-jazzy-tropical-moderne experience, a trip between Nassau and Havanna, tastes as a cocktail with rhum, moonshine and whisky!\r\nThe caribean cruise that dreamed your grand mother!\r\n-For all the DJs in the world\r\n-For fine dancers and nice swinger\r\n-Some jazz swing cool before Nat King Cole\r\n-A black pearl sweet and smooth before Robert Mitchum\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1627195248/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=000000/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"http://moijconnais.bandcamp.com/album/mjcr004-blind-blake-the-victoria-royal-hotel-calypsos\">MJCR004 - Blind Blake &amp; the Victoria Royal Hotel Calypsos by Moi J'Connais Records</a></iframe>\r\n","options":[{"id":9450056,"name":"Vinyl","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25854970/-/Screen_shot_2010-08-02_at_12.42.14_AM.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25854970/-/Screen_shot_2010-08-02_at_12.42.14_AM.png","width":695,"height":695},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25854994/-/Screen_shot_2010-08-02_at_12.42.35_AM.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25854994/-/Screen_shot_2010-08-02_at_12.42.35_AM.png","width":695,"height":696}],"artists":[{"id":124625,"name":"*Moi J'Connais Records","permalink":"moi-j-connais-records","url":"/artist/moi-j-connais-records"},{"id":7903,"name":"Mama Rosin","permalink":"mama-rosin","url":"/artist/mama-rosin"}],"categories":[{"id":205277,"name":"Vinyls","permalink":"vinyls","url":"/category/vinyls"}]},{"id":1485671,"name":"Various Artists - Hypnotic Cajun & obscure Zydeco (LP)","permalink":"various-artists-hypnotic-cajun-obscure-zydeco-lp","position":61,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/various-artists-hypnotic-cajun-obscure-zydeco-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-02-05T21:39:37.000Z","description":"BACK IN STOCK !!\r\n\r\nVarious Artists - Hypnotic Cajun & obscure Zydeco (LP)\r\n(Moi j'connais Records - MJR2)\r\n(Mama Rosin/Frères Souchet)\r\n\r\nA selection of the Deep Roots of Mama Rosin:\r\n\r\nSeven songs of Cajun music from 20’s to 50’s versus height songs of very early and 60’s Creole Zydeco fire … Real roots tunes certified pure transandantal music from Louisiana.

This Geneva-based, six-piece band (consisting of former members of Dog Faced Hermans, Spaceheads, Headache, CreveCoeur) crafts pop tunes, but not without tearing them apart through vocalist Liz’s shriekings, erratic drum bangings, uncommon instruments, noise erruptions, … They fuse the wild and free attitude of post punk with tropical and afrobeat vibes. Blasting trombones, skillfully played marimba, screaming vocals, roaring guitars.\r\n\r\nThe sensibility of Orchestre Tout Puissant Marcel Duchamp is post-punk, and the instrumentation is appropriately bizarre – trombone, marimba, fiddle, guitar, drums and double-bass. This Swiss band is surreal in the true sense: more than art, it’s a way of life; of living on the edge of your senses. The players perform with a conviction that, in other circumstances, would be dedicated to fringe religion. Very romantic. Very subversive. Very Gallic.","options":[{"id":17917679,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54640043/-/otpmd_single.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54640043/-/otpmd_single.jpg","width":200,"height":200}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":205277,"name":"Vinyls","permalink":"vinyls","url":"/category/vinyls"}]},{"id":4395115,"name":"NEW!!
