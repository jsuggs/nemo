The two level switches give you options, and the external switch makes it incredibly versatile.  Can't say enough good things about this pedal.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe APE has 7 knobs.\r\n\r\nFrom left to right they are:\r\n\r\n1-Over all volume- This will turn up or down the overall volume of the pedal. I have always wanted control of this in a delay pedal. There have been many times that I have had a spacey delay setting that I wanted a touch louder because when I turned the delay off the dry tone is perceived to be louder than the delay tone. Also you can crank the volume up and get the pedal to overdrive itself.\r\n\r\n2-Repeat filter- This 8-step rotary knob sets the tamber of the repeat tail. It goes from dark and full of lows to high pass and bright or grainy sounding.\r\n\r\n3-Delay level 1- There are two different delay level knobs so that you can set two different delay levels and toggle between them by pushing the Level push button switch. This is a setting that I have always wanted. I am tired of either only having one delay level for the whole set or leaning over to turn the delay level knob for each song.\r\n\r\n4-Delay level 2- See above.\r\n\r\n5-Delay repeat- Sets the repeat feedback of the delay. Of course you can turn it too far and have the pedal over feed itself and get crazy and loud.\r\n\r\n6-Delay time- This is a manual control of the delay. With it you can either set a non tap time or twist it around to get some cool analog delay sweeping tones. The delay time knob also acts as a switch. When the knob is anywhere left of the straight up position the taps will be dotted eighth. When it is anywhere right of straight up it is WYTIWYG (What You Tap Is What You Get).\r\n\r\n7-Mod depth- This controls the depth of the modulation. The modulation is there to emulate the sound of an old tape delay that couldn't hold the tape speed perfectly. The tape would speed up and down and slightly change the delay speed which would create a nice chorus sound.\r\n\r\nIt has 3 push switches\r\n\r\n1-Toggles between Delay level 1 and 2\r\n2-Bypass\r\n3-Tap/Scale\r\n\r\n\r\nAn external tap switch can be plugged in which turns the #3 tap switch into a toggle between dotted eights and WYTIWYG (What You Tap Is What You Get).  With this switch the modulation can be switched on and off by holding the #3 switch down for more than 600ms.  Also six/eight mode can be switched on and off by tapping the #3 switch twice in under 700ms.\r\n\r\nThe APE Delay is an analog path delay with digital delay chips. The digital chips are filtered to give the pedal an analog/tape feel. The delay will go cleanly to around 600milisecs, but it can go to 1000ms. The repeats will be super LoFi at that setting, but it I think it sounds cool.\r\n\r\nI am making this pedal because I want a great sounding delay that has all of the features that I have always wanted in one delay pedal.  I have a hard time turning it off because it sounds so good.\r\n\r\n*This pedal can only be powered by an external 9V DC source where the inside pin is negative. It has no 9V battery plug inside.

Are you searching for a pedal that keeps your tone big like a cranked amp?..  Then your search is over.  The BomesElectric BAT is here.  The BAT is an Overdrive/Gain Boost pedal with Vol, Tone, Gain and a 6 way Bass selector switch.  It has two push button switches, one for bypass and the other toggles between overdrive and gain boost.  The tone of the BAT is warm and thick and will please those looking for a pedal that will keep your tone big.  This pedal is designed to deliver everything from mellow to pushed overdrive tones.  The bass selector rotary switch determines how thick and distorted the low end will be.  This pedal will go from mellow overdrive tones to focused solo or flabby distorted low end tones depending on where you put the bass selector switch.  I made the BAT because I wanted a pedal that kept my tone open like going into a cranked amp instead of filtered and narrow like a lot of other OD/Distortion pedals that I have owned over the years.

There is a preamp stage ,   the gain of which is adjusted with the Drive control.   This stage is followed by a special waveshaping distortion circuit. There is some treble roll-off between the preamp and the special distortion circuit.\r\n\r\nThe frequency at which this treble roll-off happens can be changed with the  Guitar/Bass switch.     The special distortion stage produces strong harmonic overtones, mostly odd harmonic. Higher harmonics are progressively introduced with increased Drive   settings and signal level, so a decaying bass guitar note can sound   like a mean swept filter. Playing double notes, like 4ths or 5ths can produce some strong   intermodulation effects, rather like a ring modulator, but more   musical, albeit more distorted! The Mix control is a balance between the preamp stage output, (CCW)    and the special distortion stage output (CW). For bass guitar, the Mix control would usually be set at around 10 to 12 o’clock.  For guitar, a high  Mix setting, along with reduced Drive can give some rather pleasant overdrive effects. Where the  Drive and Mix controls are set are set to higher settings,  the sound can become all harmonics, with very little fundamental signal, and in some situations may sound a bit thin, especially for bass guitar, but setting the Lo Freq.contour switch to the right takes some low frequency from the Preamp side of the Mixcontrol and mixes it back with the special distortion side.  When used as an effect in a live mixing or recording situation, the P&C can be driven from a spare aux send or channel direct out and   returned to a spare input channel. In this situation the Mix control   would be set to maximum, and there is the added flexibilty of being   able to apply EQ to the distortion effect, and to use it dynamically   within a mix.

The Moonshine is for you. Our Moonshine Overdrive is a highly unique and massively tweaked version of the most famous overdrive ever created and housed in a little green enclosure. Blues, rock, country, jazz, and even hardcore/metal players will find this is an indispensable tool for shaping and creating unique mid heavy tones for almost any need.\r\n\r\nYou’ll immediately feel at home with our basic Volume, Tone, and Drive knobs, so tweak away! The simple 2-position “Proof” toggle gives you everything from low gain amp-like breakup with powerful colored boost settings to grinding, heavy overdrive that reaches to the very edge of cranked amp distortion.\r\n\r\nWith the toggle down, you’ll find the highest gain settings, lots of saturation and sustain and the most mid-range goo available.  In the up position are the more open and forceful crunchy tones that will make any amp beg for mercy. The up position also adds more overall volume and more headroom to those searching for cleaner applications. The tone control goes down as smooth as Grandpa’s White Lightning, with none of the harsh ice-pick characteristics that many overdrives have in the brighter settings.\r\n\r\nJust like the JHS Pedals SuperBolt, the Moonshine uses an internal 9v to 18v charge pump that allows it to run on normal 9v but converting it internally to 18v for an enormous amount of headroom, added low-end and more overall punch.\r\n\r\nWe wouldn’t be surprised if this is the most girthy, thick overdrive you have ever plugged into. If you’re a fan of stacking overdrives, you’ll love putting this in front of or behind your favorite drive, booster, or fuzz. The Moonshine delivers on any style amp, easily producing anything from SRV classic Stratocaster/Fender amp tones with class to huge “wall of rock” The Edge-style force through a Vox. On another note, you might find a few Dumble-esque lead settings that will have you feeling like you saved a cool $100,000 in search of that sacred tone.

We improved vastly on the BB while maintaining what made it a great pedal in the first place. It now has around 4X more headroom, 2X the available gain, and a more useful tone control. The “Bright Cut” toggle allows the perfect level of EQ for your rig.\r\n\r\nYou will notice immediately how touch sensitive and dynamic the feel of this pedal is. The frequencies are perfectly balanced and the tone knob reacts as a high frequency roll off. The drive allows you a huge range of tones from “little wing-ish” chime to classic rock era bite. If you’re a Strat player, this pedal will bring you sounds that you may have thought impossible. If you like the Les Paul, get ready to discover a new pallet of sounds that you won’t be able to live without.\r\n\r\nWith enough clean headroom to be used as a boost as well as a hefty amount of drive, this may be your go-to pedal for good.","options":[{"id":32307952,"name":"Default","price":199.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110644185/-/IMG_2289.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110644185/-/IMG_2289.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111869922/-/IMG_2285.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111869922/-/IMG_2285.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111869970/-/IMG_2286.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111869970/-/IMG_2286.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111870018/-/IMG_2287.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111870018/-/IMG_2287.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111870054/-/IMG_2288.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111870054/-/IMG_2288.jpg","width":750,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4747111,"name":"Effects","permalink":"effects","url":"/category/effects"},{"id":4834954,"name":"Effects - New","permalink":"effects-new","url":"/category/effects-new"},{"id":4967968,"name":"Effects - JHS Pedals","permalink":"effects-jhs-pedals","url":"/category/effects-jhs-pedals"}]},{"id":11117067,"name":"JHS Pulp N' Peel ","permalink":"jhs-pulp-n-peel","position":62,"price":215.0,"default_price":215.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/jhs-pulp-n-peel","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-13T01:31:30.000Z","description":"Compression is the one effect that can make the difference between sounding polished and professional or just normal and part of the crowd. Most people discover that “studio” quality sound in their rigs for the first time when they add a good quality compressor. Our Pulp n Peel compressor is the perfect tool for adding dynamics, flavor and sustain no matter what rig you play.\r\n\r\nAs you may have guessed by our suave design, we based this comp off of a certain vintage design made famous back in the day. Most compressors you see are based off of the Ross/MXR design that yield very squashed high end and a lack of upper end clarity and definition. The Pulp n Peel is not. With the PnP you will find that your guitar's natural color and attack stay in place instead of being forced under a hard and un-transparent squash. Another advantage is its low noise floor and super headroom that allows it to be used as a boost in front of or behind your favorite overdrive/distortion or fuzz. The PnP excels in the fields of blues, jazz, funk and classic rock because of its natural transparency and cooperation with single coils as well as humbuckers. The controls are as simple as it gets with compression, volume and a clean blend knob to dial in your original untouched signal. The idea behind our design is that you will never want to turn it off, and if your looking for the perfect \"leave-on\" compressor that will make your rig sound like a million bucks, then look no further. Once you have experienced what it does to your rig, you will never be the same.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Our blend control blends compression in. All the way up is full compression/preamp tone while rolling it backwards brings in your original uncompressed tone. One more thing, don't play with the trim pot inside of the pedal, as tempting as it is because we set that to a very specific voltage with our fancy electronic tools","options":[{"id":34972104,"name":"Default","price":215.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111870114/-/IMG_2290.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111870114/-/IMG_2290.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111870126/-/IMG_2291.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111870126/-/IMG_2291.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111870150/-/IMG_2292.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111870150/-/IMG_2292.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111870174/-/IMG_2293.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111870174/-/IMG_2293.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111870198/-/IMG_2294.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111870198/-/IMG_2294.jpg","width":750,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4747111,"name":"Effects","permalink":"effects","url":"/category/effects"},{"id":4834954,"name":"Effects - New","permalink":"effects-new","url":"/category/effects-new"},{"id":4967968,"name":"Effects - JHS Pedals","permalink":"effects-jhs-pedals","url":"/category/effects-jhs-pedals"}]},{"id":10320571,"name":"JHS Super Bolt","permalink":"jhs-super-bolt","position":63,"price":199.0,"default_price":199.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/jhs-super-bolt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-03T08:44:55.000Z","description":"From the inception of the Supro Company in 1935 until its closing in 1968, no other brand of amplifier has had such a fascinating, mysterious and legendary story. The Supro® amps deliver the voice of rock and roll, from Jimmy Page’s legendary Led Zeppelin recordings or Brian Setzer’s early Stray Cat tracks, to the raging rhythm tones of Switchfoot’s Drew Shirley. If you have ever played one of these vintage amps then you know nothing sounds the same. No matter how high you take the volume, the amp delivers the same smooth but cutting tone that has shaped countless recordings over its 75+year history.\r\n\r\nThe JHS SuperBolt overdrive pedal, at its heart, is a discreet circuit, designed to emulate the tone and character of the 1960’s-era Supro® amps. From its touch-sensitivity to the way the pedal sags with tube rectifier color at higher gain settings, the SuperBolt will give any guitar rig a versatile and useful new set of tones, reminiscent of some of the greatest sounds ever recorded. With 3 simple knob controls named Volume, Tone, and Drive, you will have the ability to make any guitar rig drip with vintage soul and attitude that no pedal has ever delivered- until now.\r\n\r\nTo understand how the SuperBolt operates, let’s begin with the Drive knob. As you turn up the Drive, it’s like turning the volume knob on one of these small-box vintage amps; the more you turn it up, the dirtier it gets. Next, the Volume knob acts like what some would call a master volume. None of the vintage Supro® amps had this control, but it works perfectly for letting the SuperBolt get the dirty cranked-volume tones with the Drive knob and then backing down the loudness factor with the Volume knob. The third knob is the Tone control, fairly true to the designs in many of these vintage amps. Our Tone control will serve as a breath of fresh air to all of you who are tired of the unusable and treble-ridden tone controls out there. All the way up, it is a biting and sharp tone that is extremely usable and easy on the ears; all the way back, you will find a dark but well-focused range of tones, useful for jazz and more subtle styles.\r\n\r\nThe Hi/Low toggle switch lets you toggle between Hi and Low gain settings, much like the High/Low input jacks found on many of the amps of the 50’s and 60’s. In the down (Hi) position, you’ll find huge amounts of headroom, more upper mids, more available dirt, and the most rock and roll that the pedal can offer. In the up (Low) position, cleaner sounds are available and a slightly darker and more mellow tone. The SuperBolt runs on a basic 9v supply, but internally it converts that 9v to 18v, for massive punch, headroom, and its overall powerful character.  Do not attempt to power the SuperBolt with a 18v power supply.\r\n\r\nYou will notice that the overall tone is open and full, without the compression found in many overdrives on the market. It will compliment a more compressed drive beautifully, and it stacks well with everything we have tried- and we’ve tried a lot. If you love boosting your amp into natural overdrive, you have never heard anything do this like the SuperBolt. It will literally make any amp into a fire-breathing dirt machine. If you want a classic tool for your guitar rig that can handle any style you throw at it, the SuperBolt is for you. We believe this is a truly unique pedal in a world full of overdrives; get a taste of something different today!","options":[{"id":32307901,"name":"Default","price":199.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110644329/-/IMG_2278.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110644329/-/IMG_2278.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111869202/-/IMG_2273.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111869202/-/IMG_2273.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111869250/-/IMG_2274.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111869250/-/IMG_2274.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111869286/-/IMG_2275.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111869286/-/IMG_2275.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111869319/-/IMG_2276.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111869319/-/IMG_2276.jpg","width":750,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4747111,"name":"Effects","permalink":"effects","url":"/category/effects"},{"id":4834954,"name":"Effects - New","permalink":"effects-new","url":"/category/effects-new"},{"id":4967968,"name":"Effects - JHS Pedals","permalink":"effects-jhs-pedals","url":"/category/effects-jhs-pedals"}]},{"id":13274940,"name":"JHS / Ernie Ball Active VP Jr","permalink":"jhs-ernie-ball-active-vp-jr","position":64,"price":149.0,"default_price":149.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/jhs-ernie-ball-active-vp-jr","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-31T00:01:05.000Z","description":"The Ernie Ball volume pedal is one of the most used pedals out there, but surprisingly it has BIG issues.

We got hip to it through hearing of Daniel Lanois using it lately, so had to check it out.\r\n\r\nThe EKKO 616 DARK is a full featured yet compact delay with external modulation controls, an optional buffer, internal level pot and 650ms of pure analog bliss! Every detail of the E616 DARK was scrutinized, data sheets compared, parts swapped, and hours of listening followed before we were satisfied. These resulting hand picked components of the highest quality are used to achieve what we consider the nicest sounding, darkest analog delay pedal we’ve made!\r\n\r\nThe EKKO 616 DARK is based on the EKKO 616 MKII yet voiced to have delays with the high frequencies rolled off, like a low-pass filter set to about 400Hz. This allows sparkling guitars to reside over a dark background of morphing overtones (when set to high regeneration amounts), or a super-fat chug sound at less regen, shorter delay times and just the right amount of effect mixed in.\r\n\r\nThe E616 DARK’s specially voiced repeats create a much heavier and muted delay sound than most traditional analog delays. Turn the mix pot all the way up and the repeats will be just louder than unity with the dry signal. The regeneration pot will take you from a simple slapback to a nice gentle decay of a few repeats then all the way to taking off into inner space with just a turn of the pot! Engage the modulation button and the EKKO 616 DARK takes on a whole new personality, from subtle chorusing or beautiful vibrato to way WAY beyond. Choose between true bypass or buffered bypass. The EKKO 616 DARK’s buffer circuit is smooth and transparent, even with many pedals on your board. Tired of annoying volume drops? An internal trimpot (labeled “gain”) will allow you to set the EKKO 616 DARK’s level to your specific setup.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":39547713,"name":"Default","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121522452/-/IMG_2809.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121522452/-/IMG_2809.jpg","width":2736,"height":3648},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121522422/-/IMG_2790.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121522422/-/IMG_2790.jpg","width":2693,"height":3590},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121522431/-/IMG_2791.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121522431/-/IMG_2791.jpg","width":2736,"height":3648},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121522437/-/IMG_2792.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121522437/-/IMG_2792.jpg","width":2736,"height":3648},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121522440/-/IMG_2793.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121522440/-/IMG_2793.jpg","width":2736,"height":3648}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4747111,"name":"Effects","permalink":"effects","url":"/category/effects"},{"id":4834954,"name":"Effects - New","permalink":"effects-new","url":"/category/effects-new"},{"id":5799399,"name":"Effects - Malekko","permalink":"effects-malekko","url":"/category/effects-malekko"}]},{"id":12454506,"name":"Malekko Omicron Analog Trem","permalink":"malekko-omicron-analog-trem","position":67,"price":99.0,"default_price":99.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/malekko-omicron-analog-trem","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-19T03:58:11.000Z","description":"“TREM” is a tiny little machine that packs a volumetric ton of oomph.

The third stage is where the NG magic takes place; it simulates a tube amp that has been over biased or has suffered serious tube or output transformer failure (The sound just before the fuse blows). The SUSTAIN control adjusts the signal level into the third section and can be adjusted from ‘Tired Output Tubes’ to ‘Melted Tubes and Shorted Output Transformer’.\r\n\r\nTONE and VOLUME controls complete the ensemble to allow matching to your bypassed signal. To glory in the sound of this pedal feed it into an amp capable of delivering huge amounts of clean, pure tone into your speakers.","options":[{"id":48295218,"name":"Default","price":729.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127697577/-/IMG_5818.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127697577/-/IMG_5818.jpg","width":2787,"height":4180},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127697547/-/IMG_5813.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127697547/-/IMG_5813.jpg","width":2848,"height":4272},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127697553/-/IMG_5814.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127697553/-/IMG_5814.jpg","width":2848,"height":4272},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127697562/-/IMG_5815.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127697562/-/IMG_5815.jpg","width":2848,"height":4272},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127697565/-/IMG_5816.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127697565/-/IMG_5816.jpg","width":2848,"height":4272}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4747105,"name":"Used","permalink":"used","url":"/category/used"},{"id":4811983,"name":"Effects - Used/Vintage","permalink":"effects-used-vintage","url":"/category/effects-used-vintage"}]},{"id":11661765,"name":"Zvex Super Hard On w/ power plate (used)","permalink":"zvex-super-hard-on-w-power-plate","position":86,"price":159.0,"default_price":159.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/zvex-super-hard-on-w-power-plate","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-08T17:42:21.000Z","description":"This is one of our favorite version of the Super Hard On, because it is older (2003), and has an LED, which is convenient.

Dave from The Fray uses this as his main delay.\r\n\r\nThe Vintage Delay will instantly bring you back to the days of warm, lush, all-tube echoes, and at the same time it connects you to the state-of-the-art digital delays of today. It builds on the legacy of the classic TC 2290, the holy grail of delays. Resurrect the tape echo of the sixties, recreate the analog temperate sound of the tubes, or be cool with the studio quality delays. Tap-tempo lets you set the pace, and several control knobs gives you the power to be delayed, but not late.\r\n\r\nVintage Series Overview\r\nThe Vintage pedals from TC Electronic will awaken any slumbering desire to revisit the past with today's technology. All pedals build on a classical approach to guitar effects and are perfectly aligned with the TC guitar legacy. From giants of the past like the SCF pedal and the G-Force, over newly released VPD1 and G-System, TC Electronic offers you a complete range of guitar effects. \r\n\r\nThe new Vintage Series covers a wide range of sonic ground, and you're sure to find something that will add that extra quality and spice to your music. Spanning from Vintage Compressor, Vintage Tremolo and Vintage Delay, to Vintage Overdrive, Vintage Distortion, and Vintage Dual Distortion, the possibilities are infinite. We've even thrown in a Vintage Bass Distortion for that extra punch to the bottom. Combine the pedals in a classical sequence or hook them up to the G-System; the choice is yours. With the new Vintage Series, TC Electronic has ensured your freedom to choose your individual setup and sound.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\nDelay time -- Sets the delay time. The delay time can be set from approx. 10ms to 1500ms.\r\n\r\nFeedback Level -- Sets the amount of signal that is fed back to the input of the delay line. The higher setting the more delay repeats.\r\n\r\nDelay Level -- Controls the level of the delay repeats.\r\n\r\nOutput Level -- Output level for the effect.\r\n\r\nFilter -- To reproduce the slight deterioration of the delay repeats that was significant to old tape echoes the Filter can be switched on. This function gives a warmer sound on the delay repeats that allows long relatively loud delay repeats to blend much better in your overall sound.\r\n\r\nTriplets -- In off position (up), the tapped tempo equals the delay time between the repeats. If you e.g. tap quarter notes at tempo 120BPM, the delay will repeat times 2 per second. When the triplet function is activated -- the delay repeats will play quarter note triplets according to the tapped tempo. That means 6 repeats per bar.","options":[{"id":31503313,"name":"Default","price":199.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99447370/-/IMG_1862.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99447370/-/IMG_1862.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99665479/-/IMG_2026.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99665479/-/IMG_2026.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99665527/-/IMG_2027.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99665527/-/IMG_2027.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99665575/-/IMG_2028.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99665575/-/IMG_2028.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99665587/-/IMG_2029.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99665587/-/IMG_2029.jpg","width":750,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4747105,"name":"Used","permalink":"used","url":"/category/used"},{"id":4811983,"name":"Effects - Used/Vintage","permalink":"effects-used-vintage","url":"/category/effects-used-vintage"}]},{"id":10122892,"name":"T-Rex Replica Delay (used)","permalink":"t-rex-replica-delay","position":100,"price":229.0,"default_price":229.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/t-rex-replica-delay","status":"sold-out","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-03-24T04:52:37.000Z","description":"Such a great sounding delay.  Comes with adapter.\r\n\r\nThe Replica utilizes truly amazing circuitry to create the most amazing delay. Unlike other digital units that use a DSP chip to sample at 44.1 kHz, the Replica uses 2 Burr Brown 24-bit converters (1 Analog to Digital; 1 Digital to Analog) to sample at an unprecedented rate of 200 kHz! In order to maintain full dynamics, the signal is routed from the input ADC directly into RAM, where it is manipulated (according to the unit's settings) and then routed directly to the Output DAC. The circuitry is entirely analog, with the exception of the 24-bit converters and RAM. An input pad switch can be engaged (attenuation of -10 dB) for studio use. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the Replica can be made to sound more \"analog\" by pressing the \"Brown\" button which engages a Hi-cut filter that alters the tone of the repeats. The result is a warmer, smoother delay reminiscent of a 60's era tape echo. The Replica is true (hot-wire) bypass and is capable of delay settings up to 2000ms. The Replica also features a tap tempo function (which can be controlled externally, via the built-in MIDI socket), and a subdivision function (which when engaged, creates triplets, based on the \"tapped\" quarter note tempo). The Replica provides a direct out 1/4 in. jack and contains a built-in power supply.

After a week of playing it, he asked me to repair his primary SCH-1, as well as modify three of his other SCH-1 pedals to specs we had discussed. When I received Michael's SCH-1's, I noticed that his primary SCH-1 had many component deviations compared to the stock version: different potentiometer values, different op-amps and more, all resulting in an incredibly unique sound. After deconstructing the deviations in Michael's primary SCH-1, I suggested that if he wanted the same sonic characteristics in all of his SCH-1 pedals, that I could include two voicings inside each pedal: one based on his primary and unique sounding SCH-1, and the other based on the modified version I had been working on, which included specs Michael had personally requested. He liked the idea (and so did I!). After returning the pedals, and after several months of satisfied use, I asked Michael if I could name this modified design after him. Michael approved and the Vertex \"Michael Landau\" SCH-1 and SCH-Z modifications were born.  \r\nModification Features:\r\n•\tTrue Bypass\r\n•\tTwo distinct chorus voicings:\r\nVOICE 1 - Michael Landau voicing, identical to Michael's primary Arion SCH-1  (warm and smooth chorusing with a thick mid-range presence, and lots of body).\r\nVOICE 2 - Vertex voicing, based on the modifications requested by Michael  (faster chorusing speeds, with more depth and warbling, and a wider tone control for more subtle and extreme settings).\r\n•\tExternal level trim-pot (from off to +2dB over unity gain)\r\n•\tImproved stereo functionality\r\n•\tHigh visibility white LED indicator\r\n•\tPremium USA-made components\r\n•\tHandcrafted in California \r\n","options":[{"id":31677898,"name":"Default","price":249.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":20.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99450547/-/IMG_1893.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99450547/-/IMG_1893.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99640267/-/IMG_2073.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99640267/-/IMG_2073.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99640279/-/IMG_2074.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99640279/-/IMG_2074.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99640351/-/IMG_2076.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99640351/-/IMG_2076.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99640303/-/IMG_2075.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99640303/-/IMG_2075.jpg","width":750,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4747111,"name":"Effects","permalink":"effects","url":"/category/effects"},{"id":5283192,"name":"Effects - Vertex","permalink":"effects-vertex","url":"/category/effects-vertex"}]},{"id":11780334,"name":"Marshall Bluesbreaker Pedal Mk1 (used)","permalink":"marshall-bluesbreaker-pedal-mk1-used","position":118,"price":229.0,"default_price":229.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/marshall-bluesbreaker-pedal-mk1-used","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-14T03:48:21.000Z","description":"Made famous by John Mayer, this is a great blues overdrive pedal.
