A product that has been in my skin care regimen for quite a while now and is at the top of the list when it comes to clearing blemishes and removing impurities that may be skin deep.\r\n\r\nThis cleanser helps to normalize the skin to provide a radiant glow, something I pride myself on having year round.\r\n\r\nThe Oil Cleansing Method is simply of course, cleansing your face with oil. A lot of people are afraid of this method for fear that their skin will break out, however, oil alone does not create blemishes and a good thing to know is oil dissolves oil so it can be used on any skin type. Acne/Blemishes are caused by several factors such as age, hormones, bacteria, dead skin cells and the buildup of these factors.\r\n\r\nMost products strip the oil out of our skin, leaving our largest organ trying to repair itself by replacing the oil stripped away…yes that’s right, your skin naturally secretes oil, even when it feels dry, it has oil on it.  When you strip your skin of its sebum, it goes into overdrive, trying to create more. Which leads to clogged pores, blackheads, whiteheads, you name it.  Your skin may go through a phase for up to 3 weeks where it is getting rid of impurities, this is the time where you want to be patient let the oil cleanser do its thing, clear and normalize your skin.\r\n\r\nCastor Oil - gives you the most cleansing compared to other oils, it draws out dirt, bacteria, dead skin cells and anything else trapped in your pores.  It also heals the skin. \r\n\r\nGrapeseed Oil - High in Vitamin C and E, a powerhouse in the fight against aging, stabilizing collagen and elastin in the skin while treating the issues our largest organ faces.\r\n\r\nJojoba Oil - Closely resembles sebum of skin, rich in Vitamin E and promotes a glowing complexion.
