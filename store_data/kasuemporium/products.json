The test for a quality pashmina is warmth and feel. Pashmina and Cashmere are both derived from Changthangi. One distinct difference between Pashmina and Cashmere is the fiber diameter.

Now's your chance to own one without any harm to widlife.  Or your could give it to a child you love, knowing that they are made from pure wool and stuffed with new cotton floss.\r\n\r\nThese little guys come from the Himalayan region of far north India in the state of Uttarakhand.  They are hand knitted from wool by artisans who receive a fair price for their work.  The colours on these cute toys are the colours of the mountains: all are made from the local vegetation and minerals.\r\n\r\nAs in nature, no two elephants are alike: each little face is a bit different: the ears curl forward or back; the eyes sleepy or awake; some are plump, others svelte; the cute striped sweaters mix and match with their owners. They stand about 12 to 14cm high: small enough to sneak into your pocket or to give to a human baby.\r\n\r\nWe have quite a herd of them in stock - too many for each to have its own mugshot, so we have grouped them into colours. The images below are an indication only. Eg: if you order a grey baby elephant, he may have a slightly different combination of colours, and the same with other colours. The colour quoted is the main body colour.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Free postage for this item if purchased with another product from Kasu Emporium.\r\n\r\n10% OF THE SALE PRICE OF THIS PRODUCT GOES TO SOMEONE IN NEED.\r\n","options":[{"id":29234078,"name":"dark red","price":11.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29234081,"name":"blue","price":11.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29234084,"name":"orange","price":11.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29234087,"name":"pale green","price":11.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29234090,"name":"olive green","price":11.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29234093,"name":"beige","price":11.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29234096,"name":"dark grey","price":11.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29285132,"name":"chocolate","price":11.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.9,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":9,"name":"China","code":"CN"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":104,"name":"Fiji","code":"FJ"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":20,"name":"India","code":"IN"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":126,"name":"Indonesia","code":"ID"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":27,"name":"Malaysia","code":"MY"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}},{"amount_alone":27.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":27.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91829750/-/elephant_rain.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91829750/-/elephant_rain.jpg","width":720,"height":720},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91829666/-/E-_grey.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91829666/-/E-_grey.jpg","width":480,"height":720},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91990208/-/E-blue2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91990208/-/E-blue2.jpg","width":480,"height":720},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91829654/-/E-_green_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91829654/-/E-_green_2.jpg","width":480,"height":720},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91829690/-/E-_orange.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91829690/-/E-_orange.jpg","width":480,"height":720}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3380397,"name":"SHOP - toys","permalink":"shop-toys","url":"/category/shop-toys"},{"id":5379492,"name":"COLOURS","permalink":"colours","url":"/category/colours"},{"id":5398860,"name":"COLOURS - blue, green & purple","permalink":"colours-blue-green-purple","url":"/category/colours-blue-green-purple"},{"id":5398869,"name":"COLOURS - multicoloured","permalink":"colours-multicoloured","url":"/category/colours-multicoloured"},{"id":5398863,"name":"COLOURS - natural","permalink":"colours-natural","url":"/category/colours-natural"},{"id":5398872,"name":"COLOURS - black, grey & brown","permalink":"colours-black-grey-brown","url":"/category/colours-black-grey-brown"},{"id":5398875,"name":"COLOURS - neutral","permalink":"colours-neutral","url":"/category/colours-neutral"},{"id":4580675,"name":"NEW STOCK","permalink":"new-stock","url":"/category/new-stock"}]},{"id":9342470,"name":"Block printed cotton covered notebooks from Jaipur","permalink":"block-printed-cotton-covered-notebooks-from-jaipur","position":73,"price":7.6,"default_price":7.6,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/block-printed-cotton-covered-notebooks-from-jaipur","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-06T07:22:56.000Z","description":"We found these delightful handmade notebooks in the Indian city of Jaipur, Rajasthan.

These babies have kept themselves nice down through the ages (well, from the 40s & 50s), dodging the needle and thread, sidestepping cardies and coats, frocks and all manner of frippery to arrive clean and virginal in my button box.

His plump body curves to a short tail, and he has short legs attached to bars with holes in them. It looks like it originally may have some practical usepurpose, but that is now a mystery. He is 11 cm long and very cute.\r\n\r\nDhokra bronze objects are created by the lost wax method.
