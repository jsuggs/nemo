The album is released in the UK via Heist Or Hit Records on Monday 17th February, led by the standout single, ‘Honeycomb’.\r\n\r\nSince the release of debut album ‘On Claws’ in 2010, I Am Oak has built an impressive track record. The band won a 3VOOR12 Award for Best Album of 2011, and last year’s stunning follow-up, ‘Nowhere or Tammensaari’, gave them the opportunity to tour in thirteen countries worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch folk/indie band, formed around songwriter Thijs Kuijken, create hauntingly beautiful music that takes the listener on a journey through Kuijken’s observational and nature influenced songwriting and mesmeric vocals.\r\n\r\nThe songs that make up new album ‘Ols Songd’ were actually written many years ago, but have remained unreleased until now.  Kuijken explains: “These are old songs. While they were being written, they were already old songs. Though the content of the songs was current when they were written, the feelings enveloped in these songs had come over me before, making them old and new at the same time. Some time ago, another wave of similar feelings rolled in, reminding me of the old songs, obscuring the ability to differentiate between past and present – and inevitably the two intertwine.”\r\n","options":[{"id":50874417,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":184,"name":"Poland","code":"PL"}},{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.75,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.75,"amount_with_others":2.75,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.75,"amount_with_others":3.5},{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129591576/-/IAO_OS_digi_1400px.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129591576/-/IAO_OS_digi_1400px.jpg","width":1400,"height":1400}],"artists":[{"id":119935,"name":"I Am Oak","permalink":"i-am-oak","url":"/artist/i-am-oak"}],"categories":[{"id":219558,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":14019978,"name":"High Hazels - Hearts Are Breaking (7\" Vinyl)","permalink":"high-hazels-hearts-are-breaking-7-vinyl","position":2,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/high-hazels-hearts-are-breaking-7-vinyl","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-07T09:26:52.000Z","description":"Tracklisting:\r\na) Hearts Are Breaking\r\nb) Five Weirs (acoustic)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Limited Edition (ONLY 300 COPIES) *\r\n*Comes with FREE MP3 download code for a-side and b-side*\r\n* All prices subject to P&P *\r\n___________________________________________\r\n\r\nDrawing on a love and appreciation for the timeless charms of Britain’s great northern songwriters & poets - James Skelley, Steven Patrick Morrissey, John Cooper Clarke - High Hazels are a young quartet from Sheffield who will release their debut single ‘Hearts Are Breaking’ via Heist or Hit Records on the 7th October.\r\n\r\nFronted by James Leesley, High Hazels include Anthony Barlow on percussion, brother Paul Barlow on bass and guitarist Scott Howes.

Music that takes you on a journey, that’s what the judges of the 3VOOR12 Award 2011 wrote. That prize was for Oasem (pronounced as awesome) by I Am Oak, according to the judges the best Dutch album of that year.\r\nThijs Kuijken from Utrecht wrote the folk album alone and performs it with I Am Oak. A trip to Finland was a huge inspiration for the music, lyrics and whole idea of the album. Those big thoughts come in small songs and just because Kuijken is holding back, the album is full of tension. Oasem is the next step in a career that slowly but steadily unfolds. The album before Oasem was more acoustic, now the guitars are plugged in, although every song would hold its strength when played acoustic.\r\nKuijken made an album to listen to, not just a collection of singles with some fillers, it’s a listening experience.

His debut LP, Infinite Traffic Everywhere, is a collection of DIY recordings made in and around the creative collective from which mentioned band emerged. \r\n\r\nWhile relying for the most part on sequenced electronics, the musical landscape is a sonic collage of scarcely recorded drums, heavily processed guitars and loops. The record is minimalistic and elaborate, yet intuitive and direct. \"Aerial has always been keen on keeping our work abstract and open for interpretation, both musically and thematically\" Sebastian explains, \"and with Simian Ghost I wanted to do something that is more in the form of one way communication, as traditional pop music dictates. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso the tunes revolve more around the vocals rather than the other way around\". This is apparent while listening to songs such as the pop gems Transparent is OK and Star Receiver, and though the record may be very traditional in some aspects, the arrangements are still as complex and multi-layered as in those of his earlier work. \r\n\r\nThe themes span from issues such as growing up in the ever expanding information society, to sexual ambivalence, Eastern philosophy and the tv-series the Sopranos. \r\n\r\n\"I guess that this is what a debut album is supposed to be in a way. More personal and honest. But in the end I still like to keep it kind of open for the listener to decide what to make of it\".\r\n__________________________\r\n\r\nAll prices subject to P&P.","options":[{"id":14937471,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":184,"name":"Poland","code":"PL"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":1.75,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":4.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":4.5},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/44685877/-/Infinite_Traffic_Everywhere.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/44685877/-/Infinite_Traffic_Everywhere.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":79379,"name":"Simian Ghost","permalink":"simian-ghost","url":"/artist/simian-ghost"}],"categories":[{"id":224358,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":4133216,"name":"Rapids! - Fragments EP (CD)","permalink":"rapids-fragments-ep-cd","position":15,"price":3.5,"default_price":3.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rapids-fragments-ep-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-07-22T12:22:37.000Z","description":"‘Fragments’ is the sound of a band discovering its true identity; peeling back layers of bouncy math-pop beats and angular guitar hooks, leaving at its core a body of work that swirls with deep intensity and primal emotion.
