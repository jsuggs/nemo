The roaring 20's and Lefty O'Doul.  Recreation Park was the home of it all.  Formerly located at the corner of 14th and Valencia in San Francisco's Mission District, Recreation Park was the quintessential neighborhood ballpark.  Nestled into a residential community, it was a grand structure built primarily from wood.  An interesting material choice considering the earthquake and fires of 1906 destroyed its predecessor.  \r\n\r\nFrom its inception in 1907 until its final season in 1930, the park housed three different professional teams and was the spring training site of the Chicago White Sox in 1909 and 1910.  Because of the mild climate, San Franciscans enjoyed some of the longest seasons in professional play, some exceeding 200 games.  Undoubtedly, it was this passion for baseball that landed San Francisco on the short list for Major League Baseball's westward expansion in the 1950's\r\n\r\nAvailable in two classic ballpark colors, each hand-pulled silkscreen print is laid onto a hand painted background giving the image the depth and character of a time worn sign.\r\n\r\nOpen edition.
