Gandhi led the 24-day, 240-mile tax resistance march, breaking the salt laws on 5 April 1930, where growing numbers of Indians joined him along the way, sparking large scale acts of civil disobedience against the British Raj salt laws. The campaign received worldwide news coverage and had \r\na significant effect on the changing world and British attitudes towards Indian independence.

It is said that Joseph started selling his biscuits to the travellers on the coaches outside his shop. Because he found the biscuits were vulnerable to breakage on the coach journey, he started putting them in metal tins. Out of this innovation grew two businesses: Joseph's biscuit shop that was to become Huntley & Palmers, and Huntley, Bourne and Stevens, a firm of biscuit tin manufacturers founded by his younger son, also called Joseph.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 Joseph Huntley was forced by ill-health to retire, handing control of the business to his older son Thomas, and in 1841, Thomas took his distant cousin George Palmer, who soon became the chief force behind the businesses success. The company created one of the world's first global brands and ran what was once the world’s largest biscuit factory.\r\n\r\nThe name 'Patisserie Pants' was inspired by the bulbous shape of this tubby character.

These precious component parts, were offered to local pinball restorers. \r\n\r\nWorking with the original shape and incline of the cabinet and playfield, to retain all the original artwork, the once tilted cabinet was levelled as a table top, so each bespoke wooden leg was fitted on a slight angle to fit the cabinet. Each wooden leg was fitted using chunky nuts and bolts. \r\n\r\nThe cabinet was then fitted with a wooden magazine rack, replacing the area where the machines back-box scoreboard was removed. \r\n\r\nAll the wooden components were handmade using Ash wood to match the playfield. The Ash was then oiled with 3 layers of Danish oil for a natural, low lustre finish.\r\n\r\nThe original glass top has been replaced with toughened safety glass.\r\n\r\nThe table was then fitted with a 3 Core Vintage Gold Silk Covered Flexible Cable, attached to a tough plug, fitted with a 3 Amp Fuse, attached to a junction box, and connected to long life, warm white, twinkling LED lamps; 6 of the 28 LED bulbs twinkle.\r\n\r\nDimensions: H58 x W66 x L138\r\n\r\n* Please be advised that this piece is a repurposed pinball machine which no longer functions to be played, but appreciates the aesthetics, history and memory of the pinball machine. \r\n\r\n* At the time of being purchased for repurpose, the machine was 38 years old. This machine has not been restored, it was purchased for the appreciation of natural wear and tear that comes with age. Though such wear and tear adds to the aesthetics of this vintage piece, it does not effect the stability of its structure.\r\n\r\n* The delivery charge for this item will be quoted individually, based upon delivery rates to your location.
