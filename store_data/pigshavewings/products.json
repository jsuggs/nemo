The carefully sculpted cloud and each of its raindrops are hand felted from soft Merino wool using a single barbed needle. It is a time consuming process, but the outcome is worth it.\r\n\r\nThe cloud hangs from strong monofilament, as do the raindrops, giving the illusion from afar that it floats as it spins gently in the slightest breeze.\r\n\r\nEach mobile is made to order so please expect up to two weeks for delivery. If you would like the raindrops in your own choice of colours, just contact me and I will be happy to oblige.\r\n\r\nPlease take care to hang mobiles out of reach of small and mischievous hands.","options":[{"id":27136032,"name":"Default","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":8.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/85100721/-/2ndCloud1copy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/85100721/-/2ndCloud1copy.jpg","width":667,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4258470,"name":"Mobiles","permalink":"mobiles","url":"/category/mobiles"}]},{"id":8648043,"name":"Tweet Tweet Mobile","permalink":"tweet-tweet-mobile","position":3,"price":55.0,"default_price":55.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tweet-tweet-mobile","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-21T17:14:07.000Z","description":"Sweet little birds in shades of teal, yellow and pink perch upon reclaimed branches collected from Highgate Wood in London.
