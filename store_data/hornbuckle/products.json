She is prominently featured in songs by AIR, M83, Crooked Cowboy, Jun Miyake, and Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, as well as with Tyler Bates on the <em>Watchmen</em> film score. Additionally, Lisa is one half of Big Sir with Juan Alderete and ME&LP with Matt Embree, both of whom make guest appearances on <em>Blood Noise</em>, her third solo album.  These nine songs create their own microscopic world that runs a vein through each one's respective atmosphere, proving that Lisa is more than just a vocalist&mdash;her whole presence assumes the role of the instrument. That presence and perseverance brought this album to fruition as she battled serious health issues over the course of its recording, resulting in a vulnerable, raw, and emotionally fearless collection of songs comprised of first takes.</p>\r\n<p>Lisa has been one of our favorite voices in music since she was a member of Pet in the mid-'90s and has since become one of our favorite people. We are extremely excited and honored to have a small part in getting this album out to the world by releasing a limited edition cassette with a full-color insert and yellow-tinted case.

Together they have released two excellent albums of dance jams and chill-out tunes that will get stuck in your head for weeks&mdash;<em>The Heart of the Nightlife</em> in 2010 and <em>Kids in LA</em> earlier this year. Around the time of their first album, they also quietly released a digital EP of instrumental synth songs that could easily be the soundtrack for a sci-fi film yet to be made. Inspired by NASA space shuttle launches and the film <em>For All Mankind</em>, which documents the Apollo missions, this release focuses more on atmosphere than hooks. Despite having no vocals or lyrics, we actually found these songs to be as catchy as the albums and felt that they deserved to be more than just a download.</p>\r\n<p>We are very excited to present the first physical release of <em>Other Planets</em>, now available on chrome tape in a limited edition purple cassette. When planning this project, we also wanted to do something special with the artwork, so each insert is hand screen-printed and numbered.

The band's stay on Earth was brief, and when they were gone, silence. Retreating from the evil forces of Alabama, their spacecraft crash-landed into the bottom of an Oregon volcano. Only now, four million years later (okay, fifteen years later) the volcano has erupted, and a decomposing 19-song master CD-R has emerged from the wreckage of their ship.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>With this historic archive finally in hand, we are offering these translucent red cassettes containing its glorious contents to commemorate the legacy of Thee Autobots.
