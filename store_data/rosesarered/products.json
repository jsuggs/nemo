I don't send the watch ticking - I don't think Royal Mail wouldn't like ticking packages, plus it saves the battery! So to start the watch - turn the dial on top to the correct time then press down again until you hear a click. To just open up the watch, press the little stud on the top of the fob down. Battery is replaceable once run down.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/product/gift-box\"><img border=0 alt=\"Get this item gift boxed\" src= \"http://www.ringalex.com/rar/GiftboxICONcopy.png\" ></a></b>","options":[{"id":21116651,"name":"Default","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":2.95,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65195477/-/tearosewatch1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65195477/-/tearosewatch1.jpg","width":447,"height":456},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65195393/-/tearose3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65195393/-/tearose3.jpg","width":671,"height":520},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65195421/-/tearose4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65195421/-/tearose4.jpg","width":541,"height":442},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65195449/-/tearose5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65195449/-/tearose5.jpg","width":977,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/65195373/-/tearose2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/65195373/-/tearose2.jpg","width":313,"height":557}],"artists":[{"id":74134,"name":"Summer Meadow","permalink":"summer-meadow","url":"/artist/summer-meadow"}],"categories":[{"id":2225121,"name":"Pocket watches","permalink":"pocket-watches","url":"/category/pocket-watches"},{"id":137166,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]},{"id":5751475,"name":"Dreams Take Flight ring ","permalink":"dreams-take-flight-ring","position":49,"price":7.95,"default_price":7.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dreams-take-flight-ring","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-03-22T02:12:54.000Z","description":"Divine golden band of a swooping bird with a tiny crystal sparkle - let your dreams soar! \r\n\r\nThis item is raw brass, do not get it wet!
