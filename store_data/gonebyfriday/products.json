We recorded this album way back in September-October 2010 and originally planned on a February 2011 release. Unfortunately due to complications involving the lineup and money issues, this release got a little delayed.\r\n\r\n    If you've been waiting for this album since February, WE ARE SORRY! But hey better late than never right?\r\n\r\n    Here's a little back story to this album:\r\n\r\n    We started recording Noisetank 9/23/10 and finished 10/03/10 at Killingsworth Studios in Farmingdale, NY. We had 2 rough months of preproduction before hand with our producers Michael Gaudiello & Anthony Santonocito.\r\n\r\n    We had a blast recording the album and even put up some video blogs on our youtube page about it. The end result as you hear now is the result of all the hard work, the blood, sweat, tears, stress and everything we went through to make this album happen. Mommy and daddy didn't pay for this album. We did. We put in all the hard hours working our asses off to get this out for the world to hear.\r\n\r\n    Each track on this CD explains an event or a feeling we were going through. At the end of the day we are real people. writing about real everyday situations. These songs are easy to relate too and we hope you enjoy them.\r\n\r\n    If you enjoyed this album, please tell all your friends, hell even give them the mp3's for free. And if you live outside of NY, don't be afraid to shoot us a email, give us some local venues. We will try our best to come through.\r\n\r\n    This is our dream, and this CD is literally made with every last penny in our pockets. We are Gone By Friday, hope to see you soon.\r\n\r\n    Thank you\r\n\r\n    Billy, Peter & Chris\r\ncredits\r\n    released 18 October 2011\r\n    Billy Kupillas - Lead Vocals/Guitar\r\n    Peter Berardi - Lead Guitar/Vocals\r\n    Chris Berardi - Drums/Loud\r\n\r\n    Michael Gaudiello - Producer\r\n    Anthony Santonocito - Producer ","options":[{"id":15347003,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/45912425/-/finalcoversmall_copy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/45912425/-/finalcoversmall_copy.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2550923,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
