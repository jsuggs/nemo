Mick Gorry (Bass 2000-3) joined shortly afterwards.</p>\r\n<p>The band started gigging regularly from mid 2001 onwards after Stuart Penderghast (Lead guitar 2001) completed the line-up. For the first year Diamanthian concentrated mainly on the North West, then branched out playing all over the UK, from Glasgow to London and everywhere in between.</p>\r\n<p>2002 saw Stuart leave the band to concentrate on his recently revived Malefic. After a five month search for a new axeman, enter Kev ‘Troy’ Dixon (Lead Guitar 2002-present). </p>\r\n<p>The first 'official' Diamanthian demo; 'Orchestrated Violence' was recorded in early 2003 which was well received throughout the Uk underground scene and the band ended up selling literally hundreds of copies over the next couple of years.</p>\r\n<p>By September 2003 Diamanthian would regretfully lose Liverpool’s number 1 Heavy Metal maniac Micky Gorry, who emigrated to Australia. He was soon replaced by long time friend of the band Iain Turner (Bass 2003-05).</p>\r\n<p>In the 2004 Terrorizer magazine readers poll Diamanthian was voted 'best unsigned band' and came 9th in the 'best live band category' (While being the only unsigned band in this category).\r\nIn August 2004 whilst doing a summer tour of Finland with Maple Cross, the debut album 'The Infinite Descent' was recorded. The album was released in March 2005 through London indepedant label Black Aura Records. 'The Infinite Descent' received much praise throughout out the global Metal press and went on to sell copies all over the world.</p>\r\n<p>Shortly before the release, Iain Turner left the band due to family commitments. A fantastic replacement was found in the form of Death Metal veteran Kev Gurell (Bass 2005-07).</p> \r\n<p>The band went on to play with many established International acts such BEHEMOTH, VADER, KRISIUN, and MARDUK, to name but a few.</p>\r\n<p>In January 2006 Diamanthian completed its second tour of Finland, again with Maple Cross, to great success, finishing with a slot at the Jalometalli winterfest in front of 1200 people. \r\nThe next few years saw a few line up changes with some of the band members starting families, changes of career, etc... Founding member Pete Watson, would be replaced by Thrash fanatic Andy 'Hatchets and Hammers' Campbell (drums 2006-present).</p>\r\n<p>2007 saw the band do a mini tour of Spain for the first time with technical metal demons BAALPHEGOR (Spa). When the tour was over Kev Gurell retired from the band to concentrate on his hectic career in Logistics. The favour was returned with the Baalphegor guys by organising a 4 date UK tour in October '07.</p>\r\n<p>The band then went on to record the '2007 promo' in September to remind everyone that the band was still a force to be reckoned with. In January '08 Texan label <b>OSSUARY INDUSTRIES</b>' heard the results and signed the band.</p>\r\n<p>2008 saw the band continue to play all over the UK, culminating with a 5 date tour of Switzerland & Holland with Swiss metal veterans CENSORED (SWI) & MELTDOWN (SPA) in October. \r\nIn March 2009 Diamanthian recorded the long anticipated follow up to the The Infinite Descent; ‘ARCANA DOCTRINA’ at Foel studios in Wales with Chris Fielding at the production helm. In November/December of 2009 Diamanthian went on to tour Scotland, UK and Spain for the release of the album.
