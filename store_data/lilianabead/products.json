First I blow a multi-layered ball on the end of a steel pipe and, in addition to different  transparent and opaque glass, I incorporate enamels, fine silver and pure copper metal foils. \r\nThe next step consists of cooling the ball and then breaking it into shards which are rich in color and form and look like broken pieces of glass. \r\nI then preheat these shards in a kiln and apply them to a surface of a hot bead in a torch flame.\r\nAs result each bead is truly one of a kind and a piece born in the moment.\r\n\r\nThe idea of creating and breaking, and then re-creating and forming each bead in this collection drives interpretation and meaning-making which is an integral part of our everyday. That's what I love most about this collection.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a dynamic focal glass bead which will serve you as a pendant and/or a sculpture.\r\n\r\nMeasurements: 1.45 in x 1.9 in\r\nHole size: 0.28 in","options":[{"id":32364667,"name":"Default","price":170.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/101587012/-/My-World-1a.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/101587012/-/My-World-1a.jpg","width":720,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/101587048/-/My-World-1b.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/101587048/-/My-World-1b.jpg","width":720,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/101587204/-/My-World-1c.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/101587204/-/My-World-1c.jpg","width":800,"height":720},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/101587276/-/My-World-1d.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/101587276/-/My-World-1d.jpg","width":800,"height":720}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4882711,"name":"Tectonics Series","permalink":"tectonics-series","url":"/category/tectonics-series"}]},{"id":10334977,"name":"Seed Heaven Vessel","permalink":"seed-heaven-vessel","position":2,"price":195.0,"default_price":195.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/seed-heaven-vessel","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-03T23:35:14.000Z","description":"Tiny pink seeds nested up and down streams of promise...\r\nOrange, purple, teal and aqua - true cross-pollination requires color and lots of it!\r\n\r\nKeep a loving message or a drop of your favorite essential oil, either way this vessel is beyond containment...\r\n\r\nWould you like to wear it?

Long before I made an apple core for years I made this bead and developed it to where it is now.\r\n\r\nWhy would you purchase this tutorial if you can just purchase the Apple Core Design Tutorial? This tutorial is different in that the goal of it is\r\n\r\n1) to show you how to make the bead in the image;\r\n2) to start you thinking about designs as modules that will lead you to more composite designs of your own;\r\n3) to get you to practice several techniques that make this design what it is;\r\n4) to introduce you to concepts of color use to accentuate depth and color in glass.\r\n\r\nThe clues I offer here make each step more comprehensive and strategic. They are perceptibly different from tutorial to tutorial. I rarely copy and paste. My preference is to think about each tutorial in the moment as having its own logic and a distinct flow of words and expression. Thus, you will learn something different from each of them even though processes might appear as similar if not identical.\r\n\r\nI wrote this tutorial with the beginner in mind and have offered multiple clues to working with glass that have served me very well. This tutorial is a great resource for an intermediate-level lampworker as well.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial is 27 pages long and I used 36 images to illustrate step-by-step instructions explaining this technique.
