Located terrestrially in Austin, TX but borne of outer limits only imagined by acid casualties trying to find where Syd Barrett lives, Rayon Beach take us on an incredible ride through surreal sound-scapes and off-center arrangements, and pull it all together under a tight black umbrella, soaked in afterbirth and glowing like weird moon rocks. With aural slices so scrappy and inspirational, they effortlessly conjoin shards of obscure noise, not unlike the uncategorizable brilliance of The Deviants, Swell Maps, and The Soft Boys, in that inescapable running of the primal Pink Floyd nuance through the chainsaw-style state of mind (...)\"\r\n \r\nPLUS these great reviews !!!\r\n\r\nreview in \"RAVEN SINGS THE BLUES\" :\r\n\r\nFollowing up a great HoZac EP with an even more ferocious single on the ever consistent Plastic Spoon Records, Rayon Beach bring more of their psych-addled garage to this single. It takes a certain amount \r\nof panache to really meld psych and garage without sounding overly hippy and Rayon Beach seem to balance the buzz saw crunch and rumble with just the right amount of space scraping effects. If the first 12\" felt like a primer, then these three songs sounds like the band really starting to hit their stride and they've certainly peaked my interest to see what the band brings next. -\r\n\r\nreview in \"THE STYROFOAM DRONE\" :\r\n\r\nThe boys of RAYON BEACH recently released a new 7″ from Plastic Spoons Records. It features their dizzying take on crunchy, energetic garage rock with an obvious lo-fi production and some slight nods to psych rock and punk on the other end.\r\n\r\nA few places seem to be calling these guys psych as opposed to anything else. I don’t know why that is, because there’s little in their music to actually prove that. The most you could say is that it’s subtle, stemming from the thick and heavy guitar chord blasts. Something a little easier to prove is that they play at a wildly frantic pace and this makes their music seem much less organized than it actually is. They have background effects that add much color to songs, and their use of repetition also helps keeps things interesting. Their fiery hooks are addicting and they do a great job roping you in right off the bat with “Death Rides a Horse”. The closest thing you get to psych rock is that blazing guitar solo smack-dab in the middle – it hits like a ton of bricks and will most definitely keep your attention. Track two makes these guys sound more poppy than anything else, while “Sister Fever” is when most of the sound-deepening effects come into play. In the end these guys seem to have a firm grasp on their sound, and we should see a full-length soon enough via Hozac.\r\n \r\nPlastic Spoons Records roster on Discogs :\r\nhttp://www.discogs.com/label/Plastic+Spoons+Records\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":10435939,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":5.9,"amount_with_others":0.0},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":89,"name":"Croatia (Hrvatska)","code":"HR"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":105,"name":"France, Metropolitan","code":"FX"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":204,"name":"Slovenia","code":"SI"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":203,"name":"Slovakia (Slovak Republic)","code":"SK"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":184,"name":"Poland","code":"PL"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":19,"name":"Iceland","code":"IS"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":125,"name":"Hungary","code":"HU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29434613/-/RayonBeachrectojpeg_240x240.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29434613/-/RayonBeachrectojpeg_240x240.jpg","width":240,"height":240}],"artists":[{"id":49091,"name":"RAYON BEACH","permalink":"rayon-beach","url":"/artist/rayon-beach"}],"categories":[{"id":316141,"name":"RECORDS","permalink":"records","url":"/category/records"}]},{"id":2206021,"name":"PS 007 - MESS FOLK - Modern Man 7''  ","permalink":"mess-folk-modern-man-7-preorder-will-ship-around-the-15th-may","position":3,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mess-folk-modern-man-7-preorder-will-ship-around-the-15th-may","status":"sold-out","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-04-02T18:43:00.000Z","description":"45 rpm - 7\"\r\n4 tracks\r\ngreat artwork by Elzo (The Oh Sees/Magnetix/Jack Of Heart/Immaterial/Rayon Beach)\r\n\r\nlisten to it on our soundcloud :\r\nhttp://soundcloud.com/plastic-spoons-records \r\n\r\nIf you wanna buy this record get it from the following distros and shops (worldwide) or on Discogs (http://www.discogs.com/label/Plastic+Spoons+Records ) :\r\n\r\nEurope\r\n\r\nUK : Rough Trade / Norman Records / Soft Power \r\nGermany : X-Mist / P Trash / Kernkrach /\r\nFrance : Born Bad / Abus Dangereux / Hands&Arms /Souffle Continu\r\nBelgique : Rockerill Records\r\nItaly : Hate Records . \r\nSweden : Art Or Arse / Push My Button\r\n\r\nAmericas\r\n\r\nUSA :Permanent Records / Slovenly / Insound / Kill Shaman / Dark Entries / Penpals Music / Florida's Dying / 80/81 /S-S Records .\r\n\r\nAsia\r\n\r\nJapan : Sonerecords / The Stone Records \r\nTaiwan : Beethobear\r\n\r\nEn France disponible dans les boutiques suivantes :\r\n\r\nBordeaux : Total Heaven\r\nRennes : Blindspot\r\nLyon : Dangerhouse\r\nParis : Born Bad,Bimbo Tower, Pop Culture,Ground Zero,En Face,Souffle Continu,Les Boutiques Sonores,Vinyl Office,Gibert\r\n\r\n\r\nreview in SoundsXP :\r\n\r\n\"This is four short stabs of brilliant lo-fi punk rock from Sydney, Nova Scotia. It sounds like the New York punks of 30 years ago like the Heartbreakers, Ramones and Dictators, all grunge, grit and menace but with hooky songs. That raw power certainly fits the attack on suburban conformity in 'Modern Man' – 'do you love your god? Do you love your job?' - and the scratchy guitar solo in 'Damaged Babe'. Maybe the lyrics of 'Two Time' are a little tongue-in-cheek but it's not misogynistic (they might also have had a song titled 'I Beat My Woman Sometimes (And She Likes It)' but there's a deliberate snoot-cocking in their song titles generally). Punk rock was never subtle so just play this loud (easy) and enjoy (even easier).\" \r\n\r\nPlastic Spoons Records roster on Discogs :\r\nhttp://www.discogs.com/label/Plastic+Spoons+Records","options":[{"id":7938511,"name":"Default","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.0},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":105,"name":"France, Metropolitan","code":"FX"}},{"amount_alone":5.9,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.9,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":5.9,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":39,"name":"Taiwan","code":"TW"}},{"amount_alone":5.9,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.9,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/21164121/-/ps007_pochette.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/21164121/-/ps007_pochette.jpg","width":240,"height":240}],"artists":[{"id":38321,"name":"MESS FOLK","permalink":"mess-folk","url":"/artist/mess-folk"}],"categories":[{"id":316141,"name":"RECORDS","permalink":"records","url":"/category/records"}]},{"id":2632974,"name":"PS004 - PLUTON 12\"","permalink":"ps004-pluton-12","position":4,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ps004-pluton-12","status":"sold-out","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-06-27T23:04:41.000Z","description":"12\" / maxi 45 rpm \r\n6 tracks\r\nArtwork by Baldo \r\n\r\nRegular edition : 450 copies - a couple of copies left. \r\nLimited Edition :   50 copies - silkcreened different cover , SOLD-OUT !\r\n\r\nIf you wanna buy this record get it from the following distros and shops (worldwide) or on Discogs (http://www.discogs.com/label/Plastic+Spoons+Records ) :\r\n\r\nEurope\r\n\r\nUK : Rough Trade / Norman Records / Soft Power \r\nGermany : X-Mist / P Trash / Kernkrach /\r\nFrance : Born Bad / Abus Dangereux / Hands&Arms /Souffle Continu\r\nBelgique : Rockerill Records\r\nItaly : Hate Records . \r\nSweden : Art Or Arse / Push My Button\r\n\r\nAmericas\r\n\r\nUSA :Permanent Records / Slovenly / Insound / Kill Shaman / Dark Entries / Penpals Music / Florida's Dying / 80/81 /S-S Records .\r\n\r\nAsia\r\n\r\nJapan : Sonerecords / The Stone Records \r\nTaiwan : Beethobear\r\n\r\nEn France disponible dans les boutiques suivantes :\r\n\r\nBordeaux : Total Heaven\r\nRennes : Blindspot\r\nLyon : Dangerhouse\r\nParis : Born Bad,Bimbo Tower, Pop Culture,Ground Zero,En Face,Souffle Continu,Les Boutiques Sonores,Vinyl Office,Gibert\r\n\r\nchronique de PLUTON dans Rock'n'Folk N° 518 (octobre 2010) :\r\n\r\n\"Trio francilien au son post punk proche de The Fall ou Cheveu , Pluton a fait forte impression récemment en première partie des Black Diamond Heavies à Paris. \r\nLe groupe mené par FX des regrettés VOLT sort un EP (mini-album disent certains) sur le label parisien Plastic Spoons,en vinyle uniquement. \r\nEn six titres bien troussés (mention spéciale à \"Self confident man\" et \"ain't on time\" , Pluton se montre à la hauteur de nos attentes et s'affirme comme un des groupes français les plus enthousiasmants du moment. \r\nUne belle promesse.\"\r\n\r\nE.
