Meeting once a week for nearly a year in a room without air conditioning or heating, the quintet carefully crafted a record that they later self-released in 2009. After a couple years of playing countless shows and receiving glowing reviews, the band still felt like something was missing. The group hibernated for another 12 months and re-invented themselves. \r\n\r\nThe first offering from their newly defined sound, America's Son, became one of the most requested songs on north Texas' 91.7 KXT who later included it in their \"Best Songs of 2011\" right next to Adele, Foster the People and Coldplay. America's Son also caught the attention of The Huffington Post and CMJ who claimed it was \"a very different sound from other folk-pop groups and considered the band one to watch in 2012\". \r\n\r\nAir Review's dynamic live shows have landed them support slots for acts such as Flaming Lips, Portugal. The Man, Grimes and School of Seven Bells. Their knack for engaging melodies has turned heads around the world securing licensing with the International Olympic Committee and Levi's. \r\n\r\nAll of this paved the way for their upcoming masterfully composed full-length album, Low Wishes, to be released by Velvet Blue Music (Huntington Beach, CA) and Spune (DFW, Texas) January 29th, 2013. This self-produced and recorded, pop infused indie record gracefully combines folk influences with synthesizers, beats and noisy guitars. It is soft and subtle at times, yet unmistakably anthemic, complete with magnificent choruses. \r\n\r\nLow Wishes is a nostalgic look at growing into adulthood and an affirmation of the belief that there is something more to life.

A musician, producer, designer and wizard. \r\n \r\nMost recently Mr. Edman has collaborated with members of The Polyphonic Spree and shared the stage with Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr., Purity Ring, Die Antwood, Yelle and more. In addition to his musical abilities, Edman has designed art for Mos Def, Ryan Adams and Jimmy Eat World. He also loves to make stuff - especially projection models, terrariums and other magical goods. Hence, Mad Scientist! \r\n \r\nAbracadabra. This is where Velvet Blue Music (Huntington Beach, CA), Tree Fall Sounds (Dallas, TX), and Spune (DFW, Texas) enter the picture. A collective effort to educate the universe about Datahowler and his gifts. Or, at least assist in pulling the rabbit from the hat. The label trio having already introduced a 7\" vinyl series, felt it seemed only natural to include Datahowler. Except this 7\" grew to be a 10\"!\r\n  \r\nDatahowler's latest release, \"The Crystal Gazers\" comes in the form of a limited edition 10\" colored vinyl / digital EP. It's 5 songs and 20 minutes of Ross' favorite sonic compositions.\r\n\r\n_________________________________________\r\n\r\n<b>Track Listing:</b>\r\n1. Watchtowers\r\n2.

We have teamed up again with our west coast pals at Velvet Blue Music to share these wonderful tunes. Bethan has given a few Christmas classics their own unique spin. We dig it! Read below to find out how this little holiday gem came about. Happy holidays, everyone!\r\n\r\nThis crazy little Christmas collection started at band practice. We were wrapping up for the night and someone mentioned that it might be fun to arrange and record a few Christmas songs a la Bethan. After a collective glance at our watches we realized we had only a few weeks to do this thing so we set the ball in motion. We had three weeks to arrange, track, mix and deliver, which made the process exciting...and deadline driven. Turns out we all work pretty well under pressure, and we still like each other, to boot! \r\n\r\nThe most fun and challenging aspect of this project was re-imagining songs we've grown up listening to. Inspired by Christmas recordings from Julie Andrews, Doris Day and regularly filling our ears with Tom Waits and David Lynch scores, the result was nothing short of an orchestrated X-periment! An end result that we're extremely happy with. We hope you enjoy it, too! -- Bethan\r\n\r\n_________________________________________\r\n\r\n<b>Track Listing:</b>\r\n1.

It will be released digitally and as a limited edition 7\" with 2 tracks on the vinyl and a 4-track download card.\r\n\r\nThe tracks are beautifully stripped down isolating Doug's distinct vocals and allowing his lyrics to be front and center. \r\n\r\nFor those who are unfamiliar with Doug Burr, he is a Denton, TX local troubadour . . .a folk hero! After 4 full lengths (O Ye Devastator, The Shawl, On Promenade, The Sickle and The Sheaves), Burr has carved his path in music. It’s hard to generalize Burr’s music…call it folk, roots, Americana, twang, folk pop, call it whatever you like. Nobody leaves a Burr performance unaffected, whether it’s Mr. Burr alone or accompanied by a full band. His carefully crafted, heart-felt songs seem to resonate with all who hear them!\r\n\r\nWhile Burr has been on stage less recently, he has been busy writing and recording demos of new songs. His songs have also been featured in a handful of indie movies and TV shows.\r\n\r\nFor those who are hungry for more Burr now, we're offering this new 7\"!\r\n \r\nBurr's music means different things to different people yet there’s always an underlying personal connection to all who listen! Below are a few quotes from what others are saying.\r\n\r\nThanks for listening!\r\n\r\n\"This man sings with such an ease it will leave you planted right where you are with a sensation to do nothing but listen. And listen close.\" - Fensepost\r\n\r\n\"One of the most criminally overlooked performers working in the state.\" - Fort Worth Star-Telegram \r\n\r\n\"Exquisitely detailed, slow and deliberate\"- Paste Magazine\r\n\r\n\"Burr evokes distinctive voices such as Wilco's Jeff Tweedy or Red House Painters' Mark Kozelek. These warm, inviting compositions are effortlessly beautiful.\"- Fort Worth Weekly \r\n\r\n \"Burr shares an intrinsic knowledge of song dynamics with the likes of Jeff Tweedy, and has a voice that tugs at the heart strings. Brilliant! \" - Americana UK \r\n\r\n\"Exceptional Denton Troubadour\" - Austin Sound\r\n\r\n<b><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Doug-Burr/115851860400\">Follow Doug Burr</a></b>\r\n\r\n<b>Track Listing:</b>\r\n\r\nA Side:  \"A Black Wave Is Comin'\" (Forest Fortress Version) \r\nB Side:  \"Chief of Police in Chicago\" (Indefinite Surveillance Version) \r\n \r\nDownload Card comes with 4 tracks:\r\n1.  \"A Black Wave Is Comin'\" (Forest Fortress Version) \r\n2.  \"Chief of Police in Chicago\" (Indefinite Surveillance Version) \r\n3.  \"Do You Hear Wedding Bells\" (Low Down Version) \r\n4.  \"A Black Wave Is Comin' (taken from the full length album, O Ye Devastator) ","options":[{"id":17712779,"name":"Default","price":5.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53931153/-/black_fingertips.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53931153/-/black_fingertips.jpg","width":1000,"height":978}],"artists":[{"id":8635,"name":"Doug Burr","permalink":"doug-burr","url":"/artist/doug-burr"}],"categories":[{"id":1534775,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":5431867,"name":"Gold Beach: Gold Beach - 7\"","permalink":"gold-beach-gold-beach-7","position":21,"price":5.99,"default_price":5.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/gold-beach-gold-beach-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-09T06:48:12.000Z","description":"<b>To pre-order 7\", click \"ADD TO CART\" below</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Release:</b> SP010 | 02.28.12 \r\n<b>Status:</b> Will ship 02.22.12\r\n\r\n<b>Description:</b>\r\n\r\nThis record is a co-release with our friends at Velvet Blue Music and Tree Fall Sounds.\r\n\r\nInitially hailing from the Houston area, the principle songwriters of Gold Beach, Tony Daugherty and Michael Winningham, grew up on the same street.  The two relocated to Austin and put the band together, which includes a plethora of regional talent, including: Jeremy Gomez (x-Mineral, the Glass Family), Carlos Orozco (x-Western Keys, Black Drum Set), Nicole Kern (x-Balmorhea), Evan Jacobs (Tacks! the Boy Disaster, Polyphonic Spree), Andy Sharp (Girling), and Henna Chou (x-My Education).\r\n\r\nSince then, the band has been on a roll! They self released their first record which the Austin Chronicle called a \"carefully crafted debut\", supported national bands such as Memoryhouse, Talkdemonic, Wooden Birds, Balmorhea and recently completed a Daytrotter session. KUT/NPR Austin had the band in studio and Texas Music Matters/NPR included the band in their \"Best of 2011\" list.  Needless to say, the band has been hard at work and already has made plans in the studio with renown producer John Congleton (St. Vincent, the Walkmen, Wye Oak) to start work on the next record.\r\n \r\nThis is where we pick up with the band!  Gold Beach \"Gold Beach\" out 2/28 is the first in a series of 7\"s that is being released as a joint effort by Velvet Blue Music, Spune, and Tree Fall Sounds.  It's 2 tracks on beautiful white vinyl, which includes a previously unreleased song and a download card with an whopping 6 tracks! We anticipate great things for the band in 2012! \r\n\r\n<b><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/goldbeachband\">Follow Gold Beach</a></b>\r\n\r\n<b>Track Listing:</b>\r\n\r\nSide A - Gold Beach\r\nSide B - The Soft Effect\r\n\r\nDownload Card comes with 4 additional tracks:\r\nDiving Bell / Habibi / Skin Of Yours / Everyone I Know ","options":[{"id":17530473,"name":"Default","price":5.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53339713/-/GB7_22.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53339713/-/GB7_22.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":105377,"name":"Gold Beach","permalink":"gold-beach","url":"/artist/gold-beach"}],"categories":[{"id":1534775,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":5072459,"name":"A Spune Christmas Dallas 2011 Poster","permalink":"a-spune-christmas-dallas-2011-poster","position":22,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/a-spune-christmas-dallas-2011-poster","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-12-13T20:40:32.000Z","description":"Silk screened 16\" X 20\" 2 color poster printed on stark white 130 weight paper.\r\n\r\n<b><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/events/322976494383456/\">Event Details</a></b><br>\r\n\r\n<b><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/posterdezigner/\">Design by Brandon Lesley. </a></b><br>\r\n\r\n<b><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Green-Skates-Screen-Printing/191375330897952\">Printing by Green Skates Printing.</a></b><br>","options":[{"id":16465497,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49800473/-/spune_christmas11_poster.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49800473/-/spune_christmas11_poster.jpg","width":800,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":300015,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":2867957,"name":"Seryn: This Is Where We Are - CD ","permalink":"seryn-this-is-where-we-are-cd-coming-soon","position":23,"price":5.99,"default_price":5.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/seryn-this-is-where-we-are-cd-coming-soon","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-11-12T22:02:18.000Z","description":"<b><a href=\"http://spune.bandcamp.com/album/seryn-this-is-where-we-are\">Stream Songs Here</a></b><br>\r\n\r\n<b>To order CD, click \"ADD TO CART\" below</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Release:</b> SP009 | 01.25.11 \r\n<b>Status:</b> In Stock. \r\n\r\n<b>Description:</b>\r\n\r\nThis is co-release with our friends at Velvet Blue Music.\r\n\r\nSeryn is a 5 piece band who calls Denton, Texas their home.  When listening to the well layered textures of guitars, ukulele, accordion, bass, viola, banjo and various percussion, it's hard to imagine This Is Where We Are is the band's debut effort.  The band's strength resides in their vast musical talent and understanding of dynamics. Their beauty is gracefully displayed through chilling harmonies. Each member and their voice carry the same importance. One is not complete without the other.\r\n\r\nIt is in this craft that the young band shines so bright. It has earned them a sound that isn't easily defined, but still proven triumphant.  What may first appear as straight folk songs, later transcend into menacing walls of sound.  The term \"Folk-Pop\" has been thrown around and maybe it loosely fits, but we will leave the definitions up to you. \r\n\r\nThe Denton Record-Chronicle said \"Seryn's set was so dynamic that you could feel the key changes in your feet, through Festival Hall’s concrete floor!\".  While the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported, \"Watching Seryn perform, it's hard to convince yourself that those crystalline, multi-part harmonies are not pre-recorded or some kind of sleight of ear.\"  You can see where this is going...\r\n\r\nThis is Where We Are was produced by Britton Beisenherz (Ramble Creek), and recorded over the course of a few months.  The experience felt at their live show seems to be captured well in these recordings, which was something of great importance to the band. The band has created their own buzz in the most traditional way too by winning people over at their shows.  It's not often that a band without a record out is able to play so many great bills and sold out shows. Much less, be nominated for awards such as Best Folk Artist, and Song of the Year (Dallas Observer). There is no shortage of regional press on them either but the band is excited to take their sound, their show, and their new record on the road.  They will be traveling all over the US in the coming months. Go see them play and you will be sucked in!\r\n\r\nSoaring vocal harmonies boil over alongside the rousing rat-a-tat-tats of snare drum, the intensity of the composition climbing steadily upward until one last glorious bit of harmonizing lets the listener down gently. ... part Freakwater, part Arcade Fire.\" - One Track Mind\r\n\r\n\"A likeness to both Arcade Fire and The Low Anthem. \"We Will All Be Changed\" has gotten us excited about this new band, and we hope it does the same for you. - Reviewsic\r\n\r\n\"Seryn is like the neighborhood friend that everyone is rooting for, and it's paying off. The varied and multi-layered songs from this band never get old, so this is a New Year's present in waiting.\" - Pegasus News\r\n\r\n\"One of Denton's hottest bands in any genre.\" - Fort Worth Star-Telegram\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful arrangements (both in instrumentation and in vocal harmonies) and an epic, \"big sky\" sound that, at times, seems more fitting washing over dilapidated wooden pews in an old church than the usual torn-up couches, vinyl booths and barstools of area venues.\" - Dallas Observer\r\n\r\n\"Like ice-cold water on a hot day, their music is crisp and refreshing, and I cannot get enough. The imagery packed into their set is unreal. It’s like listening to the soundtrack of a great love story, breathtaking drama, and a dark tragedy all rolled into one over-the-top, unparalleled performance.\"  - My Denton Music\r\n_________________________________________\r\n\r\n<b>Track Listing:</b>\r\n1.

It will probably be the last Comet material you ever hear! Once sharing a label with Spiritualized, the Cranes and Beth Orton, Comet dropped their domestic debut record Chandelier Musings in October of '96 and March '97 in the UK. However, the band came to an unexpected halt after a tour-van accident on icy roads in Minnesota left the band splintered and disillusioned after returning home. In 2005, Comet returned after 8 years of  silence with Spune releasing the highly anticipated \"feathers from the wing\" EP. After only a few public appearances and shows around DFW and Austin, the band found itself back in the studios consumed in the writing phase. Unfortunately, this again has lead to another unexpected hiatus. The guys are involved in their own personal journeys with their families and enjoying life. Hopefully, one day we will again be able to soak in the beautiful, dreamy, noise pop songs that we've always loved from this band! PS. Jim Stone continues to write. If we're lucky, he'll let you hear a demo or two.\r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\n<b>Track Listing:</b>\r\n1. Miss The World\r\n2. Feathers That Shone\r\n3. Sputnik\r\n4.
