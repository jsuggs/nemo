The Captain is contrasted in 3 parts. The Top hemisphere is solid black, the bottom hemisphere remains the light color of the beech wood, and the bevel of the hole is painted black.  This 3 part contrast allows you to always know top from bottom and enables your eyes to track the hole.\r\nTo top it off and seal the concept of direction Sourmash added the compass by hand drawing and stippling each tama individually.
