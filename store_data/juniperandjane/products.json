It has an unrivalled variety of geology for such a small area. Our own Juniper spent a week conducting fieldwork there, measuring and interpreting igneous intrusions, aeolian sandstone boundaries, a multitude of fossils and the famous Hutton’s Unconformity. In 1787 James Hutton  identified structures near Lochranza which lead to him concluding that the Earth was much older than people had previously thought.\r\n\r\nFor each Arran product sold through our website, we donate £1.00 to the Arran Trust.
