It's street-cred and classical, mystically woven in a fierce musical tapestry. This newly release CD reflects a twenty-four year journey of mastering, then challenging and expanding classical Viola expression. Christen's performance and compositional approach is to surrender to creating space for music to express through her. Spontaneously creating then incorporating layers of live effects, Lien paints music with guitar effect pedals, live looping, melodic mixing and expressive performance.”\r\n- Jana Lynne White","options":[{"id":1632291,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3344790/-/front.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3344790/-/front.jpg","width":551,"height":485}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":320225,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
