I did a lot of research to find the best way to give a matte effect to my images, and you’ll find that specific method in this set!  I thought that it might be fun to give some color to these matte effects, too.  My first inclination was to go with lighter, pastel colors, but I quickly discovered that darker, bold colors would give great tones to your matted image.  The result?  More options!!  The lighter colors give a subtle little something-something to your image, while the bold colors give a little more oomph.  I think you’ll love these actions, and the light, airy feeling it creates!\r\n\r\nIn this action set, you’ll find:\r\n\r\nA basic matte with no color\r\nElectric Blue matte\r\nBaby Blues matte\r\nMellow Yellow matte\r\nLemony Yellow matte\r\nSpring Green matte\r\nGrassy Green matte\r\nFlushed Pink matte\r\nRazzle Dazzle Pink matte\r\nDreamsicle Orange matte\r\nTangerine Orange matte\r\nPurple Amethyst matte\r\nPurple Plum matte\r\nSilvery Gray matte\r\nRainy Day Gray matte\r\nMilky Matte\r\n\r\nThe opacity on these actions has been pre-adjusted to my own tastes, but is fully adjustable to your own...both with the level of matte you prefer in your image, and the level of color that you'd like to add.  :)\r\n\r\nAll Actions & Textures are Copyright Rise and Shine Actions, 2013.\r\n\r\nCompatible with PS CS2-CS6 and PSE6-11.\r\n\r\nActions & textures are not to be re-sold or transferred.
