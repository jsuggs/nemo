The brewing variables are highly repeatable giving great consistency. Cleanup is fast and easy. And most importantly, the resulting cup can be fantastic.\r\n\r\nOur recipe below should be used <u>as a guide</u> and is for the Aeropress teamed with the Porlex Mini Hand Grinder. Depending on the quality, roast profile, origin and age of your coffee as well as your personal preferences you may need to change the variables of the brew recipe to achieve the perfect extraction.\r\n\r\n<b>Note:</b> With water 1g = 1ml\r\n<b>Coffee Dose:</b> 15g\r\n<b>Grind Size:</b> Fully tighten the Porlex Grinder clockwise, then bring it back 4 \"clicks\" anti-clockwise. The \"press time\" should comfortably take 45 second to complete. Too fine will take longer, too coarse will take less time. Also known as a \"filter grind\", i.e. coarser than espresso but finer than plunger.\r\n<b>Water:</b> 200g at 92-95°c (7 ounces at 197.6-203° fahrenheit)\r\n<b>Steep Time:</b> 45 seconds\r\n<b> Total Brew time:</b> 1 minute and 30 seconds\r\n<b>Equipment Required:</b> Aeropress, Porlex Mini Hand Grinder, Water, Coffee Beans, Timer (your phone?), 225ml/8oz or greater cup with mouth big enough to accept the Aeropress\r\n<b>Equipment Optional / Best Practice:</b> Filtered Water, Accurate digital thermometer capable reading at least 20-100°c (68-212°f), Accurate Digital Scales with 0.1g or better resolution and a 1kg+ ability, Quality Coffee aged no more than 28 days post roast.\r\n\r\n<b><u>Inverted Method</u></b>\r\n<b>1)</b> Get out all your equipment:\r\n<b>i)</b> Pull the plunger out so just the rubber seal is still inside the piston\r\n<b>ii)</b> Take the cap off, load it with a single filter (paper or disk) and put it over your cup and rinse it with cold water\r\n<b>iii)</b> Set your grind as described above with the grinder empty\r\n<b>iv)</b> Weigh out the correct coffee dose into top of the grinder and assemble it\r\n\r\n<b>2)</b> Fill your kettle with enough filtered water to both rinse your aeropress and brew (500g+).\r\n\r\n<b>3)</b> Grind your coffee\r\n\r\n<b>4)</b> With the Aeropress inverted and the piston pulled out as described above, fill the Aeropress with boiled water. This will pre-heat your Aeropress.\r\n\r\n<b>5)</b> Tip the water out and put the ground coffee into the barrel of the inverted Aeropress.\r\n\r\n<b>6)</b> Start the timer and immediately pour the hot water from the kettle slowly over the ground coffee, ensuring all the coffee is wet. Fill it close to the top, but leave about 2mm so you can put the filter cap on without hitting the brewing coffee.\r\n\r\n<b>7)</b> Put the filter cap on tight and while still inverted, carefully and slowly (holding the chamber!) lower the chamber over the piston until a small amount of brewed coffee shows through the filter.\r\n\r\n<b>8)</b> Put the plunger just into the top of the barrel to create a vacuum, this will stop most of the water from going through the filter and into the cup. Some of the water will have filtered through already. This is no problem.\r\n\r\n<b>9)</b> At the 45 second mark, put your cup on top of the inverted Aeropress and while holding the cup and the Aeropress piston, flip it over. Then slowly and evenly press down on the plunger using your body weight to push the water through the filter. This should take a comfortable 45 seconds aiming to finish around the 1 minute 30 second mark..\r\n\r\n<b>10)</b> Done! Clean everything immediately as the brew will be too hot to enjoy straight away anyway.\r\n\r\n<b>11)</b> Enjoy your brew. Sip regularly as it cools as the flavours will change immensely with temperature until in most cases it hits peak flavour around 55°c (131°f)","options":[{"id":10978837,"name":"Default","price":49.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31338285/-/aeropress1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31338285/-/aeropress1.jpg","width":816,"height":612},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31338325/-/aeropress2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31338325/-/aeropress2.jpg","width":524,"height":601},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31338341/-/aeropress3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31338341/-/aeropress3.jpg","width":359,"height":816}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":3269197,"name":"Pocket Digital Scales (1kg, 0.1g) and 2 x AAA Rechargeable Batteries","permalink":"pocket-digital-scales-1kg-0-1g-and-2-x-aaa-rechargeable-batteries","position":2,"price":23.0,"default_price":23.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pocket-digital-scales-1kg-0-1g-and-2-x-aaa-rechargeable-batteries","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-02-11T05:01:12.000Z","description":"For reproduction and development of coffee and tea brewing recipes accurate digital scales are a must.\r\n\r\nFor environmental and practical reasons we include 2 x High Quality AAA rechargeable batteries with every set of scales.\r\n\r\nWe have tried out a lot of scales but these are the best we have tried for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- They have a capacity of 1kg (35.2oz) and a resolution of 0.1g (0.01oz). i.e. large enough capacity and very accurate.\r\n\r\n- A 200ms refresh rate makes it great for weighing espresso shots, or anything for that matter.\r\n\r\n-  The\" pocket\" size makes it the perfect addition for travel with the Aeropress and Porlex Mini Hand Grinder combination.\r\n\r\n- The hard plastic cover and protective pouch decrease the risk of damage when travelling, transporting or storing.\r\n\r\n- AAA Batteries are easy to come by.\r\n\r\n- It has an Auto-off function as well as an \"off\" button.\r\n\r\n- It can weigh in any of the following scales: g, oz, ct, ozt, dwt, GN.\r\n\r\n- The blue back-light is easy to see in the daylight or in the dark.\r\n\r\n- The scales can be recalibrated using calibration weights if necessary in extreme temperature conditions.\r\n\r\nLength: 11.1cm (4.37 inches)\r\nHeight: 1.8cm (0.71 inches)\r\nWidth: 7.5m (2.95 inches)\r\nWeight: 101.4g (3.58oz)","options":[{"id":11116467,"name":"Default","price":23.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31722355/-/scales01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31722355/-/scales01.jpg","width":652,"height":815},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31722363/-/scales02.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31722363/-/scales02.jpg","width":491,"height":641},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31722383/-/scales03.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31722383/-/scales03.jpg","width":617,"height":966}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":4903575,"name":"$20 Gift Card","permalink":"20-gift-card","position":3,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/20-gift-card","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-22T10:55:04.000Z","description":"The card can be redeemed intermittently in small amounts or all at once.
