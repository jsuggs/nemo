Come on in, but be prepared—it might not be quite what you expect. There is flour on the counter, oats that overflowed onto the floor, chocolate-encrusted spoons in the sink. There is Joey, the husband, exhausted by the thirty-five preschoolers who were hanging on him all day, and he is stuffing granola into his mouth to ease his five o’clock starvation. There are two little girls trying to show me cartwheels in that miniscule space between the refrigerator and the counter where I really need to be.”\r\n \r\nIn her debut cookbook, Alana Chernila inspires you to step inside your kitchen, take a look around, and change the way you relate to food. The Homemade Pantry was born of a tight budget, Alana’s love for sharing recipes with her farmers’ market customers, and a desire to enjoy a happy cooking and eating life with her young family. On a mission to kick their packaged-food habit, she learned that with a little determination, anything she could buy at the store could be made in her kitchen, and her homemade versions were more satisfying, easier to make than she expected, and tastier.  \r\n            \r\nHere are her very approachable recipes for 101 everyday staples, organized by supermarket aisle—from crackers to cheese, pesto to sauerkraut, and mayonnaise to toaster pastries. The Homemade Pantry is a celebration of food made by hand—warm mozzarella that is stretched, thick lasagna noodles rolled from flour and egg, fresh tomato sauce that bubbles on the stove. Whether you are trying a recipe for butter, potato chips, spice mixes, or ketchup, you will discover the magic and thrill that comes with the homemade pantry.\r\n            \r\nAlana captures the humor and messiness of everyday family life, too. A true friend to the home cook, she shares her “tense moments” to help you get through your own. With stories offering patient, humble advice, tips for storing the homemade foods, and rich four-color photography throughout, The Homemade Pantry will quickly become the go-to source for how to make delicious staples in your home kitchen.

Like her brother, Jane Franklin was a passionate reader, a gifted writer, and an astonishingly shrewd political commentator. Unlike him, she was a mother of twelve.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin, who wrote more letters to his sister than he wrote to anyone else, was the original American self-made man; his sister spent her life caring for her children. They left very different traces behind. Making use of an amazing cache of little-studied material, including documents, objects, and portraits only just discovered, Jill Lepore brings Jane Franklin to life in a way that illuminates not only this one woman but an entire world—a world usually lost to history. Lepore’s life of Jane Franklin, with its strikingly original vantage on her remarkable brother, is at once a wholly different account of the founding of the United States and one of the great untold stories of American history and letters: a life unknown.","options":[{"id":45576687,"name":"Book Only","price":27.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":45576690,"name":"Dinner Only","price":21.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125718552/-/Picture_3.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125718552/-/Picture_3.png","width":539,"height":550},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125718561/-/Picture_4.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125718561/-/Picture_4.png","width":420,"height":393},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125718444/-/BOOKOFAGES.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125718444/-/BOOKOFAGES.jpeg","width":302,"height":450}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4816144,"name":"Book Club","permalink":"book-club","url":"/category/book-club"},{"id":1715582,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":13542330,"name":"Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Holiday Hand Soaps","permalink":"mrs-meyer-s-clean-day-holiday-hand-soaps","position":25,"price":3.99,"default_price":3.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mrs-meyer-s-clean-day-holiday-hand-soaps","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-13T14:34:54.000Z","description":"Limited Editions\r\n\r\nMrs. Meyer's Clean Day hand and body care products include liquid and bar soaps.

On a Saturday afternoon in Centerville, a sleepy Midwestern town, a disaffected husband enters a busy drugstore where his estranged wife works and sets a bag with a homemade bomb on the floor. Outside the drugstore, a fourteen-year-old girl places her hand on the door, then inexplicably turns away and keeps walking. Moments later, standing safely inside a bowling alley with her best friend, she hears a sound like thunder.\r\n\r\nWith one devastating explosion, the town is changed forever. In the next few days, four lives become entwined, as the townspeople face sudden loss and new, unpredictable realities.\r\n\r\nSet against the backdrop of the Civil Rights Movement and the escalating Vietnam War, Centerville forms an engrossing meditation on the complex questions that arise in the wake of senseless violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About The Author</b>\r\nKaren Osborn is the author of three previous novels, Patchwork (a New York Times Notable Book of the Year), Between Earth and Sky, and The River Road. She lives in Amherst, Massachusetts with her husband and teaches fiction writing at Mt. Holyoke College and Fairfield University. While growing up in the Midwest, she witnessed a bombing and the resulting conflagration in her small town.

Roosevelt faced an ailing economy in the throes of the Great Depression and rushed to transform the country through recovery programs and legislative reform. By 1934, he began to send professional photographers to the state of West Virginia to document living conditions and the effects of his New Deal programs. The photographs from the Farm Security Administration Project not only introduced “America to Americans,” exposing a continued need for government intervention, but also captured powerful images of life in rural and small town America.\r\n\r\nNew Deal Photographs of West Virginia, 1934-1943 presents images of the state’s northern and southern coalfields, the subsistence homestead projects of Arthurdale, Eleanor, and Tygart Valley, and various communities from Charleston to Clarksburg and Parkersburg to Elkins. With over one hundred and fifty images by ten FSA photographers, including Walker Evans, Marion Post Wolcott, Arthur Rothstein, and Ben Shahn, this collection is a remarkable proclamation of hardship, hope, endurance, and, above all, community.

In The Botany of Desire, Michael Pollan ingeniously demonstrates how people and domesticated plants have formed a similarly reciprocal relationship. He masterfully links four fundamental human desires—sweetness, beauty, intoxication, and control—with the plants that satisfy them: the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. In telling the stories of four familiar species, Pollan illustrates how the plants have evolved to satisfy humankind’s most basic yearnings. And just as we’ve benefited from these plants, we have also done well by them.

It’s the story of a garden revolution that began in America.\r\n\r\nIn 1733, the American farmer John Bartram dispatched two boxes of plants and seeds from the American colonies, addressed to the London cloth merchant Peter Collinson. Most of these plants had never before been grown in British soil, but in time the magnificent and colorful American trees, evergreens, and shrubs would transform the English landscape and garden forever. During the next forty years, Collinson and a handful of botany enthusiasts cultivated hundreds of American species. The Brother Gardeners follows the lives of six of these men, whose shared passion for plants gave rise to the English love affair with gardens. In addition to Collinson and Bartram, who forged an extraordinary friendship, here are Philip Miller, author of the best-selling Gardeners Dictionary; the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, whose standardized nomenclature helped bring botany to the middle classes; and Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, who explored the strange flora of Brazil, Tahiti, New Zealand, and Australia on the greatest voyage of discovery of their time, aboard Captain Cook’s Endeavour.\r\n\r\nFrom the exotic blooms in Botany Bay to the royal gardens at Kew, from the streets of London to the vistas of the Appalachian Mountains, The Brother Gardeners paints a vivid portrait of an emerging world of knowledge and of gardening as we know it today. It is a delightful and beautifully told narrative history.\r\n\r\nHardcover, 368 pages","options":[{"id":10101238,"name":"Default","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/28203088/-/thebrothergardners.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/28203088/-/thebrothergardners.jpg","width":335,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1715582,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":2909810,"name":"The French Chef Cookbook - Julia Child","permalink":"the-french-chef-cookbook-julia-child","position":64,"price":17.95,"default_price":17.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-french-chef-cookbook-julia-child","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-11-22T00:22:20.000Z","description":"From The French Chef, the PBS series that began it all, here are all the recipes that introduced Julia Child to an American public hungry for more sophisticated cooking techniques.
