Most songs were recorded in one take in a couple of hours, thus explaining their charming, \"raw\" quality.\r\n \r\nJimmy wrote \"Iconoclast Youth.\" \"Eating Out\" was Mike Hurley’s contribution. Lina and Gary wrote the goofy little half bad French howl of despair \"Lon Chaney,\" and Gary wrote the twin head-scratchers \"Bromide\" and \"Box of Words.\"\r\n \r\nMike Watt and the others from New Alliance liked the tape well enough that they planned to put it out as a 5 song 45: NAR 009 (1982) Peer Group: <i>Rhetoric and Hands</i> EP\r\n \r\nThey played as a trio for another year or so until Gary went into hospital, Lina went off to Connecticut to get married, later returning to San Pedro to settle, and Mike Hurley went to Texas to work as a mechanic. Jimmy \"the Otter\" Slayden eventually settled in Northern California.\r\n \r\nThey did get the chance to play the Whisky a Go-Go before it was over, opening for Salvation Army and the Alley Cats. They were proud of that, even if it was a bit of a tin god hippy landmark.\r\n \r\nThis is the recording they put together, half with Jimmy and half with Gary doing the singing.\r\n \r\nFor some reason, though it was planned and designated NAR 009 — it was never released, until now.\r\n \r\nThe band hopes you enjoy hearing it as much as they did recording it.\r\n \r\nDon't take it too seriously.\r\n\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\n<b>VIDEO</b>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADnjf_GIW2c\"> \"Box of Words\"</a>\r\n\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\n<b> DOWNLOAD CODE ONLY</b>\r\n\r\nPayPal $4.00 to: bob@waterunderthebridgerecords.com\r\nPlease include your email address and catalog number <i>(WUB 009)</i> and we will email you a code.\r\n\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\n<b>HIGHLIGHTS</b>\r\n\r\n• Comes w/ MP3 Download \r\n• Download Includes 4 Bonus Tracks\r\n• Insert Included\r\n\r\n▬\r\n\r\n<i>WUB 009\r\nRelease Date: 04.27.13</i>","options":[{"id":29187764,"name":"Default","price":6.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.53,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.55,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.75,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121221648/-/PG_NEW_MINI.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121221648/-/PG_NEW_MINI.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121221633/-/pg_all_four_members_500.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121221633/-/pg_all_four_members_500.jpg","width":500,"height":333},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121578216/-/PEER_GROUP.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121578216/-/PEER_GROUP.jpg","width":500,"height":297}],"artists":[{"id":173990,"name":"PEER GROUP","permalink":"peer-group","url":"/artist/peer-group"}],"categories":[{"id":448391,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":7808784,"name":"THE EXXTRAS - Waiting for You (Cassette w/Download)","permalink":"the-exxtras-waiting-for-you-cassette-w-download","position":6,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-exxtras-waiting-for-you-cassette-w-download","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-03T06:01:51.000Z","description":"<object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F101025536%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-TGe6C&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=true&amp;color=ff7700\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F112931525%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-TGe6C&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=true&amp;color=ff7700\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>   <span> </a></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Bill Marks</b>&nbsp;  bass, vocals\r\n<b>Raenie Kane</b>&nbsp;  drumbs, vocals\r\n<b>Philo Van Duyne</b>&nbsp;  guitar, vocals\r\n<b>Jack Brewer</b>&nbsp;  guitar, vocals\r\n\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\n<b>15</b>&nbsp; songs\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>1.

The songs are upbeat and never stop. Everything is up front and right there in your face. They keep it simple and to the point, which give the songs that extra punch. “Caught Me Off Guard” is definitely the stand out here. Mix up some early Descendents with the Buzzcocks and pour some syrup on that. It’s poppier than hell, and like anything sugary, you keep on wanting more. I have made the motion that this is thee official song of the summer, along with limeade being the official beverage of summer 2012. \r\n\r\n<i>–Matt Average,</i> Razorcake\r\n\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\n<b>VIDEO</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFy3kF1-Xq0\"> \"Frustration\"</a>\r\n\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\n<b> DIGITAL ONLY</b>\r\n\r\nGo here:\r\n<a href=\"http://waterunderthebridgerecords.bandcamp.com/album/thought-patterns\"><b>IMAGES - <i>Thought Patterns</i></b></a>\r\nDownload individual tracks or immediate download of 4-track album in your choice of high-quality MP3, FLAC, or just about any other format you could possibly desire. \r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\n<b>HIGHLIGHTS</b>\r\n\r\n• 7\" comes w/ MP3 Download\r\n\r\n\r\n▬\r\n\r\n<i>WUB 007\r\nRelease Date: 03.30.12</i>","options":[{"id":39025185,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.53,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.55,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.75,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121208928/-/Images_500.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121208928/-/Images_500.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121208886/-/PRESS_PHOTO_BC500.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121208886/-/PRESS_PHOTO_BC500.jpg","width":500,"height":333},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121578444/-/IMAGES.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121578444/-/IMAGES.jpg","width":500,"height":312}],"artists":[{"id":62516,"name":"IMAGES","permalink":"images","url":"/artist/images"}],"categories":[{"id":448391,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":3953712,"name":"(thee ultimate) BABY J - Looking for a Sign (7\" EP w/Download)","permalink":"thee-ultimate-baby-j-looking-for-a-sign-7-inch-ep","position":8,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/thee-ultimate-baby-j-looking-for-a-sign-7-inch-ep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-06-20T06:14:56.000Z","description":"<object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F39436981%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-7TUvd&amp;show_comments=false&amp;auto_play=true&amp;color=559b48\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F39436981%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-7TUvd&amp;show_comments=false&amp;auto_play=true&amp;color=559b48\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>   <span></a></span>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nGuitar and Singing by <b>Baby J</b><i> of Can of Beans and Stoned at Heart</i>\r\n\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\n<b>6</b>&nbsp; songs\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Turns out the louder she gets, the better it sounds. “World Is Winning” reminds me of Miguel Mendez, another South Bay songwriter who was rightfully wrapped up with Dios and who could do powerful crazy things with his own acoustic guitar. Frantic righteous guitar, lots of momentum, great sentiment (“What it really deserves is to burn …”) and great refrain (“Now look what has become of the world!”) and dramatic drum hits that make me think of Minutemen promising that they’d curse more if they heard mortar shells. “Ghetto Street” is “World”’s little friend – comes out slashing with harmonica and doesn’t let up, and you can fill in the drums and the amps in your own head, and they’d sound good, too. Of the softer ones, go with “Dope Smoker Clothes” – you can hear the marine layer settle as J sings about looking for roads where the cops don’t drive slow. The best parts on here have that come-along-fer-the-ride! joy that the Fugs had when they were honkin’ harmonicas and singing about dope and the world as they knew it, too.\r\n\r\n<i>-Chris Ziegler,</i> L.A.

This is not a Beach Boys' parody album sung by a \"special\" boy and his musical cat. This is Todd Congelliere's <i>Clown Sounds + Clown Frowns</i>. 23 songs by Todd, recorded throughout the past few years in the Recess Records Clown Sound Studio (converted garage).\r\n\r\nSome of these songs have appeared on other record labels in the form of a split cassette w/ Jacob Hamilton (<i>Clown Frown</i> – People’s Republic Of Rock And Roll) and two 7-Inches (<i>People In The Sand</i> – Ol’ Tennis Shoes / <i>Dangerous Intersections Vol. III</i> – Traffic Street), but this CD has all that, plus 13 unreleased songs (<i>Clown Sounds</i>).\r\n\r\nThe liner notes features a story Mike Watt originally wrote to be the liner notes for BLACK FLAG's EP, <i>The Process Of Weeding Out</i>. I assume it didn’t make the cut because Greg Ginn thought it was too goddamn strange. That is why it is perfect for this release, rad dudes letting their freak flags fly. What more can I say, check it out while you’re doing the dishes, you lowdown punk! \r\n\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\n<b>VIDEO</b>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhQNJW4BNeQ\"> \"You'll Hear My Voice\"</a>\r\n\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\n<b> DIGITAL ONLY</b>\r\n\r\nGo here:\r\n<a href=\"http://waterunderthebridgerecords.bandcamp.com/album/clown-sounds-clown-frowns\"><b>TODD CONGELLIERE - <i>Clown Sounds + Clown Frowns</i></b></a>\r\nDownload individual tracks or immediate download of 23-track album in your choice of high-quality MP3, FLAC, or just about any other format you could possibly desire. \r\n\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\n<b>HIGHLIGHTS</b>\r\n\r\n• 4-panel Digipak\r\n• <i>Clown Sounds</i> Lyrics included\r\n• Liner Notes by Mike Watt\r\n\r\n▬\r\n\r\n<i>WUB CD 004\r\nRelease Date: 06.19.10</i>","options":[{"id":9206248,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.49,"amount_with_others":0.46,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.69,"amount_with_others":0.66,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.32,"amount_with_others":1.3,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":5.14,"amount_with_others":1.89}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121174326/-/Todd_C_Clown_Sounds_DIGI_CD_500.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121174326/-/Todd_C_Clown_Sounds_DIGI_CD_500.jpg","width":500,"height":441},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121174299/-/todd_meower_color_version.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121174299/-/todd_meower_color_version.jpg","width":500,"height":332},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122219022/-/TODD.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122219022/-/TODD.jpg","width":500,"height":296}],"artists":[{"id":43753,"name":"TODD CONGELLIERE","permalink":"todd-congelliere","url":"/artist/todd-congelliere"},{"id":73335,"name":"TOYS THAT KILL","permalink":"toys-that-kill","url":"/artist/toys-that-kill"}],"categories":[{"id":449331,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":2692894,"name":"EPIC DEBAUCHERY - Excess In Moderation (Cassette w/Download)","permalink":"epic-debauchery-excess-in-moderation-cassette-dl","position":11,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/epic-debauchery-excess-in-moderation-cassette-dl","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-08-09T22:11:05.000Z","description":"<object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F101025536%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-TGe6C&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=true&amp;color=ff7700\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F101025536%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-TGe6C&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=true&amp;color=ff7700\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>   <span> </a></span>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Billy Fleps</b>&nbsp;  bass, vocals\r\n<b>Moe Maldonado</b>&nbsp;  guitar\r\n<b>Denis Fleps</b>&nbsp;  drums\r\n\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\n<b>10</b>&nbsp; songs\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

This is one of the few bands that can pull Hollywood hipsters away from their iPhones and hold their attention for the set. When I asked Denis Fleps how he would describe the band he said, \"Mid ’80s, Valley Girl rock, played by guys going through a mid-life crisis … too stubborn to turn down the volume and play real music.\" That sounds about right to me. One time in San Pedro, CA a girl came up to the guys after they played and said she loved the band, but had to leave because the vibrations were hurting her uterus. It turns out the guys got a bunch of free CRUNK energy drinks just before they played, and drank three each. As of late, I hear the boys have been hanging around Trader Joe’s scoring STEAZ energy drinks. So if you think you might be pregnant and you’re at an Epic Debauchery gig, get some earplugs for your uterus.\r\n\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\n<b>VIDEO</b>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpDOfJjJS1U\"> \"Head Down\"</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3D4kvud0ig\"> \"I Don't Mind\"</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\n<b> DIGITAL ONLY</b>\r\n\r\nGo here:\r\n<a href=\"http://waterunderthebridgerecords.bandcamp.com/album/excess-in-moderation\"><b>EPIC DEBAUCHERY - <i>Excess in Moderation</i></b></a>\r\nDownload individual tracks or immediate download of 10-track album in your choice of high-quality MP3, FLAC, or just about any other format you could possibly desire. \r\n\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\n<b>HIGHLIGHTS</b>\r\n\r\n• Cassette comes w/ MP3 Download\r\n• Limited Edition of 250\r\n\r\n\r\n▬\r\n\r\n<i>WUBC 003\r\nRelease Date: 09.11.10</i>","options":[{"id":9484840,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.71,"amount_with_others":0.71,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":9.34,"amount_with_others":1.36,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.53,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.45,"amount_with_others":3.3}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125022681/-/ED_CASS_VERSION.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125022681/-/ED_CASS_VERSION.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121173099/-/blurr_500.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121173099/-/blurr_500.jpg","width":500,"height":332},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122218782/-/EPIC.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122218782/-/EPIC.jpg","width":500,"height":271}],"artists":[{"id":193372,"name":"A LOVELY SORT OF DEATH","permalink":"a-lovely-sort-of-death","url":"/artist/a-lovely-sort-of-death"},{"id":43357,"name":"EPIC DEBAUCHERY","permalink":"epic-debauchery","url":"/artist/epic-debauchery"}],"categories":[{"id":1578174,"name":"Cassettes","permalink":"cassettes","url":"/category/cassettes"}]},{"id":2692830,"name":"SEAN COLE - Christy Twins (Cassette w/Download)","permalink":"sean-cole-christy-twins-cass-dl","position":12,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sean-cole-christy-twins-cass-dl","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-08-09T21:40:28.000Z","description":"<object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F9406686%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-UlG78&amp;show_comments=false&amp;auto_play=true&amp;color=ff7700\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F9406686%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-UlG78&amp;show_comments=false&amp;auto_play=true&amp;color=ff7700\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>   <span></a></span>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nAll songs recorded and arranged by <b>Sean Cole</b> <i>of Toys That Kill</i>\r\n\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>6</b>&nbsp; songs\r\n\r\n\r\n1.
