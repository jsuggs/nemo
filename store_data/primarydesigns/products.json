The cards are printed on white, acid free card stock in red water-based ink. They are packaged with envelopes. Each card measures 5 x 7 inches. They are blank inside. \r\n\r\nThe Dala Horse (Swedish: Dalahäst) is a traditional carved and painted wooden statue of a horse originating in the Swedish province of Dalarna. In the old days the Dala horse was mostly used as a toy for children; in modern times it has become a symbol of Sweden. \r\n\r\nEach linocut card is hand-pulled. The cards are 5x7 100% recycled, 30% post-consumer waste paper, archival and acid-free. Each piece is hand printed by me. Due to the nature of hand printing, each print is slightly different. I design and hand carve all of my linoleum blocks.\r\n\r\nThis set includes:\r\n3 Dala Horse cards\r\n3 white envelopes\r\n\r\nPlease contact me if you are interested in a larger order of cards or a different color paper or ink. I would be happy to customize your order.","options":[{"id":31607935,"name":"Default","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99219499/-/Set_of_3_Linocut_Swedish_Dala_Horse_cards__Block_print.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99219499/-/Set_of_3_Linocut_Swedish_Dala_Horse_cards__Block_print.jpg","width":800,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4888951,"name":"Cards","permalink":"cards","url":"/category/cards"}]}]
