This will make your guitar look as if it just arrived from the 1950's, but now plays even better.\r\n\r\nThis service includes a complete setup and re-string for all instruments, and is available on anything with strings.\r\n\r\nWe offer 3 stages, light, medium and heavy.\r\n\r\nLight - Minor in appearance, but great on the hands, softening the edges of frets, and wearing the lacquer down to give a slightly worn appearance with a few chips and dings for good measure.\r\n\r\nMedium - Surface scratches and body work cuts, exposing the under layers and wood surface, but rounding off any grooves to give a \"worn over time\" look. This also increases speed of the neck by creating a satin finish, and enhancing the hardware with some small details.\r\n\r\nHeavy - For only the most daring, this will really take your guitar back a few decades. This includes everything we can do; scratching, wearing, erosion of paint and edge softening, neck grading, fret rounding, acid erosion of hardware, plectrum scratches, buckle rash and anything else you might want.\r\n\r\nAll these options are available direct from Loki Guitars, and can be pre-arranged with specific attention to certain areas, so you know the outcome before we even begin.\r\n\r\nFor the cheapest price, you can contact us directly, and arrange an instrument collection/postage to and from the shop.","options":[{"id":44243019,"name":"Light Relic","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44243022,"name":"Medium Relic","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44243025,"name":"Heavy Relic","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":50.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":50.0,"amount_with_others":100.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124855302/-/Screen_Shot_2013-09-25_at_16.14.50.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124855302/-/Screen_Shot_2013-09-25_at_16.14.50.png","width":416,"height":554},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124855467/-/Screen_Shot_2013-09-25_at_16.26.55.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124855467/-/Screen_Shot_2013-09-25_at_16.26.55.png","width":427,"height":598},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124855551/-/Screen_Shot_2013-09-25_at_16.29.00.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124855551/-/Screen_Shot_2013-09-25_at_16.29.00.png","width":423,"height":594}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4826725,"name":"Custom","permalink":"custom","url":"/category/custom"}]},{"id":9939946,"name":"Loki Hammer 'Mod'","permalink":"loki-hammer-mod","position":3,"price":549.99,"default_price":549.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/loki-hammer-mod","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-03-15T04:26:25.000Z","description":"Loki Hammer Custom 6\r\n\r\nBased on the standard hammer model\r\nOptions include:\r\n\r\nScale Length -
