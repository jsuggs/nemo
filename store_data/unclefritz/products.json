Perhaps his father is a sadist and more embarrassed than I first reckoned.","options":[{"id":31035619,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122992059/-/unclefritzadvicetote01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122992059/-/unclefritzadvicetote01.jpg","width":480,"height":483},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/118203966/-/adviceimage01.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/118203966/-/adviceimage01.gif","width":480,"height":483}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4749725,"name":"Totes","permalink":"totes","url":"/category/totes"}]},{"id":11633535,"name":"Sumo Suit","permalink":"sumo-suit","position":36,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sumo-suit","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-07T03:25:41.000Z","description":"When I first met Sumo, I thought he was a rat so I tried to destroy him.
