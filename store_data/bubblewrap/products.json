Where some see boundaries or confines, Quiet Marauder see an idea worth pursuing. Currently embroiled in a Guinness World Record application for longest debut LP in recorded popular music history, Men charts the path of the male identity through love, rejection, murderous fantasy, discontent, crisis, intoxication, perversion and, ultimately, resolution.\r\n\r\nPowered by the dual songwriting engine room of Simon M. Read and Jonathan Day, Quiet Marauder are a loose collective of musicians all contributing flourishes of cornet, melodica, guitar, piano and strings.  For the purposes of Men, however, 26 artists from as far afield as Austria to as near as their hometown of Cardiff were recruited. These include the likes of The School, Winter Villains, Little Arrow, Bensh, John Mouse, Hail! The Planes, Ivan Moult, Laurence Made Me Cry, Spencer McGarry, Rory & NedTotem Terrors, Houdini Dax, Jemma Roper, My Name Is Ian, Francesca’s Word Salad, The Lovely Wars and many, many more.\r\n\r\nThe end result is an anti-folk, pop odyssey that can either be dipped into or out of, or swallowed in one, long ingestion (with breaks, naturally). Conjuring ghostly recollections of The Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band, Syd Barrett, The Magnetic Fields and The Fugs, Men is one of the most unique releases to have emerged from Wales or, indeed, the United Kingdom in some time.\r\n ","options":[{"id":44592354,"name":"Default","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126881190/-/BXMAu2oIAAAD8Ve.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126881190/-/BXMAu2oIAAAD8Ve.jpg","width":1024,"height":1024},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125118774/-/MEN-ALL.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125118774/-/MEN-ALL.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":237195,"name":"Quiet Marauder","permalink":"quiet-marauder","url":"/artist/quiet-marauder"}],"categories":[{"id":6326472,"name":"Albums","permalink":"albums","url":"/category/albums"},{"id":6326841,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":13884168,"name":"The Killing Woods","permalink":"the-killing-woods","position":2,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-killing-woods","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-30T19:15:22.000Z","description":"BWR014 (CD EP)\r\n\r\nAhead of the launch of their unique, 111 song, 4 volume debut album, Men, in November, Cardiff's favourite unhinged anti-folk heroes are releasing an appetite-whetting EP, or in their words, a 'quadruple A-side single'.\r\n\r\nPowered by the dual songwriting engine room of Simon M. Read and Jonathan Day, Quiet Marauder are a loose collective of musicians all contributing flourishes of cornet, melodica, guitar, piano and kitchen utensil percussion. For this EP they joined forces with international bestselling and award-winning author Lucy Christopher. Her brand new young adult fiction novel, also named The Killing Woods, is a dark, psychological thriller with a global release through publishers Chicken House.\r\n\r\nThe songs forming this EP were written and recorded during Lucy's own writing process and helped to inform the atmosphere and tone of the novel. Likewise, the novel itself helped to inspire these four songs in a symbiotic, creative meeting of minds.\r\n\r\nMurderous, threatening and endlessly sinister, The Killing Woods EP showcases Quiet Marauder at their very darkest, incorporating the skills of the incredible Hail! The Planes for final track The Game. The full tracklisting is as follows:\r\n\r\n1.\tIt Wasn't Me, It Was The Moon \r\n2.\tRoda & The Bunker \r\n3.\tThe Woods \r\n4.\tThe Game (feat. Hail!

Their unique sound focuses around the girls’ three stunning voices and is aptly complimented with acoustic guitar, cello, ukulele and percussion.\r\n\r\nRecorded live by in-demand producer Charlie Francis (REM, The High llamas, Sweet Baboo), the result feels less like listening to an album, and more like having the best seat in the house at an exclusive private concert. The record beautifully captures Barefoot's delicate and deeply personal style, portraying every facet of the band with tender tales of heartache heard on tracks such as ‘So It Goes’ and lively clap-a-longs with a sinister tinge such as ‘The Murder Song’.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\n1.

Recorded by Gareth Wardle at Cardiff Music Studios, the split 7\" release is a collaboration between Evening Chorus and Barefoot Dance of the Sea and incorporates Evening Chorus' 'Decisions', and Barefoot Dance of the Sea's '531 Miles from Aberdeen to Cardiff'. The result of this recording is two beautifully crafted pieces of folk music, wrapped up in harmonies, with subtle and diverse instrumentation and yearningly honest lyrics.\r\n\r\nEvening Chorus began as two lifelong friends, a chance meeting and a university course mate. They were brought together by a love of tea, biscuits and folk music and decided to combine their own experience and influence to create something new. A year and a half later, after extensive touring of South Wales and the South of England, and a finalist position in the Greenman Festival's Green Poll, their powerful vocal harmonies and inventive use of the instrumentation has granted them a solid reputation as one of Wales' finest Folk groups.\r\n\r\nThe trio that is Barefoot Dance of the Sea is made up of Rebecca Wood, Beth Gibson & Sophie Cochrane, the former two from of the Hot Puppies fame and all three from the ensemble supporting Spencer McGarry Season on his Episode 2 album. Their gorgeous three-part harmonies, country laments and sea shanties are encompassed by minimal (bordering on skeletal) instrumentation. Their delicate guitar and percussion embellish songs of gentle melancholia and light-footed charm.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\nA.

From a partridge in a pear tree to drummers drumming, each band has brought their own artistic style to create a fruitful spectrum of genres ranging from indie pop to folk to tweepop.\r\n\r\nDrawing from nostalgic memories of Christmas time spent as a child; the warm fuzzy feeling of roasting chestnuts on an open fire, hearing Phil Spector's 'A Gift For Christmas' crackling on an old record player and singing carols gathered around a grand piano (ok, maybe not that picturesque). 12 Days of Christmas aims to bring that childish excitement of surprise such as the next present to open, families and friends coming together or the distant sound of sleigh bells. To hear exclusive festive songs in a range of moods and styles from up and coming indie artists, is sure to be Christmas present arrived early!\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\n1.
