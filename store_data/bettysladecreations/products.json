These articles appeared weekly from 2008 to 2012 in The Pagosa Springs SUN, Pagosa Springs, Colorado. Her humorous style engages the reader to take their daily circumstances lightly. Love for her family and community is written in every word.\r\n\r\nShe writes about Sweet Al, his brother David, and the rest of the family. Whiskey and Daisy, the family dogs, and her friends’ pets have become famous. Her writings include family living, old and new friends, neighbors, and small-town sports. Even a few serious articles are sprinkled throughout the book.","options":[{"id":29305898,"name":"Paperback book","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":29305901,"name":"Hardback book","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/92058662/-/Living_Life_on_the_Front_Page.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/92058662/-/Living_Life_on_the_Front_Page.jpg","width":377,"height":480}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4297397,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":8721989,"name":"Spirit of the Red Candle, Journal of Mary Magdalene","permalink":"spirit-of-the-red-candle-journal-of-mary-magdalene","position":2,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/spirit-of-the-red-candle-journal-of-mary-magdalene","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-30T03:10:28.000Z","description":"The Spirit of the Red Candle is the first in the Scarlet Triangle Series.
