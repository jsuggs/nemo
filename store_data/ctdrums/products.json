We have researched and mimicd the best qualities of early American brass shells, like the thin 1.2mm shell thickness, installed center bead, vintage style rolled edges and smooth gradual snare beds for great articulation and tuning range.  They have that classic crisp brass sound with tons of depth and tone along with killer sensitivity that is highly sought after in any snare.  These drums can be tuned way up for a quick high pitched crack to very low for a fatter back beat, while the medium tuning creates a versatile smooth playability with great mid focus tone.    Perfect for any style of player, great for any snare drum collection.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe included 2.3mm triple flanged provide an open sound with a wide tuning range and versatility.  Solid made vintage style chrome plated brass tube lugs are minimally attached with a small footprint and add to that classic style.  Trick multi step throwoff offers 3 locking positions and smooth operation.  Remo Ambassador drum heads and 20 strand bronze wires also included.  A classic, top of the line drum straight out of the box.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Upgrade Options</u></b>\r\n<br>Die Cast Hoops (+70)\r\n<br>Single Flange Hoops & Clips (+$100)\r\n<br>Chrome Over Brass Hoops (+$85)\r\n<br>Black Nickel or Brass Hardware (+$30)\r\n<br>Various Lugs, Throwoffs, & More....\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<center><i>Add any upgrades to your comments area in your shopping cart after purchase and we will send an invoice for your upgrades.

The 4.5mm cold rolled steel hoops are similar to vintage single flange hoops that give the drum a more boxy, older tone but since the hoops are much  thicker and are heavy steel, they produce more cut and heavy rimshots.  These hoops can be considered a cross of die cast and single flanged hoops.
