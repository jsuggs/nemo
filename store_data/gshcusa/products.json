I have always been a baseball fan, I don't particularly like any other sports, but baseball always did it for me. Once I got a little older and discovered beer, this whole baseball thing seemed to make that much more sense.\r\n\r\nNow, I'm not sure who authorized it, but when the Tiger's redid their logo to its currenty design, I wanted to punch something. Compared to this throwback design, that logo just sucks. The story behind this print is that we were asked to do a series of jerseys for this totally awesome event hosted in Detroit in mid September called \"Another Detroit is Happening\". Check them out, they're doing good stuff, making Detroit not Suck if you will.\r\n\r\nI designed this shirt for them, using a design that fell off the back of a truck.

We spent a couple days perfecting this design, only to discover that while this IS completely customized from the pixel up, it bears a resemblance to a certain popular designer label. OOPS! It's cool, they owe Lucifer for all their successes any way (and we probably do too).\r\n\r\nAt first we thought maybe we'd pretend like this was some kind of political statement about how all designers/artists/etc all have to eventually sell their soul to the devil to succeed in their craft. Perhaps also a general call-out of sorts to people worshiping the false idol of brands, labels, designers so why not bring Satan in on it. Actually you know what, that's what this is all about - I just made that up, but it sounds legit.\r\n\r\nShirt is on a 100% cotton soft as all hell jersey knit shirt. Better pics are on the way, for now you have to settle for this crap iPhone shot. More colorways are in the works too. Red-dyed discharge means it's a print with NO HAND but a super duper vibrant color. The second photo up there is a digital snip to show the detail on this bad boy.\r\n\r\nTHANKS!

This shirt will potentially be the best investment you'll ever make. How many times have you been at a party, and wandering around asking people for drugs? All the time, right? Yeah, we're not stupid, we know you, and you hit us up for drugs at like every single event like for some reason because we give you everything else we're keeping some giant stockpile of shit to share with you as well. Well, here's the final word on that: We're not sharing our giant stockpile.\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for this shirt came to us when thinking \"What would be the greatest shirt to see a DJ in, ever?\" And this popped up. It's also the first two-color print that we've offered to date. We're getting much better at printing, and as such are upgrading the crap we have available.\r\n\r\nWe 100% guarantee that there is a small possibility that someone might give you some drugs just because you wear this shirt out once. All our products pay for themselves in free shit and laughs from people, expand the collection. Y'all. There are some new colorways on tap. Stay tuned.\r\n\r\nThe print is set on the right hip & detail includes our GSHC logo replacing the period on the question mark. We haven't been branding our shit, we are going to start doing that again because, well, you're our new billboard. Thanks for that.\r\n\r\nPlease email us if you're looking for something other than standard S-XL. We can offer womens sizes but colors may vary.
