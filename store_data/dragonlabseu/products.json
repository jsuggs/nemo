It has PPM output on the end pins which can connect to your DOSD's PPM input without needing a separate PPM encoder. It weighs only 4g so is perfect for your parkflyer FPV project! \r\n\r\nYou can de-solder the PPM pins and replace them with female header so that the receiver pushes on to the DOSD for a really light, neat installation. Send me a message with your order, I probably have some female headers you can have. \r\n\r\nComes with a bind plug and a sticky pad for mounting.

Connected to the DOSD via the Xlator it will give you stabilisation and artificial horizon indicator (AHI). You can simply connect the  data cable, or for the full feature set including 3D mode you need to run the servo cables from DOSD (and/or your receiver) to the FY-30A and then to the servos. You can get the Xlator and a cable set in this shop.\r\n\r\n      FY-30A has an integrated three-axisgyro and three-axis accelerometer which controls the aircraft movement in three-dimensional space. By using your remote control, the unit can be turned on or off for the following functions:\r\n       •  Level flight– When stabilizer is activated, the FY-30A will automatically control the aircraft for smooth easy flying. For beginners in RC aircraft flying, this is advantages as it makes flight easier and increases the student pilot self-confidence. The system can be activated throughout the entire flight duration, from take off to landing.\r\n       •  Emergency Recovery- If you lose orientation or feel the plane out of control, then release all control sticks, maintain throttle and switch on the FY30A.The unit will automatically send the correct signals to balance of the aircraft and regain level flight.\r\n       •  Aerobatics– for the experienced fixed wing 3D pilot, the FY-30A can help you achieve a more accurate flight path, especially in windy conditions. FY-30A makes 3D maneuvers such as inverted flight, , crane etc easier and simpler to achieve and maintain. A great way to practice and improve your 3D flying.\r\n       •  First Person View- for long-distance RC flight via video transmitter, the FY-30A will maintain the balance of your aircraft. You only need to control the heading of your aircraft and enjoy the view.\r\n       •  Firmwareupgrade –The FY-30A firmware is upgradable by connecting to your computer via a USB-TTL cable. As Feiyu Tech continuously improves the FY-30A system, firmware upgrades will be released periodically.\r\n \r\nHow it works\r\n      The core hardware for the FY-30Ais the integrated three-axis gyro and three-axis accelerometer which is the basis for inertial sensing. The other major components are an inertial navigation platform and strap down attitude algorithm designed for fixed wing aircraft stabilization.\r\n      When theFY-30A is in auto-balance mode, it detects the aircraft attitude and horizontal positioning and issues commands to servos that adjust the aircraft control surfaces (Aileron, Elevator and Rudder) so that the aircraft remains level at all times. Due to this auto corrective action to maintain smooth attitude and level flight, the FY-30A makes flying very easy.\r\n    When theFY-30A is operating in 3D mode and the aircraft is in an acrobatics flight, the FY-30A will use the 3-axis gyroscope sensors to calculate roll velocity and overall flight attitude. With this data, the system will output corresponding control corrections to maintain a smooth aircraft flight attitude even when doing aerobatics flight.\r\n      Since the FY-30A is self contained, it can be used in all weather conditions, indoors or outdoors. Just power up and take off.\r\n \r\nApplications\r\nThe FY-30A can be used in the followingfixed wing models:\r\n     •  Traditionallayout fixed-wing aircraft with Aileron, Elevator and Rudder;\r\n     •  Flying wings with rudder;\r\n     •  Flying wings with no rudder;\r\n     •  Airplanes with no ailerons (rudder and elevator only)\r\n     • V-tail airplanes with ailerons;\r\n     •  V tail airplanes with no ailerons;\r\n     •  Any other configuration, please email us for consultation - service@feiyu-tech.com","options":[{"id":24479916,"name":"FY-30A","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":28027616,"name":"box cover torn. box is fine..","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.4,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76156740/-/FY30A.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76156740/-/FY30A.jpg","width":160,"height":128},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76156779/-/FY_cables.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76156779/-/FY_cables.jpg","width":160,"height":128},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128254527/-/FY30a_wiring_options.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128254527/-/FY30a_wiring_options.jpg","width":1470,"height":998}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1974250,"name":"Sensors for OSD","permalink":"sensors-for-osd","url":"/category/sensors-for-osd"},{"id":2888001,"name":"Accessories","permalink":"accessories","url":"/category/accessories"}]},{"id":7755357,"name":"Xlator.
