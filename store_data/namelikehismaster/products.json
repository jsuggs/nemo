Naraka is largely a two-man effort, written, shot, scored, and edited over the course of a year and a half by Ryan Page and Ben Doty. The film’s austere style—black and white, as well as without dialogue—contributes to the sense of rising paranoia. Influenced by a variety of sources, from H.P. Lovecraft and David Lynch to The Seventh Seal and Abu Ghraib, Naraka features a climax reminiscent of Ambrose Beirce’s “An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.”\r\n“captivat[es] its audience with stark simplicity” -The Maine Campus\r\n\r\nThis special edition DVD contains a high quality render of the film along with a host of features prepared by the filmmakers.","options":[{"id":9489213,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25988218/-/Naraka-front.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25988218/-/Naraka-front.jpg","width":695,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":45059,"name":"Naraka","permalink":"naraka","url":"/artist/naraka"}],"categories":[{"id":1609687,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
