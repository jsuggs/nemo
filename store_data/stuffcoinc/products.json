The GotM edition means you not only get the game, you get a whole bunch of older stuff that we have worked on in the past, plus beta versions of newer games coming out soon.  Isn't that neat?\r\n\r\nFallen Rising is a two-dimensional top down shooter adventure game. Take to missions the way you choose with an arsenal of over 25 unique weapons, extensive dual-wielding combinations, RPG element to develop your character, and a free-roam story-based campaign.  You play an average character caught in a terrible situation. Randal Fallen, the young dictator, goes mad with power and issues his unhumanly loyal army to begin some form of Crusade. Caught in ground zero of the first attack, you manage to slip out. However, unknown parties are pulling the strings, and you are forced to become the front of the revolution to take down Randal Fallen using any means necessary, even if you must become just as infamous as the man you're after.\r\n\r\nThe story doesn't really start picking up until the later half, and I did almost all the artwork, coding, testing, writing, re-writing, re-re-writing (we lost the story update file so I had to redo all of the storyline) and development, so bear with me.\r\n\r\nPlus, have it delivered directly to your door.  100% not our fault if things fail! Blame UPS or something.  Speaking of UPS, this item has free shipping, because I can skip UPS and include it in an envelope or something without having to ship anything.  Either that, or, you can choose to directly download the game.\r\n\r\nWhy purchase this game when you can just as easily crack into my home computer, peer-to-peer share the install file and redistribute it to other people who probably wouldn't care less?  You buy it for the same reason you have that Native American Dreamcatcher or Copper Pot you got at the street fair that one time. It's to support your local artists.  I won't buy drugs with this money or go into street gangs.  We guarantee it (tm).\r\n\r\nFt. Music by local Tucson band Four Against One and Flagstaff girl-punk Cliche iDs.\r\n\r\n(Send any problems, bugs, or comments my way via email or facebook post.
