With the celebratory release show coming in less than a week, the anticipation for some is agonizing. Fans eagerly awaiting a sequel to So Came the Decimation however, should look elsewhere. In their new full-length album, The Beneath deliver epic technical songs with vocals reminiscent of 80’s metal, among a diverse mix of sounds carefully blended to perfection. Fans of Protest the Hero, All That Remains, and even Dragonforce will certainly appreciate the turn the band has taken. The 45-minute album kicks off beautifully with a slow acoustic fade-up, building to the inevitable explosion of brutal goodness that listeners have been craving. Tyler’s screams are simply the icing on the cake. On a cake that needs more icing, that is. Let’s just say more of the incredibly powerful vocals would not have done the album any harm. The band’s musical maturity and experience is revealed without doubt through their accomplishment of such diverse styles in one album. In one sitting, The Beneath takes the listener from slow acoustic guitar to technical metal riffs, from ambient metal to smooth piano to blasting drum beats. They also accomplish a major goal for every ideal album: a powerful, memorable introduction and conclusion. Die-hard fans and strangers to The Beneath alike will not be disappointed with this album.\r\n\r\nNote: Blake and I recommend watching Constantine (starring Keanu Reeves) while listening to this album for a truly epic experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nContains 7 songs for a total of 45 minutes of listening enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":1111554,"name":"City of Light CD","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2152800/-/colsmall.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2152800/-/colsmall.jpg","width":175,"height":175}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":228345,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":285976,"name":"Black Rhino Tee","permalink":"black-rhino-tee","position":4,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/black-rhino-tee","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-04-27T07:39:04.000Z","description":"Black Rhino Tee shirt.\r\n\r\nThis is a front only oversized print shirt.
