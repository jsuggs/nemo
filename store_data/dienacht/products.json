All know each other, families stick together, and the inhabitants love their neighborhood.\r\n\r\nSocial life takes place on the street with the neighbors and in the summer months -people sit in front of their houses and chat with passers-by. Kids rush up and down the streets with bikes and greet everyone passing their way, and feed upon the demolished gumball machine.\r\n\r\nThe street called Trierweilerweg is a kind of passage between downtown Trier and Trier West, which you walk through to get to the low cost houses. I lived in this street for two years, and during this time I documented the everyday life of the 150 meter street section I could see from my window.\r\n--\r\nA Special Edition of 5 with a signed and numbered Print (20 x 30 cm, printed on Hahnemühle Photo Rag, 308 g/m²) is available.\r\n--\r\nPrint run: 45 copies + 5 copies incl. a 20 x 30 cm Print, signed and numbered \r\n32 Pages, black and white photographs on cream paper | Size: 18 x 13 cm | 2nd Edition \r\nCover made of polaroid cardboard, laser perforated ","options":[{"id":45682260,"name":"WEST without Print","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.4,"amount_with_others":1.8,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125787978/-/IMGP5993.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125787978/-/IMGP5993.jpg","width":1000,"height":664},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125787981/-/IMGP6001.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125787981/-/IMGP6001.jpg","width":1000,"height":664}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":201636,"name":"Artzine","permalink":"artzine","url":"/category/artzine"},{"id":5212098,"name":"Book","permalink":"book","url":"/category/book"}]},{"id":13899465,"name":"dienacht Package","permalink":"dienacht-package","position":3,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dienacht-package","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-10-01T10:09:26.000Z","description":"All 8 available – timeless – issues: dienacht #8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and the special issues “Ostkreuzschule – Faits Divers” and “Young Polish Photographers”).

Neither do I feel the need to identify them with the music they listen to. We can guess that they probably don’t listen to club music, for example (although they seem to enjoy the disco ball). (…) I think that Anti-accent, even though it portrays people involved in the ‘punk scene’, with all their artistic influences, this aforementioned ‘fall’ of the ideas has a marginal meaning. These photographs ‘are punk’ more than they ‘show punk’. They seem to rather invite you to ‘punk’, than guide you through all the sweaty rehearsal rooms. ‘Punk’ understood as a certain idea, an ethos, a rebellion, showing your bruised ass off to the middle-class conventions. ‘Punk’ that pushes you into action, that has you co-create a community. So, not to repeat anything, Anti-accent rather is a rehearsal room, than shows you one. A rehearsal room that’s familiar to anyone, who doesn’t come back home before the evening cartoons. These photographs seem to come alive with whatever we put into them ourselves.” – Mateusz Romanowski\r\n\r\nGabriel Orłowski was born in 1989; he lives in Warsaw, Poland, and is a member of Merkabah and Acid Lindgren, experimental hardcore bands.\r\n--\r\nSoftcover, 100 pages, full colour \r\nSize: 15 x 21 cm, thread stitched \r\nPrint run: 100 copies \r\nWill arrive with ONE out of five numbered prints, \r\nsize: 13 x 18 cm \r\nDesigned by FLUUT","options":[{"id":34317372,"name":"Default","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.8,"amount_with_others":1.4,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/107366877/-/IMGP5811.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/107366877/-/IMGP5811.jpg","width":1000,"height":664},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/107366997/-/IMGP5838.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/107366997/-/IMGP5838.jpg","width":1000,"height":664},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/107367069/-/IMGP5811_Prints.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/107367069/-/IMGP5811_Prints.jpg","width":1000,"height":664}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":201636,"name":"Artzine","permalink":"artzine","url":"/category/artzine"},{"id":5212098,"name":"Book","permalink":"book","url":"/category/book"}]},{"id":10623784,"name":"dienacht Magazine #13","permalink":"dienacht-magazine-13","position":6,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dienacht-magazine-13","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-18T13:43:42.000Z","description":"The brand new issue of dienacht is now available for pre-order!

DIVERS \r\nOstkreuzschule – Seminar Thomas Meyer \r\n--\r\n„Nun, eine Fotografie entsteht immer durch die spontane Reaktion auf sich selbst.“ Robert Frank, 1958\r\n\r\nReportagen und Dokumentationen zählen zu den ältesten, aber auch zu den umstrittensten Genres der Fotografie. An ihnen manifestierte sich schnell eine Kritik, die einerseits auf den impliziten Realismus abzielt, andererseits aber auch auf die soziale Konstruktion, also den Raum hinter der Kamera, der systematisch ausgeblendet würde. Beides ist nicht Geschichte, aber die Genres sind offener geworden, durchlässiger für andere Formen und reflektierende Elemente. Auch die Themen haben sich geändert. Nicht das Spektakuläre, sondern das „So nicht Gesehene“ interessiert. Auf diesem Weg ist die Angst vor der Banalität verschwunden und eine diskrete Aufmerksamkeit wird nun offensiv eingefordert.\r\n\r\nDer vorliegende Band versammelt daher höchst unterschiedliche Interpretationen dieser beiden Genres, Fait divers aus unseren visuellen Welten. Gemein ist ihnen Freiheit der Form: Inszenierte Passagen wechseln mit klassisch dokumentarischem Blick, intime Nähe wird kontrastiert mit Distanz und Lust am Unbekannten. Verbunden werden sie durch das, was Fotografie schon immer begleitete: die Lust am „So noch nicht Gesehenen“. Und manchmal ist es – etwa in den Bildern vom Münchner Oktoberfest – noch nicht einmal das Objekt selbst, was fasziniert, sondern der illuminierte Himmel, den man zwar kannte, auf diese Weise aber noch nie wahr genommen hat.\r\n\r\nAm Ende steht die keineswegs triviale Erkenntnis, dass Fotografie in ihren gelingenden Momenten eine „spontane Reaktion auf sich selbst“ (Frank) ist, kein Einschnitt, sondern ein Ausschnitt von Welt und Ich.\r\n--\r\nFAITS DIVERS \r\nOstkreuzschule – Seminar Thomas Meyer \r\n14 Fotografen auf 144 Seiten, \r\n15 x 18 cm \r\n500 Exemplare \r\nOffsetdruck, vollfarbig \r\nSprache: deutsch","options":[{"id":20034781,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.2,"amount_with_others":1.4,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61700719/-/dncht_Ostkreuz_Cover_FINAL.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61700719/-/dncht_Ostkreuz_Cover_FINAL.jpg","width":600,"height":721}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":201635,"name":"Magazine","permalink":"magazine","url":"/category/magazine"},{"id":1799857,"name":"dienacht magazine","permalink":"dienacht-magazine","url":"/category/dienacht-magazine"}]},{"id":4548847,"name":"dienacht Magazine #10","permalink":"dienacht-magazine-10","position":14,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dienacht-magazine-10","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-10-02T07:45:25.000Z","description":"Photography by Andrew Testa, Arno Schidlowski, Yossi Lolloi, Kurt Caviezel, Stephan Tillmans and William Minke, Drawings by Dragan Prgomelja, painting by Rudi Hurzlmeier, a Graphic-Design Portfolio by Stefan Kaetz, Zine and book reviews, …\r\n--\r\n15 x 18 cm, 126 pages, full colour, in English and German. \r\n1000 copies, every single copy numbered!","options":[{"id":14899141,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.2,"amount_with_others":1.4,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/44553671/-/dncht10_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/44553671/-/dncht10_cover.jpg","width":500,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":201635,"name":"Magazine","permalink":"magazine","url":"/category/magazine"},{"id":201636,"name":"Artzine","permalink":"artzine","url":"/category/artzine"},{"id":1799857,"name":"dienacht magazine","permalink":"dienacht-magazine","url":"/category/dienacht-magazine"}]},{"id":2841434,"name":"dienacht Magazine #8","permalink":"dienacht-magazine-8","position":15,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dienacht-magazine-8","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-11-04T19:11:57.000Z","description":"<b>\"dienacht\" is an independent, \"one-man-magazine\" for photography, design, illustration and subculture.</b>\r\n\r\nFrom the content of this issue: \r\n<b>Claire Martin</b> -
