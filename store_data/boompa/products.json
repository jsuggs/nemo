Belle Game’s debut LP <i><b>Ritual Tradition Habit</b></i> begins with bashful keys, a soft wave of cymbals and a pair of ambiguous phrases. ‘Ritual’, a sweetly haunting soundscape, lasts only a few moments before fleshing out an explosion of wild and witchy tunes. Led by the hypnotic vocals of Andrea Lo, The Belle Game weave intricate guitar lines and dark pop rhythms into gorgeous melodies that are graceful and elegant, with the rawness of a boozy confessional. Vancouver alt-weekly The Georgia Straight describes their music as \"...a mix of pastoral pop and percussion-bombed art rock.\" \r\n\r\nRecorded in Vancouver, BC by John Raham (Be Good Tanya's, Frazey Ford) <i><b>Ritual Tradition Habit</b></i> is a journey through 12 beautifully layered tracks, interrupted by the occasional chant, hymn and instrumental rumbling. \r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Ritual</li>\r\n <li>River</li>\r\n <li>Wait Up For You</li>\r\n <li>In Secrets</li>\r\n <li>Wasted Light</li>\r\n <li>Tradition</li>\r\n <li>Bruises To Ash</li>\r\n <li>Blame Fiction</li>\r\n <li>Salt + Water</li>\r\n<li>Keeps Me Up At Night</li>\r\n<li>Little Wars (Causing Your Trouble)</li>\r\n<li>Habit</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nRelease Date: April 16th, 2013","options":[{"id":23036197,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71376051/-/TBG_RTHCover.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71376051/-/TBG_RTHCover.jpeg","width":369,"height":369}],"artists":[{"id":140575,"name":"The Belle Game","permalink":"the-belle-game","url":"/artist/the-belle-game"}],"categories":[{"id":149741,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":7275613,"name":"Earning Keep T-Shirts & Tank Tops","permalink":"earning-keep-t-shirt","position":17,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/earning-keep-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-17T23:51:21.000Z","description":"Christopher Smith <i><b>Earning Keep</b></i> Limited Edition T-Shirt/Tank Top\r\n\r\nAvailable Sizes: Small, Medium or Large\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":23036049,"name":"Tank Top Small","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23037193,"name":"Tank Top Medium","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23037195,"name":"Tank Top Large","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23037197,"name":"T-Shirt Small","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23037199,"name":"T-Shirt Medium","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23037303,"name":"T-Shirt Large","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":9.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71372715/-/296492_10151207011673875_2121807143_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71372715/-/296492_10151207011673875_2121807143_n.jpg","width":960,"height":753}],"artists":[{"id":9192,"name":"Christopher Smith","permalink":"christopher-smith","url":"/artist/christopher-smith"}],"categories":[{"id":149744,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":7275513,"name":"Earning Keep Bundle ","permalink":"christopher-smith-earning-keep-bundle","position":18,"price":38.0,"default_price":38.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/christopher-smith-earning-keep-bundle","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-17T23:43:30.000Z","description":"This bundle contains the following items:\r\n\r\nEarning Keep T-Shirt (S/M or L)\r\n\r\nPillars and Pyre 7\" Vinyl\r\nVinyl includes: \r\n- Pillars & Pyre\r\n- Pillars and Pyre (Andy Dixon Remix)  \r\n- Download card\r\n\r\nEarning Keep CD\r\n\r\nChristopher Smith Pin\r\n\r\n\r\nEarning Keeps' resonance lies in its ability to combine the physical essence of the phrase with the many human parallels that run throughout it. It is a work of contrast and ubiquity, where roles subvert and the structure of class and ones pursuit of love and identity there-in fold and envelope each other. It is a means to an end, as the work defines the finished product; they are one in the same, the process honouring the outcome, the journey longing for destination. Smith wanted a cohesive sound built off not only simple pop idioms, but as well a more band oriented sound.

Produced by Arran Fisher, the fifteen tracks on <i>Die Stadt Muzikanten</i> move and contort like a film soundtrack. Lush, grand moments complement Mark’s signature cinematic “pretty-pretty-pop” sound. Songwriter, Mark Andrew of the Hamiltons, breathes a glorious new life into <i>Die Stadt Muzikanten</i>, an album both inspired by a recent stay in Germany and of the comparative lives of his ancestors. \r\n\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Die Stadt Muzikanten</li>\r\n<li>Woodpigeon vs. Eagleowl (Strength in Numbers)</li>\r\n<li>Empty-Hall-Sing-Along</li>\r\n<li>Morningside</li>\r\n<li>My Denial In Argyle</li>\r\n<li>Enchantée Janvier</li>\r\n<li>Such A Lucky Girl</li>\r\n<li>Unmissable Grey, Mixed Paint</li>\r\n<li>Duck Duck Goose</li>\r\n<li>Spirehouse</li>\r\n<li>Redbeard</li>\r\n<li>The Street Noise Gives You Away</li>\r\n<li>…And as the Ship Went Down, You’d Never Looked Finer</li>\r\n<li>The Pesky Druthers (Parts 1 & 2)</li>\r\n<li>Our Love is as Tall as the Calgary Tower</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nRelease Date: January 12, 2010\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://woodpigeon.bigcartel.com\">Woodpigeon's European Store</a>","options":[{"id":1699300,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3526652/-/WP-DSM-400.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3526652/-/WP-DSM-400.jpg","width":400,"height":400}],"artists":[{"id":5470,"name":"Woodpigeon","permalink":"woodpigeon","url":"/artist/woodpigeon"}],"categories":[{"id":149741,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":403725,"name":"Keepsake","permalink":"keepsake","position":29,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/keepsake","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-09-21T21:26:34.000Z","description":"Christopher Smith's songs have that timeless sound that makes you nostalgic for days gone by -- days both you and Smith alike are too young to have even known.
