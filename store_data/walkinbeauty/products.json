While healing is a journey, shamanic sessions seek to find the imbalances at their root cause, rather than working backwards from the presenting issues.  This by its very nature, tends to promote deep, lasting, transformation shifts that help us heal more quickly.  Shamanic healing is also focused on restoring personal power, and removing unwanted energies that contribute to our loss of power.\r\n\r\nIt is up to each person to set their clear intention and commitment for their own personal healing journey.  As a practitioner, I am here to support you in honouring that commitment to yourself.  By creating and holding a safe and sacred space, the luminous body can transmute heavy energies back to sources of light and power.  Our entire being is then informed in new ways, leading us to new levels of awareness, greater states of health and well-being.  As we are sourced more and more from our wholeness and less and less from our wounds, we step more fully into our personal power and potential.\r\n\r\nDuring sessions, you remain fully clothed, and lie on a massage table, or sometimes work is done on the floor or the ground if we are working outdoors.  There is gentle touch to the body for some of the work, and other forms of energy work and body work may be integrated into your session.  The work is always conducted with the deepest respect for you and your process, in the safety, protection and grace of Sacred Space, where Spirit is invited to work on your behalf. The sessions last from 1 hour to 2 hours.\r\n\r\nIlluminations\r\n\r\nMany of my shamanic sessions include an Illumination – working with one of the stones from my mesa – and with your luminous energy field, and the Luminous Lineages, to deeply clear one or more chakras that is holding “hucha” heavy energies.  This gentle but powerful process, can clear lifetimes of energy sludge from your chakras.  It’s called an Illumination, because when the clearing is complete, the chakra is “illuminated” – reinformed with Divine Light.  When I begin an illumination on a chakra, it is most often spinning slowly or not at all – a sign of a clogged, blocked chakra.  When the illumination is complete all the chakras are spinning clockwise, full of energy and light, once again sourcing the luminous and physical bodies with life force energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":10652237,"name":"Default","price":80.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30157975/-/theologue-alexgrey3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30157975/-/theologue-alexgrey3.jpg","width":933,"height":396}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":324497,"name":"Palo Santo Sticks","permalink":"palo-santo-sticks","position":2,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/palo-santo-sticks","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-06-17T10:51:24.000Z","description":"Palo Santo Incense 2 oz, med bag.
