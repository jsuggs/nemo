It is a bit eclectic, but most of the poems have common threads of nature, childhood, and old age.  It’s titled <b>Staring Down at Space</b> because it is nonsensical and contradictory.  Includes a sweet drawing of a humpback whale on the cover.\r\n\r\n(from \"Cotton\")\r\n\r\n<i>You’ve stretched yourself to let all corners,\r\nfolds, threads, stitches of you receive light and air\r\npurely allowing nature to lend you strength, and I too,\r\ncan become less resistant to the earth’s tendencies.\r\n</i>\r\n\r\nFive copies are currently available!","options":[{"id":6982101,"name":"Default","price":0.25,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/18338081/-/Staring_Down_at_Space_BG__1_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/18338081/-/Staring_Down_at_Space_BG__1_.jpg","width":400,"height":478}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1178531,"name":"Chapbook","permalink":"chapbook","url":"/category/chapbook"}]}]
