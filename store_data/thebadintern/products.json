The print is part of a series exploring the atomisation and detatchment of modern urban living.\r\n\r\n'I guess a lot of my pictures have a slightly cold, formal quality to them but that wasn't predetermined...

His first short film - The Ellington Kid  - premiered at the London Film Festival 2012 and is currently touring UK cinemas.","options":[{"id":27629540,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86535845/-/Nightbus1000.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86535845/-/Nightbus1000.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86535806/-/Nightbuscu100.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86535806/-/Nightbuscu100.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86536097/-/nightbusecu.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86536097/-/nightbusecu.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":164948,"name":"Dan Sully","permalink":"dan-sully","url":"/artist/dan-sully"}],"categories":[{"id":3437577,"name":"Photography","permalink":"photography","url":"/category/photography"}]},{"id":7598479,"name":"'Dochula' by Maja Flink","permalink":"douchala-by-maja-flink","position":2,"price":75.0,"default_price":75.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/douchala-by-maja-flink","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-19T12:41:56.000Z","description":"<b>Exclusive limited edition of 50\r\nPaper size: 297mm x 420mm\r\nImage size: 266mm x 266 mm\r\nC-type print.
