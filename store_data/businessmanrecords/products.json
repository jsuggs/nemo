Augmented with guests from The Hot Puppies, Barefoot Dance Of The Sea and Cardiff New Music Collective amongst others, this 69-minute epic brims with strings, brass, woodwind, percussion and additional vocals.\r\n\r\nProduced by Charlie Francis (High Llamas, REM), it takes its cues from a broad range of influences, with the 20th century musical theatre of Rogers and Hammerstein, Gershwin and Irving Berlin noticeable alongside the baroque pop of Brian Wilson, Sufjan Stevens and The Beatles and even modern classicists Steve Reich and Philip Glass. \r\n\r\nWith huge faux-operatic moments, jazz passages, knowing avant campness and out-and-out noise, culminating in a 20-minute medley, the results make for a challenging yet warm and accessible record and a massive step forward.\r\n\r\nHappy Talk\r\nWaiting For Isabel\r\nThe Loneliest Bridge\r\nAll Things To All Men\r\nBullets Hit Bullets You Know\r\nThe Serology Of Love/In Nervous Sleep\r\nException That Proves The Rule\r\nThe Giveaway\r\n1 Km More\r\nMemory Is...\r\nIntention Ten Folds To Tension\r\nOh Line (reprise)/Wardenclyffe And The 1895 Fire\r\nThe Girl From Milwaukee Immortalised In A Talkie\r\nBe A Sport\r\nWe're All Infants Now\r\nGreat Enemies\r\nThe Big Broadcast Of 2006","options":[{"id":7609951,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.1,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.1,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/20164611/-/smsepisode2cover__2_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/20164611/-/smsepisode2cover__2_.jpg","width":1000,"height":882}],"artists":[{"id":1812,"name":"Spencer McGarry Season","permalink":"spencer-mcgarry-season","url":"/artist/spencer-mcgarry-season"}],"categories":[{"id":59033,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
