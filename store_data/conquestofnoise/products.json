Plenty of bands are mining the early '90s alt-rock explosions for sonic ideas, but few make plundering as much fun as the Courtneys. The Vancouver via Calgary trio (their rhythm section were part of Cowtown noiseniks Puberty) ooze oversized T-shirts and teen angst on their debut self-titled full-length. Repurposing Thurston Moore's buzzy guitar tone for the kind of thoughtful, pop-minded song craft we always knew he was capable of, singer Courtney Loove, bass player Sydney Koke and drummer Jen Twynn Payne blasted out these eight tracks in a mere three days. More a document of their heady early period than a curated album, not everything represents the Courtneys at their peak. However, there are enough hooks and excitement on tracks like \"Manion\" and the stunning \"90210\" to rocket this disc up to the top of your playlist. Think Sonic Youth, Blake Babies, Pavement and they would of fit right in on New Zealand's legendary label Flying Nun back in the day. It's in it's third pressing in Canada & has just been released in JAPAN & the USA..  The record will be supported by all  formats as well as instore merch. First 125 copies come hand numbered and with a free poster.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/xlzgXh-Qj4w\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Xl77f2gFSL4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 725px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2775918595/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=4ec5ec/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://conquestofnoiserecords.bandcamp.com/album/the-courtneys-2\">THE COURTNEYS by THE COURTNEYS</a></iframe>\r\n","options":[{"id":42889518,"name":"Default","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124437087/-/44622_con_cover_proof.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124437087/-/44622_con_cover_proof.jpg","width":394,"height":394},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124437105/-/44622_con_cover_proof2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124437105/-/44622_con_cover_proof2.jpg","width":394,"height":394},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123966123/-/thecourtneys_letter_insert_FINAL_OUTS.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123966123/-/thecourtneys_letter_insert_FINAL_OUTS.jpg","width":394,"height":394},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124186668/-/thecourtneys_beastie.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124186668/-/thecourtneys_beastie.jpg","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":193747,"name":"CONQUEST OF NOISE RECORDS","permalink":"conquest-of-noise-records","url":"/artist/conquest-of-noise-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"},{"id":6955896,"name":"NEW RELEASES","permalink":"new-releases","url":"/category/new-releases"},{"id":6367632,"name":"FAVOURITE RECORDS OF 2013","permalink":"favourite-records-of-2013","url":"/category/favourite-records-of-2013"},{"id":5253093,"name":"STAFF PICKS","permalink":"staff-picks","url":"/category/staff-picks"}]},{"id":15346494,"name":"THE BALLANTYNES - Liquor Store Gun Store Pawn Shop Church 12\" EP","permalink":"the-ballantynes-liquor-store-gun-store-pawn-shop-church-12-ep","position":3,"price":19.99,"default_price":19.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-ballantynes-liquor-store-gun-store-pawn-shop-church-12-ep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-05T07:46:54.000Z","description":"Finally after three ripping sold out 7\"s of 60's garage gospel soul THE BALLANTYNES have released a multi tracker.

I know your friend Stardust described them as such after seeing them last week but let's not even ironically pretend to pay credence to the opinion of someone with such a ludicrous name. Bath Party is, however, an exuberantly reverberated tank of psychedelic blues rock that is willing to let you call it whatever you want as long as you dance. After a trio of EP's, the band is proud to finally release it's acid-friendly, self-titled debut. Employing a familiar kaleidoscope of swirling guitars, enchanting rhythms, and pop-conscious structures, the album provides an atmospheric environment appropriate for a plethora of spiritual and recreational activities. A fittingly idle listener can expect a sonic journey replete with raga-level space vibrations and explosively fuzzy freak-outs alike. Gentle blues drones swell to crashing highs of Seeds-esque energy and back down again, ad infinitum. It's rock... but more space-y... You could call it space rock but band Hawkwind already stole the name and Bath Party sounds nothing like Hawkwind. Bath Party sounds like Bath Party. As stated before, you can call Bath Party whatever you want, really. Just don't make the mistake of not buying this record as that would be both abusive to your third eye and the stupidest thing you've done since befriending someone named Stardust. 500 Pressed on Black, Green, & Blue Colored Vinyl. + Digital Download.\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/GYafWCZa4Ro\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4124841432/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e32c14/notracklist=true/t=1/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://resurrectionrecords.bandcamp.com/album/s-t-5\">S/t by Bath Party</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":42641706,"name":"Default","price":21.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123712323/-/a2122177500_10.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123712323/-/a2122177500_10.jpg","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":189880,"name":"RESURRECTION Records","permalink":"resurrection-records","url":"/artist/resurrection-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"},{"id":6955896,"name":"NEW RELEASES","permalink":"new-releases","url":"/category/new-releases"},{"id":5253093,"name":"STAFF PICKS","permalink":"staff-picks","url":"/category/staff-picks"}]},{"id":15347523,"name":"BRIMSTONE HOWL - Blowhard Deluxe LP ","permalink":"brimstone-howl-blowhard-deluxe-lp-pre-order","position":5,"price":21.99,"default_price":21.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/brimstone-howl-blowhard-deluxe-lp-pre-order","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-05T09:47:55.000Z","description":"Roaring out the gates with a gale force of noisy, feedback-drenched guitars and thunderous pummeling drums, the pride and joy of Lincoln, NE return with a snarling, shambolic vengeance.

The boys are back! GIUDA (pronounced JEW-DA) are an Italian Glam/Glittler/Boot Boy band from Rome, born from the ashes of one of the finest European punk rock groups: TAXI.\r\n\r\nThey play the most exciting kind of retro sounding pub rock and junk shop glam and they have the look of true working class heroes (boots, polos, chequered shirts, leather jackets and short or shaved hair).\r\n\r\nactually they are the perfect party band, but with a tough attitude. Damaged Goods released their debut album \"Racey Roller\" last year and now the band are back with the aptly titled \"Let's Do It Again\".\r\n\r\nTheir debut album \"Racey Roller\"was famously described by Robin Wills (THE BARRACUDAS) as \"Cock Sparrer twinned with the Equals\" and quickly became an underground sensation, highly praised by publications as diverse as Mojo, Rolling Stone and Maximum Rock'n'Roll.\r\n\r\nWorking from the same glammy three-chord blueprint as groups like SLADE, T. REX, FACES, MUD, STATUS QUO, and THE SWEET, GIUDA take the listener back to a monumental bygone era of Rock'n'Roll.\r\n\r\nSpecifically the early 70's pre-punk, glitter days when music was all about monstrous riffs, boisterous attitudes, high energy experimentation and fun.\r\n\r\nGIUDA take that same glammy, proto-punk foundation and fuse it with the grimy, tattered muck of bands like THIRD WORLD WAR, EDDIE AND THE HOT RODS and COCK SPARRER to create a timeless arsenal of glam injected, pub rock classics, of which 10 make up the new sensational album \"Let's Do It Again\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/d7Ib0KLtRP8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","options":[{"id":45476595,"name":"Default","price":29.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125641512/-/1383947_615058311877582_948788982_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125641512/-/1383947_615058311877582_948788982_n.jpg","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":140337,"name":"FUNGO Records","permalink":"fungo-records","url":"/artist/fungo-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"},{"id":6955896,"name":"NEW RELEASES","permalink":"new-releases","url":"/category/new-releases"},{"id":6367632,"name":"FAVOURITE RECORDS OF 2013","permalink":"favourite-records-of-2013","url":"/category/favourite-records-of-2013"},{"id":5253093,"name":"STAFF PICKS","permalink":"staff-picks","url":"/category/staff-picks"}]},{"id":15346221,"name":"GRAVEL SAMWIDGE - Medicinal Requirements 12\" EP","permalink":"gravel-samwidge-medicinal-requirements-12-ep","position":10,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/gravel-samwidge-medicinal-requirements-12-ep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-05T07:20:13.000Z","description":"Gravel Samwidge on a 12\" record for the first time, cut at 45rpm for maximum head thumpin' potential. 6 over the counter doses of suburban backwoods Brisbane outsider rock.

If your not interested in parties or fun or what have you, might I suggest Train's \"Drops of Jupiter\". Now, if your not off on iTunes (or wherever the fuck it is that moms buy music) buying said Train album, let's talk about how much fun you will have listening Honey Badger's \"Buena Park\". Short answer; all of it. This circular piece of Orange County awesome is etched with a surprising variety of crunchy hit's. From upbeat cowpunk sing-a-longs to head hanging, synth-laden post punk rippers, the album never looses a dance-able pulse. The music is undeniably garage pop in it's foundation but the bubblegum you often find in this kind of stuff is all but absent, leaving recognizable tunes with a raw delivery (this being the best type of delivery aside from pizza). What I'm saying is, this music is much more similar to pizza than it is to bubblegum. I hope that helps.\r\n+ Digital Download.\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2006866616/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=63b2cc/notracklist=true/t=2/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://resurrectionrecords.bandcamp.com/album/buena-park\">Buena Park by Honey Badgers</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":50702316,"name":"Default","price":21.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129458376/-/a0367789916_10.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129458376/-/a0367789916_10.jpg","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":189880,"name":"RESURRECTION Records","permalink":"resurrection-records","url":"/artist/resurrection-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"},{"id":6955896,"name":"NEW RELEASES","permalink":"new-releases","url":"/category/new-releases"}]},{"id":12259515,"name":"THE JAY VONS - Night (Was stealing from the sun) 7\" ","permalink":"the-jay-vons-night-was-stealing-from-the-sun-7","position":12,"price":11.99,"default_price":11.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-jay-vons-night-was-stealing-from-the-sun-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-09T06:08:59.000Z","description":"Recorded by Wayne “Johnny Cakes” Gordon at Daptone Studios with Budos Band baritone Jared Tankel guesting, The Jay Vons deliver two tracks with the stamp of quality you’ve all come to expect from those hallowed halls.

Americana and marijuana. \"Love Is The Law\" is the direct sequel to the first record. It includes songs from the sessions that made up the first album as well as songs that were recorded later. We wanted the first album to be really short so that's why some of the songs got saved for the second record. Unlike the first album, which was recorded completely by me and Kyle in his old bedroom in Summer 2010, \"Love Is The Law\" features some songs recorded with Izak on bass.\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/cy4I_3P9s-Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the songs came naturally, Kyle would write the music and I'd write the words. All the lyrics are about things that we know or do; convincing girls, female anatomy, cuddling, being stoned all the time, self-employment/unemployment, Star Trek, sex dreams, cellphones, heartbreak, penis size, cunnilingus, after parties, and past lovers. All the songs are written from the stuff I got laying around in my memories, fresh and old.\r\n\r\n\"Love Is The Law\" is Summer nights drinking and making out on the playground. It's about having a lust for everything and believing that love is never far away. We want people to hear these songs and remember their exes. We want people to remember things and smile. To remember and to savor the flavor.\r\n\r\nThis album is The Memories. It's sweet weed, late nights, chill days, sweat, beer, tears, whiskey, women, and wine. Not a word in these songs are a lie and they are about real people and real places. It was written and recorded from 2010 to 2012 in different bedrooms, apartments, houses, and hallways, on drugs and in love with life.\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3425790560/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/notracklist=true/t=1/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://burgerrecords.bandcamp.com/album/love-is-the-law\">Love Is The Law by The Memories</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":42640962,"name":"Default","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123711792/-/INS120877.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123711792/-/INS120877.jpg","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":160338,"name":"BURGER Records","permalink":"burger-records","url":"/artist/burger-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"},{"id":6955896,"name":"NEW RELEASES","permalink":"new-releases","url":"/category/new-releases"},{"id":5253093,"name":"STAFF PICKS","permalink":"staff-picks","url":"/category/staff-picks"}]},{"id":15393375,"name":"MISCALCULATIONS - Self Titled LP ","permalink":"miscalculations-self-titled-lp-pre-order","position":16,"price":21.99,"default_price":21.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/miscalculations-self-titled-lp-pre-order","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-07T10:05:29.000Z","description":"Ambitious effort from these London pukes .

Surfy, with punk hooks and smilyfaced locals exploding with danger, fun, youth with just a small tinge of sadness. These dudes crap out catchy riffs like golden eggs, everything is light, uptempo and catchy as shit.” (The Big Takeover, July 2013)\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/NBK7Ke9Y2Qk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/gndAHcdO84w\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/101394667&amp;color=00ffff&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":49910088,"name":"Default","price":21.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128856042/-/new_swears_sleeve_front-500x500.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128856042/-/new_swears_sleeve_front-500x500.jpg","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":183928,"name":"BACHELOR Records","permalink":"bachelor-records","url":"/artist/bachelor-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"},{"id":6955896,"name":"NEW RELEASES","permalink":"new-releases","url":"/category/new-releases"},{"id":5253099,"name":"PRE ORDERS","permalink":"pre-orders","url":"/category/pre-orders"},{"id":5253093,"name":"STAFF PICKS","permalink":"staff-picks","url":"/category/staff-picks"}]},{"id":15393345,"name":"RÄTTENS KRATER - Bygga Upp Ett Stort Berg LP ","permalink":"rattens-krater-bygga-upp-ett-stort-berg-lp-pre-order","position":19,"price":21.99,"default_price":21.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rattens-krater-bygga-upp-ett-stort-berg-lp-pre-order","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-07T10:03:00.000Z","description":"Holy shit, this is Punk Rock of the highest caliber.  Lodged somewhere in between the intriguing aesthetics and dirty fringes of Sweden's first wave rippers like Cortex and Lädernunnan,  RÄTTENS KRATER carve out dark, driving wasteoid hits with complicated riffs and clangy, bouncy hooks.  Influences range from the Wipers to Flipper to Gang Of Four to a bit of the Swell Maps; and they spit shine their noisy, chaotic Post Punk grit with shards of broken glass bashed over an off-kilter, jittery rhythm section.  RÄTTENS KRATER 's songs are as much compelling as they are unique and their accompanying artwork really accentuates their gritty, tattered music.

Highlights include the \"Total Shit\" trilogy on the b-side. \"Feel Like Total Shit\" / \"This is Total Shit\" / \"I'm Total Shit\" - three songs that give you a 360 degree views from the dregs of modern life: making bad choices, feeling powerless against the will of people who make bad choices, and just generally having everything stacked against you and turning those bad vibes inwards. In the Strange Attractor land, when we point fingers we have to remember that we are simultaneously pointing at ourselves. \"Back to the Cruel World\" will fail to get the attention it rightfully deserves. It will not get the head space it needs, the listening time required to unlock the riches contained within. Sure, there will be a few true believers who will wave the flag of Strange Attractor, who will herald this LP as a cornerstone of Canadian music in 2013, but they will be met with complete blank stares and people turning back to topics they are versed in whenever they try to spread the word. Why? Strange Attractor are from a small town in Northern Ontario. Strange Attractor don't tour much, and when they do, they tour in Europe where they are already massive punk rock superstars. Strange Attractor don't have a street team, management, or a fancy P.R. person who can 'guarantee a Best New Music.' Strange Attractor don't have a social media strategy outside \"making cool records\" and \"making cool videos.\" Strange Attractor are not hot 20-year old dudes. There are no drops. But make no mistake, \"Back to the Cruel World\" rules and is perfectly happy standing on its own, outsider status intact. When you find other people with Strange Attractor records on their shelves, give them the secret Punk Handshake™ and congratulate them on their good taste.\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/kMYP4QUYrYw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/ZrTjXG6O-h0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1971593687/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=e99708/notracklist=true/t=1/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://resurrectionrecords.bandcamp.com/album/back-to-the-cruel-world\">Back To The Cruel World by Strange Attractor</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":50702634,"name":"Default","price":21.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129458523/-/a2388828783_10.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129458523/-/a2388828783_10.jpg","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":189880,"name":"RESURRECTION Records","permalink":"resurrection-records","url":"/artist/resurrection-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"},{"id":6955896,"name":"NEW RELEASES","permalink":"new-releases","url":"/category/new-releases"}]},{"id":13330551,"name":"TOMORROWS TULIPS - EXPERIMENTAL JELLY LP ","permalink":"tomorrows-tulips-experimental-jelly-lp","position":24,"price":19.99,"default_price":19.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tomorrows-tulips-experimental-jelly-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-03T07:43:35.000Z","description":"\"Tomorrows Tulips' Alex Knost and Christina Keyes approach simple with ideas that are born and bred with the most pure of intentions faded, stone-drenched, wall-fuzzed rock/pop that reverbs with calming steam.\" \r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/XXnbvEsyfnk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nTomorrows Tulips hail from California, and make lo-fi indie surfer pop. \r\n“Tomorrow’s Tulips new album Experimental Jelly starts out like any psychedelic California beach-pop album, with the song “Flowers on the Wall”.  It is the very definition of the form, from the Zombies-esque texture to the guitar solo that sounds like Brian Eno after getting high.  But, through listening to the rest of the album, a concept becomes clear.  The first side is all a dream.  It begins with the trippy surrealism that all dreams contain to an extent, but very sharply takes a turn into nightmare with track two, “He Quits”.  This song sounds as though it was written by a post-Beatles, pre-Double Fantasy John Lennon, and preformed by the Undertakers, only with the voice of Matt Berninger.  It goes on to track three “Introduction to a Pile of Confetti and Glue”.  This song is far less lucid than the ones before it, more evocative of the unnamable fear of a night terror.  It sounds like a Dead Man’s Bones song performed by Neutral Milk Hotel circa 1998.  These feelings continue though “Dream Thru” and “Misses Hash”, but are then interrupted by a striking instrumental piece that brings the listener back to reality in “Wake Up”.  Side Two, unfortunately, obviously can not continue this concept, but instead seems to follow this same person in their attempt to escape from their working class prison, with songs like “Vacation” “Free” and “Mr. Sun”.  All in all, Experimental Jelly is a triumphant sophomore album from Tomorrow’s Tulips, and hopefully indicates a desire to branch out to even more ambitious ideas in their coming work.” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F85978979\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":42640293,"name":"Default","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123711051/-/tumblr_inline_mmibrh8ctx1qz4rgp.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123711051/-/tumblr_inline_mmibrh8ctx1qz4rgp.jpg","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":160338,"name":"BURGER Records","permalink":"burger-records","url":"/artist/burger-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"},{"id":6955896,"name":"NEW RELEASES","permalink":"new-releases","url":"/category/new-releases"},{"id":6367632,"name":"FAVOURITE RECORDS OF 2013","permalink":"favourite-records-of-2013","url":"/category/favourite-records-of-2013"}]},{"id":7226241,"name":"ALUMINUM KNOT EYE - Trunk Lunker LP","permalink":"aluminum-knot-eye-trunk-lunker-lp","position":41,"price":19.99,"default_price":19.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/aluminum-knot-eye-trunk-lunker-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-12T16:30:24.000Z","description":"ALUMINUM KNOT EYE - ‘Trunk Lunker' LP.

The lyrics are as menacing as Big Black’s “Kerosene” and delivered with an abject snotty vitriol generally reserved for the face of someone into which you are about to spit. “Wot I Say” could be a variation of the A-side with rapid-fire drum fills and similarly executed guitar leads. I put this in league with the Golden Boys stellar “Whiskey Before Sleep” from a couple years ago. Their Slovenly single was pretty great, but Ape City R&B shows us their next level shit on this release.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=526764424/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e32c14/notracklist=true/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://latidarecords.bandcamp.com/album/fire-starter-wot-i-say-7-ltdr004\">Fire Starter/Wot I Say 7&#39;&#39; (LTDR004) by Ape City R&amp;B</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":23570461,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89474066/-/apecity-cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89474066/-/apecity-cover.jpg","width":394,"height":395}],"artists":[{"id":143961,"name":"LA-DI-DA Records","permalink":"la-di-da-records","url":"/artist/la-di-da-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687793,"name":"7\" VINYLS","permalink":"7-vinyls","url":"/category/7-vinyls"}]},{"id":8488623,"name":"AUDACITY - Mellow Cruisers LP","permalink":"audacity-mellow-cruisers-lp","position":44,"price":19.99,"default_price":19.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/audacity-mellow-cruisers-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-11T11:54:23.000Z","description":"Love this record. Elements of Born Innocent Redd Kross plus others highly recommend.\r\nAudacity is Orange County’s latest proof that California’s the place to be. This fresh-faced Fullerton four piece has roots that stretch back to elementary school. That sense of lifelong camaraderie comes across in their buoyant take on the classic power punk sound. Bouncy slacker pop is always an appropriate soundtrack for a warm West Coast spring night.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/u4CPqgKyKIs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nFormed when they were only 14 years old, the members of Audacity connect with a musical lineage that stretches back about as far as their ages combined. The music invokes trails of Todd Rundgren’s A Wizard, A True Star, as well as the best work of the Modern Lovers. Twisting in those influences with geographic touchstones like the Descendents and the Adolescents, Audacity crafts tunes that trade in hooks and fun amidst a rush of volume and youthful enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nDeflowered and inspired by Anaheim’s Thee Makeout Party, Audacity are putting in the effort on the road to make a name for themselves. They’re asserting their place among power pop peers like Nobunny and Atlanta’s Gentleman Jesse and His Men. Audacity is evidence that suburban sprawl combined with a little sun and surf can make for fantastic results.\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3783327664/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e32c14/notracklist=true/t=1/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://audacityca.bandcamp.com/album/mellow-cruisers\">Mellow Cruisers by AUDACITY</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":26685516,"name":"Default","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/83488485/-/AUDACITY_ITUNES_COVER.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/83488485/-/AUDACITY_ITUNES_COVER.jpg","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":160338,"name":"BURGER Records","permalink":"burger-records","url":"/artist/burger-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"},{"id":5253210,"name":"FAVOURITE RECORDS OF 2012","permalink":"favourite-records-of-2012","url":"/category/favourite-records-of-2012"}]},{"id":10322164,"name":"AUDACITY - Finders Keepers 7\"","permalink":"audacity-finders-keepers","position":45,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/audacity-finders-keepers","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-03T11:19:22.000Z","description":"New 7\" and a very limited amount in soon.\r\nA-side Finder Keepers\r\nB-side Onomatopoeia\r\nOn Suicide Squeeze\r\nDouble A-side killer OC band.\r\nFirst pressing limited to 500 copies! There’s a common-held notion that great rock music only comes out of big cities, as if the grime and struggle of life in urban spaces is the essential fuel for truly passionate rock n roll. But this was a belief when cities were emptying out and the suburbs were growing. Now we’re witnessing the repopulation of major metropolitan areas. Suburbs are becoming the new wasteland. Perhaps that’s the reason why the Orange County suburb of Fullerton was finally able to birth a band like Audacity. Nurtured by local garage rock havens like record store/label Burger Records, the young brash power pop of Audacity kick out jams that are both aptly sunny and gritty—a perfect blend of SoCal’s good weather and endless concrete. With two LPs under the young four-piece’s belt, they’ve set aside two songs for a 7” on Suicide Squeeze before they unleash another full-length later this year. For the uninitiated, “Finders Keepers” b/w “Onomatopoeia” is the perfect introduction to Audacity’s potent combination of pop melodies and roughly hewn energy. The first pressing of this 7” is limited to 500 copies on translucent green vinyl as well as being available digitally worldwide.\r\n\r\nIncludes a coupon for a free digital download of the single in MP3 format.\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=129717561/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e32c14/notracklist=true/t=1/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://suicidesqueeze.bandcamp.com/album/finders-keepers\">Finders Keepers by Audacity</a></iframe>\r\n","options":[{"id":32313460,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/101437888/-/3044266627-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/101437888/-/3044266627-1.jpg","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":160335,"name":"VARIOUS LABELS","permalink":"various-labels","url":"/artist/various-labels"}],"categories":[{"id":3687793,"name":"7\" VINYLS","permalink":"7-vinyls","url":"/category/7-vinyls"},{"id":6367632,"name":"FAVOURITE RECORDS OF 2013","permalink":"favourite-records-of-2013","url":"/category/favourite-records-of-2013"},{"id":5253093,"name":"STAFF PICKS","permalink":"staff-picks","url":"/category/staff-picks"}]},{"id":7457407,"name":"THE BALLANTYNES - Misery 7\" ","permalink":"the-ballantynes-misery-7","position":46,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-ballantynes-misery-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-05T16:38:44.000Z","description":"Ballantynes: Misery/Stay - Two new tracks from this soul seven piece with dual drums! “Misery” can be related to the months of rain they get here in Vancouver while “Stay” can get a little romantic… Get on the floor baby!

These songs scream about lousy jobs, barely having enough money to make your mortgage payments, paying for prescriptions, having the electricity shut off when you can’t pay the bill etc. On this album, instead of going for any sort of slick sound, things sound rougher. Especially with the vocals. To my ears they sound cruder and that’s meant in the most positive sense of the word since it really enhances Gabby’s larynx-shredding utterings. There’s an abundance of go-for-the-throat thrash and other climactic elements as well. The circle-pit inducing breakdown of \"Another Wave\" is one such moment. So is the stop/start thrash of \"its Always Darkest After Shutoff,\" interspersing guitar and bass atonalities, if that’s the right term. Everything comes to a screeching halt for the final cut, \"A Bird In The Hand Means You’ve Been Dead For A Few Days\" and it’s a slower, desperate-droning song, building up and then slowing down as the guitars mimic the sound of something/someone barely clinging to life before it abruptly ends. Think of the album as a cautionary tale and, as Black Flag sang on \"Depression\" all those years ago, \"they say things are gonna get better—all I know is THEY BETTER.\" ‘Swallowed By The World’ may not make you feel better but it’s still some damned good scream therapy.\"","options":[{"id":40217991,"name":"Default","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/83483823/-/Billbondsmen.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/83483823/-/Billbondsmen.gif","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":139683,"name":"DEAD BEAT Records","permalink":"dead-beat-records","url":"/artist/dead-beat-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"}]},{"id":7226475,"name":"BIRTH - Self Titled LP","permalink":"birth-self-titled-lp","position":49,"price":19.99,"default_price":19.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/birth-self-titled-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-12T16:59:13.000Z","description":"BIRTH- S/T LP.

Remember those days when Rock & Roll ran through the veins of the bands that played it.  Well you don't have to remember those days any more thanks to Rock N Roll heathens the Black Jetts.  Situated deep below the glitz and glamour of the Las Vegas strip, lie these 4 mopped haired rockers. These fellas have been around for a few years now creating quite a commotion in and around Sin City.  With the undaunting drive the Black Jetts had to create the epic debut, 'Bleed Me' offers 11 killer rippers including a cool cover of the Who’s ‘Leavin Here’.   In 2 seperate recording sessions the Black Jetts definately captured something. You can just hear a band totally busting at the seems playing their hearts out for only a few mics and an 8 track recorder.\r\n\r\nYou can really hear something fresh in these 11 tracks.   First and foremost originality, but on top of that these songs really have soul. In the same way that many people say that Thunders spoke with his guitar without saying a word, the Black Jetts exude that same raw, energetic intensity. Just check out songs like ‘Rehab Love’, ‘Cheap Date’ and the incredibly moody ‘Hangin’ Around.’ They just exude heart and soul rock n roll that you can feel.  And the Black Jetts are definately one of the better bands out there playing that stripped down n dirty early Detroit style rock n roll.

The LP, which builds on the foundation of a demo and two 7\"s, includes a different mix of the recent single \"Frozen Rain.\"\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=826000357/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e32c14/notracklist=true/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://bloodygears.bandcamp.com/album/landscapes-of-disease\">Landscapes of Disease by Bloody Gears</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":22886867,"name":"Default","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89475050/-/BLOODYGEARS_lp_jacketweb.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89475050/-/BLOODYGEARS_lp_jacketweb.jpg","width":394,"height":396}],"artists":[{"id":139689,"name":"DERANGED Records","permalink":"deranged-records","url":"/artist/deranged-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"},{"id":5253210,"name":"FAVOURITE RECORDS OF 2012","permalink":"favourite-records-of-2012","url":"/category/favourite-records-of-2012"},{"id":5253093,"name":"STAFF PICKS","permalink":"staff-picks","url":"/category/staff-picks"}]},{"id":8488074,"name":"BRAIN TUMORS - Self Titled LP","permalink":"brain-tumors-self-titled-lp","position":54,"price":19.99,"default_price":19.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/brain-tumors-self-titled-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-11T11:16:23.000Z","description":"Minneapolis degenerates BRAIN TUMORS spit back with another angry ripper.

CORY draws influences from past experiences and daily life.

A past where he isn't afraid to open up about his highs and lows all the while presenting a very creative, intricate musical back drop where CORY CASE comes off sounding more like a musical colleague to his mentors; than a fan.  I don't know how else to say it, but that  their really is something special about the way CORY CASE writes.  And that special something only comes from years and years of listening to, absorbing and playing music.  His music really stands on it's own and his lifes passion to his work, illustriously shines through on ‘Waiting On A Remedy'.  CD includes the bonus track ‘It'll Be Alright', which is one of CORY's most requested live songs.

Every once in a while band will come out of nowhere and just flat out knocks you on your ass. CELLOS are definitely one of those bands. Stewing in the same sludgey, riff infected cesspool as mid to late 90's heavy hitters like Karp, Unwound, Godheadsilo and Unsane; this Windsor, Ontario three-piece write some of the most punishingly awesome tunes you'll ever hear. This is harsh, destructive music where warm, fuzzy riffs are king and loud, noisy feedback is lauded as they melt, slice, and demolish each song into acute ear fucking precision. Nods to the Melvins and Black Sabbath are pretty much essential as foundational purveyors in the genre. And CELLOS fit right in with the above mentioned artists as a band that's pushing the boundaries of extremely heavy music, one crudely bashed low-end hit at a time. Really can't recommend this one enough. Great LP right here. \r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=732545366/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e32c14/notracklist=true/t=2/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://cellos.bandcamp.com/album/bomb-shelter\">Bomb Shelter by Cellos</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":22885097,"name":"Default","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89479214/-/4122077636-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89479214/-/4122077636-1.jpg","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":139683,"name":"DEAD BEAT Records","permalink":"dead-beat-records","url":"/artist/dead-beat-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"},{"id":5253210,"name":"FAVOURITE RECORDS OF 2012","permalink":"favourite-records-of-2012","url":"/category/favourite-records-of-2012"}]},{"id":11105133,"name":"CHAINS OF LOVE - Strange Grey Days LP","permalink":"chains-of-love-strange-grey-days-lp","position":67,"price":19.99,"default_price":19.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/chains-of-love-strange-grey-days-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-12T08:04:22.000Z","description":"Chains of Love started when Guitarist Felix Fung, the engineer and owner of Vancouver’s Little Red Sound, hatched a plan to start a girl group with Nathalia Pizarro, who shares the vocal and lyrical duties of the band. Nathalia was known as one of the best singers and all around performers on the scene, and with her voice and the harmonic help of Aileen Bryant, Felix knew that they had something truly amazing on their hands. They had what they call a “memory of that girl group sound” and a free studio on Tuesday afternoons, so they started inviting their friends over to see what they could make of this fortuitous combination. What you have in your headphones is what came of these nostalgic happenings, Spector harmonies, Motown bass lines and rich, thumping drums.\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/CZAGOdu_3Us\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n \r\nWhat sets Chains of Love apart from their throwback-y, reverb-drenched contemporaries is something in the philosophy behind the band. Chains of Love is truly a passion project—a group of musicians doing nothing what but they love and working as hard as they can at it. Chains started by referencing certain artists such as Gail Harris, Ike & Tina, The Ronnettes, and The Shangri-la's by using their lo-fi recording styles as a blueprint for what they wanted to create. By combining this with modern, garage rock influenced, modern viewpoint, Chains of love has effectively bridged the gap between the nostalgic pop sounds of the 60's with a modern and elegant twist.\r\n THIS IS A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED RECORD\r\nWIth download code\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1793886551/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e32c14/notracklist=true/t=4/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://chainsoflove.bandcamp.com/album/strange-grey-days\">Strange Grey Days by Chains Of Love</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":34935252,"name":"Default","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109213641/-/2846127493-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109213641/-/2846127493-1.jpg","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":160335,"name":"VARIOUS LABELS","permalink":"various-labels","url":"/artist/various-labels"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"},{"id":5253210,"name":"FAVOURITE RECORDS OF 2012","permalink":"favourite-records-of-2012","url":"/category/favourite-records-of-2012"},{"id":5253093,"name":"STAFF PICKS","permalink":"staff-picks","url":"/category/staff-picks"}]},{"id":7226609,"name":"THE CHENIERS - Trouble 7\" EP","permalink":"the-cheniers-trouble-7-ep","position":68,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-cheniers-trouble-7-ep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-12T17:18:38.000Z","description":"“Here Comes Trouble,” in which the Cheniers sound exactly like what they are—a band in a room, in this case pushing through a simple, catchy rock song in the vein of the Fall.

This was all happening in Detroit during the punk rock explosion where Nikki would see herself sharing the stage with The Ramones, Johnny Thunders, The Romantics and many more. Up until then she had acquired a pretty decent rock and roll education by attending MC5 and Stooges gigs and by being on the road with The New York Dolls. By 1980 the band name was changed to Nikki and the Corvettes, a band name that would become synonymous with being the template for many female fronted punk groups to come. They would release their notable debut album on BOMP! Records, an incredible mixture of 60's style girl group vocals, twangy guitars and teenage pop with plenty of punk rock attitude, with songs about cruisin’ for boys and having fun. The album and band would influence everyone from The Go-Go's (to go for more of a \"pop\" sound) all the way to The Donnas (see the lyric \"I wanna be like Nikki Corvette\" from Gimmie My Radio), and around the world to Japan with The 5678's. The album has consistently stayed in print and by the early to mid 90's bands began to record and release cover versions of the classic Corvette tunes. The new interest drummed up by the second generation of Corvette fans prompted BOMP! to re-release the album on CD in 2000 and include some of the early singles. This success prompted Nikki to return to the stage with a new band and go on to record a new 45 single Love Me / Whats On My Mind , which received rave reviews. Once the world heard that Nikki Corvette was back the demands poured in. Since her return in 2001, Nikki has several singles,an EP, 3 Japan only releases and the \"Back To Detroit\" album, a mixture of classic Nikki and the Corvettes sound and all of the great powerpop and punk rock that preceded it and that it inspired. She has toured Japan 4 times, Europe twice, played an all girl festival with Ronnie Spector, The 5678s and toured as Blondie's opening act still retaining that high energy rock and roll!\r\nIn 2012, Nikki wanted to return to Europe and contacted Franz Barcella from Otis Tours to book the shows. He also put together an Italian back up band for the tour consisting of Herve Peroncini (The Peawees) on guitar and himself and brother Bruno (Miss Chain and The Broken Heels) on bass and drums. Nikki and the band had one day to rehearse before the tour started and it was magical from the start. Every show was better then the last as the band got tighter and by the 3rd day Nikki was inspired enough to write for/about them called 'Rockin' Romeos'. Herve immediately wrote music for it and it was soon part of the set. As the band evolved and developed their own sound and style it became obvious that this was something special and Nikki Corvette and The Romeos were born. Nikki and Herve have continued writing songs and the band has just recorded their first single 'Rockin' Romeos/He's Gone' to be released in April to coincide with their next tour. They are currently working on tours of Japan and Australia as well as the recording of their first album and more, look out world, here come Nikki Corvette and The Romeos!  \r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1653424366/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e32c14/notracklist=true/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://nikkicorvetteandtheromeos.bandcamp.com/album/hes-gone-rockinromeos\">He&#39;s Gone/ Rockin&#39;Romeos by Nikki Corvette And The Romeos</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":35527254,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111020709/-/a0304393655_10.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111020709/-/a0304393655_10.jpg","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":160335,"name":"VARIOUS LABELS","permalink":"various-labels","url":"/artist/various-labels"}],"categories":[{"id":3687793,"name":"7\" VINYLS","permalink":"7-vinyls","url":"/category/7-vinyls"},{"id":6367632,"name":"FAVOURITE RECORDS OF 2013","permalink":"favourite-records-of-2013","url":"/category/favourite-records-of-2013"},{"id":5253093,"name":"STAFF PICKS","permalink":"staff-picks","url":"/category/staff-picks"}]},{"id":12341358,"name":"COSMONAUTS - Persona Non Grata LP ","permalink":"cosmonauts-persona-non-grata-lp","position":71,"price":19.99,"default_price":19.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cosmonauts-persona-non-grata-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-13T04:21:31.000Z","description":"Reverb heavy Brit-pop inspired psychedelic awesomeness.

Cut from the same treble-tattered cloth as greats like the Cramps, Gene Vincent, Thee Headcoats and The Oblivians; The CREEPING IVIES seamlessly mesh stripped down 50's Rock N Roll, Swampy Blues, R&B and raw, unbridled Garage Punk into their own depraved, cauldron of Riff N Roll supremacy.  With torn-toms, shredded guitars, and hauntingly carnal Blues howled vox, The CREEPING IVIES dish out a primitive dose of mutated Rock N Roll that works.  Cathartic, hot-wired, fuzz heavy filth from this feisty, ferocious two-some.

Full length in the works for 2013. Three new moody hardcore tracks. It used to be easy to describe Criminal Code. From the onset, they came across as straightforward sounding mid 80s Midwest hardcore styled three piece with Taiga on guitar Andrew handling the basslines. Hook filled and moodily earnest, proudly wielding a love for Husker Du. Crim Code quickly became favorites of the Northwest hardcore scene. After a handful of west coast tours and a couple of limited self released rarities, Crim Code added Miles on second guitar and Jawsh on drums.... This is where the comparisons to other acts ends. Having saw them play three times in the past 10 days I can only describe them as themselves. Once in front of a group of black clad doom punks they came off as a tightly wound psychedelic nightmare, as if My Bloody Valentine grew up playing Middle Class covers. The next, in a room filled with knucke dragging skinheads the doomiest pop you could imagine at a deafening level. The third still a pounding set of shouted agit-punk anthems that could have been the best record SST never released. With this, their third vinyl release, and the first for Deranged they continue to push the boundaries of what it means to be a a modern hardcore punk band. Oh yeah, and they aren't from Olympia.\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=62217421/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e32c14/notracklist=true/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://derangedrecords.bandcamp.com/album/criminal-code\">CRIMINAL CODE by CRIMINAL CODE</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":26686167,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/83489817/-/criminal.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/83489817/-/criminal.jpg","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":139689,"name":"DERANGED Records","permalink":"deranged-records","url":"/artist/deranged-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687793,"name":"7\" VINYLS","permalink":"7-vinyls","url":"/category/7-vinyls"}]},{"id":10394344,"name":"CUMSTAIN - Hurry Up & Kill Yourself You Scumbag Trust Me Your Mother Won't Miss U LP","permalink":"cumstain-hurry-up-kill-yourself-you-scumbag-trust-me-your-mother-won-t-miss-u-lp","position":75,"price":19.99,"default_price":19.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cumstain-hurry-up-kill-yourself-you-scumbag-trust-me-your-mother-won-t-miss-u-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-07T04:05:19.000Z","description":"The folks in California have come through with another fine release, this time with Cum Stain's debut album 'Hurry Up and Kill Yourself'.

This is old school, straight-up party music. The only thing better than listening to this album at a party (nighttime, outside, backyard, torches to ward off mosquitoes) would be having the band actually play live at your party.\r\n\r\nThis isn’t sitting alone in your bedroom, poring over the lyric sheet music; if you want clearly enunciated lyrics, Can’t Get No is not for you. However, as befits their sound, the lyrics on Can’t Get No are all about the ennui of youth: love, drugs, booze, and heartbreak. Who could resist lines like “I wanna hold you/Tonight instead of the phone”? Not me.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/jRvafTLpLDE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nThere are fuzzy, feedbacked vocals and guitars, plus tambourines and organs (think Hammond, not Bach). There’s even some awesome honky tonk piano in “You Don’t Belong” and “B.A.D.”\r\n\r\nEach song boasts a terrific chorus. The one in “I Want You Back” is just the title of the song, but it’s so good it doesn’t need any other lyrics. Although every song is great, the title track, “On Your Own,” and the T.Rexy “Hangin’ in the Alley” are definite standouts.\r\n\r\nDead Ghosts also acknowledges their influences and peers. “Roky Said” references a couple 13th Floor Elevators songs, plus it’s got a wicked two-part chorus, reverbed guitar, and an insanely memorable guitar melody. The instrumental “Tea Swamp Rumble” pays homage to Link Wray’s “Rumble” as well as fellow Vancouverites Nü Sensae’s own tribute to the city’s Tea Swamp Park.\r\n\r\nCan’t Get No is an album full of bona fide summertime jams. It’s only a half-hour long, so put this one on repeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F86020436\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":35326236,"name":"Default","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110455101/-/deadghosts_cantgetno-575x575.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110455101/-/deadghosts_cantgetno-575x575.png","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":160338,"name":"BURGER Records","permalink":"burger-records","url":"/artist/burger-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"},{"id":6367632,"name":"FAVOURITE RECORDS OF 2013","permalink":"favourite-records-of-2013","url":"/category/favourite-records-of-2013"},{"id":5253093,"name":"STAFF PICKS","permalink":"staff-picks","url":"/category/staff-picks"}]},{"id":7226581,"name":"DEAD HOOKERS - The Burial/The Rebirth LP","permalink":"dead-hookers-the-burial-the-rebirth-lp","position":79,"price":19.99,"default_price":19.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dead-hookers-the-burial-the-rebirth-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-12T17:12:22.000Z","description":"DEAD HOOKERS- 'The Burial/The Rebirth' LP.

After 3 mind bending singles, New Haven, CT's premier rockers the ESTROGEN HIGHS are back to give us another upbeat, jangley dose of primitive rock n roll. As the singles can attest, with the ESTROGEN HIGHS, the tunes are never to calculated. The playing is always loose, the ideas are always solid, and the end result is a pretty warbled, sloppy mess that comes together into something raw and unique. And I don't think that happens by accident. Their musical blue print definitely centers around the less is more aestetic, and they drill the point home with with overly catchy riffs bashed intoxicatingly into poppy garage precision. After listening to 'Tell It To Them' you definitely get the sense that each of the four members of the band have a pretty similar idea of what rock n roll is. There are probably more than a few overlapping Yardbirds, Gories, Cheater Slicks, Seeds, Real Kids, Kinks and Stones records in their collections giving them enough of an idyllic musical arsenal to really dish the goods. And dish the goods they do. On 'Tell It To Them', the ESTROGEN HIGHS take that less is more aesthetic and keep it honest, real and catchy by letting the music hammer out their blurry, scuzzy message.  During a time when their definitely seems to be a lull in underground garage bands, it's nice to know that there are still a few killer bands that more than adequately fill the gap.

On FIST CITY's debut album 'Hunting You', they skillfully cross-stitch different eras of punks rich historical landscapes to create mesmerizing brain blobs that are as much intriguing as they are familiar. Theirs a definate late 70's UK DIY aesthetic running through these grooves that resonates throughout the entire album. By fusing the agitated, post punk grit of bands like the Despertate Bicycles and the Raincoats with an acid soaked take on the Vaselines, Shop Assistants downer pop; 'Hunting You' shines through in it's doomy, pop-contaminated bliss. The spaced out vox give the tunes an eerie, almost goth-ey, vibe creating a nice washed out, claustrophobic back drop for the music. And intentional or not, it definitely sounds like FIST CITY have more than a few early 90's riot grrl records in their collective collections. But don't expect any pro-fem messages from the CITY. It's more in their music, as they channel the early 90's cling-clang of bands like Slant 6, Huggy Bear and Bikini Kill that echoes through their trebley, punk brandished scrawlings.

Although, if their latest single on Vancouver/Victoria-based label La Ti Da Records, Buried/Cryptic Transmissions is anything to go by, you might not have guessed that at all.\r\n  The Lethbridge band has dealt in giddy post-punk stompers (their first LP, Hunting You, sounded to this reviewer a little bit like the B-52s and Wire comparing notes over grits and warm beer in someone’s living room), but a laid-back beach-and-surf vibe has washed over them as of late, and the Buried/Cryptic Transmissions split reflects this tendency.    “Buried” is practically built around its opening riff, a prototypical, Dick Dale-indebted vamp which plays peek-a-boo with lead singer Kier Griffith’s droll vocals. “Cryptic Transmissions” is angular and loping post-punk, and straightforward stuff (perhaps too straightforward).\r\n  At any rate, whether or not you think they’ve bitten off more than they could chew, it’s undeniable that Fist City and their ilk are making their town one that you’d best not detour around.\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0;

You can practically see the records that tattered the floors of each of the members of the FORBIDDEN TIGERS when they were growin up.  Gun Club, The Saints, Jon Spencer, ‘68 Comeback, Rolling Stones, Lightnin Hopkins, James Brown and The Scientists were certainly records strewn amongst the floor right  next to their balled up home made T Shirts emblazoned with the words: REATARDS, SPACESHITS, REIGNING SOUND and GORIES written in faded black magic marker.  On ‘Magnetic Problems’ the FORBIDDEN TIGERS bash out 12 tracks with precise, acuracy all the while sounding pretty care free and unrehearsed.  ‘Son Of A Carnivore’ and ‘Forbidden Tigers’ certainly stand out as two tracks that aim to maim.  They completely nail the fast n hard approach and the mid-fi recording perfectly accentuates the fierce, decimating, guitar tones.  The rhythm track alone on ‘Forbidden Tigers’ is pure perfection and brings to mind an early GG pickin away in the basement with a cig hangin off his lip and a spilled bottle of Jim Bean on the floor.  Just pure reckless, care free rock n roll that grabs your ear drums and doesn’t let go.  But the entire album isn’t a whirl-wind of noise, feedback and distortion.  The majority of ‘Magnetic Problems’ contains a pleasant mish-mash of mid tempo, blues amped, rock n ravers all tied together with the loose, raspy baritone howl of what sounds like the ghost of Jeffrey Lee Pierce.   From the Black Lips gone country twang of ‘Can of Beans’ to the neo primativee Gories clatter of ‘Magnetic Problems’, they cover alot of ground on their debut and certainly strum, pluck, beat and scream like the best of their mentors.  It’s nice to see such a young new band write a solid album and not fall into the standard new band, riff-rip trappings of most bands their age.

You may ask if there is some kind of plan behind all of this. Well, of course not. Or maybe thats the plan. I guess its just like the five guys who call themselves INDIAN WARS persue a \"plan\" that is to stick together, write, play and record outstanding songs and release records on small labels like BACHELOR.  This here is the third slab of vinyl we put out on our imprint, and we are so glad to have the possibility to work with them! It started several years ago when we heard the track \"If you want me\", which turned us into releases the debut 7\" back in 2009.\r\nAfter their very successful first full lenght released in 2011, \"Walk around the park\" they soon had new ideas, new songs, and tried them on live audience around their hombase, Vancouver, BC, Canada.   They booked a studio to record their sophomore album in just one night, in the wee hours, when the rate is cheap, with hardly any overdubs and with live vocals. Beside of their instruments, skill and musicianship they also\r\n\r\nused alcohol to finish this epic album, at least this is what I think of when I'm listening to the songs... The music is quite diverse, you can take a journey through roots country, rock and roll and garage punk-eske songs, but it still sounds very homogenous in its entirety.

More out of curiosity than anything, I got hold of their Inconvenient Dreams mini-album, but I’ve had it on – loudly -  at least once a day ever since.\r\nAs a brief introduction, Jail Weddings are essentially a dirty Polyphonic Spree with a love of Berry Gordy, a tatooed and badly-behaved congregation of many parts, making a motowny, Spector-ish racket that’s distinctly Los Angeles, wide-eyed and in thrall to its forebears, but dressing and talking like its peers. A twitchy and mesmerising Hollywood-based Glasvegas if you like, or a1950s Distillers. Wait, neither of them sound as good as I meant to – let’s start again.\r\nBasically, having spun through this one more than a few times now, I’m still hearing stuff I love in here – Mekons, Spector, Ronnettes, Springsteen, but the more I listen to it, the more I get the feeling it’s the soundtrack to the noir-est of all Chandler novels that never got made into a film. It’s like it fell straight off the silverest of screens, and it’s so rich and velvety and filling it should come with a packet of Rennie.\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/4-ZmOiidxPg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nFrom the opening jangles of ‘Cheat On Your New Lover With Me’ – which may just be the best opening track for a wedding disco of all time – right through to the last line of the final track ‘I Am Fucking Crazy’ (“And now that you know, what are you going to do?“), it’s imaginative, evocative, and a flat-out great time from top to bottom.

A shadow has been cast over the fleeting Utopia of modern love, where we still wear such out of date traditions as marriage and monogamy like shackles on a chain gang. Who better to have cast this shadow then Jail Weddings – a soul-stricken modern day “Wall Of Sound” rock and roll behemoth, comprised of ten (yes, 10) grown men and women who at least have the guts to admit they have still have the emotional stability of an eternally wounded teenager?!?! \r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/VvfUyBp17_M\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n\r\nSure the 60’s pool they may siphon from, but do not confuse Jail Weddings as any kind of mere throwback act. The sphere of influence is vast, from the grandiose Scott Walker-esque soundscape of the album’s existential opener “How Am I Alive?” to the E-Street Band gone to Hell epic “I Thought You Were Someone I Knew”, to the Sparks meets Meatloaf bombastic melodrama of “What Did You Do With My Gun?”, the band proves its sound is unique as it is limitless. \r\n\r\nEven somewhat theatrical in its scope, Love Is Lawless is sprinkled with moments of quieter reprieve as well, with Hart’s folksy “One Of These Days?” where he and his vocal bookends (Katya Hubiak and Jada Wagensomer) simply gather around one single acoustic guitar. “Eavesdroppin’ finds Hart and band arranger Brad Caulkins (of LA based band Fool’s Gold) drunken busking free-jazz under a brooding vocal, before the impending “Staring At The Stars” suddenly sneaks up from beneath, making the album explode back into high gear till it’s unnerving, determined conclusion “The Impossible”.\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3866189433/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e32c14/notracklist=true/t=3/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://jailweddings.bandcamp.com/album/love-is-lawless\">Love Is Lawless by Jail Weddings</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":23569363,"name":"Default","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89471174/-/1293664239_515111515151.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89471174/-/1293664239_515111515151.jpg","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":160335,"name":"VARIOUS LABELS","permalink":"various-labels","url":"/artist/various-labels"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"}]},{"id":7457301,"name":"JAIL WEDDINGS - Four Future Standards EP RED VINYL ","permalink":"jail-weddings-four-future-standards","position":118,"price":19.99,"default_price":19.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/jail-weddings-four-future-standards","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-05T16:17:09.000Z","description":"If they aren’t L.A.’s biggest band, Jail Weddings definitely have L.A.’s biggest sound—an nine-person-deep rock ‘n’ soul revue that feels like the Pogues as produced by Phil Spector, a soundtrack to a Hollywood-gone-Babylon left unloved and unexplored since the last notes of X’ Los Angeles LP. Their 2010 full-length Love Is Lawless was gigantic, the kind of thing that should be a film (directed by Billy Wilder) but becomes an album instead. L.A. Weekly correctly called it “a big, fine mess of weepy, quavering, hiccupy hurtin’ hurt, plowed through with a way-tough punk rock theatricality and welcome good humor,” and a lovestruck reporter for Seattle’s Stranger reported that “Jail Weddings songs sound the way the band looks: huge, soulful, and swaggering, taut and unpredictable as a cat.” \r\n\r\nNow Jail Weddings return with a leaner line-up and a new EP called Four Future Standards, releasing on the formidable new Neurotic Yell label. Recorded through the fall and winter of 2011-2012 by Mark Rains (Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Waylon Jennings), Four Future Standards reinforces frontman-architect-drill sergeant-and-mad-genius (oh, and singer) Gabriel Hart and his returning core members Jada Wagensomer (vocals), Hannah Blumenfeld (violin) and Josh Puklavetz (bass) with drums by Mike Shelbourn, keys by L.A. stalwart Marty Sataman and guitar by Chris Rager. And Standards also sees the welcome debut of a full Stax-style backline with sequin-clad singers Mary Animaux (White Murder) and Kristina Benson (Red Onions, Flash Express.) \r\n\r\n“I wanted to start a band that blurred the lines of fantasy and reality, that collectively lived the lyrics, a band that would end up being a lifestyle all its own and turn the lives of the members into a goddamn musical, even if we were the only ones that knew it,” says Hart. And this time, the songs (in a way) are all love songs, he explains—the raging Scott Walker-meets-Ziggy Stardust cabaret rocker “Overnight,” or the collision of Gun Club guitar and Shangri-Las melodrama that lets “Good Book” make death into the break-up to end all bitter break-ups, or the punked-up Del Shannon-style story of regret and revelation in “Red Light Rhythm.” Or especially “(There’s Nothing Worse In The World Than A) Crying Girl,” an unflinching last-call operetta that could have been written by Warren Zevon, produced by Nick Cave and recorded by Roy Orbison … but only after a bleary night playing Iggy Pop’s “Turn Blue” until the needle gave out in a wisp of smoke. In these four songs are love as sickness, love as delusion, love as warning, love as righted wrong or wronged right—even love as total helplessness before impending doom, as seen through the lens of an upturned bottle. \r\n\r\nThere’s an arc to this whole story you may recognize—first Love Is Lawless’ glorious full-bore exhilaration and now Four Future Standards’ collision between hope and hopelessness, and next of course comes the comedown, with a scheduled album tentatively titled Meltdown that Hart says is the most doomed-feeling album his band has ever made. (“Anyone that thought they were a party band will be greatly mistaken after hearing it,” he warns.) But that’s not something to worry about now—Four Future Standards is a set of songs for the time between midnight and six, when it feels like you could close the door and make the night last forever\r\nRED VINYL with DOWNLOAD CODE\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3455679847/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e32c14/notracklist=true/t=3/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://jailweddings.bandcamp.com/album/four-future-standards\">Four Future Standards by Jail Weddings</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":51041685,"name":"Default","price":19.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89471330/-/3824827596-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89471330/-/3824827596-1.jpg","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":160335,"name":"VARIOUS LABELS","permalink":"various-labels","url":"/artist/various-labels"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"}]},{"id":7457343,"name":"JAIL WEDDINGS - It Was Nice To Be Loved 7\"","permalink":"jail-weddings-it-was-nice-to-be-loved-7","position":119,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/jail-weddings-it-was-nice-to-be-loved-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-05T16:26:06.000Z","description":"It Was Nice To Be Loved backed with Digan Lo Que Digan (originally performed by Raphael).

Even for me, I don't remember writing the songs and I barely remember recording them. I do know that they came from the purest part of my heart and they were made with a mischievous little smile on my face.\r\n\r\nI think it was 2006. I recorded mostly late at night, in a giant dirty ballroom called Vegetable Street, in my hometown of Brattleboro, Vermont. My days were filled with endless cups of Mocha Joe's coffee, black, sitting on the stoop with my friends, and spazzing out on my guitar. Looking down at the streets of Brattleboro below and out at Mount Wantastiquet and beyond. I didn't have a cell phone or a computer and the only way to find me was either to call my mom, Lil' Smashy, who was probably already too busy cooking me something really delicious, or spot me in the corner of the coffee shop spying on people and drawing them in my sketchbook. They were very chill times.\r\n\r\nI wanted Was Dead to be a pure Vermont Rock and Roll record, fueled by extra sharp Cabot cheddar cheese and hot, grade-A fancy maple syrup poured over crisp white snow and served with a pickle and a cider donut. You sit down on the shitty concrete in the parking lot and you slurp it all up. I had already made a few King Tuff albums in the early 2000's and had laid the project to rest around 2003. But something told me to resurrect King Tuff, hence the title Was Dead.\r\n\r\nThis album changed my life in so many ways, as it slowly trickled out into the world. I never expected anyone to hear it, let alone connect with it. I never would have left Vermont, never met the boys at Burger Records or any of the other insane, beautiful, cartoonish characters that now populate my life in the best way. It’s an expression of my infinitely teenage heart and soul, and I'm really proud of it. So here it is again, thanks to Burger Records. These songs belong to the Strutters and the Stutterers, the Headbangers and the Stoop Hangers, the Ruthies and the Gold Toothies, and of course, the A-N-I-M-A-L-S...\r\n\r\nWas Dead is reanimated on April 30th, 2013 via Burger Records.\r\nOUT APRIL 30th\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F87172519&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":30058885,"name":"Default","price":29.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94407439/-/Was_Dead_Cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94407439/-/Was_Dead_Cover.jpg","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":160338,"name":"BURGER Records","permalink":"burger-records","url":"/artist/burger-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"},{"id":5253093,"name":"STAFF PICKS","permalink":"staff-picks","url":"/category/staff-picks"}]},{"id":11542014,"name":"KNIFE FIGHT - Self Titled 7\"","permalink":"knife-fight-self-titled-7","position":126,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/knife-fight-self-titled-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-03T07:38:30.000Z","description":"This New Zealand-based group conjures up images from my mind that are just plain fucked.

A torn piece by fuzzed-out that will crush in every second the few neurons, which already will have, and I am speaking simply of the opening theme, that title also this EP.\r\n\"Gotta Talk About\" and \"Hang Around\" are two of the four songs present in the second EP, and if the first is primitive, and can easily be part of any collection of \"Girls In The Garage\", the second tear everything fuzz and bumps battery that look more like a heart beat of a tired horse.\r\nBoth \"The White Out\" and \"Drugstore\" show that there are no double meanings, not loud and no doubt always, always what is easiest or so it seems, will always be the best.\r\nYou guys are in the presence of two records simply unique and fantastics.

Two years of relentless touring and personal change. Miss Chain was then singing about being 25 years old and the bittersweet thoughts and preoccupations that come with such an age. Now, two years later, the girl has become a woman: this journey has finally seen the light of dawn, it has changed its nature, turned into a rite of passage.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/0lwYbb8EpgE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n\r\n Her thoughts have become a stream of introspection that is equal parts light and darkness, reason and spirituality, demons and hopes. Following this transformation, the music itself has changed, pushing the melodies beyond the usual rock ’n’roll/garage blueprint, such as we were used to.   “The Dawn” stems from the common effort of the band together with producer Pierluigi Ballarin (The R’s) at T.U.P. Studio in Brescia (Italy). Two weeks of live recordings on tape to capture the joy of experimenting in a studio yielded a perfect blend of warm, thick and surrounding sound: it is a complex record that deploys a vast array of sounds, so deep that sometimes you find yourself drifting away with your eyes closed, totally immersed in a mixture of country, rhythm’n’blues, pop and Beatles-esque melodies, surrounded by dreamy landscapes, sometimes even bordering on psychedelia.\r\nReferences to Sixties melodies and sunshine pop are the ideal framing for a record whose sound and content is at the same moment timeless and steeped in the contemporary, the soundtrack to an internal journey which contemplates life and its baggage but it’s not afraid of its dark corners.   It will be an intense 2013 for Astrid, Silva, Franz and Brown: USA, Canada, Japan are waiting for them at the end of the summer, while starting in March they will travel extensively through Italy and Europe to promote their new record in the best way they can: by being on a stage, in front of their audience, spreading their energy through their music and, even if for a little while, taking you along for the ride. \r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2919387868/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e32c14/notracklist=true/t=6/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://misschainandthebrokenheels.bandcamp.com/album/the-dawn\">The Dawn by Miss Chain &amp; The Broken Heels</a></iframe>\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":30982597,"name":"Default","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/97308907/-/mctbh_sleeve_front.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/97308907/-/mctbh_sleeve_front.jpg","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":183928,"name":"BACHELOR Records","permalink":"bachelor-records","url":"/artist/bachelor-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"},{"id":6367632,"name":"FAVOURITE RECORDS OF 2013","permalink":"favourite-records-of-2013","url":"/category/favourite-records-of-2013"},{"id":5253093,"name":"STAFF PICKS","permalink":"staff-picks","url":"/category/staff-picks"}]},{"id":7458051,"name":"MMOSS -\"I\" LP ","permalink":"mmoss-i-lp","position":143,"price":21.99,"default_price":21.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mmoss-i-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-05T18:11:06.000Z","description":"Psychedelic Rock from New England!!!

The sound is pretty far from the chaotic vehemence of their early works, it has more in common with the intense, touching, dark atmospheres of songwriters like Nick Cave, Neil Young and Leonard Cohen with a little twist of frisky rhythm n blues. \r\nA long tale in William Faulkner's style told in ten songs, a long journey where ancestral rites and religious superstitions take place, around three main characters: a stranger, a priest and a farmer. “Son of the dust” is a man trying to defeat the drought, in the landscape of a country village, surrounded by ancient legends and traditions, opposing pagan rites to the fear of divine punishment. \r\nRecords like this are musical movies of the mind, records the listener must decipher and make his own.

Myelin Sheaths have crafted their own blend of “Weird Canada” punk and fuzzy garage pop that explodes when it hits your ears. The Sheaths hook you in right away with the opener instrumental track “Gloves” which quickly rips into “Mutations” with a Mummies style organ groove and sets the tone for the rest of the record. Stand out tracks “Everything is Contagious” and “Half- Wit” will become instant classics after a few spins, but you will quickly be knocked on your ass by songs “Do The Mental Shake” and “Dissektor” showing you just how punk this band can be. Blown out production, surfy guitar leads, pounding drums, and a spot on combo of female/male vocals is the perfect concoction to make this a great punk record.

Fuzzy, bopping garage rock that sounds pretty much like all those great bands that came out of the Southwest in the mid-‘90s like the Drags, the Inhalants, Cryin’ Out Louds and the Motards. It may seem like a disservice to simply compare them to so many other bands, but with this record it totally fits. It’s awesome to know that bands are still playing this kind of simple, straightforward punk rock with those catchy guitar parts that just rip yer face off.

In my own defense as said “newspaper man”, it’s my job to talk about what kind of dudes they are, and I’d say they’re rock ‘n’ rollers who want some cash, sex, and weed (and I’d be right, as that first track freely admits to all of the above).\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/nwzYM4U_OtU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\nNatural Child is the latest in a line of Nashville-based garage rock acts that includes JEFF the Brotherhood and PUJOL, but Natural Child has the distinction of being the sleaziest of the bunch. Their sleaze is an earnest sleaze— blues-rock in the vein of Beggars Banquet-era Rolling Stones, played with the sloppy grit of garage outfits such as the Oblivians. Hard in Heaven is Natural Child’s third LP (their second of 2012) and their most entertaining selection of songs to date.\r\n\r\nMurray and Traylor share the mic, shouting in harmony about the curves of a husky-yet-irresistible woman (“Rock Bottom”), hiding weed in their mouths while talking to a highway patrolman (“Let the Good Times Roll”), and “searching for a certain kind of high” (“Blind Owl Speaks”). Natural Child sings about drugs a lot. In fact, the band supposedly formed when drummer Zack Martin—stoned off pot brownies— called Murray three times in a row, begging him to form a band. Murray agreed under the condition that they tour and record all the time, which they do.\r\n\r\nActive since 2009, Natural Child record songs and tour whenever they aren’t in the studio. The repetition’s tightened their songwriting, and Hard in Heaven even gets emotional in spots. The band often eschews the mushy stuff in favor of the beer-drinking good times, but the title track, “Hard in Heaven”, is burn-out blues at its most desolate. Looks like all that toking has caused the band to look inward (read: Neil Young’s “On the Beach”). “I spent too long living in my head,” sings Traylor. Introspection foiling hedonism: a rock ‘n’ roll archetype fitting of a scuzzy trio like Natural Child.\r\nOUT OF PRINT\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3842556827/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e32c14/notracklist=true/t=9/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://naturalchild.bandcamp.com/album/hard-in-heaven\">Hard in Heaven by Natural Child</a></iframe>\r\n","options":[{"id":26685540,"name":"Default","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/83488629/-/N_CHILD_HIH_web_cover.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/83488629/-/N_CHILD_HIH_web_cover.png","width":394,"height":396}],"artists":[{"id":160338,"name":"BURGER Records","permalink":"burger-records","url":"/artist/burger-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"},{"id":5253210,"name":"FAVOURITE RECORDS OF 2012","permalink":"favourite-records-of-2012","url":"/category/favourite-records-of-2012"}]},{"id":10395124,"name":"NECTARINE PIE - Dreamdaze 7\"","permalink":"nectarine-pie-dreamdaze-7","position":156,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nectarine-pie-dreamdaze-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-07T05:33:32.000Z","description":"The long awaited debut 7\" from Oakland's Nectarine Pie, featuring members of Bare Wires.

This is a cracker power pop single and great art work.\r\nNeedles//Pins are making the rounds and it’s really no surprise why. It all comes down to their catchy and memorable garage rock spirit, which has a tight and vibrant power-pop edge that drives songs with an invigorating energy. Lead singer Adam Ess guides us through the pulsing rage with his raspy, snarling vocals, fitting in perfectly to the mix and giving these songs their unsettling qualities. “Getting On Home” starts the 7″ with it’s crunchy, trashy guitars, leading us through a sharp and jangly garage-punk beat down that’s worthy of many spins. On the B-side, “Picture My Face” is driven by a poppy guitar hook and plenty of optimistic energy, leaving us with just one more undeniably catchy garage pop anthem to sink your teeth into.

There are the surf-drenched guitars, the complementary female vocals, and the rock ‘n’ roll frenzy of X (Los Angeles), some of what has been brewing in Denmark and Sweden over the last decades with bands like MASSHYSTERI / VICIOUS, and NO HOPE FOR THE KIDS, but also with lots of melody and leads that is reminiscent of 80's LA bands like SOCIAL DISTORTION and ADOLESCENTS, all infused with a unique quality of their own. Lead singer Milo has been around for some years now as a singer song writer in her own solo project ROSIE TIE. Drummer Juan Miguel has been busy on the heavier side of music, playing guitar in bands like LOS DOLARES, LEADERSHIT, ETACARINAE, and PELIGRO!, in Barcelona over the past decade. Will has also done time in many bands over the past decade with groups BORN/DEAD, DESOLATION, SUICIDE BOMB, DOPECHARGE, and most recently Portland's RED DONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2825431088/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e32c14/notracklist=true/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://nomoreart.bandcamp.com/album/tough-to-breathe\">Tough to Breathe by No More Art</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":26686668,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/83491263/-/2981048175-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/83491263/-/2981048175-1.jpg","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":139689,"name":"DERANGED Records","permalink":"deranged-records","url":"/artist/deranged-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687793,"name":"7\" VINYLS","permalink":"7-vinyls","url":"/category/7-vinyls"}]},{"id":10261312,"name":"OUTER MINDS -  Push My Buttons 7”","permalink":"outer-minds-push-my-buttons-7","position":164,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/outer-minds-push-my-buttons-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-31T02:48:31.000Z","description":"Eerie Garage / Psych Punk from CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.

It’s out on the Austrian Bachelor Records imprint, and full of great mono guitar tones. Bo Diddley’s “You Can’t Judge A Book By It’s Cover” is given star treatment as the A-Side and it’s a fitting opener to this EP of covers. The Pacifics hit all the right covers on this one. Up next? Little Richard’s “Lucille” and the piano obviously gets out front on this one (besides the magnificently maniacal vocal take that’s perfect for the track). The piano sounds as ragged as Little Richard’s version, a feat that should not go unnoticed. The last strike on it rings out pure ugly soul. It’s great.\r\n\r\n“Baby It’s You” a Burt Bacherach penned tune that found it’s place being recorded by the Beatles and The Shirelles among many others, opens up the B-Side with a more smooth and light edge. Lots of true singing and no yelping/squealing in this one. The Pacifics manage to make all of these songs sound like their own brand of “Beat”. Each track has it’s own feel and it’s own vocal styling and that’s what’s really impressive about this tiny platter EP. These guys can really sing, now lets see if they can write their own jams! The Chuck Barry “I’m Talking About You” cover is obviously another rock n roll raver in the vein of “You Can’t Judge A Book By It’s Cover”. Perfect bookend, and it brings the single full circle and leaves you wanting to flip it again and again.\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=507317554/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e32c14/notracklist=true/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://pacifics.bandcamp.com/album/play-favourites\">Play Favourites by The Pacifics</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":33746874,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/105774876/-/pacifics_front-500x500.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/105774876/-/pacifics_front-500x500.jpg","width":394,"height":387}],"artists":[{"id":183928,"name":"BACHELOR Records","permalink":"bachelor-records","url":"/artist/bachelor-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687793,"name":"7\" VINYLS","permalink":"7-vinyls","url":"/category/7-vinyls"}]},{"id":10395340,"name":"PAMELA - Self Titled 7\"","permalink":"pamela-self-titled-7","position":168,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pamela-self-titled-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-07T05:53:03.000Z","description":"Pamela has finally arrived!

They began performing at CalArts and house parties in the Santa Clarita valley in 2008, soon venturing to house shows and DIY spaces throughout the West Coast. These initial grassroots tours were followed by shows at iconic LA venues such as The Echo, Echoplex, the Troubadour and The Roxy, as well as trips to Austin for SXSW.\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Z4rrp2iNanU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nTheir debut recording was 2010's cassette-only Jelly Jam, released by Seattle-based label Lost Sound Tapes. Their second album Living Dummy was co-released on LP in the summer of 2011 by Burger Records and The Smell's label Olfactory. Living Dummy was followed up by the Killer Dreams EP in early 2012. Pangea have played shows with Wavves, The Black Lips, FIDLAR, Ty Segall, Mikal Cronin, King Kahn and the Shrines, Nobunny, Redd Kross, Guitar Wolf, The Strange Boys, and many more.

In case you dont know, she‘s the drummer for WHITE WIRES who have two albums out on Going Gaga / Douchemaster and Dirtnap, toured through Europe and USA. Allie Hanlon always had her own musical outlet, since 2009, her music has gone from the Ottawa basements and bedrooms where it spawned, to all corners of Canada and the USA.\r\n \r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/9Eeck0gSY6s\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n  She has toured under the PEACH KELLI POP moniker the USA multiple times with various friends completing her live band. Hanlon's output is slow - 3 years after the first self-titled album - her second, also self-titled, is finally due out on Austria's BACHELOR RECORDS.   This time round you can hear a distinct improvement in production quality. Both albums were written, performed and recorded entirely by Hanlon, and it is clear she has learned a thing or two since her genuinely amateur debut.\r\nThe second album is a sort of continuation of the last - songs about love, loss, fun, still laced with the same sass and femininity, but with significantly faster tempos and a welcome dash of distortion.The 10-track album features a diverse range of instruments and is very concise, lasting under 25 minutes. Quick songs with driving 4/4 beats, harmonies and pop melodies for miles.  Recommended for fans of the GOGO‘S, NIKKI & THE CORVETTES, THE QUICK and THE PEECHEES.\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4129958231/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e32c14/notracklist=true/t=6/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://peachkellipop.bandcamp.com/album/peach-kelli-pop-ii\">Peach Kelli Pop II by peach kelli pop</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":28198328,"name":"Default","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/88379798/-/artworks-000034132795-f1pay7-original.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/88379798/-/artworks-000034132795-f1pay7-original.png","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":183928,"name":"BACHELOR Records","permalink":"bachelor-records","url":"/artist/bachelor-records"},{"id":160338,"name":"BURGER Records","permalink":"burger-records","url":"/artist/burger-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"}]},{"id":7458099,"name":"PEAWEES - Leave It Behind LP","permalink":"peawees-leave-it-behind-lp","position":173,"price":19.99,"default_price":19.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/peawees-leave-it-behind-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-05T18:17:02.000Z","description":"The soul of Rock and Roll is alive. 11 tracks rooted in 60's soul and a sonic testament to the band's true passion for the sound of the past.

It comes less rootsy and more awkward, but if you can sit still through the self-titled “Primitive Heart”, we doubt you’d pass an empathy test. One of the of the scrappiest love songs of the year, it’s vulnerable without being sappy. The hook is ample, but the verse is what gets stuck in your head, swirling around uplifting major chords that shake you into submission. It feels like a sucker-punch before “Believe Me”, which bellows with enough background ‘oooh-ooooos’ to make Shannon Shaw blush. “Killing Time” hits a mid-tempo stride with a dirty lick and sing-along vocals before venturing into the minute long Flamin’ Groovies stomp of “Breakdown”. It could be the production by Elvis Christ, but the EP is saturated in the same ball-in-hand catchiness as Nobunny’s First Blood.

RÄJÄYTTÄJÄT kind of remind me of an upbeat version of that old 70's Finnish Pub Rock band Hurriganes, if you remember those guys.   Total guitar hammering Rock N Roll with a nice fuzzy, bouncing, bottom-end to make their songs sit just right. Ya the foundations are all Flamin' Groovies, Gizmos, Pagans and Real Kids, but they take that and just totally go in their own  ramshackle, Räjä N Roll direction.  Their music has a nice scuzzy, murky grit to it, but that definitely doesn't detract from it's appeal. The recordings are actually pretty clean sounding and the fuzzy , scuzzy wall of noise that embodies each song is really what gives their songs character.   The Stooges embraced that same stylistic aesthetic and RÄJÄYTTÄJÄT fire back with that same kind of effectiveness.  Just pure fuzzy, laid back Rock N Roll jammers with guitar solos that seem to pop out of nowhere.  Seriously one of the best new bands from Finland.

The music runs the gamet from faster Punk based garage tunes to warped darker post punk tunes and the way they mix things up really make this band stand out. Influences range from the Swell Maps to The Fall to Gang Of Four to a bit of the Gun Club, and they take those influences and write about things that are familiar to the band based on their selcuded living situation living in smaller towns on the outskirts of the big city. Their’s definately a darker overall atmosphere to the mood of the music and that helps to convey the bleaker, more complex lyrics that they sing about. You definately get the sense that the band came into releasing this debut single with conveying a mood and feeling for the band based on the visuals of the artwork and the grooves on the single and they definately get the job done there.

Honorable independent publications and the ever growing \"blogosphere\" outdid themselves with Top 5, Top 10, and Top 100 lists of records that were issued in the last ten years. A common find among these lists was the seminal SO WHAT'S LEFT NOW? LP by Portland, Oregon's THE OBSERVERS released on VINYL WARNING in 2004. The dawn of a new decade is upon us and Doug Burns (Lead singer/songwriter/artist of THE OBSERVERS) has a new band, the RED DONS, featuring Daniel Hajji Husayn, Richard Joachim Preinesberger, and a rotating cast of characters including Justin Maurer (Clorox Girls), Will Kinser (Born/Dead), Zack Brooks (Soda Pop Kids), and Andy Foote (The Physical Challenge). Named after a group of Cambridge professors that operated as spies for the Soviet Union in WW2, the RED DONS continue where the OBSERVERS left off with added elements of Arabic themes in both the artwork and sound. After the much lauded release of their debut album and successfully touring the US, Canada, Europe, and Brazil, the RED DONS entered a Portland studio to record ten new tracks. On this new album FAKE MEETS FAILURE (DERANGED RECORDS / TAKEN BY SURPRISE RECORDS), the band successfully develops their unique style even further. Coded lyrics about vagabond characters moving back and forth between the lines of the current climate of fear and suspicion that has been brought upon the USA by the war on terror. Again, consistent songwriting and a great production make this record stand out among the current competition. Combining TSOL-like vocals, SoCal punk rage, and the defiant melancholy of Pacific Northwesterners like the WIPERS this powerful release rises above the stack of contemporaries that take on the early 80s punk sound. No retro fashion hype, no flavor of the month. When this year turns, be sure to find this LP in the leading spots of Top 5, Top 10 and Top 100 lists of 2010.

Recently Shannon joined the live incarnation of Hunx & His Punx or as they call it now Hunx & His Punkettes, and when you see them live you realize how much Shannon's vocals and playing really help make Hunx's live shows so much more satisfying. \r\nPaddy's Birthday continues to show us why we love this group so much. Shannon is possessed with one of the strongest and moving voices of any vocalist around, she really owns every single note and word she sings.

Throbbing bass, jagged guitars, and dreary vocals anchor each tune with grimy proto punk toughness and clangy, post punk grit. And the poetry-as-lyrics vocals are smattered with splashes of Keys and a Moog that have a real rhythmic, almost mechanical, feel to them that kinda comes off a little like Devo.  But don't take that as them sounding like a Wave band, because they're far from it.  SHARK TOYS music is carved out of the ramshackle, pop-fused, punk of bands like the Modern Lovers and Television Personalities.   Intimate and shambolic, gutter-pop, slop polished in Swell Maps, Raincoats and Gang of Four decadence.

After self releasing several demos both Gustavson and Hanker relocated to Vancouver and brought Heather and Nathan Szilagyi in on Drums and Bass, and Zach Batalden in on second guitar.  Heather Szilagyi would soon be replaced by Steve Gerenscer on drums, and after releasing two singles and touring the west coast with the Estranged Hanker would leave the band to be replaced by Tyler Pilling.  2010 saw the release of the band’s first full length LP, LAST DAYS which was followed in 2011 by a European tour and a split 7” with Arctic Flowers.

They are doing a 2nd European tour this spring and new album is also going into production shortly. Reviews of their 2nd album here: Maximumrocknroll 285 Wow, a welcome new dsicovery for me. Mining the same updated pop-punk/power-pop/mod-punk vein as SMALLTOWN or current faves (and co-Canucks) TRANZMITORS, with the hint of a less snotty BRIEFS and a literary JAWBREAKER-esque quality to the lyrics. Great stuff, recorded well and with great catchy choruses. Sounds authentic but not retro. Eight songs at 45RPM for max. auditory effect. Apparently the CD has five more songs-BOO! If those extra songs we're any good they'd be onthe vinyl. You don't need 'em! (AM) NOW WAVE Webzine Statues New People Make Us Nervous CD (Pelado Records/Shooting at Decoys) (REVIEW BY LORD RUTLEDGE) Your typical pop-crazy Now Wave readers will love Sudbury, Ontario's Statues. On its second full-length release, this mod/punk/powerpop trio lets loose 13 bolts of upbeat, high-energy tuneage that I can't help but crank loud. What a great album! Kicking up some snappy Jam/Buzzcocks electricity a la American counterparts The Adored and specializing in bright, frenetic melodies that would thrill fans of Green Day, Statues storm out of the gates and never let up on this delightful sophomore effort. It's hard to single out one particular \"hit\", because song after song is tuneful and energetic in the most thoroughly enjoyable way. I'm especially keen on \"Living In Lines\", \"Nerve Damage\", \"The Last Stand\", and \"Rubber Gloves\". With the exception of minor forays into the realm of Clashy reggae and radio friendly post-punk, the disc delivers a non-stop barrage of pulsating power chords and brisk, catchy tunes. But don't go thinking this is lightweight, fluffy stuff! The vibe here is nervy, not cutesy. There are no sappy songs about broken hearts or unattainable pretty girls. In fact, one of the things I like most about this album is the lyrics. Here Statues take on some sharp social commentary in a non-preachy and not at all heavy-handed way. These are songs that reflect the pervasive anxiety and emotional disconnection that plague today's world: technology gone too far, governments and employers intruding into our lives, consumerism run amok, and the overmedicated masses beset by the rigors of the rat race. All of this 21st Century fear and loathing is explored with good humor and invigorating, high-spirited playing. I defy you not to smile and dance your way through the infectious refrain \"We can't complain about the weather/If we never go outside\". All in all, a totally outstanding release from one of North America's most underrated punky pop groups.

Try 'Stop watch' and the critical, exploding 'Self Help Con Job' to satisfy your appetite.","options":[{"id":22887015,"name":"Default","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89477378/-/STATUESholidaycops.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89477378/-/STATUESholidaycops.jpg","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":139689,"name":"DERANGED Records","permalink":"deranged-records","url":"/artist/deranged-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"}]},{"id":8488719,"name":"SUMMER TWINS - Self Titled LP","permalink":"summer-twins-self-titled-lp","position":205,"price":19.99,"default_price":19.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/summer-twins-self-titled-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-11T12:00:11.000Z","description":"On this album The Summer Twins incorporate elements of surf and doo-wop into their garage rock sound. It was recorded entirely onto analog tape. This record has the typical retro sound of a Burger release, but it does not share the typical lo-fi quality. It sounds more like something produced by Phil Spector than something recorded in a hippie’s garage.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/D1pki6fOy18\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nSide A begins with “Got Somebody to Dream About” a slow dreamy Doo-Wop number about a girl who is alone in her bed. She feels cold and lonely, but she is able to sleep because she has somebody special to dream about. The second track “I Don’t Care” picks up the pace a little and brings in some attitude. After that the record slows down again for “Stars Aligned”, a mellow tune with a surf beat and Hawaiian inlfuenced acoustic guitar. The narrator sings about getting together with the man of her dreams, but then she realizes that the reality of this guy can never live up to her fantasies. “Apple Orchards” is a more upbeat psychedelic tune with an electric guitar up front and an organ droning in the background. Side A concludes with “Try”, a slow, painfully-sincere ballad about trying your absolute best.\r\n\r\nSide B opens with a dark tune “Teardrops On My Pillow” about a woman who wakes from a dream to find her lover gone. The next song “I Could Never Break Your Heart” is a bitter-sweet acoustic duet about two lovers who who fall in love at first sight. There is an immediate spark, but they both go their separate ways because they want to preserve their perfect memory, rather than spoil it by getting to know each other. “Pickin’ Dasies” features a slight country twang and a hard driving bass drum pulsating through the mix. “I Will Love You” is a Doo-Wop song with hand clapping and a backing chorus of “oohs” and “aahs”. The album ends on a high note with “Worryhead”. This song is written for a worried friend. It tells them to go to sleep where they can recede into their dreams and wake up to a new day.\r\nOUT OF PRINT\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4042223073/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e32c14/notracklist=true/t=7/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://summertwins.bandcamp.com/album/summer-twins\">Summer Twins by Summer Twins</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":26685726,"name":"Default","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/83489157/-/SUMMER_TWINS_LP_COVER.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/83489157/-/SUMMER_TWINS_LP_COVER.png","width":394,"height":401}],"artists":[{"id":160338,"name":"BURGER Records","permalink":"burger-records","url":"/artist/burger-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"},{"id":5253210,"name":"FAVOURITE RECORDS OF 2012","permalink":"favourite-records-of-2012","url":"/category/favourite-records-of-2012"}]},{"id":12001302,"name":"SUMMER TWINS - Forget Me 7\"","permalink":"summer-twins-forget-me-7","position":206,"price":10.99,"default_price":10.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/summer-twins-forget-me-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-25T10:27:07.000Z","description":"\"Forget Me\" 7 inch on Burger Records \r\nIncludes a full color insert with a code to download our full 5 song EP! \r\n\r\nSome of the best sun blessed pop in recent times.

Rockin’ punk and rockin roll from 3/4 of the late great MULLENS here. You know that time when you were drinking all day long and you reach that point where you begin drooling?  Well, a CD of the Sunday Drunks caliber would definitely fit in at that moment.\r\n\r\nHaving been one myself, I was interested to find out if these Sunday Drunks could live up to the haggard, street nuisance lot in life that their name implies. Well, get out the sawdust and keep 911 on the speed dial, because these cats sound like the real deal. The Sunday Drunks play rattlesnake daddy swagger rock, the kind Chuck Berry used to make, only roughed up to the contemporary standard of sin drivers like American Heartbreak or the Sons of Hercules and infused with a shot of Stonesy honky tonk and a splash of 60's fuzz punk. It's like a dizzy mixture of ever more poisonous flavors of rock that would most surely be green, fizzing, and harmful if swallowed were it an actual drink and not just a record that sounds like the last cocktail that nearly did you in. Admitting everything, regretting nothing, and doing it all in classic rubber legged style, the Sunday Drunks are one bloody Mary away from either debauched rock stardom or just falling down dead. Something tells me that either one would suit the boys just fine.  The Sunday Drunks really won me over.

Searing guitar work and a vocalist that can actually manage to convey his live frustration through recorded media, a rare feat.  A distinct sound is hard to pinpoint.  Influences range all over the place from Death Side to Poison Idea.  Everyone will tell you something different, make your own judgement.  Members of Unlearn and Vacant State.\r\nAfter the break-up of Unlearn the guitarist set out to get another project started as soon as possible, actually only within a few days he and Isaiah (vocalist) started working together.  After a few months, a few bassists and a few drummers, a solid lineup developed and a demo was recorded in Dec.2011.

The ferocity of Husker Du, the melancholy of folk (\"15th of July\" and the ballad obscure and popular \"One Year Older\" are suitable catch his breath and glue these ecstatic thirty-five minutes), the poetry of the Paisley Underground (\"Daddy Says \"would not disfigured in the songs of Medicine Show), the anger of punk, the sparkle of the power pop of the Hoodoo Gurus, the bold look of the garage and the irresistible youth mental that makes the four boys from Bologna beings unaffected by the currents of fashion.\r\nEverything from oil paints to cover harmonica mouth \"I've been Young\", promises a small revolution, so that we can allow to evoke our \"Dream Syndicate\".

The backbone of Portland’s fierce rock n roll scene has always been the Weaklings. It’s been nearly 11 years since the bands first 7” release back in 1995. Their “NEVER SAY DIE” attitude and dedication to the road has cost them many members over the years, but has also earned them a rabid loyal fan base along the way. A fan base that has helped earn the WEAKLINGS a slot as one of the best and wildest bands in the underground rock n roll scene.  Well here is their latest offering.  11 songs of raw brash, sleazy rock n roll. Whereas the WEAKLINGS began as more of a loud fast punk band in ’95, they have evolved into a sleazy dirty raunchy rock outfit. The songs on ‘’Rock N Roll Owes Me’ have more swagger and verve than their earlier blast ya fast approach. Along with Bradley's signature tales of alcohol addled mischief you also get Rhemrev’s catchy Heartbreakers/ AC/DC / Rolling Stones guitar work to add to their new amped up and sexed out approach.

Their 2010 debut It’s the Evil earned them the title as the primary ambassadors for Canada’s emergent punk scene receiving critical acclaim from CHARTAttack to Maximum Rock n’ Roll to Terminal Boredom and their follow-up does not disappoint. McCorkell’s signature driving, off-kilter riffage paired with Way’s snarling and aggressive yet melodic vocals and the hard-hitting rhythmic duo of Grady Mackintosh on bass and Anne-Marie Vassilou on drums amp up White Lung’s position from ambassadors to the queens (and king) of Canandian noise rock. Bowing to the inevitable need for comparison, according to Vice Magazine, “White Lung combine the feral energy of the Germs with the taut, wiry dynamics of the Wipers and have released a string of singles that keep improving in a bewilderingly exponential fashion.” \r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/VTbiAuqewBA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nAlso present in their sound are golden era Kurt and Courtney, The Bags, and Rocket from the Crypt. This wealth of influences doesn’t mean the band’s sound is hard to pin-down. Written and recorded nearly simultaneously, Sorry manages to be both raw and complex, thanks to White Lung’s focus on cohesive writing. Sorry may have been stressful to record, but it’s a joy to listen to. It signals a new era for White Lung, featuring denser more melodic songs that maintain the rough edge of their punk pedigree. \r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1828877247/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e32c14/notracklist=true/t=7/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://whitelung.bandcamp.com/album/sorry\">Sorry by WHITE LUNG</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":22885427,"name":"Default","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89478266/-/880981834-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89478266/-/880981834-1.jpg","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":139689,"name":"DERANGED Records","permalink":"deranged-records","url":"/artist/deranged-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687711,"name":"LP's & 12\" VINYLS","permalink":"lp-s-12-vinyls","url":"/category/lp-s-12-vinyls"},{"id":5253210,"name":"FAVOURITE RECORDS OF 2012","permalink":"favourite-records-of-2012","url":"/category/favourite-records-of-2012"},{"id":5253093,"name":"STAFF PICKS","permalink":"staff-picks","url":"/category/staff-picks"}]},{"id":10261522,"name":"WHITE LUNG - Two Of You 7\"","permalink":"white-lung-two-of-you-7","position":225,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/white-lung-two-of-you-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-31T03:12:50.000Z","description":"Vancouver quartet White Lung spent a fair amount of September and October trekking Europe with songs from their hellishly excellent 2012 record, Sorry.

Finally there home label DERANGED is releasing this at the start of APRIL\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2301103563/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e32c14/notracklist=true/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://whitelung.bandcamp.com/album/s-t\">S/T by WHITE LUNG</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":32118940,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100834732/-/tumblr_mc4k72YByw1qapn85o1_1350624166_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100834732/-/tumblr_mc4k72YByw1qapn85o1_1350624166_cover.jpg","width":394,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":139689,"name":"DERANGED Records","permalink":"deranged-records","url":"/artist/deranged-records"}],"categories":[{"id":3687793,"name":"7\" VINYLS","permalink":"7-vinyls","url":"/category/7-vinyls"},{"id":5253093,"name":"STAFF PICKS","permalink":"staff-picks","url":"/category/staff-picks"}]},{"id":10758288,"name":"WILD CHILD - Viral Load 7\"","permalink":"wild-child-viral-load-7","position":226,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wild-child-viral-load-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-25T03:14:02.000Z","description":"The good people at DERANGED tell me it was the best demo they heard in 2011 and here we finally have their debut record. For those who heard the demo (Fashionable Idiots just released the demo on vinyl), this is more of the same chaotic hardcore. Raw hardcore punk from Minneapolis. Has a fast paced lo fi early hardcore sound that brings to mind Copenhagen and Umea bands who were copying early 1980's US bands. A more snarly DEEP WOUND?
