Scent lasts 2-4 loads then super easy to re-scent with your favorite essential oil.  Just squeeze a few drops onto each ball and let set for 10 minutes... good as new.  Made from 100% natural triple felted wool so making them safe for babies and pets.  Best of all... your laundry will smell fresh, feel better, dry faster, and look great without adding any hazardous chemicals of pesticides!  \r\n\r\nEach ball is roughly the size of a tennis ball.
