I have recently come across this charm of hair in which normally mourning hair is tightly woven and placed in a locket, pin or a frame. This piece here is certainly different. It is a small lock of hair that is tied at the tip and placed in this pendant. I was told that the photo of the young woman is who's lock of hair is in this pendant. Sorry, I love vintage photographs so it is not going to be jointing the necklace. If you have not heard of mourning hair art or the art of mourning please check out a blog entry i did a whole back on it. http://www.lemoderntrinket.com/2010/04/15/mourning-hair-art/\r\n\r\nEverything on this piece is vintage. Event the lobster claw. The chain is made of found rosary parts, beads and watch parts.
