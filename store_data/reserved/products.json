Delicately decorated with tiny little star dots, these dishes will make a great impression every time you serve on them. \r\n\r\nThis line is available in standard sized dinner plate, side plate, serving bowl, salad bowl, cereal bowl, platter and mug. If you would like additional pieces, please contact me for a custom order and specify the number and type of pieces you would like.

Each piece is carefully selected from last-chance sources. I rescue the piece, give it a bath and make it prettier than it was when it was born. You are adopting a unique piece of serviceware. Each design is as unique as the item it's been drawn on. I cannot guarantee that the item you are purchasing is the exact one you saw in a sample picture, because I don't rescue matching sets, and I haven't quite figured out how to draw like a computer just yet. But I do guarantee an obsessive attention to detail and some pretty awesome service pieces.\r\n\r\n>>>>>Some of my pieces show more wear than others. I rescue pieces from different sources and find that the wear actually adds to the charm of the piece. I don't use stained or damaged items, but some items will have minimal signs of former-life wear.\r\n\r\n>>>>>Care recommendations: My little rescues need some TLC. They are drawn with non-toxic paint, baked in a firey hot oven (which they actually like, don't worry. think: sauna), and ensured to hug your food proudly. While I do recommend hand-washing to prolong the life of its makeup, they are dishwasher and microwave safe. All my paints are non-toxic/lead-free. Avoid harsh abrasives and knife scratches as the paint will scratch off.\r\n\r\n>>>>>Shipping Note!! My shipping rates will vary based on what you're ordering, the final weight of your order and its destination. I will do my best to estimate shipping when your listing is setup. \r\n\r\n>>>>>Timing Note!! Because I only make sample pieces for display in the store, I will need to gather the serving pieces once your order is placed. I will estimate up to 2 weeks per order with most orders being filled in a fraction of that time. Once I gather my pieces, I will revive and restore one piece from each of your selections, email you a picture to approve and then complete the order immediately.","options":[{"id":22656165,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":30.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70211767/-/re.served_023.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70211767/-/re.served_023.JPG","width":1000,"height":667}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":7158493,"name":"Recycled Dinnerware: Legal Weed","permalink":"recycled-dinnerware-legal-weed","position":2,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/recycled-dinnerware-legal-weed","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-05T10:43:22.000Z","description":"This weed blowing in the wind is just so cool.
