Two quotes from the movie that best describe it, and this print are:\r\n\r\nKathleen Kelly(Meg Ryan): Once I read a story about a butterfly in the subway, and today I saw one. I couldn't believe it. It got on at 42nd -- and got off at 59th, where I assume it was going to Bloomingdale's to buy a hat that will turn out to be a mistake. As almost all hats are.\r\n\r\nJoe Fox(Tom Hanks): Don't you love New York in the fall? It makes me wanna buy school supplies. I would send you a bouquet of newly sharpened pencils if I knew your name and address. On the other hand, this not knowing has its charms. \r\n\r\n**************\r\n\r\n8.5in by 11in, black ink on paper.
