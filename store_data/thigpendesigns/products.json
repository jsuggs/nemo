Please allow around 2-3 weeks for delivery?  \"Why?\" (I know you are asking this).  Well, because I'm a one man show and I only have so many arms - but I'll get it to you!\r\n\r\nI have unisex and girl cuts.  The girl cuts will be a slightly different color but they fit you gals oh-so-well.  Here's the thing though, if you are a medium, order a large.  If you're a large, order a XL.  The shirts I get run really, really small - and they are a tad more expensive only because it's a more expensive cut.
