Quartz beads catch light beautifully and the long, thin Abalone shell as a guru bead adds a very individual touch.\r\n\r\nThe main counters (108 beads) of this mala are clear Quartz. Each of the three divider beads are different combinations of crystals Aquamarine, African Turquoise Jasper, Amazonite, Larimar and white Agate. The guru bead includes several pieces of a long thin Abalone shell, Biwa pearls, Larimar white Agate and Aquamarine. A truly one of a kind mala. In addition to using this mala in meditation, it can be worn as a necklace, or even wrapped around the wrist for a few times. Wearing this mala as a long single length necklace particularly would make wonderful use of the crystals' healing energies as Quartz is known as a master healer and the length of this mala reaches down the whole torso.\r\n\r\nLength of mala: 130 cm (51\") all around measurement\r\nMain bead diameter: 1 cm \r\nWidth of the three divider bead combinations: approx. 3 cm \r\nLength of the guru bead combination: 9 cm\r\n\r\nI have knotted each bead one by one for ease of handling, using strong light green micro-macrame cord. I draw artistic inspiration for these contemporary yoga meditation beads from the ancient decorative Buddhist malas from Tibet that were often given as gifts to Chinese courts and called \"Chinese court necklaces\". I match the stones and crystals carefully to create an energetic combination in the mala that will benefit the keeper in an individual way. All of my malas are one-of-a-kind.\r\n\r\nThis mala comes in a soft brown leather pouch . If you would rather have a fabric pouch, please let me know at the time of purchase.\r\n\r\nWhilst this mala is made with Tibetan Buddhist bead count (108 beads), all my malas are dedicated to the Sacred Light and Unity of All – its future keeper may bless the mala as to their own wishes and purpose.\r\n","options":[{"id":38516781,"name":"Default","price":149.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":79,"name":"Cayman Islands","code":"KY"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":100,"name":"Estonia","code":"EE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":229,"name":"United Arab Emirates","code":"AE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/119811234/-/ABAmala1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/119811234/-/ABAmala1.jpg","width":570,"height":570},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/119811246/-/ABAmala2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/119811246/-/ABAmala2.jpg","width":570,"height":760},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/119811258/-/ABAmala3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/119811258/-/ABAmala3.jpg","width":570,"height":760}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":9344483,"name":"Quartz mala with Rubies","permalink":"quartz-mala-with-ruby-amethyst","position":2,"price":149.0,"default_price":149.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/quartz-mala-with-ruby-amethyst","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-06T12:00:37.000Z","description":"Tibetan style 108 bead yoga meditation mala with Quartz, Amethyst, Ruby and Pyrite.

Like all brown Jaspers, Cappuccino Jasper helps in finding inner equilibrium and balance in one's energies. Cappuccino Jasper is also said to be cleansing and great for detox.\r\n\r\nThe dividers consist of a combination of Smokey Quartz, Amethyst and Baltic Amber.

Or treat someone close to your heart - maybe write your own message on the first page for your loved one to find when opening the book...\r\n\r\nYet still, this small book treasure doesn't look like a standard book. It is intricately crafted jewelry, a romantic jewel that as a bonus hides a vessel for your own content. Record those fleeting thoughts, pearls of wisdom and lines of poetry to make this truly your own \"Wisdom Keeper\" talisman.\r\n\r\nI have knotted a decorative lace-like pattern in dark brown and burgundy red micro-macrame cord that extends across both covers and also forms the closing clasp. The knotwork is highlighted with deep red Garnet and clear Quartz beads. The larger crystal that closes the clasp is 'Shaman Dream Stone', inclusion Quartz known also as Lodolite. The necklace is braided with Burgundy cord and light grey pure silk ribbon. There's a decorative Garnet bead on the left side of the necklace braid. The book has many intricate details, including hand-sewn headbands.\r\n\r\nThe page size in the book is 3.5 cm x 4.8 cm (1.4\" x 1.9\") and there are 80 pages (40 leaves).

Inspired by native tribal style and ancient shamans' medicine pouches, complete with intricate bead details (wood, gemstones). The decorative floral embossing on the front flap is traditionally found on the covers of finely bound leather books. \r\nMeasured as a sleeve for carrying an iPad, but this leather bag can also be used for carrying a diary, journal or a sketch book...\r\n\r\nSupple and strong, yet comfortably light, this 'Wisdom Keeper' is made from the finest vegetable tanned African goat hide. It is the finest traditional, museum quality bookbinding leather, frequently covering the most valuable volumes of literary works in discerning book collections. Therefore, a stylish covering with an ancient feel for such a modern book-like device as iPad...\r\n\r\nThe pouch is carefully cut, folded, pierced and stitched by hand - one single stitch at a time - with strong waxed thread, and the bottom corners of the pouch are reinforced. The pouch is unlined, showing its natural soft suede inner, and has a long shoulder strap (also reinforced) that keeps the bag hanging a bit lower than hip level. It has no closure but a large frontal leather flap that rests over the pouch opening - the curved edge of the flap is the natural edge of the hide, finished with an eye-catching crystal detail consisting of Amethyst and Tourmaline beads. Hours of meticulous crafting and attention to detail hopefully makes this a treasured accessory for someone who's looking for a different, unusual take on an iPad case.\r\n\r\nThis is one-of-a-kind piece with unique detailing, any further pouches will never be exactly the same. Please expect and enjoy some natural surface markings on the leather which give this bag a natural, organic feel.\r\n\r\nDimensions of the wrapper sleeve: 20x25 cm \r\nThe length of the shoulder strap, hanging from the top middle of the strap down to the top edge of the pouch: 56 cm (22\") \r\nThe width of the shoulder strap is approximately 2 cm.\r\n\r\nThis leather sleeve fits all versions of iPad, also iPad2 and iPad3 with the official 'Smart Cover' on. (Whilst this iPad sleeve is not designed for all the bulky items one might carry in a normal handbag, this one is a comfortable fit if you wanted to also slip in an iPhone.)","options":[{"id":25495833,"name":"Default","price":89.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":79,"name":"Cayman

You can choose up to five (5) but the five can also be one type of crystal only. Or anything in between. For example in the photographs here, the combination of five crystals consists of 1 Rose Quartz, 1 Blue Lace Agate, 1 Amethyst and 2 Labradorites.\r\n\r\nPlease choose 1-5 from this list of crystals (if you choose one crystal, your personalised 'tassel' will have five pieces of the one crystal you've chosen):\r\n\r\nAfrican Turquoise Jasper, Agate, Amazonite, Amethyst, Apatite, Baltic Amber, Black Tourmaline, Blue Lace Agate, Bronzite, Carnelian, Citrine, Gold Rutile Quartz, Green Aventurine, Hawk's Eye, Howlite, Labradorite, Lapis Lazuli, Moonstone, Pink Peruvian Opal, Pyrite, Red Aventurine, Rose Quartz, Schorl (Black Tourmaline), Sodalite, Tiger Eye, Tourmaline (multi-colour), White Jade.\r\n\r\nOr, rather than by crystal name, you can simply let me know which ***colours*** you'd prefer and I'll choose for you accordingly. \r\n\r\nThe necklace will arrive to you in a fabric drawstring pouch, Reiki-infused and gift-wrapped.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is a made-to-order necklace and it will take three (3) days before it leaves my studio.

These stones have been called 'hag stones', 'adder stones' and 'fairy stones'. The size of this grey Flint stone is approx. 4.5 cm (1.8\") tall and 3.5 cm (1.4\") at its widest point. It weighs 55 grams (1.9 ounces).\r\n\r\nI have plied the necklace by hand from unbleached, organic linen thread. The all-around length of the necklace is 24\" and slips over the head without the need for a clasp. However, there is further detailing as well, consisting of Lava Stone, Shaman Dream Stone, Blue Lace Agate and Smokey Quartz combined with tiny Balinese cream coloured ceramic beads. The necklace runs freely through the grey Flint pebble so you will be able to choose whether to wear the crystal 'tassel' behind your neck or bring it close to the Flint for a very talismanic look.\r\n\r\nYou'll receive this amulet necklace in one of my handmade fabric draw-string pouches. Gift-wrapped at no extra cost.\r\n.\r\n\r\nFLINT \r\nAncient protection amulet, calling in spiritual guides and allies. Helps cut away anything that is not in your highest good, dissolving energetic blockages and detaching negative etheric ties from the aura and chakras. Increases self-esteem and courage. Excellent electromagnetic conductor, thus useful for those who are sensitive to EMF pollution. Keep in your pocket, wear as a necklace or place near your computer / mobile phone for EMF relief. Flint purifies its environment, so place around your living space to cleanse and stabilise energies. Said to prevent nightmares so can be placed under pillow at night. Known as a \"Portal Stone\", facilitating your connection with higher dimensions and with your true self. \r\nOn one hand Flint has a grounding vibe, resonating with the Earth Star chakra, yet it also corresponds to the Soul Star chakra, offering spiritual expansion and allowing you to ground higher spiritual knowledge into your physical existence. The energetic effects of various colours and patterns in Flint make it an incredibly useful crystal healing tool and the most fascinating stone to meditate with.","options":[{"id":50040288,"name":"Default","price":26.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":79,"name":"Cayman Islands","code":"KY"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":18,"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HK"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":100,"name":"Estonia","code":"EE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":229,"name":"United Arab Emirates","code":"AE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129020109/-/Flint_crystal_healing_jewelry.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129020109/-/Flint_crystal_healing_jewelry.JPG","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129020115/-/Flint_amulet_charm_necklace.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129020115/-/Flint_amulet_charm_necklace.JPG","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129020118/-/Flint_natural_organic_jewelry.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129020118/-/Flint_natural_organic_jewelry.JPG","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129020127/-/Flint_grey_necklace.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129020127/-/Flint_grey_necklace.JPG","width":800,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6823614,"name":"December Sale","permalink":"december-sale","url":"/category/december-sale"}]},{"id":14779959,"name":"Lava mala with Labradorite & Lapis Lazuli","permalink":"lava-mala-with-labradorite-lapis-lazuli","position":33,"price":93.0,"default_price":93.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lava-mala-with-labradorite-lapis-lazuli","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-11T22:19:08.000Z","description":"The ruggedness of Lava rock, its fiery journey and character transformation makes it one of my all-time favourite mala stone.

Even if you don't meditate, carrying these mala beads on you will surround you with quite an energy combination. This is also a very tactile object - handling the Lava beads is a pleasure, somehow in their ruggedness they still feel silky \"soft\". \r\n\r\nLava stone is considered a grounding stone, like all black stones, and to provide a sense of stability amidst tumultuous situations. In my experience Lava stone definitely exudes a certain inner fire, having been through such an incredible transformation. Holding Lava stones also instills in me a deep sense of peace and contentment, it's difficult to put them down! The rugged and rough surfaces and textures throughout this mala are like a symbol for the raw material from which your inner fire creates whatever your heart desires...\r\n\r\nCombined with the Lava stone here are two types of Rose Quartz, the more known pale pink stone in smaller nugget beads as well as lovely larger nuggets with a velvety feel frosted surface - together with the more rare, naturally dark pink variety of Rose Quartz from Madagascar. Rose Quartz being a pure Heart stone, its loving vibes with the energising and protective Lava stone are simply special.\r\n\r\nThe all-round length of the mala: 102 cm (40\")\r\nThe width of the divider bead combination: approx. 2.5 cm (1\")\r\nLava stone bead diameter: 0.8 cm\r\nLength of the guru bead combination (including the Rose Quartz and brass beads): 7 cm\r\n\r\nEach bead in this mala is knotted individually with strong black micro-macrame cord which gives it a supple feel - you can also wrap this around your wrist a few times to wear as an unusual bracelet, or of course can wear this as a long necklace. Please note that these Lava stone beads are natural, with many naturally occurring dents and holes in them - each bead is rugged and there are very slight size variations between individual beads.\r\n\r\nThis is very much a one-of-a-kind mala, just as unique as you. It comes in a luscious black leather draw-string pouch with decorative bead details that match the colour of the mala. But you can also let me know at the time of purchase if you prefer brown leather or a fabric pouch instead.\r\n\r\nWhilst this mala is made with Tibetan Buddhist bead count (108 beads), all my malas are dedicated to the Sacred Light and Unity of All – its future keeper may bless the mala as to their own wishes and purpose.","options":[{"id":45704112,"name":"Default","price":95.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":79,"name":"Cayman Islands","code":"KY"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":100,"name":"Estonia","code":"EE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":229,"name":"United Arab Emirates","code":"AE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125803557/-/Lava_stone_108_bead_mala.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125803557/-/Lava_stone_108_bead_mala.jpg","width":570,"height":570},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125803581/-/Buddhist_mala_lava_stone.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125803581/-/Buddhist_mala_lava_stone.jpg","width":570,"height":428},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125803587/-/Lava_mala_meditation_beads.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125803587/-/Lava_mala_meditation_beads.jpg","width":570,"height":760},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125803593/-/Lava_rose_quartz_mala.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125803593/-/Lava_rose_quartz_mala.jpg","width":570,"height":428},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125803602/-/Black_pink_tibetan_mala.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125803602/-/Black_pink_tibetan_mala.jpg","width":570,"height":428}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3564217,"name":"Meditation Malas","permalink":"meditation-malas","url":"/category/meditation-malas"}]},{"id":12225012,"name":"'Angel Wing' Kyanite necklace","permalink":"angel-wing-kyanite-necklace","position":40,"price":75.0,"default_price":75.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/angel-wing-kyanite-necklace","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-07T13:06:07.000Z","description":":: Angel Wing ::\r\n\r\nA completely natural raw crystal necklace, with blue Kyanite and highlighting gemstone beads of Aquamarine and Blue Calcite.\r\n\r\nThe necklace in braided with organic linen and white banana silk, very soft with a subtle sheen.

A highly individual meditation aid. This is wonderful to hold and handle and makes a statement when worn as a long single length necklace.\r\n\r\nThe main counters (108 beads) of this mala are Carnelian. The divider beads are Fire Agate, with highlighting clear Quartz. The guru bead combines Fire Agate, carved Rosewood and white Jade. A truly one of a kind mala. In addition to using this mala in meditation, it can be worn as a necklace, or even wrapped around the wrist for a few times.\r\n\r\nLength of mala: 130 cm (51\") all around measurement\r\nMain bead diameter: 1 cm (0.4\")\r\nWidth of the Fire Agate in the divider beads: 1.5 cm (0.6\")\r\nLength of guru bead combination: 8.5 cm (3.3\")\r\n\r\nI have knotted each bead one by one for ease of handling, using strong light grey micro-macrame cord. I draw artistic inspiration for these contemporary yoga meditation beads from the ancient decorative Buddhist malas from Tibet that were often given as gifts to Chinese courts and called \"Chinese court necklaces\". I match the stones and crystals carefully to create an energetic combination in the mala that will benefit the keeper in an individual way. All of my malas are one-of-a-kind.\r\n\r\nThis mala comes in one of my handmade soft brown leather pouches for safekeeping. If you would rather have a fabric pouch, please let me know at the time of purchase.\r\n\r\nWhilst this mala is made with Tibetan Buddhist bead count (108 beads), all my malas are dedicated to the Sacred Light and Unity of All – its future keeper may bless the mala as to their own wishes and purpose.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nCARNELIAN\r\nStabilising stone that restores vitality and motivation.
