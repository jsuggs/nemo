They can be made with your favourite wedding photo, a family photo, a pet - or any other you can think of! Available in silver tone, bronze tone, or gold tone metal.\r\n\r\nJust email me your photo (to dearrosewithlove@gmail.com) and let me do the rest. Please let me know if you want the image printed in colour, black and white, or sepia.\r\n\r\nEach necklace is just £7. If you don't want a photograph, we can also make these necklaces with a quote or message image which we can design for you for a little extra.\r\n\r\nCustom pendants must be paid for up front but you will be emailed progress photos of your pendant being made to ensure you are happy with the outcome.\r\n\r\nPHOTO ADVICE: The frame is an oval shape so I do recommend using a photo in a portrait position and where none of the main image is in the corners as they will be cut off.\r\n\r\nAlso, the better quality of photo that you select - the better quality the image will turn out in the pendant. I recommend selecting a high resolution image where possible. \r\n\r\nAFTERCARE: Please take care to not get your finished necklace wet. Dampness or submerging in water will result in damage to the image under the glass which we cannot be held responsible for. Please also avoid exposing your necklace to extreme temperatures as the glass may crack.\r\n","options":[{"id":48102717,"name":"Silver tone","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48921351,"name":"Bronze tone","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48921354,"name":"Gold tone","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.3,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.3,"amount_with_others":0.25}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127561995/-/weds5th_004.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127561995/-/weds5th_004.jpg","width":3657,"height":2849},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127562040/-/DSCF6622.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127562040/-/DSCF6622.JPG","width":4608,"height":3440},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127562109/-/mon10th_010.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127562109/-/mon10th_010.jpg","width":4608,"height":3440},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127775547/-/DSCF9156.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127775547/-/DSCF9156.JPG","width":2052,"height":2166}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6485874,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"},{"id":6486486,"name":"Hand Made","permalink":"hand-made","url":"/category/hand-made"},{"id":6566052,"name":"New","permalink":"new","url":"/category/new"},{"id":6566070,"name":"Christmas","permalink":"christmas","url":"/category/christmas"}]},{"id":14824167,"name":"Vintage / Sterling Silver Ethereal Ring","permalink":"vintage-sterling-silver-ethereal-ring","position":129,"price":14.0,"default_price":14.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/vintage-sterling-silver-ethereal-ring","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-13T19:57:09.000Z","description":"Sterling silver delicate open work band ring.
