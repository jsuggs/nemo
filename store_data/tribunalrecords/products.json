The quartet’s chemistry is undeniable and their arena-worthy live show has already garnered the band accolades, winning several festivals in the São Paulo region along the way.\r\n\r\nWith ‘70s flavored guitar heroics from Luiz Felipe Cardim and a locked in rhythm section in drummer Nico “The Boss” and bassist Otavio Cintra, ELECTRIC AGE is rounded out by powerhouse frontman Junior Rodrigues, a singer who channels the power of Michael Kiske (Helloween, Place Vendome) and channels it with an earthy soulfulness that suits their tunes perfectly.\r\n\r\nJoining forces with Divebomb Records for the label’s Bootcamp Series, ELECTRIC AGE is set to release their self-titled 6-song debut EP.

It wasn’t until the metamorphosis that resulted in EVERTHRONE being born that the band was truly firing on all cylinders. On their Jamie King-produced debut album, <i>Evil Tongues</i>, the group take their progressive metal sound and underscore it with a synth-driven rhythmic thrust that was so prevalent during the golden age of darkwave in the '80s.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of forward-thinking heavy metal arrangements and synth-pop might sound a bit risky, but not only does EVERTHRONE make the unlikely stylistic combination work, they also make it all feel seamless and natural, a testament to the group's profound talents.

Instead, the 4-piece combo combine their superb talents and treat the listener with a seemingly never-ending barrage of neck-snapping guitar riffs and vocals that are as authoritative as they are memorable, resulting in a fresh-sounding set of songs.

Essentially, MINISTERS OF ANGER was a two man wrecking crew as David had partnered up with former Murdercar band mate Dave McClain (Sacred Reich, Machine Head) in 1988 to help record drums on his demo. The duo wound up cranking out two demos, both engineered by Joe Floyd (Warrior). The first demo from 1988 went unnoticed but the second, <i>Renaissance</i>, released in 1990 is what really caught people’s attention. Not full on thrash metal, but not quite eccentric enough to be considered progressive MINISTERS OF ANGER fell somewhere into a grey area it would have seemed. Some might believe this to be an unfortunate place to find themselves, but what it really reveals is a band that was not afraid to take risks and ultimately was far ahead of the rest of the pack even if the appropriate accolades of the masses never came.\r\n\r\n<b>COMRADES IN ARMS:</b>\r\nDamn The Machine, Sacred Reich, Watchtower, Forbidden and Death Angel.\r\n\r\n<b>ARSENAL:</b>\r\nLimited Edition CD – only 500 units pressed worldwide – new artwork – band supplied photos – full color 12 page booklet with lyrics – new interview with David Clemmons \r\n\r\n1.

While during their early years they embraced the popularity of the exploding Thrash scene, but they simply were not content attempting to fit a mold of what that type of band should be. They grew more exploratory, stretching their creative wings and drifting further into much more progressive territories. Was this a calculated maneuver or a huge misstep on their part? History might suggest the latter, but these 6 demo tapes reveal a band embracing their enigmatic destiny and steamrolling headlong down the road less traveled.\r\n\r\n<b>COMRADES IN ARMS:</b>\r\nWatchtower, Anacrusis, Toxik and Psychotic Waltz\r\n\r\n<b>ARSENAL:</b>\r\nLimited Edition 2xCD – only 500 units pressed worldwide – new artwork – band supplied photos – full color 12 page booklet with lyrics – new interview with band members \r\n\r\n<i>DISC 1</i>\r\nKNOWLEDGE AT HAND (1995)\r\n1.

He quickly enlisted the help of former classmate Mike Morgan, John Luke Hebert and David Harbour – both of whom would eventually join CHASTAIN and KING DIAMOND. After rehearsals, selecting the moniker MANTA RAY, the group entered the famous Dallas Sound Lab Studios (PANTERA, RIGOR MORTIS) studio and laid down four tracks they hoped would land them a record deal. Despite the extremely professional demo the band found themselves caught within a transitioning time in the industry and ultimately no deal was found. This Dallas Sound Lab session has been buried for over 20 years.\r\n\r\n<b>COMRADES IN ARMS:</b>\r\nQueensryche, Crimson Glory, Fates Warning and Sanctuary\r\n\r\n<b>ARSENAL:</b>\r\nLimited Edition CD – only 500 units pressed worldwide – new artwork – band supplied photos – full color 8 page booklet with lyrics – new interview with Lance Harvill\r\n\t\r\n1.

The result, thankfully, was their one and only masterpiece, <i>The Dying Race</i>.  CROWS, while championing a melodic power metal style, signed to then German upstart label, Century Media Records, in 1990 and found themselves buried and a bit out of place within the label’s predominantly death metal roster.  However, that didn’t stop them from making one of the best power metal records you have probably never heard before.  \r\n\r\nCROWS as a group may not be instantly recognizable, but its members on the other hand surely went onto bigger things once they disbanded.  Vocalist, Leszek “Leo” Szpigiel has fronted SCANNER and MEKONG DELTA while both drummer, Bobby Schottkowski and guitarist, Bernd Kost wound up on German thrash powerhouse, SODOM.  Finally bassist, Frank “Banx” Bankowski, served as the key member of ANGEL DUST throughout that band’s history. Whatever the case may be, CROWS, seemed to have the deck stacked against them from the onset, but it didn’t prevent <i>The Dying Race</i> from happening – which is the blessing in disguise.  \r\n\r\nDivebomb Records has stepped in to make sure <i>The Dying Race</i> is never to be forgotten with this special deluxe edition reissue.  The liner notes feature new interview with CROWS founding member, Bobby Schottkowski. Besides containing brand new remastered album audio it also includes 7, band supplied demo tracks (4 from their <i>The Legions</i> demo and 3 of which are unreleased).  This is the ultimate edition of a true power metal classic.\r\n  \r\n\r\n<b>FOR FANS OF:</b>\r\nBLIND GUARDIAN, ANGEL DUST, GAMMA RAY, SCANNER & HELLOWEEN\r\n\r\n<b>POINTS OF INTEREST:</b>\r\n+ FIRST TIME ON CD IN NORTH AMERICA\r\n+ LIMITED EDITION (CD ONLY)\r\n+ NEW INTERVIEW WITH DRUMMER (BOBBY SCHOTTKOWSKI)\r\n+ MEMBERS WENT ON TO SCANNER, MEKONG DELTA, ANGEL DUST and SODOM\r\n+ INCLUDES RARE, BAND SUPPLIED, DEMO TRACKS\r\n+ ARTWORK BY AXEL HERMANN (ICED EARTH, MORGOTH, UNLEASHED)\r\n+ REMASTERED BY JAMIE KING\r\n+ LAYOUT RESTORATION BY ADAM PETERSON\r\n\r\n<b>TRACK LIST:</b>\r\n1.

Signing to Germany’s Massacre Records the band released four critically acclaimed albums throughout the 90’s and just last year released, <i>Unholy War</i>, their first new album in 12 years.

Quickly picking up S.L. Coe (ex-Angel Dust) to fill the vacated spot, the band forged onward with 1990’s <i>Terminal Earth</i>. Decidedly not following the previous album’s concept, Coe struck out on his own lyrically with solid tracks like “From the Dust of Ages,” “Wonder,” “Not Alone” and “The Law.” Musically speaking, SCANNER marched forward continuing to carry the torch of power metal across the globe pushing the genre into new markets. But even with these two impressive albums in their repertoire, and the flourishing power metal scene growing so rapidly, it would seem the plague of continued member departures would spell out disaster for SCANNER when this era of the band came to a close in 1990.\r\n\r\n<i>Terminal Earth</i> has been out of print for nearly 20 years, and not surprisingly, fetching high dollar collector prices online.

SCANNER’s 1988 debut concept album, <i>Hypertrace</i>, was as good as any album out at the time, if not better.\r\n\r\nConceptually speaking, <i>Hypertrace</i> was an intriguing tale of space travel and the bettering of humanity, while sonically it was filled to the brim with charging thunderous riffage and ear-piercing vocals (thanks to guest vocalist, Ralf Scheepers).\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that it flew under the commercial radar, <i>Hypertrace</i> is still beloved by cult metal aficionados today and ripe to be discovered by legions of younger power metal fans curious of the movement's origins.

Yet, there's one band that despite never achieving the same glory some of their contemporaries enjoyed is still adored and respected amongst cultist metal fans all these years later. We’re talking about Lake Worth thrash heathens RAPED APE.\r\n\r\nNamed after car mechanic slang for something moving very quickly, RAPED APE did precisely that within the Southern Florida metal scene. Releasing three demos (1988’s <i>In Ape We Trust</i>, 1990’s <i>Perpetual Aggravation</i> and 1991’s <i>Lost In Mind</i>) and opening for some of the biggest metal bands at that time (CORONER, SEPULTURA, OVERKILL and M.O.D.). Eventually, the group entered the famed Morrisound Recording studios to work with producer extraordinaire Scott Burns to track their debut EP, 1993’s <i>Terminal Reality</i>. Now celebrating its 20th anniversary, this new Divebomb Records collection combines not only the original <i>Terminal Reality</i> EP, but also four of the band’s long sought-after demo tapes all of which lead up to their signing to Century Media Records.\r\n\r\nA must-own for any fan of underground thrash, this <i>Land Of Broken Promises</i> limited edition set contains brand new mastering from original source tapes and a massive 16-page booklet with member-supplied scrapbook styled memorabilia encompassing RAPED APE’s entire history. As a bonus, Divebomb Records has included an enhanced portion containing seven archival live videos of the band in their prime. \r\n\r\n<b>FOR FANS OF:</b>\r\nSEPULTURA, OVERKILL, ANTHRAX, SOLSTICE and D.R.I.\r\n\r\n<b>POINTS OF INTEREST:</b>\r\n+ 20TH ANNIVERSARY FOR <i>TERMINAL REALITY</i> EP\r\n+ FIRST OFFICIAL CD RELEASE OF ALL 4 DEMO TAPES \r\n+ 7 BONUS LIVE VIDEOS\r\n+ LINER NOTE ACCOLADES BY MEMBERS OF CANNIBAL CORPSE, SOLSTICE, PRO-PAIN\r\n+ <i>TERMINAL REALITY</i> PRODUCED BY SCOTT BURNS (CANNIBAL CORPSE, DEICIDE, SOLSTICE)\r\n+ OUT OF PRINT SINCE EARLY 90’s\r\n+ CHANGED NAME TO PAINGOD – RELEASED ONE ALBUM VIA CENTURY MEDIA\r\n+ LIMITED EDITION\r\n+ NEW MASTERING BY JAMIE KING\r\n+ LAYOUT/RESTORATION BY ADAM PETERSON (WATCHTOWER, EPIDEMIC and SOLSTICE)\r\n\r\n<b>TRACK LIST:</b>\r\nDISC 1\r\n<i>Terminal Reality</i> – EP (1992)\r\n1.

Not only was their bridging of thrash with traditionally-flavored heavy metal songwriting instantly irresistible, they also had the major label muscle of Chrysalis Records behind them. But fate had other plans.\r\n\r\n<i>God’s Gift</i>, TORANAGA’s 1990 sophomore album, should have propelled the group to headliner status. The record features barnburners such as the speedy assault of “Psychotic” alongside BLACK SABBATH-like stompers like “Black Is the Mask.” MTV’s Headbangers Ball even gave album single “The Shrine” some airplay, but a series of bad record label decisions ultimately killed off any chance of <i>God’s Gift</i> truly finding a wider audience. After recording an EP as a last ditch effort to keep the band signed to Chrysalis, TORANAGA pulled the plug on the entire thing.\r\n\r\nAlways on a mission to right the wrongs of metal history, Divebomb Records now presents this deluxe edition of <i>God’s Gift</i> in newly remastered form. The album also features a brand new interview with the band by Noisecreep.com’s Carlos Ramirez, plus archival photos. If that weren’t already enough, Divebomb is including the aforementioned EP, which has never been released before. It’s the kind of deluxe packaging TORANAGA truly deserves.\r\n\r\n<b>FOR FANS OF:</b>\r\nOVERKILL, SAVATAGE, METALLICA, SABBAT and SATAN \r\n\r\n<b>POINTS OF INTEREST:</b>\r\n+ NEW BAND INTERVIEW BY CARLOS RAMIREZ OF AOL MUSIC’S NOISECREEP.COM\r\n+ INCLUDES 3 UNRELEASED TRACKS RECORDED AFTER ALBUM\r\n+ OUT OF PRINT SINCE EARLY 90’s\r\n+ FESTIVAL APPEARANCES IN SUMMER 2013\r\n+ BRAND NEW ALBUM IN THE WORKS CURRENTLY\r\n+ LIMITED EDITION\r\n+ NEW MASTERING BY JAMIE KING\r\n+ LAYOUT/RESTORATION BY ADAM PETERSON (WATCHTOWER, EPIDEMIC and SOLSTICE)\r\n\r\n<b>TRACK LIST:</b>\r\n1.

Just two years later, the band had matured significantly. The guys in DEATHROW found that 1988 was a headier, bar-raising new metal world; their third album, <i>Deception Ignored</i>, had to be light years ahead of anything they’d done previously. And it was. It wasn’t even necessarily ahead of its time; it was very much of its time, rubbing shoulders with a small, rarified set of bands (Watchtower, Voivod, Coroner) taking the heavier side of metal into wilder territory in the name of progress. \r\n\r\nThe album has been out of print for nearly 20 years and fetching high dollar collector prices online, but DEATHROW has remained a cult favorite with die-hard thrash fans.

SLAMMER were no exception and their 1989 debut album, <i>The Work Of Idle Hands</i>, delivered some of the highest caliber thrash the scene had heard from both sides of the Atlantic.  \r\n\r\nProducer Mark Dodson (Judas Priest, Anthrax, Suicidal Tendencies) honed SLAMMER’s razor sharp attack into this single shot of metallic brilliance and all who heard it thought SLAMMER had the best chance of any of the bands to break big.  But, as heard far too regularly, piss poor promotion and other extenuating circumstances all proved fatal to the band’s chances at glory.  \r\n\r\nThe album has been out of print for nearly 20 years and fetching high dollar collector prices online, but SLAMMER has remained a cult favorite with die-hard thrash fans.  <i>The Work Of Idle Hands</i> limited edition contains brand new mastering and a redesigned 16 page booklet with scrapbook style memorabilia clippings of the band’s history.

These partnerships proved extremely successful with tracks like “Bad Time For Goodbye,” “More Than A Memory,” “Hard To Find An Easy Way,” and “Take Me Home” all becoming immediate fan favorites and remaining completely relevant in today’s music market despite the passage of nearly 20 years. <i>Nevertheless</i> is a timeless album for a timeless style of American melodic rock.\r\n\r\n<i>Nevertheless</i> has been unavailable since the mid-90s and this Divebomb Records edition features newly remastered audio, 2012 interview with BRETT WALKER conducted by Line Of Fire’s Shawn Pelata and personal photos from the album's recording sessions.

The self-released cassette from Uppsala’s MIDAS TOUCH rapidly made its way through trading circles and as such attracted attention from a prominent German metal label Noise Records. The label that counted acts like Helloween, Vendetta and Coroner on their storied roster, eventually signed Midas Touch on the strength of their demo.\r\n\r\nProducer Roy M. Rowland (Laaz Rockit, Kreator, Testament) was brought in to work on what would become Midas Touch's sole album, 1989's <i>Presage of Disaster</i>. A rollicking romp of technical thrash in the vein of Deathrow, Sabbat and D.B.C., the album garnered raves from the metal literati, eventually gaining sales in excess of 60,000 units.\r\n\r\nBut along the pathway to assured success Midas Touch’s flame was extinguished, ending their run while demoing material for their unreleased second album, <i>The Deliberate Stranger</i>. As unfortunate as their early demise was, Midas Touch unquestionably still left its mark on the metal world with their menacing debut, <i>Presage of Disaster</i>.\r\n\r\nThe album has been out of print for nearly 20 years and fetching high dollar collector prices online, but MIDAS TOUCH has remained a cult favorite with die-hard thrash fans.  This <i>Presage Of Disaster</i> deluxe edition contains brand new mastering and a redesigned 16 page booklet with scrapbook style memorabilia clippings of the band’s history plus new interview and essay.

Enlisting top producer, Roger Probert (Fates Warning, Loudness) the band record their album independently hoping to land a deal.  They landed a deal quickly and at the behest of their new label, mixing engineer and industry heavyweight, Max Norman was brought in to finish the album.  Nine tracks of immaculate, sometimes macabre, American heavy metal.  Inspired by classic acts like Iron Maiden and Mercyful Fate the band also infused influences of the thrash/speed metal dominated era to develop a style that was all their own.  Not necessarily aggressive enough to be called thrash, but much heavier than the classic styles of heavy metal – this was DEAD ON.  \r\n\r\nThe album has been out of print for years, but now with the release of this limited <i>Dead On</i> (Deluxe Edition) not only do fans get the classic album and three music videos, but also their <i>All Four You</i> EP, unreleased cover of “Turning Japanese” plus ultra rare demo tape, “The Limit.”  For the fans, by the fans.\r\n\r\n<b>FOR FANS OF:</b>\r\nMETALLICA, OVERKILL, MEGADETH, SANCTUARY and MERCYFUL FATE \r\n\r\n<b>POINTS OF INTEREST:</b>\r\n+ NEW INTERVIEW WITH GUITARISTS – MICHAEL CARONIA & TONY FRAZITTA\r\n+ “DIFFERENT BREED” FEATURED ON CULT HORROR FILM “SHOCKER” SOUNDTRACK\r\n+ ALSO CONTAINS UNRELEASED DEMO TAPE & COVER SONG PLUS OUT OF PRINT EP\r\n+ THREE MUSIC VIDEOS INCLUDED\r\n+ ARCHIVAL PHOTOS/SHOW FLYERS PROVIDED BY BAND (16 PAGE BOOKLET)\r\n+ PRODUCED BY ROGER PROBERT (FATES WARNING & LOUDNESS)\r\n+ MIXED BY MAX NORMAN (MEGADETH, OZZY OSBOURNE & MALICE)\r\n+ LIMITED EDITION \r\n+ NEW MASTERING BY JAMIE KING\r\n+ LAYOUT/RESTORATION BY ADAM PETERSON (SOLSTICE, EPIDEMIC, D.A.M. and WATCHTOWER)\r\n\r\n<b>TRACK LIST:</b>\r\nDISC 1\r\n1.

Knowingly an uphill battle, D.A.M. managed to release two impressive albums (1989’s <i>Human Wreckage</i> and 1991’s <i>Inside Out</i>) during their initial years.  Two albums, despite being tracked in Germany with legendary producer Harris Johns, are distinctively British in their use of simplistic and crunching riffs rather than relying solely on technical aptitude.  The strength of big chords and rousing choruses were employed by D.A.M. to great success.  \r\n\r\n<i>Human Wreckage</i> and <i>Inside Out</i> remain popular now 20 years later, despite being out of print for two decades, due to the band’s original desire to cross boundaries and stave off being labeled haphazardly as simply another “thrash band,” but instead be remembered as a classic British heavy metal band.

And that’s the real beauty of <i>Control And Resistance</i>. The rebel spirit of heavy metal isn’t really found in the hordes of spikes-and-leather clone bands and similar fourth-raters that continue to litter metalworld.  The true rebel spirit of heavy metal is right here, in the eight sophisticated songs of <i>Control And Resistance</i> that exist only because the creators wanted to bring something truly original into the world. Odd, maybe, that true metal spirit would burn brightest on an album of sublime, progressive tech-metal, but there you have it.

In 1991, they recorded a demo produced by legendary producer Jim Morris and signed a deal with Germany’s SPV/Steamhammer and their debut album was released in 1992.  It was originally to be titled <i>The Sentencing</i>, but delays in correspondence didn’t reach Germany in time so it was simply known as <i>Solstice</i>.  The following year internal issues combined with Rob Barrett departing for a position in Cannibal Corpse forced the band into hiatus, but in 1995 they regrouped and returned with the magnificent sophomore album, <i>Pray</i>.  \r\n\r\nBoth albums are considered classics in the death/thrash crossover genre and at that time no bands were pushing the limits like SOLSTICE.  The band is currently active once again and in 2011 Dennis Munoz remixed <i>Pray</i> as an exclusive addition to this collector’s set.  <i>Pray For The Sentencing</i> is something underground metal fans have been talking about for years and we at Divebomb Records are happy to give it to them.  It contains both legendary albums in original form  (remastered), plus the newly remixed version of <i>Pray</i>.

The band had created quite a stir by playing all over the southeast and landing two tours in Europe, including the now legendary \"Gods of Grind\" tour with Carcass and Entombed.  With the release of their debut album, <i>Condemned</i>, the band felt as though their chance was at hand to show the world what they knew, that CONFESSOR was unlike anything else out at the time.  Unfortunately, label merging and politics forced CONFESSOR off of the U.S. leg of that famous tour in favor of the latest \"new band\".  Confessor's ongoing struggles with their label led to line up changes that seriously altered the band's trajectory and eventually they disbanded after only a single album was released.  Luckily, over the years CONFESSOR’s controversial, yet pioneering sound became accepted and adored by many in the metal community and in 2004 the band reunited for some festival appearances.  They have reunited once again for a special appearance at the Maryland Deathfest in 2012.\r\n\r\n<i>Uncontrolled</i> is the first time all three Confessor demo tapes have been released officially.  These are the demos that helped the band get signed to Earache Records back in 1990 and led to the eventual release of their now ground-breaking, <i>Condemned</i>, debut album.  This collection is long overdue and fans have been demanding it for years so we, at Divebomb Records, are happy to oblige them.  For the diehards we have unearthed raw archival live footage as part of both an enhanced CD and bonus DVD. For the fans, by the fans.\r\n\r\n<b>FOR FANS OF:</b>\r\nTROUBLE, CANDLEMASS, WATCHTOWER and progressive doom\r\n\r\n<b>POINTS OF INTEREST:</b>\r\n+ FIRST TIME ALL THREE DEMOS OFFICIALLY RELEASED TOGETHER\r\n+ BRAND NEW ESSAY BY JEFF WAGNER (AUTHOR OF MEAN DEVIATION – FOUR DECADES OF PROGRESSIVE HEAVY METAL)\r\n+ EARACHE RECORDS DEBUT HAS 30,000-40,000 UNITS IN CIRCULATION\r\n+ CONFIRMED REUNION APPEARANCE AT MARYLAND DEATHFEST 2012\r\n+ LIMITED EDITION WITH ARCHIVAL DVD (Limited to first pressing)\r\n\r\n<b>TRACK LIST:</b>\r\n01 Collapse Into Despair\r\n02 Alone\r\n03 Condemned\r\n04 Uncontrolled\r\n05 Prepare Yourself\r\n06 Suffer\r\n07 The Secret\r\n08 Deception\r\n09 Eve Of Salvation \r\n10 Uncontrolled (Vile Vibes Version)\r\n11 The Secret (Metal Massacre X Version)\r\n\r\n<b>“DIE-HARD” BONUS TRACKS</b>\r\n12 Words Of Praise (Live at Fame City)\r\n13 Addictive Bind (Live In Raleigh)\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 200px; height: 200px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2211910357/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://tribunalrecords.bandcamp.com/album/uncontrolled\">Uncontrolled by CONFESSOR</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":17527207,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54912015/-/confessor1400x.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54912015/-/confessor1400x.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55411755/-/confessor_promo.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55411755/-/confessor_promo.jpg","width":930,"height":547}],"artists":[{"id":105347,"name":"Confessor","permalink":"confessor","url":"/artist/confessor"}],"categories":[{"id":107817,"name":">> Divebomb Records Store","permalink":"divebomb-records-store","url":"/category/divebomb-records-store"},{"id":81949,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"},{"id":147866,"name":"DVD","permalink":"dvd","url":"/category/dvd"}]},{"id":6344245,"name":"CONFESSOR - SHIRT","permalink":"confessor-shirt","position":43,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/confessor-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-02T06:34:05.000Z","description":"We have been given the task of selling off the remainder of CONFESSOR shirts the band printed for their two reunion shows.

On one hand, it was a no holds barred metal band intent on bashing out mean riffs and complex rhythm changes.  On the other hand, FLY MACHINE was a band eager to break the confines of underground metal and explore other sounds.  The band were originally the remnants of Raleigh's own metal heavyweights, Confessor, and are now members of Loincloth (Southern Lord Recordings).  This collection of songs, <i>Come Metamorphosis</i>, represents the transition from Confessor to FLY MACHINE.  Much of this material had been written as Confessor prior to Scott’s (vocalist) departure, but FLY MACHINE had a very different way of delivering the same heavy music. There are obvious elements of Confessor's identity throughout this anthology, but in the end FLY MACHINE became a very different band. <i>Come Metamorphosis</i> contains 8 tracks the band had self-released in the mid-90’s and 3 never before released tracks.  All tracks have been remastered by Jamie King at his Basement Studios in 2012.

The English combo’s 1986 <i>Sword of Justice</i> demo became a staple on tape trading lists throughout the globe, and their <i>At the Edge of Damnation</i> debut album the next year garnered the group rave reviews and set up what seemed to be a bright future for the speedsters.\r\n\r\nIn 1988 DEATHWISH unleashed their sophomore album, a menacing slab of vinyl entitled <i>Demon Preacher</i>. Packed with biting lyrics and one machete-sharp riff after the other, the 9-song collection should have propelled DEATHWISH to the commercial league bands like Overkill, Kreator and Exodus were running in, but a series of setbacks ultimately killed off any chance of that happening. \r\n\r\nDivebomb Records reissue of <i>Demon Preacher</i> contains not only newly remastered audio but archival photos provided by the band and a brand new interview with David Brunt and Brad Sims conducted by Editor-in-Chief of AOL Music’s Noisecreep, Carlos Ramirez.  For the fans, by the fans.\r\n\r\n<b>FOR FANS OF:</b>\r\nMETALLICA, SLAYER, EXCITER and MOTORHEAD\r\n\r\n<b>POINTS OF INTEREST:</b>\r\n+ FULL COLOR BOOKLET WITH BAND SUPPLIED ARCHIVAL PHOTOS\r\n+ LONG OUT OF PRINT\r\n+ DIGITALLY REMASTERED BY JAMIE KING\r\n+ NEW INTERVIEW WITH FOUNDING MEMBERS DAVID BRUNT & BRAD SIMS\r\n\r\n<b>TRACK LIST:</b>\r\n01 Death Procession\r\n02 Demon Preacher\r\n03 Carrion\r\n04 Visions Of Insanity\r\n05 Symptom Of The Universe\r\n06 Wall Of Lies\r\n07 Prey To The Lord\r\n08 Fatal Attraction\r\n09 Past Life\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 200px; height: 200px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=230380705/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://tribunalrecords.bandcamp.com/album/demon-preacher\">Demon Preacher by DEATHWISH</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":17526325,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54912079/-/deathwish1400x.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54912079/-/deathwish1400x.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53325001/-/Deathwish.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53325001/-/Deathwish.jpg","width":1000,"height":658}],"artists":[{"id":105325,"name":"Deathwish","permalink":"deathwish","url":"/artist/deathwish"}],"categories":[{"id":107817,"name":">> Divebomb Records Store","permalink":"divebomb-records-store","url":"/category/divebomb-records-store"},{"id":81949,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":5430143,"name":"IRONCHRIST - Getting The Most Out Of Your Extinction","permalink":"ironchrist-getting-the-most-out-of-your-extinction","position":47,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ironchrist-getting-the-most-out-of-your-extinction","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-09T02:37:49.000Z","description":"<b>DIVE021</b>\r\nCD\r\n\r\n<b>OVERVIEW:</b>\r\nBlending the raw and unfiltered aggression of punk with the technical skills and forward-thinking songwriting of thrash metal, IRONCHRIST should have become a household name. Although they were only around for a few years in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, the Maryland band’s musical output is among the most cherished by connoisseurs of the thrash and crossover eras. Outside of Voivod and late period DBC, few groups were playing the post-apocalyptic thrash thing as potently as IRONCHRIST did.  \r\n\r\nDivebomb Records deluxe edition of <i>Getting The Most Out Of Your Extinction</i> features the classic album as well as bonus tracks from their 12” EP and demo tape. It also features a brand new essay by editor of AOL Music’s Noisecreep, Carlos Ramirez who conducted new interviews with three of the original four members to help shed some light on IRONCHRIST’s brief rise and ultimate demise.

Unfortunately, as with far too many bands back then, they were unable to fully capitalize on the growing momentum because of personal struggles within their ranks and then the sudden closing of Combat Records.  When Sony Records closed the doors at Combat Records this left CYCLONE TEMPLE without a label, but instead of calling it quits the band regrouped and soldiered on. They continued combining elements of thrash metal, groove and even reggae into a style we think was misunderstood and too far ahead of its time back in the early 90’s. <i>Building Errors In The Machine</i> and <i>My Friend Lonely</i>, two formerly independent and diverse releases, are collected here in this deluxe edition reissue with remastered audio and new essay by Editor-in-Chief of AOL Music’s Noisecreep, Carlos Ramirez.

We could have simply halted work given the dire circumstances but quitters we are definitely not, so we forged on and now we have 21 tracks (most never before released) to present to all the fans in this special digital collection.  Kick back, crank it up and enjoy our 100th release for what it symbolizes…having fun!\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>TRACK LIST:</b>\r\n01 THE FEDS – Barracuda\r\n02 BLATANT DISARRAY – Holy Wars…The Punishment Due\r\n03 ARIA (with Christopher Kincaid) – Clocks\r\n04 VANISHER – Of Wolf & Man\r\n05 AGE OF RUIN – Buried Dreams\r\n06 ASECRETDEATH – Welcome To The Machine\r\n07 KILLWHITNEYDEAD – Sacrifice\r\n08 SLOWMOTION APOCALYPSE – The Razor’s Edge\r\n09 LINE OF FIRE - I Will Remember\r\n10 WOMBWRECKER – Here I Stay\r\n11 JONIN – Caffeine\r\n12 HE IS LEGEND – Wounded\r\n13 SARGANT FURY – Maniac\r\n14 CENTURY – A Kiss From A Rose\r\n15 CANVAS SOLARIS – Arc Lite\r\n16 UNCLE SLAM – Dazed & Confused \r\n17 ENEMY IS US – Stockholm Syndrome\r\n18 SWIFT – Unbelievable\r\n19 VANISHER – Superbeast\r\n20 SLOWMOTION APOCALYPSE – Be Quick Or Be Dead\r\n21 KILLWHITNEYDEAD/JONIN – Vote With A Bullet\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 200px; height: 200px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=85433126/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://tribunalrecords.bandcamp.com/album/tribunal-records-100-cover-to-cover\">Tribunal Records 100: Cover To Cover by VARIOUS ARTISTS</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":17472769,"name":"*DO NOT ADD TO CART - Use Bandcamp link above**","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53144955/-/TRB100_1400x.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53144955/-/TRB100_1400x.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":5713,"name":"A Secret Death","permalink":"a-secret-death","url":"/artist/a-secret-death"},{"id":2365,"name":"Age Of Ruin","permalink":"age-of-ruin","url":"/artist/age-of-ruin"},{"id":2370,"name":"Aria","permalink":"aria","url":"/artist/aria"},{"id":5903,"name":"Blatant Disarray","permalink":"blatant-disarray","url":"/artist/blatant-disarray"},{"id":2375,"name":"Canvas Solaris","permalink":"canvas-solaris","url":"/artist/canvas-solaris"},{"id":2376,"name":"Century","permalink":"century","url":"/artist/century"},{"id":2382,"name":"Enemy Is Us","permalink":"enemy-is-us","url":"/artist/enemy-is-us"},{"id":2388,"name":"He Is Legend","permalink":"he-is-legend","url":"/artist/he-is-legend"},{"id":2391,"name":"Jonin","permalink":"jonin","url":"/artist/jonin"},{"id":2360,"name":"Killwhitneydead.","permalink":"killwhitneydead","url":"/artist/killwhitneydead"},{"id":2395,"name":"Line Of Fire","permalink":"line-of-fire","url":"/artist/line-of-fire"},{"id":8360,"name":"Sargant Fury","permalink":"sargant-fury","url":"/artist/sargant-fury"},{"id":2405,"name":"Slowmotion Apocalypse","permalink":"slowmotion-apocalypse","url":"/artist/slowmotion-apocalypse"},{"id":2407,"name":"Swift","permalink":"swift","url":"/artist/swift"},{"id":2417,"name":"The Feds","permalink":"the-feds","url":"/artist/the-feds"},{"id":9912,"name":"Uncle Slam","permalink":"uncle-slam","url":"/artist/uncle-slam"},{"id":43121,"name":"Vanisher","permalink":"vanisher","url":"/artist/vanisher"},{"id":104443,"name":"Wombwrecker","permalink":"wombwrecker","url":"/artist/wombwrecker"}],"categories":[{"id":2873329,"name":"DIGITAL DOWNLOADS","permalink":"digital-downloads","url":"/category/digital-downloads"}]},{"id":7006457,"name":"DIVEBOMB - 2012 \"Noise\" (SHIRT)","permalink":"divebomb-2012-noise-shirt","position":54,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/divebomb-2012-noise-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-19T20:22:10.000Z","description":"New 2012 Divebomb Records shirt.

After releasing 3 demos and some DIY touring with Attila (Artery Recordings) and Wretched (Victory Records) the band decided to take the necessary steps to make certain their first full length, The Depths Of Hell, would be able to compete sonically with the current crop of death metal influenced hardcore.  Enlisting producer, Kyle Odell, LABYRINTHE headed into his Attack Time Studios and the end result was phenomenal.  The Depths Of Hell is 100% pulverizing aggression that fuses death metal tinged riffing, confrontational lyrical imagery and calculated breakdowns. Given Tribunal Records 12 year history within the North Carolina metal scene it was only a matter of time before this union would become official.  \r\n\r\n<b>FOR FANS OF:</b>\r\nWHITECHAPEL, THE ACACIA STRAIN, OCEANO, SUICIDE SILENCE and CARNIFEX\r\n\r\n<b>TRACK LIST:</b>\r\n01 Body Chute\r\n02 Flesh Fixation\r\n03 Blood Baster\r\n04 Raped By Trees\r\n05 Saw Mill Road\r\n06 Razor Wire Noose\r\n07 Gutter Sludge\r\n08 Defiance\r\n09 Bordello For The Dead\r\n10 Cauterizer \r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 200px; height: 200px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2651851009/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://tribunalrecords.bandcamp.com/album/the-depths-of-hell\">The Depths Of Hell by LABYRINTHE</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":16387945,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49555347/-/labyrinthe-600x.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49555347/-/labyrinthe-600x.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/49555355/-/LABYRINTHE_promo_picture.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/49555355/-/LABYRINTHE_promo_picture.jpg","width":600,"height":400}],"artists":[{"id":95781,"name":"Labyrinthe","permalink":"labyrinthe","url":"/artist/labyrinthe"}],"categories":[{"id":81949,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":2800142,"name":"FORTÉ - Stranger Than Fiction [Deluxe Edition]","permalink":"fortÉ-stranger-than-fiction-deluxe-edition","position":57,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fortÉ-stranger-than-fiction-deluxe-edition","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-10-14T01:55:15.000Z","description":"<b>DIVE018</b>\r\nCD\r\n\r\n<b>OVERVIEW:</b>\r\nFORTÉ was founded in Oklahoma City in 1987 by brothers Jeff and Greg Scott and were in time joined by bassist Ghames “Rev” Jones and ex-Oliver Magnum vocalist, James Randel.  In the early stages FORTÉ played an abundant of shows quickly establishing themselves within the flourishing underground metal scene by opening for bands like Pantera, Dream Theater, Fates Warning, Watchtower, Overkill, Savatage and Trouble.  \r\n\r\nAfter spending time on the road hammering out and fine tuning everything they recorded and released their (now) classic <i>Dementia By Design</i> demo tape in 1989.  It was both fan and critic favorite and their popularity began to spread worldwide as it went on to sell a stunning 1,500 copies.  The demo’s title track was even featured on Metal Blade Records’ Metal Massacre series giving the band even more exposure which they certainly used to their advantage.  Not wanting to slow the building momentum they delivered an impressive showcase at the Foundations Forum.  Germany’s Massacre Records was in attendance and quickly signed FORTÉ to their first recording contract.  \r\n\r\nTheir debut, <i>Stranger Than Fiction</i>, was released in 1992 stunning both critics and their ever expanding fan base with its intensity, speed, power and excellent use of melody.  <i>Stranger Than Fiction</i> has been unavailable for years and with the line-up back together and prepping a new album for release in 2011 we decided it was time to re-release this classic slab of melodic/power/thrash metal.  Working in conjunction with the band we were able to unearth two original FORTÉ demo tapes for inclusion on this new deluxe edition to make it the most comprehensive collection of their early years.\r\n\r\n<b>FOR FANS OF:</b>\r\nMETALLICA, VICIOUS RUMORS, TESTAMENT and HELSTAR.\r\n\r\n<b>POINTS OF INTEREST:</b>\r\n+ LIMITED EDITION OF 1,000\r\n+ DEBUT ALBUM FROM 1992 (4 ALBUMS TOTAL IN CAREER)\r\n+ INCLUDES BOTH 1990 & 1991 DEMO TAPES\r\n+ FULL COLOR BOOKLET WITH TONS OF BAND SUPPLIED ARCHIVAL PHOTOS\r\n+ LONG OUT OF PRINT\r\n+ REMASTERED BY JAMIE KING (2010)\r\n+ NEW ALBUM COMING IN 2011 (THIS LINE UP!)\r\n+ SHARED STAGES WITH PANTERA, DREAM THEATER, MANOWAR, SEPULTURA, BIOHAZARD\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>TRACK LIST:</b>\r\n1.

After their <i>Annihilation Complete</i> demo (1987) garnered instant critical acclaim (voted “best demo of 1987” by the readers of Metal Forces magazine), the band signed a two album deal with UK label, Active Records. The combo then released their debut and follow-up albums, <i>Suffering Hour</i> and <i>Reason</i> in 1988 and 1990 respectively.  With their Active Records contract obligations fulfilled and momentum building, the band knew they needed a bigger marketing push behind them.  It was no surprise when Anacrusis signed on with U.S. powerhouse Metal Blade Records. This was exactly the kind of label the band needed in their corner.  Metal Blade eventually released Prog/Thrash/Power-Metal masterstrokes <i>Manic Impression</i> (1991) and <i>Screams & Whispers</i> (1993) -- both releases are considered forward-thinking metal landmarks.  Despite all the accolades the band received in 1993 they quietly disbanded following a European tour with Death.  \r\n\r\nAfter remaining dormant for more than 15 years, the band finally saw the release of its original <i>Annihilation Complete</i> demo in a limited edition CD/DVD set which included early video footage along with various demos and rehearsal clips.  With public interest re-engaged and a new crop of younger fans discovering the band, Anacrusis accepted an invitation to perform at Germany's KEEP IT TRUE XIII festival the following year.  With all of the original members in place -- Kenn Nardi, Kevin Heidbreder, John Emery and Mike Owen -- ANACRUSIS decided to re-record their <i>Suffering Hour</i> and <i>Reason</i> albums, and they have now been presented as the new <i>Hindsight</i> collection.  \r\n\r\n“This is just a dazzling display of technicality fused with aggression that has to be heard to be believed.” <b><i>Hardrock Haven</i></b>\r\n\r\n“In short, they did it right – they didn't go in and rewrite solos, make the lyrics 'more mature,' or try to tack on any 2010 insights onto 1988's material.

Chastain has gained a reputation over the last 25 years as a powerful, progressive guitarist whose music has been centered around his melodic and technically fluent fret board mastery.  <i>For Those Who Dare</i>, the fifth CHASTAIN album and originally released in 1990, showed David forging into new territory with the finest group of musicians he had ever worked with creating not only the most accessible metal record of his career but also the most inventive.  \r\n\r\nWhile David did remain the principle songwriter, he admitted that the band’s sound on <i>For Those Who Dare</i> wouldn’t have been the same without David Harbour (bass) and John Luke He’bert (drums) supplying their own individual trademark performances.  Besides David’s virtuoso style the other major attribute to CHASTAIN’s instantly distinct sound is vocalist Leather Leone’s superior and ultimately commanding presence.  \r\n\r\nOriginally brought together by Shrapnel Records’ Mike Varney, Leather quickly established herself as one of the greatest female heavy metal vocalists of all time appearing on all four previous and critically acclaimed CHASTAIN albums - <i>Mystery Of Illusion</i> (1985), <i>Ruler Of The Wasteland</i> (1986), <i>The 7th Of Never</i> (1987) & <i>Voice Of The Cult</i> (1988).  Ever since his recording debut in 1983 David Chastain has been wowing fans with his innovative and technically superb guitar playing.  <i>For Those Who Dare</i> is a perfect example that David Chastain was not just a great player, but also a talented songwriter and band leader with an exceptional group of collaborators to help make his melodic visions a reality.\r\n\r\n<b>FOR FANS OF:</b>\r\nDIO, WARLOCK, YNGWIE MALMSTEEN and RACER X\r\n\r\n<b>POINTS OF INTEREST:</b>\r\n+ LIMITED EDITION OF 1,000 – CD ONLY\r\n+ 5th ALBUM IN DISTINGUISHED CAREER\r\n+ LONG OUT OF PRINT\r\n+ NEW ESSAY/INTERVIEW BY CARLOS RAMIREZ (AOL MUSIC'S NOISECREEP)\r\n+ REMASTERED BY JAMIE KING (2010)\r\n+ INCLUDES COVER OF HEART CLASSIC “BARRACUDA”\r\n+ MEMBERS ALSO IN KING DIAMOND & MERCYFUL FATE\r\n+ FULL PARTICIPATION OF DAVID T.

Chastain.  Besides the brilliant, <i>Shock Waves</i>, LEATHER’s work with the metal band Chastain produced five (5) of the best releases in metal during that era - <i>Mystery Of Illusion</i> (1985), <i>Ruler Of The Wasteland</i> (1986), <i>The 7th Of Never</i> (1987), <i>Voice Of The Cult</i> (1988) and <i>For Those Who Dare</i> (1990).  She received rave reviews from magazines worldwide and is still regularly mentioned as one of the most powerful voices in heavy metal.\r\n\r\nOriginally released in 1989 via Roadrunner Records, <i>Shock Waves</i> featured some of the biggest names in heavy metal then either performing on the album or co-writing songs with LEATHER.  Producing the record was the metal legend himself, David T. Chastain.  Among the songwriters collaborating with LEATHER included David T.

Despite being a new band ELYSIUM found themselves playing an active part in the thriving Florida metal scene during the late eighties.  Besides finding time to record their <i>Inspired Hatred</i> demo they were sharing stages with “local” bands like Death, Cynic, Malevolent Creation, Solstice, Nasty Savage and as well as touring acts like Trouble and King Diamond.  \r\n\r\nELYSIUM’s only recorded work arrived as the <i>Inspired Hatred</i> demo tape.  This was not like any ordinary demo of its time due to the exceptional production it showcased.  <i>Inspired Hatred</i>’s high production value can be attributed to the fact that the band chose to work with engineer Tom Morris (Iced Earth, Morbid Angel, Coroner, Kreator, Sepultura) of the now and still legendary Morrisound Studios.  \r\n\r\nAlthough ELYSIUM found themselves recording at the traditional Floridian death metal headquarters they most definitely were not of the same ilk.  ELYSIUM instead chose a path of melodic and technical thrash metal.  Speedy tempos, rapid fire riffs and a unique vocal rasp all helped to set ELYSIUM off from the Floridian death metal pack.  Like many fans of cult metal <i>Inspired Hatred</i> has always remained one of Divebomb Records favorite unreleased gems and we are extremely excited to now give this classic demo it’s first proper release on CD.  This reissue not only includes the original <i>Inspired Hatred</i> demo tape, but also adds a bonus track and a full live set (video only) as part of an enhanced CD.\r\n\r\n<b>FOR FANS OF:</b>\r\nDEATH, ATHEIST, SABBAT, VIO-LENCE, KREATOR, CORONER and TESTAMENT\r\n\r\n<b>POINTS OF INTEREST:</b>\r\n- FIRST TIME ON CD\r\n- ENGINEERED BY TOM MORRIS (ICED EARTH, MORBID ANGEL, CORONER, KREATOR, SEPULTURA)\r\n- RECORDED AT LEGENDARY MORRISOUND STUDIOS IN 1989\r\n- MASTERED BY JAMIE KING IN 2010\r\n- LIMITED EDITION OF 1,000\r\n- BONUS TRACK, LIVE CONCERT VIDEO & BAND ARCHIVAL PICTURES\r\n\r\n<b>TRACK LIST:</b>\r\n01 Inspired Hatred\r\n02 Cold Turkey\r\n03 Dead Till The End\r\n04 Food Of The Gods\r\n05 Funeral In Vain\r\n06 Provocation Of Obscene Rage (P.O.O.R.)\r\n07 Plague Of Men\r\n08 Baby F*ck\r\n\r\n<i>BONUS TRACK</i>\r\n09 Crystal Blisters\r\n\r\nENHANCED LIVE VIDEO\r\nLive @ Rock It Club (Tampa – 1991)\r\n01 Dead Till The End\r\n02 Crystal Blisters\r\n03 Funeral In Vain\r\n04 Inspired Hatred\r\n05 Food Of The Gods\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 200px; height: 200px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2654573639/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://tribunalrecords.bandcamp.com/album/inspired-hatred\">Inspired Hatred by ELYSIUM</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":9504681,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26043445/-/ELYSIUM_cover_750.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26043445/-/ELYSIUM_cover_750.jpg","width":750,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26043469/-/ELYSIUM_PROMO_01_bw_750.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26043469/-/ELYSIUM_PROMO_01_bw_750.jpg","width":750,"height":468},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26911019/-/ELYSIUM_logo.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26911019/-/ELYSIUM_logo.jpg","width":697,"height":363}],"artists":[{"id":45105,"name":"Elysium","permalink":"elysium","url":"/artist/elysium"}],"categories":[{"id":107817,"name":">> Divebomb Records Store","permalink":"divebomb-records-store","url":"/category/divebomb-records-store"},{"id":81949,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":14247927,"name":"LINE OF FIRE + DIMAGE (Package Deal)","permalink":"line-of-fire-dimage-package-deal","position":65,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/line-of-fire-dimage-package-deal","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-17T22:35:47.000Z","description":"LINE OF FIRE <i>Momentum</i>\r\nLINE OF FIRE <i>Line Of Fire (Deluxe Edition)</i>\r\nDIMAGE <i>It Takes Time</i>\r\n\r\n*PACKAGE DEAL*\r\n\r\nGet three releases for a low price!\r\n\r\n*INTERNATIONAL ORDERS*\r\nYour order will ship without jewel cases.

The band had planned to swiftly capitalize on the glowing success of Line Of Fire but when the sessions for <i>Momentum</i> began in 2006 it seemed that fate had other plans. Numerous personnel problems, sudden and life threatening health issues and other disruptive elements ran rampant throughout the LINE OF FIRE camp. It’s a miracle the band survived such tumultuous times. But it’s been said that great music comes from great struggle and <i>Momentum</i> is the culmination of 5 years of very complicated and strenuous circumstances.  Despite the negative energies circulating during its conception, <i>Momentum</i> emerges as a bright light beaming from that dark period to carry the band forward and thrust them back into the spotlight of the AOR scene.\r\n\r\nTo help aid in the album’s completion, the band enlisted several session musicians (Killwhitneydead, The Demonstration, Hip Pocket) in addition to adding a new guitarist. Thomas Clark (Jonin) joined vocalist Shawn Pelata and guitarist Nikki Dimage as a permanent member of LINE OF FIRE and brought with him a new spark and creative insight. The resulting material doesn’t stray too far from the Melodic Rock formula for which the band is best known. Despite using digital technologies to track <i>Momentum</i>, the band wanted to draw influence from classic albums like Boston’s <i>Boston</i> and Journey’s <i>Departure</i> for a more raw and organic sound. A sound which producer Jamie King was easily able to deliver. <i>Momentum</i> is a standout Melodic Rock album through and through and should not disappoint any of the fans who have been waiting patiently for this long promised and much delayed sophomore album.\r\n\r\n<b>FOR FANS OF:</b>\r\nJOURNEY, BOSTON and all melodic rock.\r\n\r\n<b>POINTS OF INTEREST:</b>\r\n- Produced/Mixed by Jamie King\r\n- CD includes exclusive Dokken cover song\r\n- Guest session member of KILLWHITNEYDEAD and THE DEMONSTRATION\r\n- Shawn Pelata long time guest melodic vocalist on KWD albums\r\n\r\n<b>TRACK LIST:</b>\r\n01 It Takes Time \r\n02 Obsession \r\n03 Give Me All\r\n04 I'll Be The One Tonight\r\n05 I Belong\r\n06 The Fire Never Dies\r\n07 I'm Crying For You\r\n08 In The Stone\r\n09 Undone\r\n10 Ghost In Your Heart\r\n11 Breaking The Chains\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 200px; height: 200px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1253963859/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://tribunalrecords.bandcamp.com/album/momentum\">Momentum by LINE OF FIRE</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":9033511,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25162415/-/LOF_Momentum_750.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25162415/-/LOF_Momentum_750.jpg","width":750,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25529911/-/LOF_2010_-_Copy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25529911/-/LOF_2010_-_Copy.jpg","width":750,"height":502},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25309627/-/LOF_logo.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25309627/-/LOF_logo.jpg","width":700,"height":201}],"artists":[{"id":2395,"name":"Line Of Fire","permalink":"line-of-fire","url":"/artist/line-of-fire"}],"categories":[{"id":107817,"name":">> Divebomb Records Store","permalink":"divebomb-records-store","url":"/category/divebomb-records-store"},{"id":81949,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":2648610,"name":"LINE OF FIRE - Line Of Fire [Deluxe Edition]","permalink":"line-of-fire-line-of-fire-deluxe-edition","position":67,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/line-of-fire-line-of-fire-deluxe-edition","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-07-09T00:33:57.000Z","description":"<b>DIVE012</b>\r\nCD - Deluxe Edition \r\n*Newly Remixed & Remastered*\r\n\r\n<b>OVERVIEW:</b>\r\nTribunal Records originally released LINE OF FIRE’s debut album in 2005 based simply on the fact that Journey is our favorite band.  What we realized then was that LINE OF FIRE was as close as we were going to come to having Journey on our label, so we decided to sign them and throw possibly the biggest curve ball at our loyal and devout metallic hardcore label fanbase.  To our surprise, we found out how much people still loved Journey and they happily embraced our newest band, LINE OF FIRE and their brand of classic melodic rock.  \r\n\r\nBesides LINE OF FIRE’s brilliant songwriting it may have also helped that vocalist, Shawn Pelata, was already well known in metalcore circles as being “Dr. Extremus Melodicus” the guest power metal vocalist featured on Killwhitneydead’s most popular albums.  \r\n\r\nRegardless, LINE OF FIRE’s debut album was universally accepted across the board by fans from all genres and critics raved about the album online and in print magazines.  Unfortunately, we came into some financial troubles and it was forced to delete some albums from our catalog and <i>Line Of Fire</i> fell victim to these troubled times.  But happily, we recovered and kick started a new reissue division which actually specializes in melodic hard rock.  We decided that it was time to reissue LINE OF FIRE’s debut album on Divebomb Records with a brand new mix and mastering job from original engineer, Jamie King.  We have also added two new alternate mixes as bonus tracks.  So now, we present the deluxe edition of <i>Line Of Fire</i> for all the fans, old and new, who love LINE OF FIRE as much as we do.\r\n\r\n<b>FOR FANS OF:</b>\r\nJOURNEY, BOSTON and all melodic rock.\r\n\r\n<b>POINTS OF INTEREST:</b>\r\n+ Budget Priced\r\n+ Limited Edition - CD ONLY\r\n+ Contains 2 Bonus Track\r\n+ Remixed & Remastered by Jamie King\r\n+ Artwork by Rex Zachary (OPETH)\r\n+ EVERYONE loves JOURNEY - it’s ok to admit it.\r\n\r\n<b>TRACK LIST:</b>\r\n01 Faith In Fire\r\n02 Live & Let Go\r\n03 Fade\r\n04 Paradise\r\n05 Remind Me\r\n06 Morning Light\r\n07 Can’t You See\r\n08 Salvation’s Edge\r\n09 Falling Down (Hear My Prayer)\r\n10 Time To Say Goodbye\r\n\r\n<i>BONUS TRACKS</i>\r\n11 Remind Me [Alternate Version]\r\n12 Can’t You See [Alternate Version]\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 200px; height: 200px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=871311541/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://tribunalrecords.bandcamp.com/album/line-of-fire\">Line Of Fire by LINE OF FIRE</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":9354490,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25530059/-/LINE_OF_FIRE_600x600.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25530059/-/LINE_OF_FIRE_600x600.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25530042/-/LOF_2010_-_Copy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25530042/-/LOF_2010_-_Copy.jpg","width":750,"height":502}],"artists":[{"id":2395,"name":"Line Of Fire","permalink":"line-of-fire","url":"/artist/line-of-fire"}],"categories":[{"id":107817,"name":">> Divebomb Records Store","permalink":"divebomb-records-store","url":"/category/divebomb-records-store"},{"id":81949,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":2600164,"name":"COLOSSUS - Drunk On Blood","permalink":"colossus-drunk-on-blood","position":68,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/colossus-drunk-on-blood","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-06-03T19:41:55.000Z","description":"<b>TRB106</b>\r\nCDEP\r\n\r\n<b>OVERVIEW:</b>\r\nIn their early careers members of COLOSSUS were in several formidable punk rock acts, but thankfully came to their senses and embraced their irrepressible youthful metal roots.

COLOSSUS sound as if they were actually taking part in the original NWOBHM scene alongside Saxon, Diamond Head, Iron Maiden and Angel Witch in 1982, but cosmically (and fortunately for us) slipped through a wormhole winding up in 2010.  <i>Drunk On Blood</i> spiritedly follows on the heels of their debut album, <i>…And The Rift Of The Pan Dimensional Under-Gods</i>, and only further expands on their love of classic heavy metal, fantasy, folklore, zombies, science fiction and ultimately laying waste to any and all who catch their enthusiastic and sweat-filled live shows.  <i>Drunk On Blood</i> is for people who like to party and remember what it was like to make music for fun.

Their roots began in such classic and esteemed German hard rock/heavy metal bands such as Mad Max and Warlock.  Formed in 1990 when Warlock super-producer, Henry Staroste, brought Michael Voss and Michael Eurich together to craft the debut album, <i>Casanova</i>, that took the hard rock world by storm.  Well, the hard rock world outside of the USA that is.  \r\n\r\nTouring Europe in support of the album, which eventually sold 170,000 copies, only helped to establish and strengthen their rapidly increasing fanbase.  A devout fanbase that remains by their side, even now, 20 years later.  <i>Casanova</i> has been out of print for years and was never actually released in the United States until now.  With supplies diminishing over the years, the price of obtaining an original copy of <i>Casanova</i> has skyrocketed to prices over the $100 mark.  So with it being the band’s 20th anniversary we are extremely excited to present a new deluxe edition of the album which includes not only remastered audio, but seven (7) bonus tracks.  This updated release of <i>Casanova</i> is the ultimate edition and more importantly a celebration of the classic hard rock sounds of CASANOVA!\r\n\r\n<b>FOR FANS OF:</b>\r\nWARLOCK, MAD MAX, WHITESNAKE, BON JOVI, FIREHOUSE, DOKKEN and ICON\r\n\r\n<b>SELLING POINTS:</b>\r\n- Features former members of WARLOCK and MAD MAX\r\n- Contains 7 bonus tracks (Five of which were never available outside Japan)\r\n- Out of print for years/original version highly collectible\r\n- Never released in the U.S. before now\r\n- Limited Edition of 1000 (CD ONLY)\r\n- Band celebrating their 20th anniversary in 2010\r\n- First time all original 14 recorded album tracks compiled together\r\n-  All tracks remastered in 2010 by Jamie King\r\n\r\n<b>TRACK LIST:</b>\r\n01 Don’t Talk About Love\r\n02 Burning Love\r\n03 Living A Lie\r\n04 The Girl Is Mine\r\n05 Rome Burns\r\n06 Love Lies\r\n07 Bang Bang\r\n08 Sticky Sweet\r\n09 Back To The Wall\r\n10 Ride The Wings Of Freedom\r\n11 Hollywood Angels\r\n12 Heaven Can Wait\r\n\r\n<i>BONUS TRACKS</i>\r\n13 Hot Legs\r\n14 Written In My Heart\r\n15 Hollywood Angels (Acoustic)\r\n16 Love Lies (Acoustic)\r\n17 Don’t Talk About Love (Live)\r\n18 Burning Love (Live)\r\n19 Ride The Wings Of Freedom (Live)\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 200px; height: 200px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2265159240/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://tribunalrecords.bandcamp.com/album/casanova-deluxe-edition\">Casanova (Deluxe Edition) by CASANOVA</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":5758021,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/15854161/-/casanova_cover_1425x1425_2_-_Copy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/15854161/-/casanova_cover_1425x1425_2_-_Copy.jpg","width":750,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/16592001/-/l_5b46d67e1880b5a9928ff1b5d051f3e3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/16592001/-/l_5b46d67e1880b5a9928ff1b5d051f3e3.jpg","width":587,"height":390},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/14828821/-/casanova2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/14828821/-/casanova2.jpg","width":600,"height":392},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/14829221/-/l_6f6e3dd8d801e6e45479eb0934ca208c.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/14829221/-/l_6f6e3dd8d801e6e45479eb0934ca208c.jpg","width":600,"height":921},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/14829261/-/l_8c74d022a32c0885cb2c9ae1c14cc0cd.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/14829261/-/l_8c74d022a32c0885cb2c9ae1c14cc0cd.jpg","width":600,"height":393}],"artists":[{"id":27261,"name":"Casanova","permalink":"casanova","url":"/artist/casanova"}],"categories":[{"id":107817,"name":">> Divebomb Records Store","permalink":"divebomb-records-store","url":"/category/divebomb-records-store"},{"id":81949,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":441365,"name":"UNCLE SLAM - Say Uncle","permalink":"uncle-slam-say-uncle-coming-soon","position":72,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/uncle-slam-say-uncle-coming-soon","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-10-29T07:36:00.000Z","description":"<b>DIVE007</b>\r\nCD\r\n\r\n<b>OVERVIEW:</b>\r\nUNCLE SLAM’s <i>Say Uncle</i> was released in 1988 and featured former Suicidal Tendencies drummer, Amery Smith (he performed on their now classic debut album).  Upon its release <i>Say Uncle</i> was immediately recognizable thanks to it’s distinctive and iconic artwork created by artist, Michael Seiff, who at the time was becoming more popular with help from bands like Suicidal Tendencies, Excel, No Mercy and Wasted Youth already having had his artwork grace their most recent albums. Besides the slick cover art Uncle Slam had equally impressive production due to Randy Burns being brought on board to work with the band.  He was responsible for some of the metal scene’s most impressive releases to date like <i>Peace Sells…But Who’s Buying</i> (Megadeth), <i>Darkness Descends</i> (Dark Angel), <i>Seven Churches</i> (Possessed) and <i>Scream Bloody Gore</i> (Death).\r\n\r\nIn most critics’ minds UNCLE SLAM’s <i>Say Uncle</i> may not be known as the most innovative album of the 1980’s Thrash era, but it most definitely stands right alongside the likes of <i>I Hate Therefore I Am</i> (Cyclone Temple), <i>Born To Expire</i> (Leeway), <i>Mind Wars</i> (Holy Terror), <i>Beast On My Back</i> (Crumbsuckers) and <i>Kill To Survive</i> (Meliah Rage) as one of collectors’ favorite, yet critically underappreciated albums ever released. <i>Say Uncle</i> has an undeniable crossover appeal to any Thrash Metal fans looking for an additional dose of hardcore styled aggression.

It too can hardly be contested that the best thrash metal music was released between the years of 1984 and 1988.  Fast forward two decades later and BLATANT DISARRAY’s new album, <i>Everyone Dies Alone</i>, is not just a “throwback” to that era, but sounds more like an album that could have easily prospered in the genre’s glory days with a definite nod to metal greats Metallica and Testament.  <i>Everyone Dies Alone</i>’s raw and organic tones courtesy of Grammy nominated producer John Custer (think Corrosion Of Conformity’s <i>Blind</i>) are reminiscent of the classic metal era which existed long before the advent and extensive over-use of slick engineering tricks which have only helped to homogenize the scene.\r\n\r\nWith over 200 shows under their belts and having shared the stage with veteran acts such as Anthrax, Metal Church, Lamb Of God and W.A.S.P. the band have been able to hone their razor sharp attack in front of thrash metal’s customary critical horde.  BLATANT DISARRAY wears their influences on their sleeves proudly and stand firmly planted in the greatest era metal has even known.  Sometimes dwelling in the past isn’t such a terrible thing is it?  We don’t think so.\r\n\r\nTribunal Records supports tangible artistic substance and rewards music fans who share in our beliefs. So, the physical release of <i>Everyone Dies Alone</i> contains three (3) bonus tracks not available on digital release.  \r\n\r\n<b>FOR FANS OF:</b>\r\nMETALLICA, TESTAMENT and all cult Thrash Metal.\r\n\r\n<b>TRACK LIST:</b>\r\n01 Undetermined\r\n02 Down & Out\r\n03 Question\r\n04 End\r\n05 Faithless\r\n06 Pathetic\r\n07 A Righteous Rant\r\n08 Eye Fortune\r\n09 Hourglass\r\n10 Everyone Dies Alone\r\n\r\n<u>BONUS TRACKS</u>\r\n11 Nine Days Wonder\r\n12 Number One Disaster\r\n13 Manipulation\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 200px; height: 200px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2530902562/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://tribunalrecords.bandcamp.com/album/everyone-dies-alone\">Everyone Dies Alone by BLATANT DISARRAY</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":994350,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/14022351/-/BD_EDA_700x700.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/14022351/-/BD_EDA_700x700.jpg","width":700,"height":700},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/14027231/-/PS7-02911.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/14027231/-/PS7-02911.jpg","width":500,"height":354}],"artists":[{"id":5903,"name":"Blatant Disarray","permalink":"blatant-disarray","url":"/artist/blatant-disarray"}],"categories":[{"id":107817,"name":">> Divebomb Records Store","permalink":"divebomb-records-store","url":"/category/divebomb-records-store"},{"id":81949,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":210700,"name":"KILLWHITNEYDEAD - Not Even God Can Save You Now: A Trilogy Of Terror (4 CD SET)","permalink":"killwhitneydead-not-even-god-can-save-you-now-a-trilogy-of-terror","position":74,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/killwhitneydead-not-even-god-can-save-you-now-a-trilogy-of-terror","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-01-03T02:20:24.000Z","description":"<b>TRB101</b>\r\n3 CD SET\r\n+ 1 <i>BONUS ESTORE EXCLUSIVE </i>CD\r\n\r\n<b>OVERVIEW:</b>\r\nBy now it’s no secret that KILLWHITNEYDEAD began their career in a shroud of mystery.  It too is no secret that they didn’t expect to ever release any material beyond the first EP.  But with the release of that first EP the unexpected happened…KWD had actual fans besides their close friends and “people in the know.”  Those amazing new fans demanded more music.  So in the incredibly short process of about six months the band wrote and recorded nearly 30 more songs which would become the albums <i>Never Good Enough For You</i> and <i>So Pretty So Plastic</i>.  \r\n\r\nWhat is not widely known about these early years is what little finances the band had at their disposal to record these albums.  With a few pennies and a helping hand from engineer/friend Jamie King, KWD were able to record those albums for basically nothing by today’s standards.  Fast forward to 2008 and Jamie King (known the world over now as “the” metal  engineer) asks KWD if they would like to remix the early albums because he can surely make them sound better with today’s technology.

Since 2004, they have issued three more critically acclaimed albums on Sensory Music (<i>Penumbra Diffuse</i>, <i>Cortical Tectonics</i> and <i>The Atomized Dream</i>) only seeming to help instrumental artists become the new \"in thing” within metal realms.\r\n\r\nSince Tribunal Records is mainly a hardcore and death metal label <i>Sublimation</i> drifted out of print.  We have decided to re-introduce the metal community to this album due to the rise of instrumental music awareness, but more importantly its acceptance and new found respect.\r\n\r\nSo many people couldn't believe we would have even taken a chance on releasing a record like <i>Sublimation</i> back in 2004, but we absolutely loved it then and <i>Sublimation</i> still serves as a classic piece of Tribunal Records history.  It still gets regular rotation here in our office.\r\n\r\nWe have remastered the original recordings, created new layout/artwork and added their live set from Tribunal Records 2006 Showcase to make it a fully enhanced CD release.\r\n\r\n<b>REVIEWS</b>\r\n<i>...the dizzying fray of killer compositions like \"Cosmopolysyndeton\" and \"When Solar Winds Collide\" won't help alleviate the assumption that Canvas Solaris are snooty, intellectual muso types who are too smart for their own good and the consumer's understanding. Maybe? Maybe not? But every once in a while, metal needs an IQ boost to reaffirm its vitality in the face of cliches and close-mindedness, doesn't it?</i>\r\nTERRORIZER\r\n\r\n<i>Canvas Solaris will surely enjoy exponential success with Sublimation, a prime exemplar of technical metal for the ages.</i>\r\nEXCLAIM!\r\n\r\n<i>...to the mainstream audiences this album will be far too much to understand as it lacks the tedious nu-metalcore formulaics. But to those who appreciate the art form of intricate and imaginative metal, you need look no further.</i>\r\nTHE PRP\r\n\r\n<i>...in today's sadly self-gratifying prog metal market where players are looking for individual attention rather than worrying about the product on a whole, Canvas Solaris show that they have some integrity (both musically and personally). What they sacrifice from not showing off they make up for with their virtuous songwriting. </i>\r\nINTO OBSCURITY\r\n\r\n<i>Sure it’s mind-bendingly original and overtly progressive but can an instrumental album have the kind of bite that generates enough interest to repeatedly listen to it? The answer is a resounding yes.</i>\r\nSMOTHER.NET\r\n\r\n<i>This disc is far from crushing, but every note the band plays is captivating and delivered with the seeming ease that only a true pro can feign...The music on this CD is so cool and at the same time so far beyond the realm of “progressive” it’s not even funny.</i>\r\nDEADTIDE.COM\r\n\r\n<i>Canvas Solaris keep it complicated but stay coherent in their style while being on another plane of musical existence...The album through and through is an amazing trip that will make one want to learn to play an instrument or at least give one a whole new appreciation for music.  </i>\r\nRIFT ROCK\r\n\r\n<i>This is a top metal album of 2004 for me. I recommend this to fans of The Dillinger Escape Plan, Cancer Conspiracy and metalcore fans that are looking to enjoy something a little different than your average two-chord breakdown.</i>\r\nPIVOTAL RAGE\r\n\r\n<i>Its a damn shame a vast majority will simply hear this album one time and miss the chance to broaden their musical horizons. To those looking to get lost in their own bright utopia: Canvas Solaris is the drug of choice.</i>\r\nSIX12\r\n\r\n<b><i>SPATIAL/DESIGN</i> OVERVIEW</b>\r\nProbably the most non-traditional signing to Tribunal Records yet. Statesboro, Georgia’s CANVAS SOLARIS could be classified as “thinking man’s metal”. Their debut, Spatial/Design, is perplexing technical metal bursting with way too many musical acrobatics to even bother with vocals, it is genius-level stuff. We guarantee it will blow your mind. The four spacey and ultra complex tracks have a running time of over 25 minutes and cover the gamut of metal’s many facets. This young trio have learned their lessons well. Their masters are Spiral Architect, Watchtower, Cynic and King Crimson. Their peers are few. Canvas Solaris stands alone.\r\n\r\n<b>FOR FANS OF:</b>\r\nCYNIC, FATES WARNING, DREAM THEATER, SPIRAL ARCHITECT and WATCHTOWER\r\n\r\n<b><i>Sublimation</i> TRACK LIST:</b>\r\n01 Cosmopolysyndeton\r\n02 Spheres In Design\r\n03 When Solar Winds Collide\r\n04 Cyclotron Emission\r\n05 Syzygial Epiphany\r\n06 Ekstatik Parataxis (The New Measure)\r\n07 Sublimation\r\n\r\nAll tracks REMASTERED by Jamie King in 2009.\r\n\r\n<b>BONUS ENHANCED CONTENT:</b>\r\nLIVE @ TRIBUNAL RECORDS 2006 SHOWCASE\r\n01 Reflections Carried To Mirror\r\n02 Patterns Spiral Into Swarm\r\n03 Heat Distortion Manifest\r\n04 Psychotropic Resonance\r\n05 The Unknowable And Defeating Glow\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 200px; height: 200px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1896815614/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://tribunalrecords.bandcamp.com/album/sublimaton\">Sublimaton by CANVAS SOLARIS</a></iframe>\r\n\r\n<b><i>Spatial/Design</i> TRACK LIST:</b>\r\n01 Camera Obscura\r\n02 Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation\r\n03 The Non-Terminating Integer\r\n04 Dark Matter, Accretion Disk And Interacting Binary Neutron Star In A Self-Reproducing Inflationary Universe\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 200px; height: 200px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2772543486/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://tribunalrecords.bandcamp.com/album/spatial-design\">Spatial / Design by CANVAS SOLARIS</a></iframe>\r\n","options":[{"id":7456251,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/19702171/-/PS7-00300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/19702171/-/PS7-00300.jpg","width":750,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/28595099/-/PS7-02182.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/28595099/-/PS7-02182.jpg","width":342,"height":340},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/19702211/-/PS7-03080.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/19702211/-/PS7-03080.jpg","width":570,"height":350},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/28595091/-/PS7-02181.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/28595091/-/PS7-02181.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":2375,"name":"Canvas Solaris","permalink":"canvas-solaris","url":"/artist/canvas-solaris"}],"categories":[{"id":81949,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"},{"id":292243,"name":"CD - Package Deals","permalink":"cd-package-deals","url":"/category/cd-package-deals"}]},{"id":81583,"name":"SIX REASONS TO KILL - Another Horizon (3 CD PACKAGE DEAL)","permalink":"six-reasons-to-kill-another-horizon","position":77,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/six-reasons-to-kill-another-horizon","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-03-06T12:08:25.000Z","description":"<b><span class=\"caps\">TRB096 + TRB070 + \"Kiss The Demon\" </span></b>\r\nCD\r\n\r\n<b><span class=\"caps\">OVERVIEW</span>:</b>\r\nHaving survived several recent shake-ups which saw some members depart and join the ranks of Germany’s top metal bands (Caliban and Deadsoil), <span class=\"caps\">SIX REASONS TO KILL</span> have regrouped and returned with an even more massive album entitled, Another Horizon.

The new album, <i>Another Horizon</i>, follows the same destructive path of its predecessor, but with more vocal melody infused into their now distinct “sledgehammer to your face” approach.  Along with the unabashedly “metal worship” also comes a socially conscious album dealing with such topics as discrimination, environmental exploitation, racism, war and human rights. <span class=\"caps\">SRTK</span> not only want to impress you sonically, but they hope to challenge you mentally and open doors you may have kept closed up until right now.  <i>Another Horizon</i> is a monumental moment in German hardcore, but most importantly a relevant human commentary on our civilization’s current dilemmas. \r\n\r\n<b><span class=\"caps\">FOR FANS OF</span>:</b>\r\n<span class=\"caps\">HATEBREED</span>, SOILWORK, <span class=\"caps\">BOLT THROWER</span>, OBITUARY, <span class=\"caps\">MACHINE HEAD</span> and <span class=\"caps\">SHADOWS FALL</span>\r\n\r\n<b><i> Another Horizon</i>\r\n<span class=\"caps\"> TRACK LIST</span>:</b>\r\n01 Introduction\r\n02 Observer\r\n03 Another Horizon\r\n04 On This Battlefield\r\n05 Weak In Darkening\r\n06 Eyesore\r\n07 &#8230;And Tomorrow’s Gone\r\n08 Bleeding Stereo\r\n09 Massgrave Memorial\r\n10 Phoenix\r\n11 Ammunition\r\n12 Beside Nowhere\r\n13 The Hardest Revenge\r\n\r\n<b><span class=\"caps\">ENHANCED CD</span></b>\r\n- <span class=\"caps\">TRIBUNAL RECORDS SAMPLER VIDEO</span>\r\n- 30+ <span class=\"caps\">FREE</span> MP3s <span class=\"caps\">OF TRIBUNAL ARTISTS</span>\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 200px; height: 200px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3243628388/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://tribunalrecords.bandcamp.com/album/another-horizon\">Another Horizon by SIX REASONS TO KILL</a></iframe>\r\n\r\n<b><i>Reborn</i>\r\n<span class=\"caps\"> TRACK LIST</span>:</b>\r\n01 Symbols of Ignorance\r\n02 Cutting Away\r\n03 Retribution\r\n04 Against All Enemies\r\n05 A Cold Sensation\r\n06 Dying Peace\r\n07 Last Prayer\r\n08 Truth Remains\r\n09 Apocalypse Of Reality\r\n10 Addicted To Love (Life’s Dead End Path)\r\n\r\n<b>FOR FANS OF:</b>\r\nHATEBREED, LAMB OF GOD, BOLT THROWER, OBITUARY, MACHINE HEAD and SHADOWS FALL\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 200px; height: 200px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1368393389/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://tribunalrecords.bandcamp.com/album/reborn\">Reborn by SIX REASONS TO KILL</a></iframe>\r\n\r\n<b><i>Kiss The Demon</i>\r\n<span class=\"caps\"> TRACK LIST</span>:</b>\r\n01 Kiss The Demon\r\n02 Inside My Shell\r\n03 As The Earth Sleeps\r\n04 Awakening\r\n05 Coldness\r\n06 In Splitted Tongues We Speak\r\n07 The Voice Inside...\r\n08 These Days\r\n09 Knights Of The Apocalypse\r\n10 Unknown Path ","options":[{"id":380187,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2916959/-/SRTK_Package_Deal.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2916959/-/SRTK_Package_Deal.jpg","width":500,"height":496},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/173073/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/173073/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1605237/-/SRTK.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1605237/-/SRTK.jpg","width":600,"height":430},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1605241/-/SRTK2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1605241/-/SRTK2.jpg","width":600,"height":399}],"artists":[{"id":2404,"name":"Six Reasons To Kill","permalink":"six-reasons-to-kill","url":"/artist/six-reasons-to-kill"}],"categories":[{"id":81949,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"},{"id":292243,"name":"CD - Package Deals","permalink":"cd-package-deals","url":"/category/cd-package-deals"}]},{"id":75571,"name":"KILLWHITNEYDEAD - Nothing Less Nothing More","permalink":"killwhitneydead-nothing-less-nothing-more","position":78,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/killwhitneydead-nothing-less-nothing-more","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-02-14T21:05:52.000Z","description":"<b><span class=\"caps\">TRB086</span></b>\r\nCD\r\n\r\n<b><span class=\"caps\">OVERVIEW</span>:</b>\r\n<span class=\"caps\">KILLWHITNEYDEAD</span>, the band you love to hate is back at it, yet again.

Three critically acclaimed releases, a documentary/live <span class=\"caps\">DVD</span>, their first ever tour (a US headlining tour to boot) during 7 weeks in the summer of 2006 have all brought <span class=\"caps\">KWD</span> to this explosive point. The aptly titled, <i>Nothing Less Nothing More</i>, is their fourth album and is all that fans have come to adore in <span class=\"caps\">KWD</span>; tales of retribution, blast beats, sound clips, scathing vocals, a plethora of swanky solos and classic thrash metal. Upon returning from the road they entered The Basement Studios with their long time producer, Jamie King, and proceeded to churn out 24 new songs for fans to devour. Thirteen of those twenty four wound up on <i>Nothing Less Nothing More</i>.\r\n\r\n<b><span class=\"caps\">FOR FANS OF</span>:</b>\r\nThrash Metal, Death Metal, Hardcore and Modern cinema.\r\n\r\n<b><span class=\"caps\">TRACK LIST</span>:</b>\r\n01 Words Don’t Last Forever Your Wounds Will\r\n02 Just When You Thought I Was Listening\r\n03 Time To Teach Her A Lesson Called “Replaceable”\r\n04 <a href=\"http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&#38;VideoID=16201245\" target=\"_blank\">Put A Sock In It</a>\r\n05 Skip The Break Up Get To The Make Up\r\n06 (Here’s An Idea) How About More Of Me &#38; Less Of You\r\n07 White Trash But Worth Every Cent\r\n08 Losing Weight &#38; Looking Great\r\n09 Maybe Death Is A Gift\r\n10 If Only My Eyes Were Loaded\r\n11 You Getting Boom Boom With The Bridesmaids?\r\n12 Stop Crying Just Start Dying\r\n13 Funny Enough It Sounds Just Like Tainted Love (7” Single Version)\r\n\r\n<b><span class=\"caps\">ENHANCED CD</span></b>\r\n- &#8220;Losing Weight &#38; Looking Great&#8221; <span class=\"caps\">MUSIC VIDEO</span> \r\n- <span class=\"caps\">TRIBUNAL RECORDS SAMPLER VIDEO</span>\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 200px; height: 200px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=432996032/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://tribunalrecords.bandcamp.com/album/nothing-less-nothing-more\">Nothing Less Nothing More by KILLWHITNEYDEAD</a></iframe>\r\n","options":[{"id":358388,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/154507/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/154507/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1608037/-/KWD1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1608037/-/KWD1.jpg","width":600,"height":407},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1608045/-/KWD2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1608045/-/KWD2.jpg","width":600,"height":399}],"artists":[{"id":2360,"name":"Killwhitneydead.","permalink":"killwhitneydead","url":"/artist/killwhitneydead"}],"categories":[{"id":2505239,"name":">> Killwhitneydead Store","permalink":"killwhitneydead-store","url":"/category/killwhitneydead-store"},{"id":81949,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":75897,"name":"SCHOOL FOR HEROES - The Answer (3 CD PACKAGE DEAL)","permalink":"school-for-heroes-the-answer","position":79,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/school-for-heroes-the-answer","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-02-16T00:34:49.000Z","description":"<b><span class=\"caps\">TRB081 + TRB53 + TRB046</span></b>\r\n<span class=\"caps\">3xCD - PACKAGE DEAL</span>       \r\n\r\n<b><span class=\"caps\">OVERVIEW</span>:</b>\r\nAfter going on hiatus in 2004, Florida&#8217;s <span class=\"caps\">SCHOOL FOR HEROES</span> decided to re-ignite their creative spark in 2006 and unleash possibly the most unruly release in their entire career. 2007&#8217;s The Answer is exactly that; a bold declaration to any of the bands naysayers that a completely new and revitalized <span class=\"caps\">SCHOOL FOR HEROES</span> era has begun.

It was unknown at that time, but <span class=\"caps\">PRAYER FOR CLEANSING</span> would become an extremely influential force in the modern hardcore scene. Fans from all over the world rejoiced for what had been created, it was a perfect blend of melodic Swedish death metal and the brutality of modern hardcore with a hint of black metal viciousness. Even though the record was revolutionary in concept for its time, it seemed all the fans had one major gripe, the production of the record was &#8220;lacking&#8221; so to speak. We decided that instead of just re-releasing the original album re-mastered, that we would have it remixed. So engineer, Jamie King, (Between The Buried and Me, Bloodjinn and Beloved) was given the opportunity to enhance the original tracks and truly make this a reissue worth having in your collection. <i>The Rain In Endless Fall</i> is now <span class=\"caps\">HEAVY</span>, like it was originally intended to be. The individual instruments are more pronounced and clearly defined. It is now a whole new listening experience, and one that we think the fans will enjoy immensely. &#8220;The Rain In Endless Fall,&#8221; will now become the classic it was destined to be upon its initial release, but production flaws and poor engineering ultimately prohibited it from doing so. \r\n\r\n<b><span class=\"caps\">FOR FANS OF</span>:</b>\r\n<span class=\"caps\">UNEARTH</span>, AT <span class=\"caps\">THE GATES</span>, EMPEROR, <span class=\"caps\">UNDYING</span> and <span class=\"caps\">BETWEEN THE BURIED</span> &#38; ME.\r\n\r\n<b><span class=\"caps\">TRACK LIST</span>:</b>\r\n01 A Dozen Black Roses\r\n02 Feinbhas A Ghabhail\r\n03 Winter&#8217;s Gloom\r\n04 A Dead Soul Born\r\n05 <a href=\"http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&#38;VideoID=16657857\" target=\"_blank\">Sonnet</a>\r\n06 Violent Waves\r\n07 Destiny Of Culture\r\n08 Chalice Of Repentance\r\n09 Bael Na Mblath\r\n10 Sleep Eternal\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 200px; height: 200px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3337248470/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://tribunalrecords.bandcamp.com/album/the-rain-in-endless-fall\">The Rain In Endless Fall by PRAYER FOR CLEANSING</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":359147,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/155002/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/155002/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1608249/-/PFC1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1608249/-/PFC1.jpg","width":500,"height":375},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1608257/-/PFC3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1608257/-/PFC3.jpg","width":500,"height":375},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1608253/-/PFC2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1608253/-/PFC2.jpg","width":400,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":2398,"name":"Prayer For Cleansing","permalink":"prayer-for-cleansing","url":"/artist/prayer-for-cleansing"}],"categories":[{"id":81949,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":5300461,"name":"BACK CATALOG ($1-$10)","permalink":"back-catalog","position":82,"price":1.0,"default_price":1.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/back-catalog","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-01-21T23:16:50.000Z","description":"This is nearly all of our back catalog which is still in print physically.

forward thinking Philadelphia area thrash band was formed from the ashes of cult heroes Anvil Bitch.  Their two classic demos (<i>Dominance</i> - 1988 and <i>Look Where We Worship</i> - 1990) have been compiled and remastered for this new collection.\r\n\r\n<i>Resurrected</i> is the first time this material has been released on CD.  The enhanced content contains a full live set from 1989 and slide show of club flyers from the era.  Also included - brand new interview with the band and full lyrics.\r\n\r\n<i>\"Even with Dominance’s late arrival to the thrash metal explosion, their music was adventurous and lyrical subject matter absolutely captivating.  However, what truly set them apart from the countless bands hacking it out was the addition of samples to their music.  It was extraordinarily innovative and I can still remember getting chills the first time I heard General Ursus’ voice declaring “The only good human is a dead human” (from Planet Of The Apes) in the opening few seconds of “Resurrected.”  It was eerie, yet uplifting in a sense.  When their Look Where We Worship demo was released, the thrash scene may have been on its way out, but Dominance were defiantly paving a new path and adding even more creative depth to their already impressive arsenal of songs.  Though they weren’t necessarily reinventing the wheel their bold approach to thrash metal certainly changed my world, forever.\"</i>\r\n<b>Matt of KILLWHITNEYDEAD</b>\r\n\r\n<b>FOR FANS OF:</b>\r\nMETALLICA, SLAYER, EXODUS, TESTAMENT and FORBIDDEN\r\n\r\n<b>SELLING POINTS:</b>\r\n-  Enhanced CD contains full live set from 1989 and slideshow of original show flyers\r\n-  Includes new band interview conducted in 2009 by Kevin Stewart-Panko of <i>Decibel/Terrorizer</i>\r\n-  Includes introduction by Matt of KILLWHITNEYDEAD\r\n-  Appeared on METAL BLADE RECORDS’ Metal Massacre Series - Volume 11\r\n-  Artwork faithfully restored from original demo tape\r\n-  All tracks remastered in 2009 by Jamie King\r\n-  Shared stage with: SLAYER, BIOHAZARD, MORBID ANGEL, OVERKILL, THE ACCUSED & so many more!!\r\n\r\n<b>TRACK LIST:</b>\r\n01 Resurrected\r\n02 Father Paranoia\r\n03 Disabled\r\n04 This Is Only A Test\r\n05 Dreams Of Supremacy\r\n06 Explicit Termination\r\n07 New Annihilation\r\n08 Liquid Remains\r\n09 Feeding Frenzy\r\n10 Resurrected (MMXI Version) [Bonus Track]\r\n\r\nENHANCED CD\r\n- Live video from 1989\r\n- Slideshow of vintage show flyers\r\n- DIVEBOMB RECORDS DIGITAL SAMPLER \r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 200px; height: 200px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2407169663/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://tribunalrecords.bandcamp.com/album/resurrected\">Resurrected by DOMINANCE</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":1456014,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2828097/-/dominance_cover_white.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2828097/-/dominance_cover_white.jpg","width":750,"height":745},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2828105/-/DOMINANCE_promo2a.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2828105/-/DOMINANCE_promo2a.jpg","width":750,"height":520},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2828109/-/DOMINANCE_promo.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2828109/-/DOMINANCE_promo.jpg","width":803,"height":623}],"artists":[{"id":8358,"name":"Dominance","permalink":"dominance","url":"/artist/dominance"}],"categories":[{"id":107817,"name":">> Divebomb Records Store","permalink":"divebomb-records-store","url":"/category/divebomb-records-store"},{"id":81949,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":357490,"name":"SOLITUDE - Poisoned Population: The Complete Collection (1987-1994) [2 CD SET]","permalink":"solitude-poisoned-population-the-complete-collection-1987-1994","position":84,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/solitude-poisoned-population-the-complete-collection-1987-1994","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-07-30T09:40:08.000Z","description":"<b>DIVE006</b>\r\n2xCD\r\n\r\n<b>OVERVIEW:</b>\r\nDelaware thrash/speed metal band, SOLITUDE, was formed in 1983. Despite releasing three critically acclaimed demos true “break out success” always seemed to slip through their fingers.  While influenced by  Metallica and Testament they were also equally drawn to works by Rush, Mahavishnu Orchestra and even Eric Johnson. \r\n\r\nIn 1987, they released their first demo, <i>Focus Of Terror</i>, which received an enthusiastic response from the scene thus resulting in the track “The End” appearing on <i>Thrash Attack III</i>.  <i>Sickness</i>, released a year later, found the band quickly gaining ground with great reviews in fanzines worldwide most notably, Kerrang!  As if all the positive press and opening for bands such as DEATH, DARK ANGEL and SACRED REICH, wasn’t enough to warrant the scene’s attention “Typhoid Mary” was then chosen to appear on Metal Blade Records’ prestigious <i>Metal Massacre</i> series. \r\n\r\n<i>Fall Of Creation</i> brought greater exposure in publications like Metal Maniacs, Thrash ‘Em All and Metal Forces and they signed with Red Light Records in 1993 and recorded <i>From Within</i> in 1994.  Sadly enough, right before the album’s release the label went belly up and it never saw the light of day in the US.  After a crushing blow like that and 10 years as a band SOLITUDE decided to quietly bow out of the metal world.\r\n\r\n<i>Poisoned Population: The Complete Collection (1987-1994)</i> is a two disc remastered collection of all 26 tracks.

Alas, as we all know by now some things are just never meant to happen.\r\n\r\nHowever it didn't stop there for some SARGANT FURY members, their vocalist, Andrew \"Mac\" McDermott, did eventually go on to front the UK's premiere progressive metal act, THRESHOLD during their most eventful years. Bassist, Bauke de Groot, currently plays in HATE SQUAD and started his own record label in Germany and besides releasing amazing metal and hardcore from European bands he even licensed Tribunal Records' own, KILLWHITNEYDEAD for release overseas.

In 1978 a little known Seattle band (formerly Mojo Hand) emerged with an album that would become a classic slab of American rock ‘n’ roll. Drawing influence from other ‘70s rock acts like Boston, Heart and Journey, but maintaining a sound all their own, <span class=\"caps\">TKO</span> garnered critical acclaim for their achievements. Even with the praise being thrown upon the band while opening for acts such as AC/DC, Van Halen, The Kinks and Cheap Trick, their label (Infinity Records) mismanaged money (apparently signing The Pope for $6 million) and went bankrupt soon after the album’s release leaving <span class=\"caps\">TKO</span> without a home. Despite the bottom falling out, the band pressed on in support of the material they had spent years perfecting, but eventually the <i>Let It Roll</i>-era lineup disbanded sending members to start new bands throughout Seattle, most notably, Rick Pierce eventually to Floyd Rose’s Q5. Vocalist Brad Sinsel however took <span class=\"caps\">TKO</span> and pressed onward with a new lineup and grittier edge which can be heard on the album <i>In Your Face</i>, also reissued by Divebomb Records (DIVE001).\r\n\r\nA proper release of <i>Let It Roll</i> has been long overdue considering the countless bootlegs that have surfaced over the years.  The 2008 Divebomb Records issue contains not only the original version of <i>Let It Roll</i> but a previously unreleased live radio performance recorded in 1978 for <span class=\"caps\">KZOK</span> Seattle.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"caps\">TKO</span>’s ranks have included members who eventually went onto bands such as <span class=\"caps\">FIFTH ANGEL</span>, HOUSE <span class=\"caps\">OF LORDS</span>, ALICE <span class=\"caps\">COOPER</span>, WAR <span class=\"caps\">BABIES</span>, CHASTAIN and Q5.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b><span class=\"caps\">TRACK LIST</span>:</b>\r\n1.
