Such a perfect 30s style with the puffed sleeves, Peter Pan collar and bow details.\r\n\r\nThis is actually a girls dress, and may possibly been made for a bridesmaid.\r\n\r\nThe skirt part is made from a cream acetate taffeta material and the sleeves and part of the bodice is a crisp white rigid organza with embroidered patterns. Two taffeta bows adorn the bodice and it has a matching sash to nip in the waist.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, this is an extra small size, but it does just about fit me {I'm a UK size 6/8}. It is only tight around the arm holes, and is a little bit of a squeeze to put it on over the chest area, but not too bad.\r\n\r\nPerfect for a girl aged around 11 to 13, I guess! But cute on a petite lady too.\r\n\r\nCondition is good for a dress of this age. There is a small break in the organza on one sleeve and a very faint mark on the other. One of the covered buttons on the back is a little stained and next to it, a small hole {see photo 5}. \r\nThis dress has just been cleaned, and has come up a beautiful bright cream and white colour. It is strong and wearable.\r\n\r\nMEASURES:\r\n\r\narm hole circumference - 14 inches\r\nsleeve opening circumference - 9 inches\r\nbust - 31 inches\r\nwaist - 29 inches\r\nhip - 32 inches\r\nlength - 37 inches\r\n\r\n* PLEASE NOTE, all items of clothing are NON-REFUNDABLE.
