Up cycled , recycled ,This is a yarn made from salvage. \r\n  I used a gorgeous pair of PJ pants. I found these in a rag bin at a local thrift store, they had been loved to the knee being worn out. \r\n I brought them home washed them and then cut them in to strips strung the strips together and knit them into the fabulous cloths you see here. \r\n   They are durable - I tested one out of this batch, they can be laundered the way any other towel or washcloth would be,\r\n   \r\n   The texture is soft and warm, one side offers a smooth and the other a \"scrubby\" , I find them  perfect for bathing although you could use them for a set of dishcloths. These would make a perfect accompaniment to a bath and body gift basket- especially if they were handmade too:)\r\n   If you would like a set and these just aren't your color fancy feel free to request custom orders.

The jeans are 100%post consumer reclaimed fabric, I have rescued it from fashion victims who were simply going to toss them because they were faded or worn. In some cases purchased  from a local charity- at the outlet extension, the last stop before the LANDFILL.\r\n  This Rug is hand knit and woven together using a whip stitch of denim and back It is a knit stitch and offers a firm stand yet is supple to walk upon. There were 4 pairs of jeans in this rug pictured - the patchwork design gives it a more rustic appearance.\r\n  measures appox 30\"in length and 18\" wide\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of intense labor invested in this item. Once the denim is reclaimed it is then cut to strips, wound and hand knit.\r\n Custom Darn rugs may be requested.
