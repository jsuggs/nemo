These sea monsters made their way into the Zorse collection after their legend was told by Quint in the 1975 classic thriller Jaws.\r\n\r\n<b>MEDIUM:</b> The original lineup of designs released by Zorse Clothing was printed on 4.5 oz ringspung cotton shirts.  These are some of the softest shirts available, and have a more fashionable slim-fitting profile.  Each shirt is printed by hand at the Zorse HQ in New Hampshire.  Each Tiger Shark Tee is printed on a water blue shirt that was dyed in house, and features subtle tints and hues as a result of the coloring process.  This ensures that each Tiger Shark will feel at home on your shirt, and that no one else will have a tee that is exactly like yours.    \r\n \r\n<b>SIZING:</b>  <a href=\"http://www.zorseclothing.com/faqs\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"FAQ Page\" style=\"font-size:14;color:#0000FF;font-family:Arial Black;text-decoration:none;\">See FAQ Page</a>\r\n","options":[{"id":9382125,"name":"Small","price":10.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9382126,"name":"Medium","price":10.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9382127,"name":"Large","price":10.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9382128,"name":"X-Large","price":10.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9847779,"name":"XX-Large","price":10.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9847780,"name":"XXX-Large","price":10.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/33313576/-/Tiger_Guy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/33313576/-/Tiger_Guy.jpg","width":726,"height":546},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/33313566/-/Tiger_Girl.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/33313566/-/Tiger_Girl.jpg","width":726,"height":544},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25620273/-/TS_Web_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25620273/-/TS_Web_3.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1538233,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":2714441,"name":"Granite State Tee (Murdered-Out)","permalink":"granite-state-tee-murdered-out-version","position":24,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/granite-state-tee-murdered-out-version","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-08-23T23:34:42.000Z","description":"<b>TITLE:</b> The Granite State Tee (Murdered Out)\r\n \r\n<b>THIS SHIRT:</b> The Murdered-Out Edition of the Granite State tee is part of the original lineup of designs released by Zorse Clothing.
