Lackey Die was the first hardcore band from the small city of Charlottesville, Virginia.  Starting out in 1982, they played furious, no-bullshit hardcore.  During this time they recorded two studio sessions, one at Floodzone Studios (White Cross, Unseen Force) and another at the now-famous Inner Ear Studios (Minor Threat, Bad Brains, etc.)  The band broke up in late 1985, leaving behind only some local fans and a couple mentions in MRR scene reports.  25 years later, the master tapes have been re-discovered and remastered for vinyl.  You'll see why Lackey Die would fit in perfectly on an old Southern hardcore mixtape alongside bands like C.O.C., early HONOR ROLE, BEEF PEOPLE, LANDLORDS, NEON CHRIST, etc.  This release is fully authorized and is limited to 500 copies w/ hand-screened sleeves.","options":[{"id":14420443,"name":"Default","price":4.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30395237/-/lackey_die_med.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30395237/-/lackey_die_med.jpg","width":351,"height":339},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30395389/-/lackeydie_back_small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30395389/-/lackeydie_back_small.jpg","width":337,"height":336}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2059764,"name":"Records","permalink":"records","url":"/category/records"}]},{"id":14106024,"name":"NUTS! #12","permalink":"nuts-12","position":4,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nuts-12","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-10T23:59:14.000Z","description":"Second NYC-centric newsprint blast from the continually excellent NUTS! fanzine.

Wow, this thing totally knocked me back at first listen - the sound here being much more focused and powerful than all their previous output combined.  SUCKED DRY have really honed in their sound with \"Dog Children\", ditching pure speedy HC to create a crushing, atmospheric mindfuck.  At times I hear a bit of RORSCHACH due to how dissonant and ugly this sounds but SUCKED DRY alternate to SIEGE-esque speeds in the blink of an eye.
