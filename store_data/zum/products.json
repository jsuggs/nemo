Robert Horton got his start in the San Francisco punk-noise act The Appliances and the eclectic Plateau Ensemble. After a musical hiatus he returned in the oughts collaborating often with Tom Carter, Loren Chasse, and members of Yellow Swans, as well as releasing solo material under his own name and the moniker of egghatcher. \r\n\r\nAlthough Campbell and Horton never met in person, they were both on the Jeweled Antler mailing list. Both musicians are ridiculously prolific and prone to collaboration and they got to talking disco, as an antidote to all the folk chatter. Campbell says, \"Robert TOLD me in an email 'one day we'll make a disco record together'... who was I to argue?\" As far as the end result being disco, Horton notes \"we failed at that.\" \r\n\r\n\"It was a good idea,\" writes Campbell, \"but you're also correct to draw attention to the missing of original target, which I really like - nothing better than the happy accident.\" Horton continues, \"collaborations are about being surprised and this one did that often. Just when I thought I knew where it was going it went somewhere else. We still have it in our future plans to make a dance record. '70s retro disco with a serious virus inside that causes it to bleed drones.\" \r\n\r\nGuest musicians on the album include Dan Plonsey and Hal Hughes (Horton's Plateau Ensemble bandmate). The title references the infamous Trojandropper virus that infected Horton's computer, eliminating many hours of work and files. The resulting album that had to be pieced back together is something that mixes organic, almost crystalline drones with off kilter beat patterns and lopsided techno. \"Trojandropper\" is beatific, odd, and an anomaly to even its creators, like all projects that take on a life of their own. \r\n\r\n<i>Robert Horton: bass, beats, boot, casio fz-1 sampler, CDs, computer, edits, filters, harmonica, loops, percussion, piano, shenai, tapes, trumpet, turntable, harmonium \r\n\r\nNeil Campbell: acoustic guitar, bliptronic 5000, casios, computer, edits, effects, electric guitar, kaossilator, loops, weevils \r\n\r\nDan Plonsey: Soprano sax on “Slush Flotsam Bunny”</i>","options":[{"id":18177165,"name":"Default","price":14.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":23.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.5,"amount_with_others":13.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55524069/-/6733464361_e7ab491070.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55524069/-/6733464361_e7ab491070.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68345315/-/1b75e130e5ad11e1a78c12313804ce91_7.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68345315/-/1b75e130e5ad11e1a78c12313804ce91_7.jpg","width":612,"height":612},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55524101/-/robert.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55524101/-/robert.jpg","width":507,"height":527},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55524139/-/nc_newyear2012.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55524139/-/nc_newyear2012.jpg","width":300,"height":336}],"artists":[{"id":110441,"name":"Neil Campbell / Astral Social Club","permalink":"neil-campbell-astral-social-club","url":"/artist/neil-campbell-astral-social-club"},{"id":110443,"name":"Robert Horton","permalink":"robert-horton","url":"/artist/robert-horton"},{"id":3805,"name":"Zum","permalink":"zum","url":"/artist/zum"}],"categories":[{"id":133208,"name":"ZUM RELEASES","permalink":"zum-releases","url":"/category/zum-releases"},{"id":126083,"name":"ALL 12\" VINYL","permalink":"all-12-vinyl","url":"/category/all-12-vinyl"}]},{"id":4119121,"name":"High Castle - Spirit Of The West LP","permalink":"high-castle-spirit-of-the-west-lp","position":2,"price":8.95,"default_price":8.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/high-castle-spirit-of-the-west-lp","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-07-20T03:54:22.000Z","description":"Zum032 LP \r\nHigh Castle \r\nSpirit of the West\r\nincludes 11\"x17\" poster/lyric sheet\r\n\r\nFirst album from Bay Area power trio embraces its inner punk beast, wrestling it into submission and teaching it new tricks. Lyric writing dominated by guitarist and visual artist Erin Allen (Child Pornography, Work) points to an evolution of sorts, retaining the muscularity of their first EP \"You're On Your Own Way\" but cleaned up and presented as a whole thematic body. \r\nCarving out autonomy in the midst of wasteland squalor, High Castle knows your plight. Paranoia and bad attitude permeate the record, carpooling to the riots while their peers choose to crisp themselves on corporate beach towels. The black circular saw on the cover speaks for the content within, a destiny manifested tooth by jagged tooth. High Castle eschews lectures and overt philosophy talk, but naming themselves after a Phillip K Dick novel lets you know where they're coming from.\r\n\"Crustaceans Demise\" and \"We Were Lovers\" are ballads for a postapocalyptic affair gone awry, thrones usurped and food pyramids collapsed. Bassist Wilson Drozdowski (Duchesses, Woman's Worth) and powerhouse drummer Shaggy Denton (Hips, Sunny Reaper) also contribute vocals, a secret weapon that comes to the fore on \"Innocence.\" \r\nThough Allen insists \"punk is not a virtue,\" there are sprinklings of Minutemen and Wire in the DNA, although their contemporaries might be Shearing Pinx and Cacaw. \r\nEleven songs tracked by Jacob Felix Heule (Ettrick, Barn Owl) at New, Improved Recordings in Oakland, CA mixed by Heule and the band. The back cover features a painting by the art-collab \"Club Paint\" (Erin Allen, Keith Boadwee and Isaac Gray). \r\n\r\nTRACK LISTING\r\n1. Swamp Thing\r\n2. Innocence\r\n3. We Were Lovers\r\n4.

Current Prague resident Boehringer has performed under the moniker Core of the Coalman since 2004. Based in the Bay Area for most of the '00s, Boehringer would play everything from Noise Pancakes and gritty warehouses to Sf Sound Ensemble shows. His recorded resume includes the \"End Grain/Spirograph\" CDR (an unofficial Zum release), \"Anxiety\" on Resipiscent, and \"Aggregate and Crackle\" on Dylan Nyoukis' Chocolate Monk label. In addition to intensive touring of Europe and the UK (and appearing at Nyoukis' Colour Out Of Space Festival, opening for Deerhoof, etc), Boehringer has worked on theater sound design and in more \"conventional\" rock band formations (US Out Of Our Uterus, Treehugger, Brown Bunny Ensemble, Commode Minstrels in Bullface).\r\n\"Box Of The Last Help\" (the Czech term for a First Aid kit) works with extended repititions that bring to mind Steve Reich tape experiments. Microtonal shifts occur and can be unsettling, nausea inducing, and relentlessly pretty all at once. Those familiar with his live sets may know these pieces, but to be taken as a whole, the album stands alone as a documentation of but one move in an overflowing sonic toolbag.

An initial attempt to learn guitar lead to a deeper interest in effects pedals to the point that the instrument was shunted altogether. The sound of the pedals themselves took precedence and Harms began making rhythmic and melodic adjustments out of a feedback circuit. Labor-intensive trial and error lead to a compositional approach that feels like pure improvisation. \r\nThe essence of this music is partly its means of production, though in a live setting the rhythmic throb has started plenty of moshpits. Having toured with modern music weirdos like Social Junk, Foot Village, and Drums Like Machine Guns (with whom he shares a split 12\") and shared stages with Black Dice, Gang Gang Dance, Extreme Animals, and USAISAMONSTER over the past few years, Harms imbues Mincemeat Or Tenspeed with a hardcore work ethic that's earned him a cult following (Dan Deacon is a supporter and has booked Harms at Whartscape three years running). \"Strange Gods\" is an evolution of sorts, letting the tones ride our more than previous efforts, a continuation of a process begun with records like the \"All Critters\" 12\" (Deathbomb Arc), or this year's double CDR \"Manifest Wizard.\" As the first \"official\" Mincemeat Or Tenspeed CD release, the seven (and a half) tracks here set the bar for \"maximal minimalism\", post-apocalyptic chirps and whirrs shifting and coalescing, cresting and searching for catharsis where none may be coming. Reminiscent of \"a smart ass take on Steve Reich\" (Z Gun) or even the synth-scuzz of Mr. Brinkman, Mincemeat Or Tenspeed is keeping it real whilst making experimental music accessible by virtue of its simplicity. \r\nAlbum artwork by Mark Price, edition of 1000 CDs, full color jewel case.\r\n\r\n\"Mincemeat Or Tenspeed’s live show seem to comprise of two equal parts, amazing skill and chaotic chance, which team together to create fascinating soundscapes.\" - Jason Glastetter, CMJ Blog\r\n\r\n\"Mincemeat or Tenspeed at first come off as a smart ass take on Steven Reich. However, as the needle grooves through, Mincemeat builds on the riff, shatters some rhythms, and shifts into new hooks. This is loud minimalism and full of all kinds of great ideas.\" - Scott Soriano, Z GUN\r\n\r\n\r\nStrange Gods Track Listing\r\n1. Hulot\r\n2. Furious Styles\r\n3. Throw Hands\r\n4.

They produce a viscous byproduct of the jams you grew up on dragged through a record collection's worth of sludge and muck. Once you decide to bring it, that's kinda the only way to go.\r\nThe \"You're on Your Own Way\" EP is the debut record for High Castle, a culmination of songs road tested on summer 2008 US tour and written post New Years hallucinations. Songs about garbage strikes, astral projection, lonely security guards, hedonism, dropping out, meditation, injustice, misplaced hearts...and more. Seven short bursts of salvation, pressing of 500, mastered by Weasel Walter. Two color silkscreened covers by Paul Morgan (Club Sandwich, Business Lady)\r\n\r\n<I>\"The new High Castle 12\" EP is pretty brutal throughout, metal and HC tinged, but it still finds these weird little spazzy, jazzy grooves in spots. Maybe it's art rock? Whatever you want to call it, it's geting some turntable time, and with a song titled 'Are Fixed Gear Tricksters the New Rollerbladers?' I think you get an idea where they stand.

By the time of House On the Hill, August Alston (Lords of Light, Pig Heart Transplant, Walls) joined on vocals and lyrics and added an exponential level of brooding creepiness and intensity. The latest album and first vinyl release, the self-titled Silentist LP, coalesces these elements and made a few top ten lists of 2008.

Luke Calzonetti played in Meths, ABK, and Sheath prior to starting up Child Abuse. After a series of drums and keyboard recordings, they added bassist Tim Dahl and the prog-fused assault went up a significant notch.

Output has run the gamut of modern day guiding lights such as Troubleman Unlimited, Planaria, Gilgongo, and 31G. \"In My Dream I Shot A Monk\" harkens to a vintage mid '00s Zs sound that dovetails nicely with their current output, a beyond aggro vocal workout with epic man-angst you can smell in the grooves.

The duo of Kevin Doria and Joe Denardo have drawn comparisons to the minimalist works of Birchville Cat Motel, LaMonte Young, and Brian Eno. This recording, \"Firmament\", is from a 2002 session and explores a warm drone.\r\nMark Evan Burden's solo recording is a composition of electronics and piano. His 15 minute piece is a roiling, percussive powerhouse that conjures up John Cage and Conlon Nancarrow. The Portland, OR-based musician and Alaska native was formerly the organist for Get Hustle and drummer for Glass Candy. He releases albums on his own Celestial Gang label under the moniker Silentist, an exploration of the heavier side of his compositional interests with drums, guitar, and piano. He is in the groups Litanic Mask and Dangerous Boys Club.\r\nVinyl of this release came out in 2006 through This Generation Tapes from Southern California. The CD is also available in Europe via Xeng/Heroin Records with alternate artwork.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:album:0YhGiheU7ScVH5fZWWwv62\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":600450,"name":"Default","price":5.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":23.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.5,"amount_with_others":13.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/694063/-/zum019.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/694063/-/zum019.jpg","width":144,"height":144},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/701876/-/outsiders-growing.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/701876/-/outsiders-growing.jpg","width":450,"height":210},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/701880/-/burden.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/701880/-/burden.jpg","width":600,"height":450}],"artists":[{"id":3798,"name":"Mark Evan Burden / Silentist","permalink":"mark-evan-burden-silentist","url":"/artist/mark-evan-burden-silentist"},{"id":3799,"name":"Compilation","permalink":"compilation","url":"/artist/compilation"},{"id":3797,"name":"Growing","permalink":"growing","url":"/artist/growing"},{"id":3805,"name":"Zum","permalink":"zum","url":"/artist/zum"}],"categories":[{"id":133208,"name":"ZUM RELEASES","permalink":"zum-releases","url":"/category/zum-releases"},{"id":125895,"name":"CDS","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":1866795,"name":"SALE","permalink":"sale","url":"/category/sale"}]},{"id":126556,"name":"P:ano - The Den CD","permalink":"p-ano-the-den-cd","position":16,"price":10.95,"default_price":10.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/p-ano-the-den-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-07-17T19:00:14.000Z","description":"<object height=\"220\" width=\"220\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F25353446&amp;auto_play=true&amp;player_type=artwork&amp;color=083312\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"220\" src=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F25353446&amp;auto_play=true&amp;player_type=artwork&amp;color=083312\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"220\"></embed> </object>   \r\n\r\nzum018\r\n1\t\tFucking Ugly Bouffant\t2:09\t\r\n2\t\tWorking\t1:41\t\r\n3\t\tWe'll Go In Character Together\t4:05\t\r\n4\t\tArguing\t2:32\t\r\n5\t\tL.D.\t3:37\t\r\n6\t\tFailure\t4:33\t\r\n7\t\tLoud Son\t5:41\t\r\n8\t\tFlowers (Don't You Bring Me No)\t2:33\t\r\n9\t\tAfter School Special (Kvos Tv 12)\t4:17\t\r\n10\t\tNoni Song\t3:34\t\r\n11\t\tNew Son\t6:51\t\r\n12\t\tThe Worst Thing Ever You Could Do\t4:08\t\r\n13\t\tAcross The Street, Desert Plants    2:31\r\n\r\n\"Lush is a word that music critics use entirely too often, but one would be hard-pressed to find a more accurate adjective to describe the latest p:ano album. To flesh out the uniformly slow, sad songs on The Den, the Vancouver four-piece recruited 18 guest musicians. Among that number are some of the city's finest players, including cellist Peggy Lee, singer Veda Hille, and multi-instrumentalist Stefan Udell (of the Beans). As a result, tracks such as 'L.D.' and 'The Worst Thing You Could Ever Do' are laden with strings, brass, and choirlike backing vocals. In the wrong hands, this could be a recipe for an overwrought mess, but the arrangements here are surprisingly uncluttered, leaving plenty of space for the songs' simple melodies. Singer Nick Krgovich mutters these in such an offhand way that you have to listen closely to realize that he's saying things like, 'How nice it would be for something tragic to happen.'\r\n\r\nIf The Den barely resembles the sound that p:ano achieves live as a quartet, that's beside the point.

Described by some as the best working band in Canada, the Beans have released the well-received Portage full-length ( Zulu) and 2000's Tired Snow EP (zum009). The five members of this Vancouver collective seamlessly blend spontaneity with studio mastery. Their latest full-length, Crane Wars (zum012-LP and CD), nests in the overlap between the organic and inorganic, technology and nature. There are clashes and closure between samples, clarion trumpet, guitars, accordion, vocals, piano and beats. Melodic explorations and textural nuances catch your breath like anything that is beautiful and inexplicable. The group performed for 48 Hours straight.

We asked them about compiling all their vinyl tracks on a CD, which is what ended up being \"Junk of Myth\", but in the interim they offered for me to release these songs as a 7\". \"The Word #2\" is part of a track that was on the original \"Follow For Now\" LP that is oddly not included in Junk of Myth. For some reason it was not on the original reel. \r\nThis was a co-release with Yakamashi and Sound on Sound, and the first 7\" Zum ever released back in 1999. Photo of Andrew on the cover were taken by Mike Cancel, and the back cover photo (which some of us would have preferred as the front cover) was taken by Matt Roberts. The handwritten text all over was done by Chuck Pettry. My favorite graphic element of this record was the label itself, which was designed by Josh Baker. The jackets are really nice, pressed at Dorado, and the vinyl was mastered by George Horn. A real slice of its time.","options":[{"id":601279,"name":"Default","price":2.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":38.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":22.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/696159/-/nuzzle.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/696159/-/nuzzle.jpg","width":190,"height":192},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116059098/-/48774.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116059098/-/48774.jpg","width":476,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":3806,"name":"Nuzzle","permalink":"nuzzle","url":"/artist/nuzzle"},{"id":3805,"name":"Zum","permalink":"zum","url":"/artist/zum"}],"categories":[{"id":133208,"name":"ZUM RELEASES","permalink":"zum-releases","url":"/category/zum-releases"},{"id":125928,"name":"ALL 7\" VINYL","permalink":"all-7-vinyl","url":"/category/all-7-vinyl"}]},{"id":126609,"name":"Zum Audio Volume 2 CD","permalink":"zum-audio-volume-2-cd","position":25,"price":9.95,"default_price":9.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/zum-audio-volume-2-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-07-17T20:37:22.000Z","description":"Zum002 compilation (1998)\r\n\r\nThe comp that firmly established Zum on the audio map.

The Invisible Hands is the English translation of the band's original Egyptian Arabic name: El Ayadi El Khafeyya. Taking almost two years to create amidst an unusual and challenging backdrop, this is the new project of Alvarius B. (Alan Bishop of Sun City Girls). Eleven highly-crafted songs projected through his typically dark lens of songwriting and a band of brilliant musicians from Egypt; this special edition limited 2LP includes the English and Arabic language vocal versions of the album together in one set. Sides A and B are the English album delivered in AB's patented sinister style, drenched in lovely psychedelic folk arrangements and vocal choruses with a nod to what could have potentially been an album that surfaced decades ago but instead found its way into the future, superimposed over historic and tumultuous times in the center of the Arab world. Sides C and D are the Arabic version -- the exact same 11 songs but the lead vocals are sung in Arabic by Cherif El Masri and Aya Hemeda. The mixes are almost identical but there are various subtle differences in instrumentation, vocal choruses, and effects. The group was established during the summer of 2011 and the album was recorded in Cairo in May of 2012.

Although touching on his past in Yellow Swans (with Pete Swanson), Saloman continues to explore the noises within rather than the purely physical component of his former collaborator. That's not saying this is lighthearted material. Quite the contrary. This is an album that needs to be experienced on proper volume for potential heart-stopping effect. Sounding as if you may be the last person left on earth, Soldier's Requiem guides you through rain-filled open spaces, epic showdowns and abandoned cities. The debris is floating and in the shadow lurks a guitar-picking Vincent Gallo. Meanwhile, there seems to be marching bands closing in on all fronts while a punk band playing Tim Hecker tracks can be heard from the horizon. Soldier's Requiem confirms Saloman as a man able to further his own musicality while regaining the key elements to his recipe. This is music for modern decay and melancholy.","options":[{"id":50217612,"name":"Default","price":19.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":23.0,"amount_with_others":38.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":22.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129092211/-/gabrielsalomanlp-9.25.2013.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129092211/-/gabrielsalomanlp-9.25.2013.jpg","width":685,"height":685}],"artists":[{"id":4077,"name":"Yellow Swans","permalink":"yellow-swans","url":"/artist/yellow-swans"}],"categories":[{"id":126083,"name":"ALL 12\" VINYL","permalink":"all-12-vinyl","url":"/category/all-12-vinyl"},{"id":212206,"name":"IMPORTS","permalink":"imports","url":"/category/imports"}]},{"id":15440067,"name":"Rene Hell - Vanilla Call Option LP","permalink":"rene-hell-vanilla-call-option-lp","position":34,"price":27.5,"default_price":27.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rene-hell-vanilla-call-option-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-09T18:40:28.000Z","description":"PAN\r\n\r\nJeff Witscher aka Rene Hell is a notoriously unique artist and nomadic SoCal everyman.

In his own words, Witscher attempted to construct \"vertical narratives\" that at times evoke the musique concrète of Bernard Parmegiani and probing electronic experiments of Charles Dodge.

These four instrumental cuts from 1976 see the prolific musician and producer modernizing Chinese folk melodies and rocketing them into the space-age. Solid synth leads are backed with fuzz and wah-wah guitars, tight funk bass lines and haunting organs -- integrating shades of surf, soul, rock, and disco into his unique sound. Multifaceted rhythms feature punchy electronic beats peppered with hand-drums and other natural percussion, while synths of all shapes and textures pan throughout the spacious mixes. Young's adventurous and unpredictable technique and production never missed a beat -- unless it was intended. Oscar Young -- known also as Yang Road Fire, or Yang Daohuo -- worked prolifically in the East Asian rock and pop music scene between the 1960s and 1980s. He first gained acclaim as an arranger, working with singers such as Teresa Teng, Xiao-Jun Huang and go-go bands like the Apollo, as well as creating scores for movies. His classical background allowed him to create a perfect hybrid of traditional Chinese music and new electronic sounds and instruments of the time. Young released multiple volumes of albums: his own series spans over 30 volumes, while his collaborations with the Apollo Band yielded an equal amount. His music can be compared to the likes of Martin Denny or Dick Hyman's synthesizer-infused exotica, or the high-profile Moog pioneers, Perry & Kingsley. The tracks featured on this EP are from his booming period of electronic experimentation during the early-to-mid 1970s, and represent a mere sliver of his giant catalog and immeasurable talent -- a short-but-sweet introduction to the wondrous synthesizer world of Oscar Young.","options":[{"id":49752942,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":23.0,"amount_with_others":38.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":22.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128747136/-/SHAM005EP_PROD.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128747136/-/SHAM005EP_PROD.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":125928,"name":"ALL 7\" VINYL","permalink":"all-7-vinyl","url":"/category/all-7-vinyl"}]},{"id":15293814,"name":"Hassaniya Music from the Western Sahara and Mauritania LP","permalink":"hassaniya-music-from-the-western-sahara-and-mauritania-lp","position":36,"price":24.5,"default_price":24.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/hassaniya-music-from-the-western-sahara-and-mauritania-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-03T09:29:38.000Z","description":"Hassaniya Music from the Western Sahara and Mauritania\r\nSUBLIME FREQUENCIES\r\nSF 083LP\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Hisham Mayet returned to West Africa to continue his search for an unknown musician he had heard six months earlier on the radio in a Morocco hotel room. Knowing only that it was Sahrawi music -- music of the south -- he headed down through the vast and remote desert landscape of the Western Sahara and Mauritania in hopes of finding someone who could identify these revelatory recordings. The story of how he finally found this elusive artist is the stuff of ethnomusicological legend. But he also found much, much more as he wandered from Laâyoune, Western Sahara, to Mauritania's capital city of Nouakchott. From intimate, sinuous home recordings by Group Marwani, to a sublimely devastating track by the enigmatic Abdul Rahman Al-Gheid, to the inimitable tidinit artistry of Sadoum Ouled Aida, the performers on this album exemplify the haunting and intoxicating qualities of Sahrawi music. Featuring Mayet's first recordings of the electrifying Group Doueh, as well as dizzying field recordings from Nouakchott's Marché Capitale -- where relentless traffic noise swirls together with fragments of melody from countless cassette vendors' PA speakers -- Hassānīya Music from the Western Sahara and Mauritania is the evocative soundtrack to a chimerical journey that is also documented visually in Sublime Frequencies' breathtaking film Palace of the Winds (SF 047DVD). It not only traces Mayet's own passage through these barren and beautiful lands, but also charts the evolution of Sahrawi music from sung poetry accompanied by traditional acoustic instruments to electrifying modern grooves drenched in reverb and phase effects.

It's musical alchemy in its purest, most remarkable form, pushing at the boundaries of geographical divergence while simultaneously speaking to the shared resonances between Western rock rhythms and the pulse of the Saharan trance tradition. Since its inception, Group Doueh's ability to craft pop hooks from a foundation of saharoui roots music has been a manifestation of sheer song craft and innovation. The tracks on Zayna Jumma are a deeper excavation of the group's forged terrain: a collision of contemporary Afro-Saharan grooves balanced with the searing modalities of Doueh's desert origins, finally nuanced by the transcendental pop/rock/desert blues elements honed from gestating in the fringes of the Sahara desert. For the latest installment of this Dakhla family's musical dynasty, Doueh recruits his next eldest sons El Waar (synth) and Hamdan (drum kit), and wife Halima is augmented by three female back-up singers. The band keeps evolving and this album reveals its newest phase -- that of a formidable ROCK unit. The songs on this record were recorded in 2010 -- a busy year for Doueh, maintaining its day job as the go-to group of the Saharan wedding industry while still managing recording sessions and a tour with Tony Allen (Fela Kuti's long-time drummer).

The focus here is more on alien electronics and overloaded loop disorientation, sometimes even working with sounds more readily associated with the far end of dance music to produce a truly vast 21st century psychedelic sound.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":49720947,"name":"Default","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":23.0,"amount_with_others":38.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":22.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128722599/-/R-1008990-1375162949-1931.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128722599/-/R-1008990-1375162949-1931.gif","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":110441,"name":"Neil Campbell / Astral Social Club","permalink":"neil-campbell-astral-social-club","url":"/artist/neil-campbell-astral-social-club"}],"categories":[{"id":126083,"name":"ALL 12\" VINYL","permalink":"all-12-vinyl","url":"/category/all-12-vinyl"}]},{"id":15293493,"name":"Dieuf-Dieul De Thiès ‎– Aw Sa Yone Vol. 1 2LP","permalink":"dieuf-dieul-de-thies-aw-sa-yone-vol-1-2lp","position":41,"price":30.5,"default_price":30.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dieuf-dieul-de-thies-aw-sa-yone-vol-1-2lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-03T08:42:42.000Z","description":"Dieuf-Dieul De Thiès ‎– Aw Sa Yone Vol. 1\r\nTeranga Beat ‎– TBLP 017\r\n\r\nTERANGA BEAT proudly presents DIEUF-DIEUL de THIÈS in their first ever edition. Three singers ASSANE CAMARA, BASSIROU SARR and GORA MBAYE together with their chef d'orchestre and guitar player PAPE SECK (an ex-member of GUELEWAR) compose traditional rhythms from all the regions of Senegal, with fuzz guitars, horn sections and hallucinatory percussion. \r\n\r\nThe result is an explosive mixture of an Electric Psychedelic sound with the wisdom and superiority of the musical traditions of the region, a crossover of AFRO-MANDING and AFRO-JAZZ, in which each singer guides the 13-member band in a different direction. Even today this 32 year old recording sounds futuristic and it is really rather weird that DIEUF-DIEUL never had the chance to release an actual album.\r\n\r\nAw Sa Yone Vol.1 includes the biggest part of their second recording and the double LP comes in a special edition with a Silkscreen print cover (see pictures below) with a large poster & included in the CD booklet photos and liner notes outlining the group member's careers.

There was nothing and no one to forge a connection between the handful of small, isolated groups, fundamentally motivated by a passion for what they deemed true rock 'n' roll (the desire to terrorize the neighborhood arrived soon afterward), each in their own little world, trying to provoke their backwater village or their lame metropolis, and meeting, of course, with total indifference.

This limited edition LP comes housed in a gorgeous hand-printed silkscreen sleeve, with insert. Sequenced in chronological order on the LP as the tracks were recorded in the studio, the opener 'Flamingo Moon' takes off into outer space. It's a gentle start to the impending Astral chaos as the rambunctious 'Punk Rocker / Mug Cracker' noisily propels itself and its passengers forwards. This 14-minute showdown is divided into two parts with the loose, drum-led 'Punk Rocker' submerging into the swooping sonics of the 'Mug Cracker.' Side 2 introduces a playful element into the spiral density with percussive sticks and bells providing a tribal backdrop for resonant electronics, keyboard odysseys and some experimental vocal work from helmsman Neil Campbell. After a wild solar adventure, the album culminates in 'Ramoon Ramoon,' a considered and tight improvisation that steers the Club homeward. Whilst Club member John Clyde-Evans's laptop contributions provide much of the backbone groove of the album, Stewart Keith adds light and shade on a variety of keyboards and toys. But it's Campbell's dense guitars that thicken the very stem of these four tracks and leads his Astral Social Club to conjure up his dreams and visions. Neil Campbell is a stalwart of the UK experimental music scene who began making music in the early 1980s. Originally a member of loose improvisational collective A-Band, he established himself more firmly in the 90s as a founding member of Vibracathedral Orchestra. Campbell utilizes guitars, electronics, vocals and laptop generated and manipulated sounds in his freeform improvisations. In 2005, he embarked on his solo project Astral Social Club often drawing on the talents of kindred spirits. Stewart Keith is a long-time friend and collaborator of Neil Campbell and one of the main members of Nottingham's the A-Band playing free drone and high-energy rock music and championing an un-tutored, elemental and almost primitive approach to music making. John Clyde-Evans, aka Tirath Singh Nirmala, has played with artists such as Richard Youngs and Vibracathedral Orchestra contributing computer generated sounds, electronics and violin.\" Limited 500 copies, numbered.","options":[{"id":49209969,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":23.0,"amount_with_others":38.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":22.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128353152/-/R-1789968-1333339838.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128353152/-/R-1789968-1333339838.jpeg","width":333,"height":333}],"artists":[{"id":110441,"name":"Neil Campbell / Astral Social Club","permalink":"neil-campbell-astral-social-club","url":"/artist/neil-campbell-astral-social-club"}],"categories":[{"id":126083,"name":"ALL 12\" VINYL","permalink":"all-12-vinyl","url":"/category/all-12-vinyl"},{"id":212206,"name":"IMPORTS","permalink":"imports","url":"/category/imports"}]},{"id":15140535,"name":"Choubi Choubi Vol. 2 2LP","permalink":"choubi-choubi-vol-2-2lp","position":49,"price":28.5,"default_price":28.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/choubi-choubi-vol-2-2lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-27T10:02:53.000Z","description":"Choubi Choubi! Folk & Pop Sounds from Iraq Vol. 2\r\nSUBLIME FREQUENCIES\r\nSF 085LP\r\nIn 2005, Sublime Frequencies released Choubi Choubi: Folk and Pop Sounds from Iraq, and in the ensuing years it has become one of the most beloved and venerable titles in their catalog. Now almost 10 years later, this highly-anticipated second volume is finally here. Compiler and producer Mark Gergis has once again put forth a revelatory and poignant collection of Iraq's national folk music. What has happened to Iraq since the 2003 U.S. invasion and eventual occupation? Endless death, destruction and chaos, the complete take-down of a functional and sovereign secular government (regardless of your opinion on that government), puppet installations, contrived sectarian divisions, the wholesale looting of culture, rampant opportunism, and apparently no lessons learned -- all at the Iraqi people's expense. Naturally, music has continued to be produced in Iraq -- however, since 2003, musicians and artists have been consistently targeted and attacked by extremists, who have also bombed music shops and forced the closing of venues and music halls. The musical style most prominently focused on in this volume is the infamous Iraqi choubi, (pronounced choe-bee), with its distinct driving rhythm that feature fiddles, double-reed instruments, bass, keyboards, and oud over its signature beat. Choubi is Iraq's version of the regionally popular dabke, another celebratory Levantine folkloric style of rhythm and line dance. What really defines the Iraqi choubi sound are the crisp, rapid-fire machine-gun style percussive rhythms set atop the main beat. To the uninitiated, they sound almost electronic. Sometimes they are, but more often this is the work of the khishba -- a unique hand-drum of nomadic origin (aka the zanbour -- Arabic for wasp), which appears across the board in many styles of Iraqi music today, with extensions of it also heard in Syrian and Kuwaiti music. Among other styles featured in this volume are Iraq's legendary brand of mawal -- an ornamental vocal improvisation that sets the tone of a song, regardless of the style, and the outstanding Iraqi hecha, with its lumbering and determined rhythm pulsing beneath sad, antagonized vocals -- as heard on tracks A4 and B2. The tracks on this collection were produced during the Saddam era -- between the 1980s and early-2000s. An important goal within the Iraqi Baathist agenda was to promote its brand of secularism, which saw the establishment of cultural centers, and a fostering of the arts. Music was more encouraged, albeit more institutionalized than ever -- particularly folkloric and heritage music such as choubi. In an Iraqi army comprised of seven divisions, Saddam referred to singers as the eighth. Still, unless a rare level of stardom has been achieved, being a singer or musician isn't usually encouraged or viewed as a respectable lifestyle in much of the Arab world. It's often those deemed social outsiders that tend to find their niche in music -- particularly the \"party music\" heard on this collection. Among them are the Rom Gypsy Iraqis (known as Kawliya in Arabic). A number of female singers wear masks and adopt pseudonyms to protect their identities, as some are runaways or prostitutes making ends meet in the seedy nightclub scene. Occasionally, they end up with successful recording careers. Sajida Obeid, who has appeared on both volumes of Choubi Choubi! is an example of a talented Kawliya singer from the nightclub scene of the 1980s who rose to choubi infamy in Baghdad. Choubi inevitably invokes tawdry connotations within Iraqi society (cheap nightclubs for the lower classes, outcast gypsies and singing prostitutes), but in fact, many calibers of Iraqi singers and ensembles have recorded and performed the music. Unofficially, choubi can be called the national dance of Iraq. Though some may deny this claim (mostly due to its reputation and stigma), at most Iraqi weddings you'll find people from all walks flaunting their best choubi moves. Iraqi music has always had a way of transcending religious groups and ethnicity, collectively shared between Arabs, Kurds, Assyrians and myriad other Iraqi minorities. In 2013 sadly, this diversity and unity within Iraq is increasingly fragmented, but traditions continue throughout the internationally displaced diaspora.

Amongst the most experimental, psychedelic bands out of Africa, GUELEWAR offer a unique sound and instrumentation, mixing traditional compositions with modern instruments such as the Mini-MOOG. The ALLIGATORS was a group led by BAI JANHA who was the most important musician from the Gambia. The ALLIGATORS later became GUELEWAR when BAI began to collaborate with LAYE N'GOM. GUELEWAR fused a blend of Bougaraboo & Saourouba mixed with Soul & Funk and were heavily influenced by traditional singer MOUSSA N'GOM. For one decade GUELEWAR was the biggest influence in the region of Sene-Gambian music. Here in their last recording, live in the \"Canari Club de Kaolack\", Senegal, 1982 the 12 members guide you to another level. The double gatefold LP's liner notes and CD’s 16 page booklet include more information and photographs outlining the beautiful story of this exceptional band from this distinctive West African country, The Gambia.

The result: a unique triumph of homegrown rural psychedelia, standing alone on the edge of an unchartered vanguard. Los Siquicos have spent the past decade recording and performing mountains of material and distilling it into a rare form of ultra-cerebral roots music from the countryside; rich with strange passion, beauty, experimentation, horror and humor. Corrientes sits in the Argentine Mesopotamic region, in the area known as el Litoral. Inhabitants of this region are known as Litoraleños. Los Siquicos Litoraleños (The Psychics of el Litoral) aren't running from their musical heritage, they are staring straight at it -- spinning it around, refracting it, and transmuting it into something that is probably one of the most genuine things that has happened to folk, rock, experimental or psychedelic music in many years. Having met through various musical projects in the mid-2000s, Los Siquicos formed as a trio in 2004, determined to develop an unheard style of music. They created their own genre -- Chipadelia, (a reference to the traditional chipá bread, typical of northeast Argentina and Paraguay). It involves equalizational demolition therapy -- which they describe as 'using sound to change people's perceptions, and words to produce cognitive dissonance in order to free the masses from the prison of fixed ideas and prejudices.' Being a peripheral band living in a semi-rural town, Los Siquicos remained outsiders to the Argentinian rock circuit for quite a while, though their unpredictable live performances in Buenos Aires caused a stir amongst the local scene. Their shows often feature extended line-ups, with members cloaked in surreal gaucho costumes, playing segments of free-music and altered versions of chamamé and cumbia tunes influenced by the myriad regional gaucho dance bands. All the while, projections of cows, fractals, UFOs and their beloved countryside play out in the background. At home, they're affectionately referred to as 'El Pink Floyd de los pobres' -- the poor man's Pink Floyd. Over time, the group has gained underground acclaim both nationally and abroad after sending their signals out in the form of self-released CDs, internet presence, and a handful of European tours. This collection has been culled from multiple recordings made between 2005 and 2010. It showcases some of the finest compositional moments in the group's dense and damaged repertoire -- pitched-down cumbias soaked in dub brine, swirling solar instrumentals, and surrealist, shamanic lyrics laid across guitars, drums, tapes and electronics. Forty-four minutes of deep, multi-fidelity electric and acoustic psychic sound-forms for a better today. Los Siquicos Litoraleños are the contemporary group you keep hoping exist, but can never find. If you were to reach for spiritual comparisons, you wouldn't be forgetting the most spirited moments from Sun City Girls, Butthole Surfers, Faust, Os Mutantes, Captain Beefheart or The Residents. Sonido Chipadelico opens with the mind-melting psych-rocker 'Cinta Planeteria' -- like a Latin American time-travel experiment gone wrong. 'Cachaka Espejo,' 'Tenemos Semillas' and 'No Sabemos Nada' reinvent cumbia radio tunes as if heard from a distance of at least two blocks away on a dirt road in the barrio, then deconstructed, propelled into the outer ether, and beamed back into a burning dub transistor. 'El Chipa Chiriri' is a subverted chamamé-styled track -- revealing the recipe for the local Corrientes cheese bread. 'Necesita Ecualisacion' is a call for aural and mental equilibrium encouraging change rapidly from the present state of things to an improved and more complex, flexible state. The hypnotic 'Sirena Chunga y la Movida Solar' is perhaps one of the strangest folkloric songs ever committed to tape -- not unlike what light must hear when it travels inside of a vacuum. 'Si, Si, Si' is an uptempo, angular anthem in collaboration with Dutch experimental duo Static Tics. Also included is Los Siquicos' haunting acid-ballad cover of 'Quizás, Quizás,' and much more -- further into the greater depths of sound and surprise...\" --Mark Gergis\r\n\r\n\r\n<object height=\"220\" width=\"220\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/119640235&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=artwork\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"220\" height=\"220\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/119640235&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=artwork\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"></embed></object>","options":[{"id":49182135,"name":"Default","price":18.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":23.0,"amount_with_others":38.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":22.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128330049/-/Los-Siquicos.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128330049/-/Los-Siquicos.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128330100/-/Siquicos-litorale%C3%B1os-1024x680.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128330100/-/Siquicos-litorale%C3%B1os-1024x680.jpg","width":1024,"height":680}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":126083,"name":"ALL 12\" VINYL","permalink":"all-12-vinyl","url":"/category/all-12-vinyl"}]},{"id":15140334,"name":"Oneohtrix Point Never / Rene Hell LP","permalink":"oneohtrix-point-never-rene-hell-lp","position":52,"price":19.5,"default_price":19.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/oneohtrix-point-never-rene-hell-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-27T09:43:14.000Z","description":"NNA051: \r\nOneohtrix Point Never / Rene Hell split LP\r\nNNA’s second split LP unites two American artists on the cutting edge of experimental electronic music: Brooklyn’s Oneohtrix Point Never and Los Angeles’ Rene Hell. Daniel Lopatin and Jeff Witscher have each been working tirelessly in the US underground for the last several years, releasing progressive, forward-thinking, and highly acclaimed music under a wide variety of guises and manifestations. In 2012, we see them each offering their respective unique visions and interpretations of digital music in the modern world, processing the world around us through the lens of technology and modern sound.\r\nOneohtrix Point Never brings us “Music For Reliquary House”, which consists of sonic reworkings from the “Reliquary House” audio/visual installation, a collaboration between Lopatin and video artist Nate Boyce. In a series of five pieces, Lopatin delivers a sequence of hallucinatory informatic assaults, a satirical re-envisioning of modernist sculpture. Picking up where 2011′s “Replica” left off, OPN uses digital technology to dissect human speech patterns and timbres almost beyond recognition. Via computer, Lopatin converts pieces of text to human speech, only to dismantle it entirely, surgically reassembling the scraps of frequencies and the shrapnel of pure sound into something new altogether… starkly melodic at times, but altogether harsh and inhuman as a whole.\r\nRene Hell presents “In 1980 I Was A Blue Square”, a suite of five pieces for piano, synthesizer, and computer. Juxtaposing mid 20th century classical music with chaotic electronic blasts, Witscher creates his own style of contemporary music that is peaceful and violent on top of itself, creating a rift of confusion that sits nicely between more vast, soundscape-like vignettes. Witscher’s previous forays into the worlds of noise and ambient are tastefully apparent here, indicative of an artist who is able to retain a broad array of influences and use them in a way that is both personal and original.\r\n\r\nMastered and cut by Lupo at Dubplates & Mastering, Berlin.\r\n","options":[{"id":49181964,"name":"Default","price":19.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":23.0,"amount_with_others":38.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":22.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128329953/-/NNA051_Dan.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128329953/-/NNA051_Dan.jpg","width":380,"height":383},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128329860/-/NNA051_Jeff.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128329860/-/NNA051_Jeff.jpg","width":380,"height":383}],"artists":[{"id":152034,"name":"Oneohtrix Point Never","permalink":"oneohtrix-point-never","url":"/artist/oneohtrix-point-never"},{"id":9007,"name":"Jeff Witscher","permalink":"jeff-witscher","url":"/artist/jeff-witscher"}],"categories":[{"id":126083,"name":"ALL 12\" VINYL","permalink":"all-12-vinyl","url":"/category/all-12-vinyl"}]},{"id":15119694,"name":"Body/Gate/Head - Glare Luring Yo LP","permalink":"body-gate-head-glare-luring-yo-lp","position":53,"price":21.0,"default_price":21.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/body-gate-head-glare-luring-yo-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-26T17:45:29.000Z","description":"Feeding Tube Records\r\n\r\nA\t\t One For Alice Bonnard\t\t\r\nB\t\t One For Earthworm Jim\t\t\r\n\r\nGuitar – Bill Nace, Michael Morley\r\nGuitar, Vocals – Kim Gordon\r\n\r\nRecorded Florence MA 2012.\r\nEdition of 300","options":[{"id":49106931,"name":"Default","price":21.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":23.0,"amount_with_others":38.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":22.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128275410/-/R-4085688-1354741902-9095.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128275410/-/R-4085688-1354741902-9095.jpeg","width":320,"height":310}],"artists":[{"id":148179,"name":"Dead C","permalink":"dead-c","url":"/artist/dead-c"}],"categories":[{"id":126083,"name":"ALL 12\" VINYL","permalink":"all-12-vinyl","url":"/category/all-12-vinyl"}]},{"id":14648301,"name":"Form A Log - The Two Benji's LP","permalink":"form-a-log-the-two-benji-s-lp","position":54,"price":16.0,"default_price":16.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/form-a-log-the-two-benji-s-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-06T00:11:56.000Z","description":"Form A Log\r\nThe Two Benji's\r\n(Decoherence) LP\r\n\r\nTrio of Ren Schofield (Container, ex-God Willing, Dynasty), Noah Anthony (Profligate, ex-Social Junk, ex-Nightburger) and Rick Weaver (Dinner Music, Human Conduct Records) \r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0;

Over two sides and four compositions, Bertucci weaves a suite of tape-focused compositions which utilize a vast library of sources, including her trademark bass clarinet (which she put to exquisite use at the center of her past work in TwistyCat as well as her many solo and collaborative performances), bowed vibraphone, various percussive implements, and mysterious field recordings take from her homestead of Brooklyn, Southern Utah, and areas unnamed. The compositions embrace an expanse of quietude that’s carefully punctuated by the reverberating progression of her meticulously collaged resonances. The album’s title is thus most apt as Bertucci’s patient focus and eclectic and tolerant ear build beautifully potent and dynamic structures out of the incidental and unexpected. Her art fits confidently and boldly alongside likeminded seekers such as Moniek Darge, Graham Lambkin, Vanessa Rossetto, The Hafler Trio, and Luc Ferrari. A must for anybody interested in modern experimental composition and sound art. Coke-bottle clear vinyl packaged in a translucent sleeve designed and printed by Bertucci herself.

Ever since banding together in the late 90′s, the duo’s numerous recorded and live works have rendered a suitable explanation of all the encompasses their vanguard productions almost unfeasible; the at-once disjointedly colliding yet ingeniously intersecting torrents of homemade electronics, tape delay, blaring riffs relayed via both guitar and synth, and subsonic rhythms are all masterfully rendered into a peculiarly riveting design which only Carbon and Sheppard seem to hold the secret to. The eight songs on Paw The Elated Ruin fluctuate between apparitions of the skewed-punk of the duo’s early tenure in Bride Of No No with the post-industrial electronic nihilism of peers such as Wolf Eyes, the otherworldly improvisational blasphemy of avant-pioneers Smegma, and the destructive reconfigurations of Nautical Almanac. While potentially resembling some of the mechanization of accustomed song-forms, Metalux’s inventive abstraction carries the finished exclamations past whatever barriers divide familiarity and innovation. Paw previously saw release as a very limited run of self-released CDR’s and stands as another compelling highlight in a discography that’s seen release via such esteemed imprints as 5RC, Load Records, No Fun Productions, Bennifer Editions, and Hanson Records. Obsolete Units is immensely thrilled to be able to give this triumphant dissertation a second coming.

An examination of recent releases demonstrates the endless regurgitation that is taking place and how pitifully inadequate most bands are at recreating the sounds of years past. However, there are those rare moments when a new band captures not only the sound, but the entire spirit of a style that seemingly died long ago. Cauchemar has done exactly that with their debut mLP entitled “La Vierge Noire.” Cauchemar certainly have mastered the heavy metal infused classic doom sound that is the focus of their pursuit. The instruments are all recorded and played in a manner that genuinely calls to mind the canonical recordings of the 1970’s and 1980’s. Emulating that sound is the easy part though. It is an entirely different matter to be able tap into the essence of that style and cultivate as thoroughly authentic a sensibility as Cauchemar demonstrate here. The songs presented on “La Vierge Noire” combine the heavy/speed metal of bands like Acid with the dark doom of Pagan Altar. The vocals, feminine and haunting and delivered in French, enhance the mysteriousness of the sound and provide a certain overall melancholy to the music. The result is unaffected, poignant, and vividly evocative music made with a strict devotion to classic sounds, but constructed and presented with a sensibility that is informed by the intervening developments throughout the years. There is no question that Cauchemar will continue to hone and develop their approach on later releases, but this debut will undoubtedly be remembered and recalled as among the best attempts within this subcategory of metal.\r\ncredits\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":40847865,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":23.0,"amount_with_others":38.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":22.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122408763/-/R-3637332-1342098067-1636.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122408763/-/R-3637332-1342098067-1636.jpeg","width":377,"height":377}],"artists":[{"id":232953,"name":"Metal","permalink":"metal","url":"/artist/metal"}],"categories":[{"id":125895,"name":"CDS","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":9743624,"name":"Mouthus / Bulbs LP","permalink":"mouthus-bulbs-lp","position":71,"price":19.0,"default_price":19.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mouthus-bulbs-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-05T09:53:02.000Z","description":"Mouthus / Bulbs ‎– Where The Bridge Was Found / Emerald Isle\r\nImportant Records ‎– IMPREC255\r\nLP\r\nOf the first 50 mailorder copies screen printed on blue paper.

Back in the 1990's four fast friends ruled the indie/hardcore scene in Santa Cruz, CA going by the name of Nuzzle. High energy shows with some of the biggest bands around led to a cult like following and a release on the Troubleman Unlimited label as well as Bay Area Label Zum.\r\n\r\nAs the band grew, their sound changed. It grew into something different, something more, something that definitely was not Nuzzle. So, when they readied a new ep's worth of material in 2001 the sound was so different, so the band changed their name to The Dying Californian and started a new musical path.\r\n\r\nToday, with over 10 years creating music together, the four have not lost any of the live intensity of their younger days, it's just channeled differently. Their journey is more like a marathon than a sprint. Fueled by the voices that come late at night , a few drinks in and most likely a few more to go, their new full length album, recorded in San Francisco, is a blend of Indie Rock, Americana, tinged with the Blues and some Country.\r\n\r\nIn 2002 The Dying Californian released their first full length record, We Are The Birds That Stay, on Turn Records.\r\n\r\nthe band is: Nate Dalton, Simon Fabela, Andrew Dalton, Ricardo Reano, Liam Nelson\r\n\r\n1\t\t Prairie Fire   3:12\t\r\n2\t\t Madrugada\t4:11\t\r\n3\t\t Phobos & Deimos  4:23\t\r\n4\t\t Scene Of The Crime\t2:00\t\r\n5\t\t My Heaven Knows No Reign\t5:40\t\r\n6\t\t The Birds That Stay\t6:32\t\r\n7\t\t Longer Nights And Shorter Roads\t4:00\t\r\n8\t\t The Frozen Path\t4:37\t\r\n9\t\t Tropism Blues\t3:53\t\r\n10\t\t Long White Hair\t6:37\t\r\n11\t\t Chris's Blues     6:01\t\r\n12\t\t Sweet Republic\t  3:19\t\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/xf0rl0hCrls\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n","options":[{"id":41854071,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":23.0,"amount_with_others":38.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":22.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123156888/-/R-717389-1151315845.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123156888/-/R-717389-1151315845.jpeg","width":200,"height":200},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123156897/-/TDC_band.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123156897/-/TDC_band.jpg","width":420,"height":315}],"artists":[{"id":3806,"name":"Nuzzle","permalink":"nuzzle","url":"/artist/nuzzle"}],"categories":[{"id":125895,"name":"CDS","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":13658421,"name":"KIT - Broken Voyage LP","permalink":"kit-broken-voyage-lp","position":77,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kit-broken-voyage-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-19T07:10:44.000Z","description":"KIT\r\nBroken Voyage\r\nUpset the Rhythm\r\nLP\r\n\r\nThis excellent debut album from Oakland’s Kit comes after a number of split 7” releases alongside Wives, Captain Ahab and the mighty Deerhoof. Kit in fact have a great deal in common with Deerhoof: both bands have a penchant for juxtaposing visceral no-wave guitars against blissful pop vocals, utilising some pretty left-of-field production techniques along the way. By no means are Kit as easy to pin down as that, however: the free noise abandon of ‘Maps’ propels them into the sort of punk netherworld Boredoms hang around in, while the nursery rhyme garage of ‘Forest’ is similarly barmy. Single potential comes from ‘Fake Broken Legs’, which sounds like Melt Banana produced by DAT Politics, slamming unintelligible, stuttering vocals against cheerfully out-of-tune synth hooks. Proving that Broken Voyage isn’t merely an album of energetic, hipster avant-rock, ‘Nautical Lament’ encroaches on some altogether murkier territory, weaving some haunted electronics and dissonant dulcimer passages in between all the jagged riffing. It might seem all too brief (clocking in at just over twenty minutes), but Broken Voyage is an exceptionally enjoyable debut with far more ideas crammed into it than its short duration could possibly suggest.","options":[{"id":43811187,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":23.0,"amount_with_others":38.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":22.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124537401/-/0828887000810.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124537401/-/0828887000810.jpg","width":350,"height":350},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124537410/-/1_150dpi.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124537410/-/1_150dpi.jpg","width":266,"height":400}],"artists":[{"id":3813,"name":"George Chen","permalink":"george-chen","url":"/artist/george-chen"},{"id":4504,"name":"Common Eider King Eider","permalink":"common-eider-king-eider","url":"/artist/common-eider-king-eider"},{"id":3817,"name":"KIT","permalink":"kit","url":"/artist/kit"},{"id":233091,"name":"Punk","permalink":"punk","url":"/artist/punk"},{"id":5312,"name":"Sir David Scott Stone","permalink":"sir-david-scott-stone","url":"/artist/sir-david-scott-stone"},{"id":9823,"name":"XBXRX","permalink":"xbxrx","url":"/artist/xbxrx"}],"categories":[{"id":126083,"name":"ALL 12\" VINYL","permalink":"all-12-vinyl","url":"/category/all-12-vinyl"},{"id":212206,"name":"IMPORTS","permalink":"imports","url":"/category/imports"}]},{"id":7959675,"name":"Eddy Detroit Meets Sun City Girls 7\"","permalink":"eddy-detroit-meets-sun-city-girls-7","position":78,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/eddy-detroit-meets-sun-city-girls-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-12T22:05:04.000Z","description":"AMMIT \r\nsecond pressing\r\n\r\nThis release features three tracks recorded in various locations in the Phoenix area in the mid 1980s.

Although their time with us was short, the Bowles' creative bloom was towering and unforgettable. The Bowles EP presents a six track overview of the group's modus operandi, recorded live to dictophone in Sydney. Murky cassette montages, strung out 3am ballads and exquisite corpse-style constructs unify and define an original voice that few have heard, until now.

– HS003\r\n\r\n\"Happiness, Gerard Patawaran's one man band, stages its self-titled LP as a marriage proposal to his girlfriend, with the ensuing songs passing through quite a few relationship-stages, most of which many of us have been through. The hesitancy of a crush to the passion of (what must be) true love; the pleasure of fucking in every room of the house to the Joy Division refrain of \"love will tear us apart again.\" \r\nThere are no song titles on the jacket or the insert, so what we'll refer to as the \"first song\" sounds like a cross between The Psychedelic Furs and an elecrified Mountain Goats. The second song has a definite Magnetic Fields flavor and not just because of the \"love\" theme. With simple instrumentation, Gerard's melodic crooning creates an atmosphere that is larger than the simple drumbeat and jangly guitar. Sometimes there's little fuck-ups that endear the listener rather than seeming like fuck-ups, reminding us that no one is perfect and that even true love has the occasional hiccup. The whole album clocks in at around 22 minutes or so, weaving its way through the Psychedelic-Magnetic-Goats themes effectively.\" - Aquarius Records\r\n\r\n\r\nall songs written and recorded by Gerard Patawaran for the lovely Ms Gabrielle Piazza between the years 2003-2004 in Los Angeles, Sacramento, and Oakland California\r\n","options":[{"id":26807163,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/83920677/-/happiness-lp002_640.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/83920677/-/happiness-lp002_640.jpg","width":640,"height":640}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":126083,"name":"ALL 12\" VINYL","permalink":"all-12-vinyl","url":"/category/all-12-vinyl"}]},{"id":7552501,"name":"Black Pus 7\"","permalink":"black-pus-7","position":94,"price":9.0,"default_price":9.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/black-pus-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-15T10:59:09.000Z","description":"Black Pus\r\nCorleone Records – CORWO 831.5, Skulltones – SKT-009\r\nVinyl, 7\", 33 ⅓ RPM\r\n\r\nA\t\t Down Down Da Drain\t\t\r\nB\t\t Bark Of The Tree","options":[{"id":23861707,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":23.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.5,"amount_with_others":13.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74131393/-/R-1784320-1243110422.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74131393/-/R-1784320-1243110422.jpeg","width":400,"height":398},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96072052/-/Black_Pus1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96072052/-/Black_Pus1.jpg","width":1000,"height":580}],"artists":[{"id":5119,"name":"Black Pus","permalink":"black-pus","url":"/artist/black-pus"}],"categories":[{"id":125928,"name":"ALL 7\" VINYL","permalink":"all-7-vinyl","url":"/category/all-7-vinyl"},{"id":334291,"name":"SILKSCREENED","permalink":"silkscreened","url":"/category/silkscreened"}]},{"id":8280006,"name":"Bad Brains -

An unstoppable force of fully erect alpha males, these super studs from the badlands are hell-bent on world domination in a vigilant frenzy of unmitigated lust.

This fine record contains 11 thrash ridden new-wave anthems for and about all the mad degenerates of the world. NIGEL plays their own brand of SCI-FI SEX ROCK unlike most bands you've ingested before, complete with sexy artwork, sexy dudes and sexy riffage. Recorded by an angry young man in Petaluma and then fined tuned by Dr. Dan Rathbun of Polymorf Studios, you can expect the sound to be THUNDEROUS and IN THE RED.

The rest is a loose hodgepodge of glam rock, low-budget black metal, tacky lounge-band funk, stage banter excerpts, tape montages, and even a brief hip-hop instrumental. It's all a big mess, and that's part of the album's charm. It actually works better this way than if it were all tightly constructed and executed à la Naked City -- that approach to genre-jumping has been applied before (by 7000 Dying Rats themselves, even) and it's doubtful anyone is going to improve on what has already been done in that vein. That's not to say there couldn't have been some better editing here, since there is some filler (e.g., \"I Blow Shits,\" which blends together the least redeeming aspects of A.C. and free improv while also managing to be the second longest track on the album). Not an appealing combo. But on the whole, the band does a good job of balancing their obnoxious side with a self-deprecating sense of humor. Plus, the grindcore/metal sections are in fact well-done (A.C. is again a reference point) and a couple of the few actual songs -- \"Strippers on Ecstasy\" and \"Paper Thin Lizzy\" -- are catchy (and stupidly funny) enough to almost justify the price of admission on their own. In any case, 7000 Dying Rats are doing their own thing here, and this is a fun album provided the listener has a sense of humor and a short attention span.","options":[{"id":24684492,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76822524/-/MI0001905258.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76822524/-/MI0001905258.jpeg","width":500,"height":489}],"artists":[{"id":232953,"name":"Metal","permalink":"metal","url":"/artist/metal"},{"id":4042,"name":"Weasel Walter","permalink":"weasel-walter","url":"/artist/weasel-walter"}],"categories":[{"id":125895,"name":"CDS","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":7819626,"name":"Core Of The Coalman - Snow Lights CDR","permalink":"core-of-the-coalman-snow-lights-cdr","position":108,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/core-of-the-coalman-snow-lights-cdr","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-04T03:09:09.000Z","description":"Core Of The Coalman ‎– Snow Lights\r\nCDr \r\nself-released 2005\r\n\r\n1\t\t What The Bear Told Barbara Barfarm\t\t\r\n2\t\t Porn End/Warm Carl\t\t\r\n3\t\t It Takes The Capes\t\t\r\n4\t\t Closed Circuit Fist Bloc\t\t\r\n5\t\t Balzac,ef\t\t\r\n6\t\t Mysterious Sources Of Light\t\t\r\n7\t\t Inedible End\t\t\r\n8\t\t Ddfg Rawing\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:album:0lcfzjA0kioj2zYMBvADVh\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":24677274,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":23.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.5,"amount_with_others":13.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76796712/-/R-623404-1140038011.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76796712/-/R-623404-1140038011.jpeg","width":337,"height":335}],"artists":[{"id":4075,"name":"Core of the Coalman","permalink":"core-of-the-coalman","url":"/artist/core-of-the-coalman"}],"categories":[{"id":125895,"name":"CDS","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":7818972,"name":"Obsidian Pond - Deep Ghosts 3\"CDR","permalink":"obsidian-pond-deep-ghosts-3-cdr","position":109,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/obsidian-pond-deep-ghosts-3-cdr","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-04T02:05:23.000Z","description":"DBA105 Obsidian Pond Deep Ghosts mini-cdr\r\n\r\n3\" Mini-CDr Obsidian Pond is a magical loop based uk project that wowed us with their topical hypnosis music video for \"Sundog Sinners\", but Deep Ghosts takes a more metal turn, still in the dreaming genre.","options":[{"id":24674505,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76790052/-/dba105.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76790052/-/dba105.jpeg","width":288,"height":288}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":125895,"name":"CDS","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":7818945,"name":"tik///tik - Dormant Like Breath CDR","permalink":"tik-tik-dormant-like-breath-cdr","position":110,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tik-tik-dormant-like-breath-cdr","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-04T02:03:25.000Z","description":"Deathbombarc\r\nCDR\r\n\r\nDBA old favorite tik///tik returns with a release perfect for winter.

In 1996 they started releasing stuff outside their country. At the moment the band has more than 50 releases in Europe, USA and Japan. During the years the band's activities included: concerts for plants, tributes to dry ice, psychic energy refractions with toothbrushes, noise performances in public squares, etc. the band also has manufacturated self-designed electric guitars and other electric instruments.","options":[{"id":24661779,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76752624/-/R-809736-1237156761.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76752624/-/R-809736-1237156761.jpeg","width":200,"height":198}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":125895,"name":"CDS","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":7633167,"name":"Social Junk - Summer Concussion CDR","permalink":"social-junk-summer-concussion-cdr","position":115,"price":8.5,"default_price":8.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/social-junk-summer-concussion-cdr","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-22T20:24:41.000Z","description":"Social Junk ‎– Summer Concussion\r\nCarbon Records – CR179\r\nCDr \r\n\r\nRecorded during the US summer tour with Big Nurse 2008.\r\n\r\n1\t\t Cleveland - Embassy Rooftop\t4:55\t\r\n2\t\t Columbus - Skylab\t1:57\t\r\n3\t\t Jersey City - Mulligan's House\t3:23\t\r\n4\t\t Baltimore - The Bank\t8:32\t\r\n5\t\t Richmond - Pom Hole\t12:51\t\r\n6\t\t Hot Springs - The Exchange\t2:28\t\r\n7\t\t Rochester - Bug Jar\t2:56\t\r\n8\t\t Pittsburg - Garfield Artworks\t5:44\t\r\n9\t\t Columbus - Skylab\t7:04\t\r\n10\t\t Minneapolis - Future Pasture\t5:03","options":[{"id":24097113,"name":"Default","price":8.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74932794/-/CR179.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74932794/-/CR179.jpeg","width":300,"height":301}],"artists":[{"id":20031,"name":"Social Junk","permalink":"social-junk","url":"/artist/social-junk"}],"categories":[{"id":125895,"name":"CDS","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":7814307,"name":"Foot Village - Fuck The Future 2 CD","permalink":"foot-village-fuck-the-future-2-cd","position":116,"price":9.0,"default_price":9.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/foot-village-fuck-the-future-2-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-03T19:00:48.000Z","description":"Foot Village\r\nFuck The Future 2\r\nGilgongo CD\r\n\r\nFour humans (you know them from Gang Wizard, Friends Forever, Rose for Bodhan and A++, and as members of 2008’s Boredoms 88 drummers performance) emerge from the apocalypse, exploring the primitive wasteland and creative a new nation of their own, using only drums and their voices.

At the end of the song, drums come rumbling in, and it all kind of fades out.\r\n\r\nI think what happened next was Wilcox came down off the mountain and hit somebody in the head with a giant human bone he'd made a weapon out of. Then he ate that person's heart to gain the strength within. The problem is, he feels guilty for having done it. So he has these night fevers that won't go away, and they come out in these creepy, shamanic poems he screeches all over this record. The moral is that survival is ugly. I'm projecting a little bit, maybe, but there is no doubt this music was made from some kind of inner battle, and the shit is heavy and weird. That's good.\r\n\r\nTemple of Bon Matin has been around for years now and has released music and toured extensively in total obscurity, at least partially for the reasons just described. The brainchild of Wilcox, the group is made up of a revolving door of varyingly able musicians, with the drummer assembling people for whatever he happens to be interested in playing at the time.\r\n\r\nWhen I first encountered Temple, Wilcox was fusing his spirit-drum free rock to elements of jazz. Specifically it was a show at the long-dead Cocodrie, and Wilcox was on all fours whispering into these tiny hand cymbals arranged in a row on the floor of the stage. Over the years, the music has evolved into an earthier, more tribal thing, with increasing amounts of New Agey-ness creeping in, making for a sort of spiritual catharsis rock. Infidel goes even deeper into the jungle than the prayerful \"Shining Path\" and the \"Mule Skinner\" chant that opened Temple's 2003 release, Cabin in the Sky (Bulb).\r\n\r\nThe album has the usual TOBM confluence of 10 zillion types of music melded into a single, hurtling freak-out that, almost inexplicably, is as linked to straight rock forms as it is to free experimentation. Wilcox has always hidden this rock underpinning beneath mountains of no-fi recording techniques, diverting noise, and barely decipherable chanting, but never has he come this close to releasing such a traditional collection of \"songs,\" with the vocals so upfront and intelligible. Still, because Wilcox's musical identity operates on some primal level, the stuff comes out as totally beyond fucked, and from any other band, it would not sound even close to conventional. There are other folks flirting with this sort of \"New Age energy rock,\" but Wilcox takes it way beyond the parameters of what's been done before.\"\r\n-Mike McGuirk, San Francisco Bay Guardian","options":[{"id":23958653,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74460257/-/infidelcvr.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74460257/-/infidelcvr.jpeg","width":958,"height":958}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":125895,"name":"CDS","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":1866795,"name":"SALE","permalink":"sale","url":"/category/sale"}]},{"id":7585763,"name":"Chris Leo - Feathers Like Leather","permalink":"chris-leo-feathers-like-leather","position":154,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/chris-leo-feathers-like-leather","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-18T07:00:41.000Z","description":"Feathers like Leather \r\n\r\nHeartworm #27\r\n\r\nby Chris Leo\r\n\r\nLeo's fourth book, Feathers Like Leather, is a collection of short stories, poems and etymologies, each a raw and urgent account of his life abroad--even in his own hometown.

From his novels White Pigeons and 57 Octaves, which come with accompanying music and drawings, to his polylingual children's book Coomoococklemungmung, illustrated by Buenos Aires-based artist Francesca Massai, to albums with his word-burdened bands The Van Pelt, The Lapse and Vague Angels, the delivery is always the same: cat's paw on a very big mouse.

Everyone gets kissed.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:album:0xcikhIepbrPFcsxPr2Y09\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":23625553,"name":"Default","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":23.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.5,"amount_with_others":13.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73356573/-/Magic_Smaile_CD.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73356573/-/Magic_Smaile_CD.jpeg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/97073611/-/Neil-Campbell-Astral-Social-Club.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/97073611/-/Neil-Campbell-Astral-Social-Club.jpg","width":356,"height":482}],"artists":[{"id":110441,"name":"Neil Campbell / Astral Social Club","permalink":"neil-campbell-astral-social-club","url":"/artist/neil-campbell-astral-social-club"}],"categories":[{"id":125895,"name":"CDS","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":212206,"name":"IMPORTS","permalink":"imports","url":"/category/imports"}]},{"id":7469623,"name":"Channels 3 & 4 - Christianity LP","permalink":"channels-3-4-christianity-lp","position":178,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/channels-3-4-christianity-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-06T23:21:02.000Z","description":"Gilgongo Records\r\n\r\nA1\t\t A Pied\t\t\r\nA2\t\t Blackbird\t\t\r\nA3\t\t Input Select\t\t\r\nA4\t\t Meeting\t\t\r\nA5\t\t Boys\t\t\r\nA6\t\t Pills\t\t\r\nB1\t\t Dark Highway Freedom\t\t\r\nB2\t\t The Queen\t\t\r\nB3\t\t Crosses\t\t\r\nB4\t\t Plastic\t\t\r\nB5\t\t Jesus/Free\t\t\r\nB6\t\t No Eyelids\t\t\r\n \t Locked Groove\r\nB7\t\t Untitled\t\t\r\nB8\t\t Untitled1","options":[{"id":23607397,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":23.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.5,"amount_with_others":13.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73296805/-/R-2433693-1283803508.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73296805/-/R-2433693-1283803508.jpeg","width":399,"height":402}],"artists":[{"id":3844,"name":"Channels 3x4","permalink":"channels-3x4","url":"/artist/channels-3x4"},{"id":4068,"name":"Shearing Pinx","permalink":"shearing-pinx","url":"/artist/shearing-pinx"}],"categories":[{"id":126083,"name":"ALL 12\" VINYL","permalink":"all-12-vinyl","url":"/category/all-12-vinyl"}]},{"id":7469551,"name":"Soiled Mattress And The Springs ‎– Springtime!

The guitar playing is massively inventive, picking out hypnotic tone-implosions with the most tactile use of illuminating electricity before dropping down into endless slipstreams of choral constructs and vocal/harmonica jams that would marry Dylan ‘66 with Kaoru Abe and Alan ‘Blind Owl’ Wilson. It sounds nothing like what any else is doing right now. Comes in a glorious private press-style sleeve with a sun-struck cover and some hermetic line-drawings on the back.

The same program runs on both sides, and you’ll probably need to listen to both in one-sitting just to catch-up with what you’ve just heard. Seibutsu Shigen strips bare this expeditious punk template to its most cathartic core; this is no muss, no fuss, and no bullshit.

Anybody familiar with Niblock would probably characterize his work by the sound of his long, sonorous drones, producing rich overtones usually combined with a visual element -- since before moving into composition, Niblock was an active photographer and filmmaker. While he usually is known for his films from the Movement Of People Working series alongside performances of his music, Niblock's early works stand apart as unique objects. The integrity and consistency of his style is fully on display in these seldomly-seen or screened 16mm sound films wonders that include: \r\nMorning (1966-1969) from an idea by Phill Niblock and Jean Claude Van Itallie, filmed by PN, text by Lee Worley and Michael Corner, with members of the Open Theater group. Starring Lee Worley, James Barbosa, Cynthis Harris, Sharon Gans, Joseph Chaikin; text read by Lee Worley, James Barbosa, Barbara Porte, Dorothy Lyman, Michael Corner. Black & white 16mm film. \r\nThe Magic Sun (1966-1968) with members of the Sun Ra Arkestra, music by Sun Ra and the Arkestra. Filmed on high-contrast black & white 16mm film. Dog Track (1969) -- a film by Phill Niblock, with a found text read by Barbara Porte. Color 16mm film. \r\nAnnie (1968) -- a portrait of the dancer Ann Danoff, with a sound collage soundtrack. Color 16mm film. Max (1966-19) -- an image collage film/portrait of percussionist/sound-artist Max Neuhaus, with a collage soundtrack by Max Neuhaus. Black & white 16mm film. \r\nRaoul (1968-1969) -- a portrait of the painter Raoul Middleman, with extensive use of time-lapse film technique. The soundtrack is improvised by Raoul Middleman and Phill Niblock. Color 16mm film. \r\n\r\nLimited edition of 500 copies. NTSC, all-region DVD, stereo, 4:3 format.

The Rhythm\r\nUTR038 LP\r\n10 tracks, 30 mins\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:album:7vzaO2VZL06sJGdNhk7ZRw\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n'INVOCATION' is KIT's second full-length and sees them producing a decidedly more reflective and considered album. Rooted in the occult and metaphysics, it's drenched in West Coast sunshine noir - a contradiction of excessive over-the-top speed-demon pop and ominous leviathans lurking right below the surface.\r\n\r\nRecorded at the Department of Safety in Anacortes, Washington aka \"Nowhere\" - before this legendary all-ages art space shut down - the band removed all of its familiar comfort zones for the sessions of 'INVOCATION'. The northern latitude meant longer days to work in and a refurbished fire station to play with, the sound of its concrete halls folding into Phil Elverum's (Microphones, Mount Eerie) unorthodox recording.\r\n\r\nThe isolation pulled the band out of its typical California home recording element. Going all analogue tape for recording, forced the group to re-think its process in terms of real time and maximising each track's potential. Elverum's unique recording merged well with the band's past DIY self-produced recording ethic. Guest appearances of violinist Nora Danielson (The Intima, Mirah) and bassist Themba Lewis (The Intima, Tara Jane O'Neil) add a contour to the recording that makes its presence most strongly felt on \"Dreams Are Burned\" - another version appears on the 7\" EP with Mike Watt.\r\n\r\n'INVOCATION' is an album about fixation, destiny and total, complete honesty. The album overspills with melodies and ideas that turn inside out over and over again - an album of happy accidents and exhilarating leaps of faith. It marks an area of lyrical maturity for the band. Singer / lyricist, Kristy, says it's about \"how the people you love (doesn’t have to be romantic) are revolving around you like planets and you are their sun. Their life revolves around you and that can take a lot of getting used to\". Other sources of inspiration include Kenneth Anger's 'Invocation Of My Demon Brother'.\r\n\r\n\"Merticane\" kicks off the album, with jarring guitars and drums preparing a near explosive drama for Kristy's tale of awkward dawning love to unfold. \"Ambrosia\" is the most prototypical light-footed KIT song, tackling their punk pop unrest in a new way - pushing through convention and adding their own uplifting uneasiness to proceedings.\r\n\r\n\"Cure Light Wounds\" springs and recoils as it unwinds into a chorus of insistent demands - \"Won't you mend my broken heart?\" pleads Kristy increasingly frenzied. \"Out Of Ruins\" resolves out of restraint, its heavy tread of twisting feedback and lurching chaos plunges into an ice cold pool of introspection that the band try to escape to no avail.\r\n\r\n\"Broke Heart\" closes the album with a delightful twist, the initial burst of liveliness crumbling into a reverberating three-minute coda of ascendent bass and guitar drone with building percussion that becomes progressively more epic and resplendent at the same time, Boredoms-style.\r\n\r\nWith 'INVOCATION', KIT have created a record that enjoys defying expectations. KIT successfully capture everything between excitement and heartbreak - a sense of wonderment at the interactions contained in the world around us all without calling on higher powers or casting any spells.","options":[{"id":23243331,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":23.0,"amount_with_others":38.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":22.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72078053/-/kit_artwork.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72078053/-/kit_artwork.jpg","width":400,"height":396},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72160333/-/KIT_CREDITSteveAndrewGarcia.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72160333/-/KIT_CREDITSteveAndrewGarcia.JPG","width":452,"height":301}],"artists":[{"id":3813,"name":"George Chen","permalink":"george-chen","url":"/artist/george-chen"},{"id":9008,"name":"Chen Santa Maria","permalink":"chen-santa-maria","url":"/artist/chen-santa-maria"},{"id":4504,"name":"Common Eider King Eider","permalink":"common-eider-king-eider","url":"/artist/common-eider-king-eider"},{"id":3808,"name":"Intima","permalink":"intima","url":"/artist/intima"},{"id":3817,"name":"KIT","permalink":"kit","url":"/artist/kit"},{"id":9823,"name":"XBXRX","permalink":"xbxrx","url":"/artist/xbxrx"}],"categories":[{"id":126083,"name":"ALL 12\" VINYL","permalink":"all-12-vinyl","url":"/category/all-12-vinyl"},{"id":212206,"name":"IMPORTS","permalink":"imports","url":"/category/imports"}]},{"id":7344665,"name":"Richard Youngs - Advent LP","permalink":"richard-youngs-advent-lp","position":204,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/richard-youngs-advent-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-25T02:42:02.000Z","description":"Richard Youngs\r\nAdvent\r\nJagjaguwar LP\r\n\r\nreissue\r\n\r\nElectric Guitar, Piano, Oboe, Vocals, Recorded By, Written-By Richard Youngs\r\n\r\nElectric guitars recorded on 14/12/1988 in Harpenden. \r\nPiano recorded on 15/12/1988 in London. \r\nOboes and vocals recorded on 16/12/1988 in Harpenden. \r\nThis mix made on 24/12/1988 in Harpenden. \r\nMost sounds by Richard Youngs.

A member of Glass Plates (with Jeffrey Allport and Robert Pederson) as well as a collaborator with violinist Angharad Davies, Narayan here presents eight brief improvisations on an instrument you don’t come across to frequently in this neck of the woods, the autoharp.\r\nThe pieces are entirely acoustic although each is approached using extended techniques of one sort or another. There’s more bowing and scraping than there is plucking and Narayan seems to enjoy particularly serrated sounds, the sort of result you might derive from drawing a nail rasp across the strings. Occasionally, echoes of its more traditional resonances can be heard, hanging ghostlike in the air for a couple of seconds but they’re quickly dispersed by the more earthly tones rising from worried metal and wood. Sometimes, the technique employed gets in the way of the piece as such, obscuring sounds themselves, attracting too much attention; other times, it passes unnoticed. It’s these latter moments, as heard on the first track (all untitled), that are the most successful, where the music just floats out there, a bit mysteriously. We’re not in Laraaji territory by any means, more akin to that inhabited by Ms. Davies’ brother, albeit without an e-bow. Another musician I found myself thinking of was Alfredo Costa Monteiro, who demonstrates a similar brand of visceral, physical attachment to his instrument. For myself, about half the time I thought the miniatures worked, about half I felt there was something lacking although I will say that the more I listened, the more I tended to fall under their spell. That missing something may simply be a collaborator and I’d be very interested to hear Narayan working in tandem with one or more fellow musicians; I get the feeling he’d be a fine listener.\r\nAs is, “Eight Vignettes for Solo Autoharp” is more in the nature of a sampler laying out propositions from Narayan, observations on the nature of his autoharp, on its own inherent phonetics. It’s an intriguing set by a musician from whom I’ll be curious to hear more.\r\n<i>-Brian Olewnick (Bagatellen)</i>","options":[{"id":23239281,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72063229/-/R-3728181-1341992272-1909.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72063229/-/R-3728181-1341992272-1909.jpeg","width":440,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96129640/-/chandan.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96129640/-/chandan.jpg","width":400,"height":299}],"artists":[{"id":182020,"name":"Chandan Narayan","permalink":"chandan-narayan","url":"/artist/chandan-narayan"}],"categories":[{"id":125895,"name":"CDS","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":212206,"name":"IMPORTS","permalink":"imports","url":"/category/imports"}]},{"id":7344177,"name":"Excepter 12\"","permalink":"excepter-12","position":208,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/excepter-12","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-25T01:55:46.000Z","description":"EXCEPTER\r\nVacation / Forget Me\r\nFusetron – FUSE 033, Excepter Records – ER02\r\n\r\nVinyl, 12\", Amber, Translucent ","options":[{"id":23239051,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72062733/-/R-302908-1090996375.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72062733/-/R-302908-1090996375.jpeg","width":250,"height":250}],"artists":[{"id":5216,"name":"Excepter","permalink":"excepter","url":"/artist/excepter"}],"categories":[{"id":126083,"name":"ALL 12\" VINYL","permalink":"all-12-vinyl","url":"/category/all-12-vinyl"},{"id":1866795,"name":"SALE","permalink":"sale","url":"/category/sale"}]},{"id":7344037,"name":"The Flying Luttenbachers -

Disheartened but eager to experiment and create, a new wave of French musicians followed the beacon of Jacno's seminal '79 hit \"Rectangle,\" a visionary, digital coup de grâce, courtesy of a former punk which dealt the Rickenbacker and Fender-era a fatal blow.

You can hear Caribbean influences here, the promise of highlife there, but Living Is Hard mostly disavows fusion and assimilation. And by contrast with antecedents in the history of black music in Britain -- minstrelsy and spirituals, for example, ragtime and jazz -- these recordings are unhitched from the protocols of a white listenership. These are startling, trenchant, elemental roots -- carrying troubled news home, along with signs of the new African nationalism -- and an enthralling glimpse of other lives, other times.

Same 14 tracks as the CD.\r\nThe mission of Analog Africa is clear: searching in dusty warehouses for forgotten music to keep it alive. All tracks have been officially licensed, usually from the artists who label-head Samy Ben Redjeb also met with for detailed research. He conducted 16 interviews in various cities in Benin and Togo with artists, producers and sound engineers to reconstruct the history of the '70s music scene for the booklet which also includes many rare photographs directly received from the artists. Like most modern music in French-speaking West African countries, the music of Benin and Togo was influenced by a few main musical currents: Cuban, Congolese and local traditional music, as well as Chanson Française. Additionally, the geographical location of Benin and Togo -- sandwiched between Ghana and Nigeria -- exposed Beninese and Togolese musicians to highlife music. The cultural and spiritual riches of traditional Beninese music had an immense impact on the sound of Benin's modern music. Benin is the birth place of Vodun (or, as it is known in the West, Voodoo), and some of the rhythms used during traditional rituals -- sakpata, sato, agbadja, tchenkoumé and many others -- were fused to soul and Latin music as early as the mid-'60s and later to funk. That fusion is the essence of this compilation. In the late '60s and early '70s, rock and soul music started creeping into the region. In particular, the music of James Brown and Johnny Halladay became immensely popular with university students. It was then that the music scene in Benin really started to take off. What made this musical revolution even more interesting is that most of the musicians could not read music. Often the music they made sounded one semi-tone away from being out of tune, but somehow they always managed to bring all the elements together into something new and exciting. One of the greatest bands of their era, Orchestre Poly-Rythmo de Cotonou, who are featured on this compilation, took the Afro sound to another level by showing their musical versatility in many forms. Although they were consciously copying Western artists, they would always inject a dose of psychedelic Afro grooves that would make their music unmistakably Beninese. Their biggest song, \"Gbeti Madjro\" is believed to have revolutionized the music industry in Benin in the '70s when the country went through a period of political turmoil. The song is full of raw breaks and hypnotic rhythms, as well as screams à la James Brown. After this song, many bands in Benin started screaming on their recordings, hence the title of this compilation. Latin-influenced sounds are present on this compilation, too. Ouidah, a city on the Atlantic coast of Benin, is home to a large Brazilian community, or, as they are called in Benin, \"Agoudas.\" Members of that community are descendents of slaves who returned from Brazil at the end of the 19th century. Their dances and songs are still being performed and fused into the traditional Beninese rituals. That, too, can be heard in modern Beninese music. The proximity of the giant neighbor Nigeria can be heard on the track \"Djanfa Magni\" which features the amazing trumpeter/ saxophonist Tidjani Koné fronting the Orchestre Poly-Rythmo. Koné, whose career started in Mali as the founder and band leader of the Rail Band de Bamako, had played with Fela Kuti for a short while, hence the strong Afrobeat influence. There are countless stories to be discovered in the extremely well-researched booklet and the music is truly mind-blowing. So delve into the forgotten raw and psychedelic Afro sounds from '70s Benin and Togo and experience the African Scream Contest.","options":[{"id":23202855,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":23.0,"amount_with_others":38.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":22.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71942373/-/zzafricanscreamcontes_101b.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71942373/-/zzafricanscreamcontes_101b.jpg","width":366,"height":335}],"artists":[{"id":3799,"name":"Compilation","permalink":"compilation","url":"/artist/compilation"}],"categories":[{"id":126083,"name":"ALL 12\" VINYL","permalink":"all-12-vinyl","url":"/category/all-12-vinyl"},{"id":212206,"name":"IMPORTS","permalink":"imports","url":"/category/imports"}]},{"id":7331757,"name":"Staring Into The Sun: Ethiopian Tribal Music 2LP","permalink":"various-staring-into-the-sun-ethiopian-tribal-music-2lp","position":219,"price":28.5,"default_price":28.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/various-staring-into-the-sun-ethiopian-tribal-music-2lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-23T22:36:36.000Z","description":"Sublime Frequencies\r\n\r\nA contemporary survey of the tribal music of Ethiopia.

Other selections include music from the Mursi, Druze, Gedeo, Konso, and Tsemay tribes as well as some fine examples of amplified roots music from the capital from the Habesha 2000 Band.

Using purely analog synths and tape manipulation, they build a foggy psychoacoustic mass that lies between dynamic yet patiently treated tape-music and industrial howl. Aaron Dilloway has been releasing and recording music since the age of 16. He was a member of experimental bands Couch, Galen and Universal Indians. He is a former guitarist and tape manipulator for the experimental band Wolf Eyes, which he left in 2005 to live most of that year in Kathmandu, Nepal. While his wife did her graduate work there, he roamed the streets recording every sound he could, many of which are used in his recent recordings and performances. Currently he runs the noise record label, record store and mailorder Hanson Records, which he began in Brighton, Michigan in 1994. Hanson then moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan for several years, before finally settling in Oberlin, Ohio, after a brief return to Ann Arbor. He performs solo using eight track tapes and vocal sounds, and records modular synthesizer music as Spine Scavenger. Recently, he has played with an ever-changing cast of sound artists under the name The Nevari Butchers. Jason Lescalleet's sound world occupies a space between noise, contemporary composition, and minimal electronics. Using decidedly primitive tactics and equipment (e.g. antiquated reel-to-reel recorders, damaged tape, etc.), his work focuses on extreme frequencies and microscopic audio detail. He's been a member of Due Process, performed and recorded with Keith Rowe, Joe Colley, Jason Kahn, John Hudak, Bhob Rainey and Greg Kelley (both separately and as Nmperign), and most recently Graham Lambkin in their Breadwinner project which has yielded unprecedented and glorious results in the electroacoustic music of today. He lives and works in the state of Maine. The LP is mastered and cut by Rashad Becker at Dubplates & Mastering, pressed on 140 gram vinyl and it is packaged in a pro-press color jacket which itself is housed in a silkscreened PVC sleeve with artwork by Kathryn Politis & Bill Kouligas.\r\n\r\nAaron Dilloway (synth and tapes); Jason Lescalleet (synth, tapes, and Dell XPS).\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:album:2oVEtlAUYddTBqHPwyfluQ\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":23201891,"name":"Default","price":25.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":23.0,"amount_with_others":38.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":22.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71939829/-/pan_30_web_a.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71939829/-/pan_30_web_a.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71939837/-/pan_30_web_b.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71939837/-/pan_30_web_b.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":141873,"name":"PAN (UK)","permalink":"pan-uk","url":"/artist/pan-uk"},{"id":4913,"name":"Wolf Eyes","permalink":"wolf-eyes","url":"/artist/wolf-eyes"}],"categories":[{"id":126083,"name":"ALL 12\" VINYL","permalink":"all-12-vinyl","url":"/category/all-12-vinyl"},{"id":212206,"name":"IMPORTS","permalink":"imports","url":"/category/imports"},{"id":334291,"name":"SILKSCREENED","permalink":"silkscreened","url":"/category/silkscreened"}]},{"id":7331565,"name":"Svarte Greiner - Penpals Forever (And Ever) LP","permalink":"svarte-greiner-penpals-forever-and-ever-lp","position":221,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/svarte-greiner-penpals-forever-and-ever-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-23T22:16:18.000Z","description":"Svarte Greiner\r\nPenpals Forever (And Ever)\r\nDigitalis LP \r\n\r\nThe first side (first two tracks) were originally issued on the Penpals Forever cassette on Digitalis in 2008, limited to 180 copies. Both tracks have been completely remastered. The remaining pieces are all new and exclusive to this release. Svarte Greiner is the nom de plume of Deaf Center's Erik K. Skodvin. Hailing from Norway, his solo efforts are always stripped bare, white-knuckle sojourns through dark, haunted ambient sonic corridors. Penpals Forever (And Ever) is the imaginary tale of a long dead Baroque painter and his telekinetic correspondence with a flightless bird. It feels archaic; experimental death marches circa 1622. Like Guercino's Et in Arcadia ego, once the end is realized, there's nowhere left to go. It's beyond our experience and sometimes you never recover from the shock. Despite its rather cheery title, Penpals Forever (And Ever) is another step toward the abyss. Musically sparse, Svarte Greiner finds new channels connecting desolate landscapes through ethereal nightmares. It is music best served cold. Chattering, looping guitar lines that feel like muscle being separated from bone slowly build into aching piles of aural dissonance. It's painful to a point. Recorded voices speak a language you can't understand underneath ominous, echoing single notes. Distant metal fragments scrape the dirt from detuned strings while a nefarious feathered minstrel bows dying instruments in the background. No hope left, death is just around the corner. As it ever was, Svarte Greiner is again weaving something deliciously sinister. This is music that is uncomfortably bare. Within its blood-stained confines, there is nowhere to hide. Skodvin's tangled, gnarled tale goes back and forth into infinity until it becomes clear that the flightless bird in question lives inside your skull. Drowning slowly into one's own twisted mind, Penpals is the soundtrack of loss; the procession of fears gradually becoming so overbearing that you can't escape your own demons.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:album:3uUS4LwRGByDTpTGlXco0e\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":23201611,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71938617/-/penpals-for-everand-ever.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71938617/-/penpals-for-everand-ever.jpg","width":460,"height":460},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/97074475/-/svartegreiner022311.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/97074475/-/svartegreiner022311.jpg","width":530,"height":355}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":126083,"name":"ALL 12\" VINYL","permalink":"all-12-vinyl","url":"/category/all-12-vinyl"}]},{"id":7331489,"name":"Chris Brokaw ‎– VDSQ Solo Acoustic Volume Three LP","permalink":"chris-brokaw-vdsq-solo-acoustic-volume-three-lp","position":222,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/chris-brokaw-vdsq-solo-acoustic-volume-three-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-23T22:08:42.000Z","description":"Vin Du Select Qualitite – VDSQ003\r\n\r\nChris Brokaw began recording and performing with Codeine (on drums & guitar) in 1990.

Harry Partch often worked with this type of harmony, so Tashi and Marc Sabat used one of his adapted violas for the recording.","options":[{"id":23201335,"name":"Default","price":7.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71937549/-/276451.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71937549/-/276451.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71937525/-/Tashi_Wada_Untitled.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71937525/-/Tashi_Wada_Untitled.png","width":500,"height":499}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":125928,"name":"ALL 7\" VINYL","permalink":"all-7-vinyl","url":"/category/all-7-vinyl"}]},{"id":7331281,"name":"Charlemagne Palestine and Simone Forti - Illuminations LP","permalink":"charlemagne-palestine-and-simone-forti-illuminations-lp","position":225,"price":28.0,"default_price":28.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/charlemagne-palestine-and-simone-forti-illuminations-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-23T21:41:07.000Z","description":"Charlemagne Palestine & Simone Forti\r\nIlluminations\r\n\r\nAlga Marghen proudly presents the first ever release of Illuminatios, or Charlemagne Palestine and Simone Forti duo interactions, illuminated with dim red lights. In early 1970 Mort Subotnick asked Charlemagne Palestine to join his soon to be created Media Department at the new 'Dream School of the Future' endowed by the Disneys to be called the California Institute of the Arts. Charlemagne and Simone Forti met there in 1970, when La Monte Young asked them to arrange a California concert for Pandit Pran Nath. They decided to try an improvisation session together and Charlemagne invited Simone the first time to the electronic music studio where he worked regularly. Their medium blended as a play of interacting sound waves and solid matter in motion as Charlemagne and Simone shared energy and focus. The three previously unreleased recordings on this LP were made between October and December 1971. The first take, titled 'Illumination,' is for two voices moving in the space with small bells and crystal glasses while Simone Forti plays the molimo, a corrugated tube meant for connecting the gas stove. The second take titled, 'Wed Oct 13th 1971,' has Simone and Charlemagne in a song dialogue as animals do. It was also at Cal Arts that Charlemagne Palestine first encountered a Bosendorfer Imperial Piano of Vienna. He played it often as Simone danced during their 'Illuminations'. Take three is a song sang in falsetto while playing the Bosendorfer Imperial in an arpeggiated style that predates the 'strummings'. Listening to these 'three takes' 40 years later, they ooze a timeless, carefree mystical, magical, dreamy atmosphere that evoked the times of the late 60s to early 70s in Charlemagne and Simone part of the California Art Scene. 'Illuminations' were a unique open spontaneous form of performance, ritual and prayer. Edition limited to 365 copies with an essay by both Charlemagne Palestine and Simone Forti, as well as photos of the performances reproduced on the LP front sleeve.","options":[{"id":23200829,"name":"Default","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":23.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.5,"amount_with_others":13.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71935605/-/1592358.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71935605/-/1592358.jpg","width":400,"height":397}],"artists":[{"id":255273,"name":"Charlemagne Palestine","permalink":"charlemagne-palestine","url":"/artist/charlemagne-palestine"}],"categories":[{"id":126083,"name":"ALL 12\" VINYL","permalink":"all-12-vinyl","url":"/category/all-12-vinyl"},{"id":212206,"name":"IMPORTS","permalink":"imports","url":"/category/imports"}]},{"id":7331155,"name":"Kublai Khan 7\"","permalink":"kublai-khan-7","position":226,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kublai-khan-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-23T21:23:37.000Z","description":"Chocolate River (Deconstructions) – cr(d) 002\r\nVinyl, 7\", Single \r\n\r\nA\t\t Alexander The Great\t\t\r\nB1\t\t Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat\t\t\r\nB2\t\t Popular Mechanics\r\nPiano – Sascha\r\n\r\nCatered & Facilitated By Jeremy Goody\r\nPrinted By Truly Evil Press\r\nNarayan, Kilbourne, Sathaye","options":[{"id":23200525,"name":"Default","price":3.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":16.5,"amount_with_others":13.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71934085/-/R-1196111-1199961899.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71934085/-/R-1196111-1199961899.gif","width":450,"height":448},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96131644/-/48779.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96131644/-/48779.jpg","width":400,"height":565}],"artists":[{"id":182020,"name":"Chandan Narayan","permalink":"chandan-narayan","url":"/artist/chandan-narayan"}],"categories":[{"id":125928,"name":"ALL 7\" VINYL","permalink":"all-7-vinyl","url":"/category/all-7-vinyl"},{"id":334291,"name":"SILKSCREENED","permalink":"silkscreened","url":"/category/silkscreened"}]},{"id":7331133,"name":"Shearing Pinx -

Over the past eleven years or so, the Columbus-based musician has investigated a breadth of approaches to sustained sound, from slow-burning microcosmic tones that gradually shift into distinctly unfamiliar forms to more carefully coordinated layers of melodious treatments of guitar, synth, and field recordings that actively extract unorthodox inflections from such familiar sources. Forgotten Somewhere has Shiflet mastering both of these attitudes, the title piece constructing a nebulous, dusky fuzz of subtly gorgeous vibration while “Omicron Meditation” is a textural excursion into crackling, jittering snaps, recalling a piece of warped blank vinyl spinning from damaged speakers.

Their new album, Hespherides, is a welcome development in the duo's trajectory, with its immersive propulsion more refined and synthesized than their 2009 self-titled debut. That earlier effort showcased the possibilities and capacities of the two artists' collaborative spirit, each track exploring the individual aspects of a shared sense of sound with discernible cues from either Campbell's or High Wolf's discography. In contrast, Hespherides is a meticulously sculpted document that embraces a total sound -- one that denies prominence of each contributor by melding the psychic duality of the pair. Shifting industrialized ethno-polyrhythmic structures are transformed by droning, blissed-out textural threads that seamlessly coexist and contradict one another; Through two side-long process-driven mechanical meditations, a shared space is constructed, one that satiates anyone willing to gorge on the global, post-acid house, rainbow hypnotism that is Iibiis Rooge.","options":[{"id":20753639,"name":"Default","price":10.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64124725/-/IibiisRooge-Hespherides.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64124725/-/IibiisRooge-Hespherides.jpg","width":512,"height":512}],"artists":[{"id":110441,"name":"Neil Campbell / Astral Social Club","permalink":"neil-campbell-astral-social-club","url":"/artist/neil-campbell-astral-social-club"}],"categories":[{"id":126083,"name":"ALL 12\" VINYL","permalink":"all-12-vinyl","url":"/category/all-12-vinyl"}]},{"id":6383915,"name":"Vegetable - C.F.

The tombs and artifacts of history’s denials and creativities are the living source for the images produced.\r\nInspired by physicist David Bohm’s writings on creativity and the implicate order in nature the work uses sculpture and sound as well as more abstracted and intuitively derived drawings to explore new formal and conceptual directions. The enfolded, expansive and unresolved nature of the conceptual content is matched formally in the more expressive handling of materials and broadened variety of media.\r\nIn “Sound From A Rock” geological, cultural and ideological artifacts are examined from the spillage of encrusted narratives that describe the creative force of high civilization as solely a construct of the West in opposition to a dark and barbaric East. Following knotted pathways, a traditional American quilt pattern called the “Star of Bethlehem” is traced back through Europe and Islam to the origin of civilization at the base of Ur’s Ziggurat. Here, the astrological matrix within the story of Matthew’s Magi, formally abstracts the planets Jupiter and Saturn and gestures to Zoroastrianism’s impact on the Persian empire and its subsequent influence on Greece, Judaism, Christianity and the historical construction of the Western mind. In a photograph from the archives of the Truman Library the hand of Iranian Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh caresses the crack in the Liberty Bell during a visit to America one year before his CIA backed overthrow. A similar patina to that on the Liberty Bell is seen on the 2500-year-old limestone surface of a griffin sculpture in Lucien Herve’s photograph taken at Persepolis during a French Institute of Archeology expedition in 1962. The image appears again collaged with over-painting in the drawing, ”Dawn Blood Of Gold, Of Yesterdays’ Dawn Gold”. Two 3’ x 3’ cubes of red earth with conical shaped extrusions, physically refer to the surface, weight and density of the copper bell and limestone griffin, and the removal of the cone from the platonic cube becomes an act of reanimating its static nature.\r\n\r\n16 pages / 28 x 37 cm / b/w Offset\r\nEdition of 150 / 2010","options":[{"id":18767625,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/57466975/-/Shaun_ODell_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/57466975/-/Shaun_ODell_cover.jpg","width":322,"height":425},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/57467071/-/Shaun_ODell_spread.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/57467071/-/Shaun_ODell_spread.jpg","width":644,"height":425}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":212206,"name":"IMPORTS","permalink":"imports","url":"/category/imports"},{"id":126113,"name":"MAGAZINES","permalink":"magazines","url":"/category/magazines"}]},{"id":5625863,"name":"Taboo - Power Charisma Influence & Property LP","permalink":"taboo-power-charisma-influence-property-lp","position":243,"price":13.0,"default_price":13.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/taboo-power-charisma-influence-property-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-03-06T06:50:13.000Z","description":"Taboo LP \r\nPOWER CHARISMA INFLUENCE & PROPERTY\r\n\r\n recorded by A.

Parallels (Cosmic Mindslayer Remix) \r\n\r\nBRONZE is an exercise in impulse. BRONZE is also the San Francisco based trio of Brian Hock, Rob Spector, and Miles Friction the latest addition to the RVNG Intl. family with their debut album, Copper. \r\n\r\nIn early 2006, Hock moved back to his native San Francisco from Berlin and took up residence with Spector in the warehouse / show space known as The Cave. The two conspired to start a new live project and enlisted the help of Friction to form BRONZE. \r\n\r\nAfter preliminary attempts to find the right environment to house the Copper Club, the Secret Society of the Bronze Age, Miles founded the Trojan Cavern in San Fran's Dogpatch neighborhood. From this outpost, BRONZE undergo disciplined training exercises in various weaponry, sonic hypnosis, horticulture and all-important copper talk. It's also from the Trojan Compound that Copper was created. \r\n\r\nStream-of-consciousness lyrical cooing and restrained analog trickery rest atop constant cog rotation grooves on Copper. These elements yield a truly conductive album, abundant in compositions that beg for a listener's oxidizing ear. Commencing with \"A Showdown Of Sorts\", the record assumes a vague narrative aided by the allure of Tuxedomoon / Ralph Records-y exoticism, albeit less claustrophobic. \"Showing Them\" staggers into even Wierd-er territory, with eye flashes and spots of Legendary Pink Dots. \"So Slow\" and \"The Rouge Became\" are sister tracks fallen not far from the same Silver Apple(s) tree. \"Wits\" and \"Fumes In Suits\" counter clockwork like a high-pressure Units track and place Copper in the lexicon of San Fran synthesized and syncopated anti-stardom. \r\nEach vinyl copy of Copper comes with a copper ring. The ring is intended to be worn to BRONZE performances or even during daily rituals. While wearing the ring, you, the ring bearer, are encouraged to speak informally - if not offensively - with fellow ring mates. When overheard or confronted, blame it on the ring - i.e. \"It was the copper talking.\" The ring will initially turn your finger green. The ring will also heal your wounds, correct your balance and is a fashionable accessory to boot. \r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:album:1kpV9431grvjKc6btkAZZW\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":15885793,"name":"Default","price":16.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47843965/-/RVNGNL10_COVER_500x500.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47843965/-/RVNGNL10_COVER_500x500.gif","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":149727,"name":"Bronze","permalink":"bronze","url":"/artist/bronze"}],"categories":[{"id":126083,"name":"ALL 12\" VINYL","permalink":"all-12-vinyl","url":"/category/all-12-vinyl"}]},{"id":4827101,"name":"FRKWYS Vol. 8: Blues Control and Laraaji LP","permalink":"frkwys-vol-8-blues-control-and-laraaji-lp","position":251,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/frkwys-vol-8-blues-control-and-laraaji-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:43:26.000Z","description":"<object height=\"18\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F26834581&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=tiny&amp;font=Arial&amp;color=083312\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed wmode=\"transparent\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"18\" src=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F26834581&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=tiny&amp;font=Arial&amp;color=083312\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>   \r\nVolume 8 in the ongoing FRKWYS series on RVNG Intl. is a double album-length collaboration between Blues Control and Laraaji. \r\n\r\nFollowing the \"fodder first\" tradition of previous FRKWYS installments, Vol. 8 was birthed over e-mail dialogue between RVNG and Russ Waterhouse and Lea Cho of Blues Control. Blues Control's evolved output gracefully arcs with influence and innovation that gleams electronic, New Age, and hard rock terrains. Laraaji's name came up early in that conversation and felt intrinsic to Waterhouse and Cho's own musical calling. \r\n\r\nAfter learning various instruments in his formative years and studying composition at Howard University, Laraaji eventually found his musical conduit in an electronically-modified zither. Laraaji's 1979 album Celestial Vibration (recorded as Edward Larry Gordon) places the stringed instrument at the forefront on two side-length excursions in rhythmic ambiance. The 1980 album Ambient 3: Day of Radiance, produced by Brian Eno for his ambient record series, further documented Laraaji's zither explorations alongside Eno's soundscaping. Laraaji continues to pursue music both in its recorded form and as a healing tool. \r\n\r\nBlues Control and Laraaji convened at Black Dirt Studio in upstate New York on December 9th, 2010. Over the course of a single studio day, the three musicians (accompanied on certain jams by Laraaji's \"musical friend\" Arji Cakouros) improvised on several themes, providing nearly four hours of material and the basis for FRKWYS Vol. 8. After meticulous note taking, sharing, and rough edits among Blues Control and Laraaji, the album was fully fleshed out. \r\n\r\nWithout context, it's hard to imagine that these musicians never creatively collaborated before this juncture. The dynamic breadth (and breath) of the album feels both effortless and epic, a line usually straddled only after years of playing together. It's clear a cosmic force is at play, and that this playfulness is the creative mediator of the music. \r\n\r\nOver two album sides, the listener is transported from the urban sound garden of \"Awakening Day,\" through the soulful yow of \"Light Ships,\" into the texture bliss of \"City of Love,\" and finally the reflective pool of \"Freeflow\". The first bonus track \"Somebody Scream\" demonstrates Laraaji's dexterous zither-playing over thirty-five minutes of music, while the second, \"Astral Jam,\" starts with a Wu-like beat (courtesy of Laraaji) and warps into a rolling snare trance. \r\n\r\nThe limited edition LP version of FRKWYS Vol. 8 is packaged in thick black jackets with a two-color adhesive wrap, both printed on post-consumer goods papers at Stumptown Printers.","options":[{"id":15752293,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47354557/-/113_frkwys08_cover_500x500.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47354557/-/113_frkwys08_cover_500x500.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[{"id":4045,"name":"Blues Control","permalink":"blues-control","url":"/artist/blues-control"}],"categories":[{"id":126083,"name":"ALL 12\" VINYL","permalink":"all-12-vinyl","url":"/category/all-12-vinyl"}]},{"id":4656949,"name":"Rale - Some Kissed Charms That Would Not Protect Them LP","permalink":"rale-some-kissed-charms-that-would-not-protect-them-lp","position":252,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rale-some-kissed-charms-that-would-not-protect-them-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-10-18T11:19:20.000Z","description":"\r\nIsounderscore – ISO_10\r\nLP\r\n\r\n\r\nHoused in deluxe fluorescent blue jackets with silver foil-stamped artwork (Clebsch graph) by Brandon Nickell.

Twilight Pacific (7:20)\r\n\r\nThe full-length player of FRKWYS Vol. 7 features pieces improvised in various forms by David Borden, James Ferraro, Samuel Godin, Laurel Halo, and Daniel Lopatin. \r\n\r\nWhen Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never, Ford & Lopatin) and RVNG Intl. began discussing this FRKWYS collaboration, Borden's work in Mother Mallard's Portable Masterpiece Co. and his seminal Music For Amplified Keyboard Instruments album were mutually / ecstatically acknowledged. While rooted in academia, Borden's minimalist compositions deal in natural themes, evoking expansive environments. \r\n\r\nThe idea to grow the project to include additional collaborators was inspired both by Borden's accomplishments in ensemble improvisation and by a basic desire for collective energy and levity. Atlantic Sound Studio in DUMBO, Brooklyn became the meeting destination for Lopatin and Borden, alongside musicians Halo, Godin, and Ferraro. \r\n\r\nOver two days in August 2010, the ensemble played infinitely. During tour breaks the following fall and winter, the endless hours of recordings were paired down to the selections of FRKWYS Vol. 7. The music of the album represents full session takes, edited only for time. The cosmically dense but dynamic nature of the recording reveals the diverse ingredients seasoning the spatial stew. \"People of Wind\" Parts 1 and 2 were amongst first takes from the two-day session. The pieces exhibit the ensemble in early harmony, allowing each other textural counterpoint play while avoiding rigidity. \"Internet Gospel\" Parts 1 and 2 demonstrate the players at ease and taking turns at solo accompaniments, ending in a Fourth World freak out. \"Twilight Pacific\" and \"Just a Little Pollution\" are compiled from middle points of the session - structured statements in solidarity. \r\n\r\nThe limited edition LP version of FRKWYS Vol. 7 is packaged in thick black jackets with a two-color adhesive wrap.

BLACK VINYL. 12 SONGS. PRINTED COVERS. COMES WITH 16 PAGE BOOKLET.\r\n\r\nChalk Circle existed in the Washington, DC metro area punk/hardcore scene between 1981 and 1983. They were the first all-female rock or punk band to ever record and perform in DC, and their recorded output will finally be available in one place: on the Reflection LP, released by both Mississippi Records and Post Present Medium. The twelve songs on this release are from compilations on Outside Records and WGNS, live shows, and unreleased recordings. It also comes with a sixteen page booklet compiled by guitarist/vocalist Sharon Cheslow that tells the Chalk Circle story in its entirety for the first time. The booklet features photographs, press clippings, and extensive liner notes by renowned musician and producer Don Fleming, whose band Velvet Monkeys headlined Chalk Circle's first shows.\r\n\r\nChalk Circle, although personally part of the birth of hardcore as friends and fans of the Dischord scene, musically never fit in to the stringent rules of that scene. They sound like they were from a time where experimentation was rewarded, where new ideas were examined and transformed by people who were curious and excited to fit with the moment. The ideas were then transformed again, when the moment changed. In an interview by Alex Guiness in 1982, in response to a question about how to label Chalk Circle, vocalist/guitarist Mary Green answered, \"We'll create our own tag.\" For those who want a tag, well, think about the raw experimental U.S. punk of Flipper, Bush Tetras, and The Minutemen, or the innovative post-punk of Delta 5, The Swell Maps, Liliput, and The Slits. Think about the youthful energy of DC Hardcore and the enthusiasm of teenagers making music that comes from the heart and not from copying riffs from rock records. Think about the straight-laced nature of the nation's capital and the joy of creating your own culture in a stifling straight world. Think about the promise of punk to teenage women. Chalk Circle expresses all this through music that is spirited, unique, creative, powerful, and fun.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:album:083lbvpBbne9dj5vvxdpCx\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":12068324,"name":"Default","price":12.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":23.0,"amount_with_others":38.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":22.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35097786/-/Chalk-Circle-Reflection-529456.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35097786/-/Chalk-Circle-Reflection-529456.jpg","width":400,"height":400},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36859008/-/chalkcircle_main.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36859008/-/chalkcircle_main.jpg","width":362,"height":432}],"artists":[{"id":4731,"name":"Sharon Cheslow","permalink":"sharon-cheslow","url":"/artist/sharon-cheslow"},{"id":48301,"name":"Mississippi Records","permalink":"mississippi-records","url":"/artist/mississippi-records"}],"categories":[{"id":126083,"name":"ALL 12\" VINYL","permalink":"all-12-vinyl","url":"/category/all-12-vinyl"},{"id":126113,"name":"MAGAZINES","permalink":"magazines","url":"/category/magazines"}]},{"id":3574088,"name":"Wally Shoup, Chris Corsano, Paul Flaherty - Bounced Check LP","permalink":"wally-shoup-chris-corsano-paul-flaherty-bounced-check-lp","position":263,"price":14.0,"default_price":14.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wally-shoup-chris-corsano-paul-flaherty-bounced-check-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-04-10T19:09:15.000Z","description":"A\t\tCarte Blanche\t18:50\t\r\nB\t\tBuried Alive In Seattle\t15:30\t\r\n\r\nAlto Saxophone - Wally Shoup\r\nArtwork By - Wally Shoup\r\nDrums - Chris Corsano\r\nMastered By - Jim Matus\r\nRecorded By - Yamada Shin\r\nTenor Saxophone, Alto Saxophone - Paul Flaherty\r\n\r\nRecorded live in concert at Gallery 1412 in Seattle, WA on Oct. 16th, 2005. \r\nMastered at Paranoise Studios, Hartford, CT, Dec. 2005.","options":[{"id":11971922,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/34735128/-/R-1216924-1285272715.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/34735128/-/R-1216924-1285272715.jpeg","width":600,"height":596}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":126083,"name":"ALL 12\" VINYL","permalink":"all-12-vinyl","url":"/category/all-12-vinyl"}]},{"id":136296,"name":"Zum block logo shirt","permalink":"zum-block-logo-shirt","position":264,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/zum-block-logo-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2008-08-09T21:13:02.000Z","description":"A handful left of this design from 2001, George designed this block logo for Zum and these were printed at Cinderblock.

The 100 drawings gathered in Dripping Junk were made over a period of five days during a recent trip to Miami FL.\r\n\r\nLambkin's eye and pen guide us through a confusion of local observation. We find ourselves transported to the opulent sands of South Beach, the strip malls of Dade County, and the many tourists spots one would expect to engage. Yet Lambkin allows us to view these sites through his own distorted lens. This is not the Miami of common expectation. Lambkin throws us headfirst in to a hallucinogenic netherworld where logic and common sense cower in the shade of the palms. A world where fantasy and reality mix effortlessly and are drank as the cocktail of choice. A world where the skunk ape is king.\r\n\r\nDripping Junk contains 100 black and white drawings printed on high-quality paper and comes as a beautiful limited edition large format hardcover book of 250 copies.\r\n\r\n<object height=\"300\" width=\"300\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F32847935&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=artwork\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F32847935&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=artwork\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"></embed></object>","options":[{"id":10292335,"name":"Default","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":48.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":28.0,"amount_with_others":35.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":38.5,"amount_with_others":43.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/28919673/-/dripping_junk.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/28919673/-/dripping_junk.jpg","width":591,"height":518},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/28919745/-/dripping_junk_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/28919745/-/dripping_junk_3.jpg","width":238,"height":320},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/28919753/-/DSC01193-1.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/28919753/-/DSC01193-1.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/28919777/-/dripping_junk_2-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/28919777/-/dripping_junk_2-1.jpg","width":742,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":131626,"name":"BOOKS","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":125895,"name":"CDS","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":212206,"name":"IMPORTS","permalink":"imports","url":"/category/imports"}]},{"id":2941685,"name":"Fanajana: A Collection Of Recordings And Photography From Madagasikara LP","permalink":"fanajana-a-collection-of-recordings-and-photography-from-madagasikara","position":268,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fanajana-a-collection-of-recordings-and-photography-from-madagasikara","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-11-28T06:20:56.000Z","description":"Mississippi Records \r\nMR-067\r\n2010 LP\r\nIncludes 12 page black and white semi-glossy booklet with notes and photographs.\r\n\r\nA1\tNoel & Isabelle  -

George Chen has played in the bands KIT, 7 Year Rabbit Cycle, Boxleitner, Vholtz, Grey Daturas (as touring bassist), Must Have No Magic, and Common Eider King Eider.\r\nHaving shared stages with pinnacles of rock and noise (Yellow Swans, UsaIsAMonster, Hair Police, The Better To See You With, Evolution Control Committee, Sic Alps, YACHT), CSM have toured West and East Coasts of the United States and plan to continue said campaign for the foreseeable future. \r\nThe album was recorded in winter of 2006 with Ricardo Esway (Militant Children's Hour, East Bay engineer par excellence) with mastering by Thomas Dimuzio (Gench Studio). Eric Ostrowski (Noggin) is sampled playing violin.\r\nGSSD is the primarily CDR imprint of Randy Lee Sutherland (Sword and Sandals, Vholtz, Wiggwaum, Thin Ensemble). The Chen Santa Maria record is their first commercially pressed CD.\r\nShit On Records is a San Francisco-based label that has released material by Kool Teen, Happiness, and Militant Children's Hour.\r\nCover artwork by Paul Tyree-Francis (Luaka Bop) printed on full-color Arigatopak from Portland's Stumptown printers.\r\n\r\n1\t\tCondominimum\t\t\t 9:16\t \r\n2\t\t<a href=\"http://freedownloads.last.fm/download/161358018/Tic%2BTaxed.mp3\r\n\">Tic Taxed <i>free download</i></a>\t\t\t 4:20\t \r\n3\t\tInsides Out\t\t\t 3:13\t \r\n4\t\tChirpin'\t\t\t 4:19\t \r\n5\t\tPing Polo\t\t\t 4:32\t \r\n6\t\tSlugless\t\t\t 5:58\t \r\n7\t\tYou're Sunk\t\t\t 6:07\t \r\n","options":[{"id":671790,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":16.5,"amount_with_others":13.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/898036/-/2811591623_296632f654_m.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/898036/-/2811591623_296632f654_m.jpg","width":240,"height":240},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1499939/-/3175126190_95d88c4f4e.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1499939/-/3175126190_95d88c4f4e.jpg","width":500,"height":193},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96131812/-/93726.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96131812/-/93726.jpg","width":351,"height":500}],"artists":[{"id":3813,"name":"George Chen","permalink":"george-chen","url":"/artist/george-chen"},{"id":9008,"name":"Chen Santa Maria","permalink":"chen-santa-maria","url":"/artist/chen-santa-maria"},{"id":4504,"name":"Common Eider King Eider","permalink":"common-eider-king-eider","url":"/artist/common-eider-king-eider"},{"id":3817,"name":"KIT","permalink":"kit","url":"/artist/kit"}],"categories":[{"id":125895,"name":"CDS","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":172570,"name":"Wiggwaum / Poor School LP+CDR","permalink":"wiggwaum-poor-school-lp-cdr","position":274,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wiggwaum-poor-school-lp-cdr","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-10-25T20:55:23.000Z","description":"Killertree Records\r\n\r\nWiggwaum (Randy Lee Sutherland of Thin Ensemble and Vholtz, Doug Katelus, filmmaker/trombonist Loren Means)\r\nPoor School (Bryan Ramirez of Ex-Cocaine and Universal Indians, Nathan Hoyme, & John Niekrasz)\r\n300lps - screened covers by Randy Lee - bonus CDR of lp w/ 2 xtra tracks. \r\n\r\n\"The playing is high-intensity throughout, though there are fundamental differences in each group's musical approach. I've come to think of their respective approaches as symbolic of something like post-nuclear morning and evening ragas.\r\n\r\nPoor School will wake you up and not take you down. Their modal and thickly drone-based song is awash in a sea of harmonics. Their music seems like a throwback at first, but it's only that there's a timelessness at the spiritual core of it. Ramirez's high-strung electric guitar pyrotechnics most often take the lead in the trio's rock-solid amalgam of ecstatic psychedelic jazz.\r\n\r\nWiggwaum shapes sound inside a nebulous cone of white noise from outer space. Their music might change your evening or your life. While its particles are made up of \"real\" sounds derived from real instruments, it is pushed to such a level of intensity that only a massive sound entity remains.\r\n\r\nRandy Sutherland's drums loosely thrash, crash, explode, and dryly implode within the sonic mush. From Doug Katelus' Fender Rhodes come jangly runs of Ra-like \"cosmic tones\" or warbly layers of static-y stratospheric dis-chords that shatter and whir upon terrestrial re-entry.\r\n\r\nAt the center of the maelstrom are the distorted voice, feedback flute, and mutant trombone of Loren Means. You might recall Loren's playing from Henry Kaiser's Ice Death (Parachute 005). Loren's new brass sound is like nothing you've heard, a muffled foghorn to guide approaching aliens. Combining crescendo-ing and decrescendo-ing globs of sound with Martian voice and Theremin-like feedback, Loren's playing gives shapeless shape to Wiggwaum's edgy next-age noise music.\" - Henry Kuntz","options":[{"id":786944,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1108458/-/killertreefront.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1108458/-/killertreefront.jpg","width":312,"height":307},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1108462/-/killertreeback.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1108462/-/killertreeback.jpg","width":312,"height":313}],"artists":[{"id":3799,"name":"Compilation","permalink":"compilation","url":"/artist/compilation"},{"id":43844,"name":"Randy Lee Sutherland","permalink":"randy-lee-sutherland","url":"/artist/randy-lee-sutherland"}],"categories":[{"id":126083,"name":"ALL 12\" VINYL","permalink":"all-12-vinyl","url":"/category/all-12-vinyl"},{"id":125895,"name":"CDS","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":334291,"name":"SILKSCREENED","permalink":"silkscreened","url":"/category/silkscreened"}]},{"id":198404,"name":"Audible Delusions Ensemble - Winter's Weapons CD","permalink":"audible-delusions-ensemble-winters-weapons-cd","position":275,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/audible-delusions-ensemble-winters-weapons-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-12-06T13:12:49.000Z","description":"Heathen Skulls CD HS009\r\n\r\nAudible Delusions Ensemble is an improvisational music collective organized by Steve Touchston of Oakland, California, via Mobile, Alabama. It serves to bring together different combinations of his favorite contemporary players for recording sessions of pieces based on everything from composed scores to verbal instructions to total free playing. AudibleDelusionsEnsemble will hopefully illuminate the much too often overlooked thread which connects different schools of music such as noise, free jazz, punk, hardcore, electronica, process music, and various other anarchic avant-garde forms. \"Winter's Weapons\" is a document of some of the cuts from the first recording session, which took place in December of 2006. The players were Jorge Boehringer (Caroliner, Core of the Coalman), Robert MacManus (Grey Daturas), Matthew Grothman (Vholtz, Woman's Worth), Yasi Perera (Breezy Days) Band, Syrinx), and of course Steve Touchston (xbxrx, snowsuit*, Kit). Percussion, guitar, piano, viola, saxophone, synthesizer, processed vocals, and various electronics abound. With the exception of \"People's Park\", no tracks on this album contain any overdubs or post-production trickery beyond basic mixing methods like compression and EQ.","options":[{"id":880736,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1520389/-/audibledelusion.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1520389/-/audibledelusion.jpg","width":246,"height":252}],"artists":[{"id":4075,"name":"Core of the Coalman","permalink":"core-of-the-coalman","url":"/artist/core-of-the-coalman"},{"id":3817,"name":"KIT","permalink":"kit","url":"/artist/kit"},{"id":9823,"name":"XBXRX","permalink":"xbxrx","url":"/artist/xbxrx"}],"categories":[{"id":125895,"name":"CDS","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":212206,"name":"IMPORTS","permalink":"imports","url":"/category/imports"}]},{"id":161633,"name":"Silentist LP","permalink":"silentist-lp","position":276,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/silentist-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-10-04T14:52:35.000Z","description":"Celestial Gang\r\n\r\nRecorded with J Romagna at Type Foundry\r\n\r\nKoan\r\nSeizures\r\nHex\r\nExecution\r\nEntropy\r\nAnesthetic\r\nBars\r\nVerdelet\r\nReturn\r\nRepulsive Resurrection\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/19792420\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/19792420\">Silentist -

He's been sending us version after version of more than 40 songs, and version after version of the ever changing intended release.
