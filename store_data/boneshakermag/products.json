From rickshaw politics to open-source cargo bikes, from racing with missing limbs to riding in search of the simple life - there's poetry, strangeness and inspiration in equal measure. As ever, we've woven in the work of some wonderful illustrators, photographers and writers from around the world to bring all these bicycle stories to life. It's taken a while, but we're happy as a tailwind with how it's turned out. We hope you like it too.\r\n\r\nBy purchasing this digital format of the magazine, you are helping us to sustain the printed version, rather than replacing it.

Our piece 'Breakaway Stages' takes in Don Quixote by Bike, Godiva Awakes from the cutural olympiad and other theatre groups using bicycles to explore the world around them as their stage. David Serrano's photo story of turns the camera on the spectators of a touring stage and shows the theatre thats behind these big events.We hear from bee-keeping bikers, catch up with two very different bike projects in Toulon and New York and feature an amusing ode to something very familiar to everyday cyclist - the 'potbelly'.\r\n\r\nAlso, Boneshaker’s reached issue 10 - we’ve come a long way since the wide-eyed first forays of issue 1. We’ve certainly got a long way to go yet. To have reached our tenth issue with all our positivity and pure-heartedness intact really does feel like a significant point; and a bit like a birthday.

The people he talked to along the way included weavers, boat builders, a stickmaker, bicycle mechanic, screen printer, cheese maker and tea taster. Conversations were recorded and edited as photofilms and uploaded from the saddle to the Slowcoast website, giving followers of the journey the chance to meet an inspirational group of people living and working around the coast of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland.\r\n\r\nNick Hand is a long-time friend of Boneshaker, who's contributed excerpts from his Slow Coast project to several of our issues. He's just made this beautiful book, and we're delighted to have a few copies to pass on to good people like you.\r\n\r\n'Conversations on the Coast' presents a selection of 20 stories and photography from the Slowcoast project.\r\n\r\n\"What I love most about this book is the humility of actually quite ordinary artisans chosen by chance as they came into focus on one man's remarkable journey around the coast. What we learn is that when you take the time to look, even the apparently straight forward lives of a bicycle repairer, hat maker or basket weaver are driven by passion and a deep seated love for their work. It is inspirational.\"\r\n\r\nRobin Wood, Chair of The Heritage Crafts Association\r\n\r\nSee more images at http://departmentofsmallworks.co.uk/images/series-5-conversations.aspx\r\nIncluded in the book:\r\n\r\nKay Anderson, Spinner\r\n\r\nBill Bontoft, Stickmaker\r\n\r\nAustin Brown, Bicycle Mechanic\r\n\r\nWill Brown, Outfitter\r\n\r\nMerin Crossingham, Animator\r\n\r\nSheena Devitt, Stone Letter Carver\r\n\r\nMartin Doyle, Flute Maker\r\n\r\nLaurence Edwards, Sculptor\r\n\r\nDouglas Grierson, Weaver\r\n\r\nJohn Joseph Hanna, Hat Maker\r\n\r\nJoanne B Kaar, Paper Maker\r\n\r\nPaul F Kelly, Gold and Silversmith\r\n\r\nNigel Legee, Fisherman and Artist\r\n\r\nDominique Lieb, Letterpress Printer\r\n\r\nJoanne Mitchell, Glass Maker\r\n\r\nKiera Rathbone, Typewriter Artist\r\n\r\nJohn J Savage, Storyteller\r\n\r\nPeter Segger, Organic Farmer\r\n\r\nPat Tanner, Boat Builder\r\n\r\nPip Weaser, Basket Maker","options":[{"id":20074083,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":3.5},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61832327/-/Conversations_two.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61832327/-/Conversations_two.JPG","width":1000,"height":666},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61832303/-/Converstions_one.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61832303/-/Converstions_one.JPG","width":1000,"height":666}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3272219,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":4949285,"name":"Our first Artists' Postcard set (plus FREE badges & stickers) ","permalink":"artists-postcard-set-including-free-badges-and-stickers","position":53,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/artists-postcard-set-including-free-badges-and-stickers","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-28T02:28:44.000Z","description":"Set of 6 postcards, A6 size, created for the launch of issue 6 of Boneshaker.

With its outstanding cover by Illustrator Stevie Gee, with more than a little nod to Kraftwerk's 'Tour de France' artwork (albeit in Stevie's unique style), this issue hits hard from the get-go.\r\n\r\nWith the usual heady mix of bike poetry, chain art from Korea and a vivid account of one man's memories of a crash, there is a something unusual at the turn of every page. The contributors have outdone themselves with the quality of their writing, photography and illustration and Boneshaker are proud as punch to share them with you in the pages of issue 8.\r\n\r\nThe publication has 60 pages, is perfect bound, advert free, printed on FSC approved uncoated Challenger Offset.\r\n\r\nWe're sold out of this issue, but you may still find a copy at one of our many stockists:\r\nwww.boneshakermag.com/stockists\r\n\r\nIf there's no stockist near you, get in touch and suggest one! \r\n\r\nDon't miss out in future - you can subscribe here: \r\nhttp://fingerprintdistribution.bigcartel.com/category/boneshaker-magazine","options":[{"id":17934947,"name":"Default","price":3.5,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":3.5},{"amount_alone":5.25,"amount_with_others":5.25,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.25,"amount_with_others":5.25,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54700105/-/Boneshaker_issue8.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54700105/-/Boneshaker_issue8.jpg","width":327,"height":459},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54700225/-/BS8_spread_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54700225/-/BS8_spread_1.jpg","width":700,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54700241/-/BS8_spread_4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54700241/-/BS8_spread_4.jpg","width":700,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2884489,"name":"Magazines","permalink":"magazines","url":"/category/magazines"}]},{"id":6203943,"name":"Boneshaker back issues: available from Fingerprint","permalink":"boneshaker-bumper-pack-all-5-issues","position":69,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/boneshaker-bumper-pack-all-5-issues","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-05-16T14:20:18.000Z","description":"Playing catch-up?
