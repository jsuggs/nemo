Hyson is a good grade of tea made from cultivated bushes.\r\n\r\nYoung Hyson is an early-harvested Hyson, plucked before the Spring rains.  It is much more delicate in flavour and aroma than Gunpowder, and with its neatly twisted leaves is attractive in appearance.\r\n\r\nYoung Hyson is also known as Yu Chin Cha or Chun Mee, which means Precious Eyebrow – a term that is meant to describe the shape of the twisted leaf.  Phillip Hyson was an English tea merchant.\r\n\r\nThe flavour of Young Hyson is light, sweet and refreshing.  The smoky character of some of the China teas is absent as is the bitterness of some Gunpowders.  This is a tea to infuse delicately and enjoy after a meal.\r\n\r\nTo brew, put a rounded tsp of tea per person in a pot or straight into a cup, boiled water that has been allowed to cool for a minute.  Brew for 2 mins and serve without milk.  Over-brewing will yield a bitter liquor.

The climate here is uncomfortable for people, but ideal for growing tea, and it is even possible that the tea plant is indigenous to this region.\r\n\r\nClassic Assam teas such as this are rich and full-flavoured with plenty of colour and a distinct malty character, with some sweetness.  They are ideal for drinking with milk at breakfast time and throughout the day and have enough flavour and richness to accompany food well, even a classic full English breakfast.\r\n\r\nTo brew, put one heaped tea spoon full per person in a pot and add fresh, boiling water.  Infuse for 1-2 mins (please infuse for at least a full minute if possible – this is very good tea and deserves it!).  This tea is best enjoyed with a little milk, and sugar if desired.  It is suitable for drinking at any time of day, particularly breakfast.","options":[{"id":12190600,"name":"Assam Full Leaf 50g","price":2.8,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12278354,"name":"100g","price":5.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":12278356,"name":"250g","price":12.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35486208/-/IMG_0152.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35486208/-/IMG_0152.JPG","width":1000,"height":991}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2054906,"name":"Black Tea","permalink":"black-tea","url":"/category/black-tea"}]},{"id":3648682,"name":"Yunnan Pu-erh Leaf Tea","permalink":"yunnan-pu-erh-leaf-tea-50g","position":3,"price":2.85,"default_price":2.85,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/yunnan-pu-erh-leaf-tea-50g","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-04-24T22:56:03.000Z","description":"Some say that Yunnam Province, in the extreme SW tip of China, is the original birthplace of tea.\r\nThis is a rich, fertile and often inaccessible region. Deep in Yunnan's mountainous rural heart lies the market village of Pu-erh, where these extraordinary aged teas were first traded.\r\nTechnically a type of green tea, Pu-erh yields an almost red liquor with a distinctive, rich, mellow, sweet flavour and a delicious aroma reminiscent of stables.\r\nTo brew put one tsp of tea per person or add direct to a cup. Add boiled water that has been allowed to cool for a minute. Brew for 30 seconds and serve without milk.\r\nThe leaves can be re-used 6-8 times.\r\nAlternatively you can treat Pu-erh like a strong blend tea and brew for 5 mins or more.

The pellets are a black-green colour and resemble lead shot- or, it seems, gunpowder, which is how this robust, invigorating and delicious tea got its name.\r\nThe tea produces a dry, rather dark green liquor with quite a strong flavour that is often described as nutty or oaked.\r\nOne advantage of Gunpowder is that being so tightly rolled it keeps very well, and is also economical- 2 tsp is enough for a whole pot.
