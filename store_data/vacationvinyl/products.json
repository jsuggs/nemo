The arpeggios continue, almost tauntingly, as singer Ben Verellen starts to growl.

None of the 8 tracks included have been released before on any other format. At a time when the scene is saturated with “Noise Techno” the album is almost celebratory by contrast, balancing caustic licks of distortion and oppressive bass with cleanly mixed synth tones and ricocheting claps in a shell-shocked, surreal soundsphere. WIth production assistance from Juan Mendez (Silent Servant), the album includes the most direct and propulsive Vatican Shadow material yet, continuing an evolutionary shift away from the complex, collage-based narrative of those cassette releases into more visibly direct contact with the listener.

Seattle’s Space Needle was no longer the world’s tallest metaphor for heroin abuse, and Tacoma/Seattle quartet Botch were about to redefine a genre with the hyperkinetic guitar squalls and contortionist rhythms of We Are the Romans. On the other side of the country, the Twin Towers were two years away from being annihilated in a terrorist firestorm, but Botch guitarist Dave Knudson had already drawn a target over the New York City skyline on the album’s unforgettable cover. By 2002, both the Towers and Botch were gone: Chronic tension between Knudson (currently of Minus the Bear) and drummer Tim Latona forced the band tits up before it ever really got its due. Bassist Brian Cook and vocalist Dave Verellen went on to form Roy (Cook is also a member of These Arms Are Snakes; Verellen is also a Tacoma firefighter), and Botch released a posthumous EP, An Anthology of Dead Ends, in late 2002. But We Are the Romans lives on as one of the most influential “hardcore” records of the last decade, its jagged grace and terminal discord revered by the likes of future noise-mongers Norma Jean, the Used and Every Time I Die—which is ironic when one considers that the album essentially called bullshit on the prevailing hardcore aesthetics of its time. Produced by Matt Bayles (who went on to record similarly lauded albums by the likes of Isis and Mastodon) at Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard’s Studio Litho, We Are the Romans is the electrifying epitaph of a band that quit while it was way ahead. —J.

Sweet Heart Sweet Light is Jason “Spaceman” Pierce’s album-length homage to all the things he loves in rock ‘n’ roll. The resulting songs span from vintage rock to sparse, piano-driven balladry, but all are immediately recognizable as Pierce creations. Nonetheless, the variety and the statement of intent did bring to mind the question of what, exactly, does he mean by rock ‘n’ roll?\r\n\r\nThe energy level fluctuates like a roller coaster through ballads and fuzz excursions. The central peak is “Heading For The Top,” an eight-minute blast of broken-sounding guitars and pounding piano notes with Spaceman’s classic wasted vocals. The ongoing up-and-down melody and unceasing rhythmic drive is entirely trance-inducing.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of songs that make one think, from the start, “classic Spiritualized.” Layered guitars, bleating horns, organ and piano pulsing or chiming underneath, then the piled-up strings coming in: these are the foundations that we’ve come to expect, together with the tired, melancholic voice and lyrics. But there’s no doubt that Sweet Heart Sweet Light steps away from this formula more than any recent Spiritualized album. “Mary” makes me think of the recent remaking of ‘70s rock that Ethan Miller’s Howlin’ Rain brings, albeit adorned with strings and signature guitar squall. “Little Girl” rides a compelling chorus into a realm of orchestral pop that strays toward the grandiose but never goes over the top.\r\n\r\nThe album’s repeating themes of heartache, loss and pain play out across the lyrics, culminating in the final pair of songs when Pierce directly addresses religious topics. “Life Is A Problem” is a brief gospel tune of soaring strings and strained vocals; “This life is too long / My willpower’s never too strong” leads into the finale, “So Long You Pretty Thing,” in which the Lord is asked for help “because I’m hurting inside” and “it ain’t easy.” The slow groove is filled with organ and strings, while the vocals are among the prettiest he’s ever committed to tape. When the song bursts into flower, the guitar breaks through and Pierce rises up to meet it. Whether you’re God fearing or not, it’s a fine performance.\r\n\r\nWhich brings us back around to our initial question: what does Pierce have in mind when he’s focused on rock ‘n’ roll? Looking at the span of the past 60-plus years, there’s obviously no single thread — and looking at the many disparate themes, it’s easier to find those not embodied herein than those that are. Sweet Heart Sweet Light is no rebel paean; it’s not a rough ode to being an outsider — not exactly. It is, though, a collection of pretty raw, honest admissions of loss, guilt, regret and loneliness. Recurring themes of emotional pain and uncertainty mingle with the occasional bombast, and point the album back to rock’s basis in blues. Certainly, Pierce’s feverish production layering is at the opposite end of the spectrum from stripped-down Delta blues, but the lyrical themes and worn vocals connect directly to that antecedent.\r\n\r\nThis uneven album takes time to break in, but each successive spin deepens the relationships among the songs and reveals more details. How listeners interpret the connection with rock’s deep history is up to them, but researching the question will be worth their while.\r\n","options":[{"id":19880555,"name":"Default","price":15.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":16.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61218879/-/homepage_large.0838d06a.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61218879/-/homepage_large.0838d06a.jpg","width":319,"height":319}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1676793,"name":"2xLP","permalink":"2xlp","url":"/category/2xlp"}]},{"id":13212867,"name":"G.I.

Hasta La Muerte (To the Death) binds a bulldozing hardcore aesthetic with sludge and mid-tempo death and doom. Xibalba's tunes engulf and pummel, in that order. The band inhabits the gloomiest of mires and mines the murkiest of grooves.\r\n\r\nXibalba's 2011 debut Madre Mia por los Dias was originally released on LP by A389 Records before being issued on CD by Southern Lord (the band signed to the label for Hasta La Muerte's release). Label head and Sunn O))) veteran Greg Anderson contributes guitar on a couple of tracks on the new album, Nails member Taylor Young produced Hasta La Muerte, and famed metal artist Dan Seagrave produced the cover art—a potent combination right there.\r\n\r\nAs for Xibalba, they're a sludgecore outfit. Accordingly, downtuned, creeping build-ups compress the density and tension, and shattering breakdowns provide the crucial cathartic release. Xibalba impart plenty of sluggishness, thickness and squalidness, along with capacious acidity. Imagine Crowbar melding with Bloodlet, and then drag that through a toxic Floridian quagmire. The end result is superbly punishing, and it's no surprise that the band have a legion of dedicated underground followers.\r\n\r\nHasta La Muerte is replete with the atmosphere of a carnivore methodically stalking its prey. You know the pivotal lunge is coming, and that ratchets up the tension, packing just as much punch as the resulting carnage. It all makes for an intense and bludgeoning sound, but critics have suggested that very same pattern of attack is a little too predictable.\r\n\r\nWell, it's undeniable that Xibalba's material falls within firm parameters, but there is absolutely nothing monochrome or banal about Hasta La Muerte. Opener \"No Serenity\" begins with a feedbacking stagger before diving into a swampy dirge, and from then on it's one crushing and menacing track after another. \"Soledad\" and \"Sentenced\" both feature fantastically bitter and lurching riffing, and the 8-minute-plus \"Lujuria\" serves as a fine example of the band's ability to sustain the ill-boding tenseness.\r\n\r\nThe sour grinding drone of \"The Flood\" billows with glorious grimness. Along with the battering \"Stoneheart\" and \"Laid to Rest\", it features some powerful percussion (the drumming throughout the album is phenomenal). \"Burn\" leans more on the hardcore fence, and the female vocals rising from the bloodthirsty \"Mala Mujer\" shows a band willing to express themselves in multicolored hues—even if those all happen to be from the darker end of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nBattering and mercilessly unforgiving, Hasta La Muerte is extremely heavy. Young's production is prodigiously hefty and, combined with the band's daunting swagger, creates a decimating album. But what ultimately underscores Xibalba’s harrowing trip to perdition is their ability to sustain a magnitude of intimidation that borders on sadistic.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":22078709,"name":"Yellow Vinyl (Ltd. to 500)","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":24.0,"amount_with_others":16.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68369089/-/Xibalba-Hasta-la-muerte-300x300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68369089/-/Xibalba-Hasta-la-muerte-300x300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1676793,"name":"2xLP","permalink":"2xlp","url":"/category/2xlp"}]},{"id":5958187,"name":"Pelican - Ataraxia/Taraxis EP 12\"","permalink":"pelican-ataraxia-taraxis-ep-12","position":29,"price":13.0,"default_price":13.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pelican-ataraxia-taraxis-ep-12","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-17T21:44:31.000Z","description":"Since the genre’s longtime flag bearers Isis called it splitsville, it seems like the post-metal genre got a little quieter. Fans of heavy melodies have been able to seek solace in such closely situated subgenres as post-rock, sludge, doom, progressive, and stoner metal, all while waiting for some of the post-metal heavyweights to put out new material. Just when we were missing them the most, Pelican returns with Ataraxia/Taraxis, the band’s first release since What We All Come to Need surfaced roughly three years ago.\r\n\r\nWhy the long delay? Reportedly, the band’s four members have spread out to different cities, which could understandably make the collaborative process a bit more difficult. Despite its four tracks being recorded in four different studios, Ataraxia/Taraxis holds together as well as you’d expect from a Pelican release, each song weaving into the next with a strangely graceful flow.\r\n\r\nThe titular lead track, “Ataraxia”, means “peace of mind,” an apt title for this calm (if somewhat unsettling) song, which opens with an Eastern-inflected dirge and then picks up a gentle keyboard melody over a growling bassline. “Lathe Biosas” immediately busts the record wide open with an impacting, churning guitar riff before unraveling into a lighter, quickly strummed grind. However, the buildup picks up the pace on the hard-pummeling “Parasite Colony”, echoing the band’s past material. “Taraxis” sounds more like a companion piece to the album’s opener. It’s moreover an acoustic track, with a great minimalist bells-and-organ breakdown that makes up its core, all before it explodes into a gloriously distorted finale.\r\n\r\nThe EP clocks in at a pretty trim 18 minutes, which may not seem all that brief until you think back on how single tracks from Pelican would sometimes play out to similar time lengths; still, it’s a welcome dose of new music from the post-metal quartet.\r\n\r\nWe got the limited to 500 copies Clear Color Vinyl (Europe)","options":[{"id":19068525,"name":"Clear Vinyl (ltd. to 500)","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":22.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58507715/-/PelicanCover_web-e1326236752208.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58507715/-/PelicanCover_web-e1326236752208.jpg","width":400,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":232758,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"},{"id":254955,"name":"EP","permalink":"ep","url":"/category/ep"}]},{"id":7043287,"name":"Aaron Turner ltd. ed.

They are  recognized as one of the most ferociously consistent, challenging and influential bands within and beyond their realm. Like other long-running institutions Neurosis, Sonic Youth, The Melvins, or Fugazi,  Converge was born from the wellspring of punk and hardcore, quickly mutating into something all together different - an aural beast of their own design.  Their sound has since fluctuated and evolved over a long and industrious career, but even in their earliest days the hallmarks of their sound were there - whiplash dynamics, floor-stomping breakdowns, brittle heart-rending melodies and a torrential sense of momentum. \r\n\r\nThe collection of  Caring & Killing captures  Converge in their formative years, spanning the timeframe of 1991-1994. This period was extremely productive for the band, generating the debut full length, Halo in a Haystack, a slew of compilation appearances and split EPs, as well as multiple demo sessions. The resultant tracks were unpredictable - rageful and delicate, catchy and obtuse. Despite the harsh juxtaposition of opposing elements, it was clear Converge possessed the will and the wit to construct cohesive songs from the maelstrom, ones that proved to be powerfully charismatic in their idiosyncratic nature.  These early anthems are certainly more ungainly than those of present day Converge, but they burn with the same vitality and punishing drive for which the band is known and loved. These incendiary sermons are as utterly convincing now as upon the day of their first iteration, and from them a cult was born.","options":[{"id":35798727,"name":"Clear/White Splatter (ltd 300)","price":28.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35798730,"name":"Clear/Black Splatter (ltd 600)","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35798733,"name":"Black (ltd 1100)","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":16.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111839286/-/Converge-Caring-Killing.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111839286/-/Converge-Caring-Killing.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1676793,"name":"2xLP","permalink":"2xlp","url":"/category/2xlp"}]},{"id":6997105,"name":"Sigur Ros - Varud 10\"","permalink":"sigur-ros-varud-10","position":42,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sigur-ros-varud-10","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-18T06:51:52.000Z","description":"Sigur Rós present a two track limited edition 10” vinyl release to coincide with their national 2012 summer tour. “Varud” is a track taken from their 2012 album Valtari.

During this time I re-discovered many of my favorite old cassette compilations from the 90's that brought many disparate groups together under one banner. 'original soundtrack', released on italy's less than zero, was of particular interest, with its sonically and geographically diverse lineup. also at this time a friend had given me a book on 20th Century Russian history, emphasizing strife in Russia and the overwhelming destructive forces of nature and man's place within it. not only were troops engaged in the largest man-made conflict in history, but were, at the same, battling nature. without coats, winter ended soldiers lives before bullets could find them. It was then that I decided to combine the themes of the book with the idea of a dynamic compilation that brought together many of the genres that the label has explored.\r\n\r\ndominick fernow\r\noctober 31st, new york city, 2011\r\n \r\nfeaturing:\r\ngenocide organ\r\nffh\r\ngaze campaign\r\ndeathpile\r\nwhorebutcher\r\nconsumer electronics\r\nmlehst\r\nasm\r\nmangled clit\r\nviodre\r\nforcible confinement\r\nsutcliffe jugend/prurient\r\ncontrolled bleeding\r\nanti-aquarian\r\nnon\r\ncontrepoison\r\nmilitia\r\nalberich\r\nbus de la lum\r\nvatican shadow\r\nthe grey wolves\r\nethnic acid\r\names sanglantes\r\nlussuria\r\nsleepchamber\r\nsmell & quim\r\nanal drill\r\nahlzagailzehguh\r\ncloister\r\nkarasyozoku\r\nage of enlightenment\r\nhuman liberation technology\r\ngeography of hell\r\nhiv corner\r\npraying for oblivion\r\noutermost\r\nincapacitants\r\nexploring jezebel\r\nthirdorgan\r\nramleh\r\nstillbirth\r\nspastic colon\r\nflutter\r\nsickness\r\ngasolineman\r\ndeterge\r\nyellow tears\r\nk.p.\r\nthe haters\r\nemil beaulieau\r\nblackhumour\r\ncon-dom","options":[{"id":31560067,"name":"Default","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":14.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99073267/-/R-3233053-1322021029.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99073267/-/R-3233053-1322021029.jpg","width":476,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":232759,"name":"Cassette","permalink":"cassette","url":"/category/cassette"}]},{"id":10021315,"name":"DEATHPILE - G.R.

Since 1995 the label has maintained a central role in the morphing flux of underground noise, metal and extreme electronics, presenting the world with landmark records such as Sunn 0)))'s debut album and Prurient's pivotal 'Bermuda Drain', among so many others. So it seems fitting that one of the scene's most progressive, open-minded operators should close their final side. Prurient offers three suitably sombre, melancholic sacrifices: the gloaming drones and wrenching metal screech of 'Chosen Books' to open for the marching noise/techno formation, 'Entering The Water' and the particularly poignant closure of 'I Understand You' with its ponderous AFXian melody and pulverized power noise urging you to either cry or smash sh*t up. And who else better to soundtrack HH's end of days than the prolific Justin K Broadrick - otherwise known as part of Napalm Death, Jesu, Godflesh, Techno Animal (etc, etc) - a longtime ally of the label with arguably the finest CV on its roster. Taking in doom D&B slaughter on 'Fear Of Fear' and the droning hard-stepper 'Deceiver', he clocks out with the shuddering, corrugated waves of bass effluence and crushing riffage of 'Obedient Automaton' in a simulated eulogy for the Hydrahead legacy.

Released to coincide with his first tour of Europe, the album incorporates the live mix rehearsals of \"Operation Neptune Spear\" with tracks made in their aftermath, recorded straight to tape and mastered by Matt Colton at Air Studios. Anyone familiar with Fernow's live set-up will recognize the distinct nature of this material -- making use of stems and partial tracks separated into a cassette system which is then re-layered and mixed, effected with electronic processing. In short -- Fernow uses his tape machines like turntables in a mix, weaving a hazy and intuitive narrative of sounds that never quite head in the direction you expect, all imbued with an almost feral attitude that's exhilarating to witness, their limitations (ever noticed how VS tracks end so abruptly? the tape ran out), and their mechanical machine qualities used to devastating effect. Side A features all three parts of \"Operation Neptune Spear,\" originally made available in a measly edition of 17 cassettes and sold at the first-ever Vatican Shadow live show in L.A. back in May 2012. Side B features an additional 25 minutes of previously-unreleased work made in the aftermath of the show and using the same set-up, including an astonishing revision of \"Cairo Is a Haunted City,\" dis-assembled and re-wired, lending it a shortwave quality that's nothing short of revelatory. Ornamented Walls is the fourth Vatican Shadow release to be made available on vinyl, following on from releases for Blackest Ever Black, Type and his own Bed of Nails imprint. \r\n\r\nA1 - Operation Neptune Spear Part 1\r\nA2 - Operation Neptune Spear Part 2\r\nA3 - Operation Neptune Spear Part 3\r\n\r\nB1 - Cairo Is A Haunted City (Mythic Chords)\r\nB2 - Nightforce Scopes\r\nB3 - Yemeni Telephone Number\r\nB4 - India Has Just Tested A Nuclear Device\r\nB5 - Chuch Of All Images (Church Of The NSA)\r\nB6 - Boxes Were Wired To Batteries Then Loaded Into A Brown Toyota Cargo Truck","options":[{"id":25755174,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":22.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/80285109/-/vatican_shadow_ornamented_walls_1349360752_crop_550x550.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/80285109/-/vatican_shadow_ornamented_walls_1349360752_crop_550x550.jpg","width":550,"height":550}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":231647,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]},{"id":9609573,"name":"RADIOHEAD REMIX PACK ( Feral + Morning Mr. Magpie 2x12\" Set!)","permalink":"radiohead-remix-pack-feral-morning-mr-magpie-2x12-set","position":50,"price":16.0,"default_price":16.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/radiohead-remix-pack-feral-morning-mr-magpie-2x12-set","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-24T01:32:13.000Z","description":"Here are some descriptions written about these remix records which we are shipping as a set! \r\n\r\nLone, Pearson Sound and Four Tet come correct for a third Radiohead remix session sprung from 'The King Of Limbs'. Frontside Lone remixes 'Feral' as a humid simulation of hybrid Funky/Techno drums with a cascading waterfall breakdown and pharmaceutically synthesized vibes all the way. Heading further out, Pearson Sound's Scavenger remix of 'Morning Mr Magpie' spreads out the intro of pastoral, glistening synth washes and tentative subs before balling into futurist FunkyXFootwork mechanics. Most impressive, however is Four Tet's 'Separator' remix, gliding Thom Yorke over warm and woozy synth convections and shuffled Drag rhythms. Smart. Then we have two highly accomplished Nathan Fake and Mark Pritchard reworks of tracks from 'The King Of Limbs'. A-side we catch Nathan Fake on a swinging revision of 'Morning Mr Magpie', transposing vocal elements of the original into a feathered 2-step framework buoyed by rich subbass amidst a slow swirling cloud of tingling, slightly dissonant harmonics. B-side you're in for a treat with not one, but two Mark Pritchard remixes of 'Bloom'. Working as Harmonic 313, we're privy to a staggering mesh of fluid slowfast rhythms fluctuating somewhere between Juke and Dubstep, while epic synth washes arc overhead and Thom is turned into a chorus of alien cadence. It's honestly jaw-dropping stuff, and almost a million miles from the urgent version under his own name, taking the same track in the opposite direction down a one-way tunnel of Industrial Krautrock electronics closer to Factory Floor or Chris Carter.","options":[{"id":30064703,"name":"Default","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":16.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94427159/-/R-2990961-1313425764.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94427159/-/R-2990961-1313425764.jpg","width":400,"height":411},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94427183/-/R-3017820-1314274639.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94427183/-/R-3017820-1314274639.jpg","width":600,"height":609}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":232758,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"}]},{"id":8651709,"name":"Isis- Temporal 3xLP + DVD","permalink":"isis-temporal-3xlp-dvd","position":51,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/isis-temporal-3xlp-dvd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-21T23:14:03.000Z","description":"ISIS and Ipecad Recordings present Temporal, a 3LP/DVD retrospective collection of unreleased rarities, remixes and videos!

But the past isn't a place that Daniel Lopatin ever seems to easily position in his music when he works under his Oneohtrix Point Never guise (his other projects are a different story). He may use it as a reference point, as with his emulation of the vintage Fairlight cut-ups favored by the Art of Noise included on last year's Replica, but OPN's material mostly feels like a slow, untethered drift into a tentative future. Music For Reliquary House, his half of this split LP with fellow celebrator of change and lover of pseudonyms Jeff Witscher, aka Rene Hell, is taken from an installation/performance piece conducted by Lopatin and video artist Nate Boyce. It's coarse and challenging, a serrated edge severed into a once-placid template. Hell picks up the thread with his side, In 1980 I Was a Blue Square, which begins in conflict and ends in a form of serene resolution. \r\n\r\nMusic For Reliquary House is a logical extension of the path traveled by Replica, and it pushes those ideas to extremes. A noise resembling a circular saw slashing through metal punctures the \"Stone of Spiritual Understanding\", while high-pitched frequencies reminiscent of Aphex Twin's piercing \"Ventolin\" make \"Free Ride\" a genuinely distressing listen. \"The Letter\" sounds like Lopatin's hard drive attempting to turn itself inside out, edging close to the collapse-of-civilization vibe of \"Nil Admirari\" from Returnal. This resembles a staging area in which new OPN ideas may be tested out rather than a potential future direction, but that doesn't invalidate the material. The first half of the wonderful \"Midday\" feels like someone just opened up a box full of manic chatter, letting it flood out into the world in a burst of expression before a familiar wave of ambience ties it down to a loose structure.\r\n\r\nStructure is something Rene Hell brings once the baton is passed. A looped piano roll opens his side, living up to his promise of making something partially influenced by \"mid 20th century classical music.\" Bursts of willful antagonism zoom into sporadic focus throughout In 1980 I Was a Blue Square, neatly tying it to what came before. A festering glitch rises up around those piano rolls on \"Meta Concrete\"; \"The Bridge\" veers close to complete disintegration. But Hell's central role, in the unlikely event that these two artists mapped this out conceptually, is to provide a dose of introspection following the ragged disemboweling provided by OPN. \"Qi\" is a doleful elegy stretched out over six minutes, forming one part oppressive death march, one part tilt up toward the sky. That's indicative of Hell's work here, providing a big mesh of emotional and stylistic contrasts, helping add to the general feel of being pushed and pulled in multiple directions at the same time.\r\n\r\nLopatin says his material on Music For Reliquary House is \"a series of hallucinatory informatic assaults\" inspired by the modernist sculptures of David Smith, Anthony Caro, Isamu Noguchi, and Tony Smith. It's reminiscent of Stereolab's 1995 collaboration with artist Charles Long, Music For the Amorphous Body Study Center. It's a similar musical digression, pulling on fibers of already extant ideas, taking them to a place ill-suited to the traditional album format. So it's appropriate that Lopatin decided to release it this way, re-tooling the tracks following a multimedia performance of his work with Boyce at the MoMA in December last year, then gelling them with the work of another artist similarly active in underground circles. For Lopatin and Hell, it purposefully muddies the intent behind work that already leaves a wildly disorienting imprint, that accrues an unusual type of weight by positioning outright hostility right on top of humor, anger, and tranquility.\r\n","options":[{"id":23482399,"name":"Default","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":22.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72890187/-/homepage_large.5a828e2c.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72890187/-/homepage_large.5a828e2c.jpg","width":317,"height":319}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":231647,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]},{"id":6700431,"name":"Chelsea Wolfe - Unknown Rooms LP","permalink":"hoax-sewn-leather-split-flexi-7","position":56,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/hoax-sewn-leather-split-flexi-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-14T23:09:39.000Z","description":"On her acoustic record Unknown Rooms, Chelsea Wolfe allows a few sunrays to poke into the lightless sepulchre she built on 2011's Apokalypsis. That record, with its gothic, bloodstained imagery and bleak post-punk guitars, carried all the warmth of a medieval hex: It opened with a gurgling, feral scream that sounded like something peeling off your skin with its incisors. Wolfe's vocals channeled PJ Harvey in full Rid of Me \"lick my injuries\" mode, and earlier she'd released a cover of the cheery Burzum number \"Black Spell of Destruction\". It spooked a lot of people to attention.\r\n\r\nUnknown Rooms, as she told Brandon Stosuy recently, was her attempt to connect to her \"folk roots,\" citing a love of Townes Van Zandt and Hank Williams. But this isn't exactly her campfire record, unless that campfire is surrounded by plague and marauders: Wolfe has kept the kernel of eerie blankness and premonition even as she tones down the vampy theatrics.  Ironically, she digs even deeper into your skin than before. Sometimes a lullabye can freak you out even more than a midnight horror flick.\r\n\r\nHer voice, in these wide-open arrangements, emerges as stunning: Her whispered, wispy high notes on \"The Way We Used To\" and \"Spinning Centers\" are lovely and convey unsettling frailty, like a hurt creature lurking in a corner that you aren't sure you should touch. The imagery isn't accidentally chosen: Wolfe seems powerfully drawn to vulnerability-- hers, yours, ours-- and she finds multiple ways to make you taste this unease. One of those is to make herself sound weak, trembling: She floats tiny, wordless harmonies in the background on \"Spinning Centers\", multi-tracking her close-mic'd voice into a pale, enervated choir. Around her, bowed string harmonics sigh dryly, drawing her further out of her body into the surrounding ether.\r\n\r\nThe songs themselves are stark, still, often nothing more two open chords strummed in common time. Surrounding them are a violin or two, muted horns, and acres of the white space. In their fidgety stasis, the songs capture some of the poetic nervousness of early Cat Power: When Wolfe whispers \"Boyfriend, be careful if you can,\" on \"Boyfriend\", drawing the word \"boyfriend\" haltingly, like an extraterrestrial voicing its first English word, I was reminded of Marshall's \"Nude as the News\", where news of a pregnancy is delivered as end-times prophecy: \"I've got a son in me/ And he's related to you/ He is waiting to meet you/ He is dying to meet you.\" Wolfe's Unknown Rooms contain some of the same mundane menace, and it's a refreshing reminder of the horror to be mined from the good old boring everyday world.\r\n\r\nUnknown Rooms is a short album, but its nine songs capture and sustain free-floating fear and menace. And even a few pockets of tenderness: On the quietly expansive \"Flatlands\", over two-finger-picked chords, Wolfe sings, \"I never cared about anything you ever owned/ I want flatlands, I want simplicity/ I need your arms wrapped hard around me.\" On closing track \"Sunstorm\", Wolfe pounds two major chords on piano with brittle force, crooning, \"I remember/ everything you said,\" until she dissolves. Unknown Rooms might be a stylistic sidestep for Wolfe, a dalliance with a simpler set-up, before she plunges back into the icy black again. But even if she goes full-on Carrie-at-the-prom next, it seems likely she'll only continue to gather force.\r\n\r\n(Pitchfork)","options":[{"id":21305709,"name":"Vinyl","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":22.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75310212/-/homepage_large.4a8066b2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75310212/-/homepage_large.4a8066b2.jpg","width":319,"height":319}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":231647,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]},{"id":6408995,"name":"Vacation T-Shirt","permalink":"vacation-t-shirt","position":57,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/vacation-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-10T00:41:38.000Z","description":"BACK IN STOCK...all sizes!

Hazlewood had moved there to lay low and to help his son avoid the draft, but wound up finding happiness and creative freedom. Many of the albums recorded in Sweden made their way no further than Scandinavia, but of them all, A House Safe For Tigers is the holy grail for collectors, often changing hands for hundreds of dollars. Originally only available in Sweden, this marks the first time Tigers has been reissued and available the world over. The movie was a “semi-documentary” featuring Hazlewood and his friend Axelman, looking back to childhood and contemplating the meaning of life. In it, Hazlewood runs a marathon, tells anecdotes about a bum who cured his stutter and convinces a group of Swedish children to take sides against Richard Nixon. “It’s strange, very strange,” Hazlewood said, “But we meant it to be strange.” It’s not necessary to see A House Safe For Tigers to enjoy the soundtrack, of course. Despite the fact that it was never released outside of Sweden, the music’s hallowed reputation - cultivated in the intervening decades by the privileged few who were able to hear it - is testament to the strength of its material. The album finds Hazlewood contentedly immersing himself in Swedish life, serenading Gotland, the island Hazlewood fell in love with during the shooting of the television movie Cowboy in Sweden and where he spent time filming Tigers. Highlights include “The Nights,” in which Lee conjures up an epic tale of love and genocide that draws on his Native American blood running, “Our Little Boy Blue,” a magical, sleepy lullaby, and the two versions of the stirring, cinematic “Souls Island” frame the album; within them is held the blueprint for Richard Hawley’s solo career.

Theirs is music of a truly relentless, cold and unforgiving nature, one which offers little or nothing in the way of relief or comforting melody. Though their albums are often punctuated by stretches of near silence or hushed ambience set between walls of frenzied blast and pummeling churn, these lulls serve to bolster the threatening whole in their absence of recognizable musical footholds. The winding paths laid by their music may be lightless, but the journey down them is one well worth taking.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdonkermaan is the third installment of a trilogy that began with 2007's Krach, and delves further into the churning cosmos as mapped out by its predecessors. Opener \"Vuur - the Deathwind of Resurrection\" serves as a devastating introduction to the album, replete with scalding washes of caustic guitars, and a howling backdrop that threatens a continual consumption of the foreground without ever fully taking over. Downshifting in tempo, but not in intensity \"Spiral - The Taileater\" brings the\r\nlistener fully into the shadowy fold, with a hypnotic combination of cascading single note bends and insistent low end throb. From this peak of maximal force, through the dizzying cycle that closes out the album, many lines are cast into the pitch, but all remain firmly tethered to a dark hearted center. It's precisely this ability to transverse a multifaceted terrain without ever losing course that give the album its undeniable potency and obsidian allure.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering Verdonkermaan unto itself, as well as the trilogy of which it belongs, it's readily apparent that Nihill have established themselves fully and firmly with these stark and ferocious musical proclamations. While their efforts are clearly built on the foundational pillars erected by the early founders of the genre, they have added their own singular and acidic tongue to the modern lexicon of black metal. Though self imposed obscurity is the proud badge of many who've tread this particular realm of sound, the existence of Nihill and their freshly completed trilogy should not be overlooked by those who seek to stare longingly into heart of darkness.","options":[{"id":21819251,"name":"w/CD!","price":26.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":22.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67535501/-/Nihill-Verdonkermaan.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67535501/-/Nihill-Verdonkermaan.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":231647,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]},{"id":7509525,"name":"ÆGES - Southern Comfort 7\"","permalink":"ges-southern-comfort-7","position":62,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ges-southern-comfort-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-10T22:47:06.000Z","description":"This 7\" features a remastered version of the ripper Southern Comfort from The Bridge, and the previously unreleased B-side, Stars.

It's a darkly thrilling piece of music, full of quiet dangers and the possibilities of the night-time as they chant, \"Antennas resonating, wilderness waiting for you\". 'Solar Nights & Rainwater' creaks like wooden beams on an abandoned log-cabin as a lonesome piano and distant ethereal harmonies conjure up a rather beautiful sonic collage. As you may have picked up, Alice is very much a record for late at night (although I'm listening to it in the baking sun and it still sounds ace).\r\n\r\n'Huthering Whites' (geddit!?) borrows the twinkling piano from Kate Bush's 'Wuthering Heights' and adds violins and a distant echoing production to stunning effect. It winds up what might well just be one of the finest records I've heard this year. As with most of the Latitudes Sessions, it's fairly short and fairly limited but Alice is well worth your time. Just under 20 minutes of music which recalls but never directly imitates Robert Wyatt, Brian Eno, The Beta Band and Kate Bush.

But, Attention Please is more like a complete redefining of their potential in several ways. First and foremost, it is the first album on which all vocals are sung by lead guitarist, Wata. While she has previously sung on a couple of songs for singles and her own solo recordings, the entire 10-song album features her intimate, multifaceted vocal style. Secondly, the songs on Attention Please have a sultry, intoxicating catchiness to them. It's melodic without sounding pop. It's psychedelic without sounding dated.
