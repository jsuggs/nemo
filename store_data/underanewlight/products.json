The backside features a painted image symbolizing the AZTEC architecture.\r\n\r\nThis piece can be worn on those special or spiritual days and in these special occasions where you will look like an INCA princess!\r\n\r\nTriangles, circles and lines are everywhere, geometry is always there to influence my pieces.\r\n\r\nThis necklace consists in a 100% hand-cut recycled leather with a diameter of 3 1/4\" which is folded onto itself to get these semi circular sides. On the front side, I put three solid vintage brass pieces and painted the back side.\r\n\r\nTo give it an even more Native look, I added a vintage snake chain and the same wave black seed beads with some brass tubes.\r\n\r\nThe whole pendant is hanging on a beautiful vintage chain ornamented with beads and brass tubes.\r\n\r\nIt makes it a truly unique piece.\r\n\r\n{d i m e n s i o n s}\r\nTotal length 27\" (including the chain + the beads +brass)\r\nDiameter of the leather 3 1/4\"\r\nHanging last seed beads 3 1/2\"\r\nHanging last vintage chain 7 1/2\"\r\n\r\nNote: \r\nFor orders to be sent directly as a present with a personalized note, please contact me.
