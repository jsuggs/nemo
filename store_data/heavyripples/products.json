In other words; your ears won't make it without Alonzo! \r\n\r\nBesides November these dudes are also comparable to bands like Truth and Janey, Sir Lord Baltimore, Stone Axe, Horisont, Mamont and Mangrove.

While the likes of Autopsy, Cannibal Corpse, and Repulsion can only wish their output is the soundtrack to serial killings and zombie outbreaks, The Nightmare Becomes Reality is what Argento and Fulci’s rotting corpses would be spinning at Sunday brunch. Whereas many bands use samples, stolen bits, or other tired clichés to create a “scary” atmosphere, this Swedish quartet creates a short horror film with each song.\r\n\r\nAfter a short intro, “Corridor Of Blood” sets the tone for the rest of the album. Synths, Hammond organs, acoustic guitars, and Mellotrons swirl within a complementary prog-rock backbeat. Not only does Anima Morte have a strong understanding of cinematic themes and orchestration, they also rock hard. Check out the off-time Neil Peart drums on “The Revenant” or the Pink-Floyd-on-speed eeriness of “Passage Of Darkness”. The title track is the strongest: a soundtrack for the bleak world inherited by survivors of a horrible apocalypse. “Things To Come” condenses an entire film’s score into one 8-minute suite; solid riffs punctuated by ELP/Golden Earring note-bends ease seamlessly into an orchestral witches brew of piano runs and an honest to goodness Steely Dan breakdown.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, “reboot” wasn’t a word and nobody made fake blood with computers. Heavy metal and horror movies have gone hand in hand since the very beginning; it’s no surprise death/doom titans Hooded Menace tapped Anima Morte for a split (covering each other’s songs) last year.

Not overly distorted guitars, a very ambient and dynamic sound very similar to the good old days. Props to Jocke Frisö for his mix. The singer also sounds very authentic, and reminds me a bit of Spice of Band Of Spice/Spiritual Beggars. Listening to the songs, there’s no doubt these guys have been breastfed liquid vinyl and given nothing but analogue toys. The songs give me no reason to complain either. This is really good stuff! When I read the final track was named Dancing Madly Backwards I was of course 100 % certain this was a cover, showing where they got the name from. Wrong was I. The band had written their own Dancing Madly Backwards. Hmm… I’m a little bit split here. For us fans of early seventies hard rock, it’s like penning your own song and name it Smoke On The Water or Stairway To Heaven. Confusing. Still, it’s a great track so I won’t complain.

One minute they might be playing a blues rock piece that feels as though the instrumentalists listened to a ton of ZZ Top while the next they are playing really heavy, slow riffs that are doom inspired. However, despite the fact that the band goes off in so many different directions it never sounds as though they are spreading themselves too thin as each track is well written and features some guitar riffs that really grab your attention. There are plenty of different directions that these guys could take their music in, but it seems likely that whichever way they choose to go will work.\" -- Cosmos Gaming","options":[{"id":39784488,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.5,"amount_with_others":6.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121664691/-/a3067630117_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121664691/-/a3067630117_2.jpg","width":350,"height":350}],"artists":[{"id":220392,"name":"Castero","permalink":"castero","url":"/artist/castero"}],"categories":[{"id":4546505,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":15530541,"name":"Černá: Restoring Life Digipak CD","permalink":"cerna-restoring-life-digipak-cd","position":37,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cerna-restoring-life-digipak-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-13T03:31:53.000Z","description":"Track Listing:\r\n\r\n    Woken In Prague\r\n    Společně Part I : Shy Sun\r\n    Společně Part II : Laying Down In The Rain\r\n    Společně Part III : Night Sounds\r\n    Společně Part IV : Embrace The Stars\r\n    Společně Part V : Lullaby\r\n    Restoring Life (Bonus)\r\n    Isa (Bonus)\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1813448743/size=medium/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://domesticgenocide.bandcamp.com/album/restoring-life\">Restoring Life by Černá</a></iframe>","options":[{"id":50504925,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.5,"amount_with_others":6.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129317358/-/dgr-cd-009.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129317358/-/dgr-cd-009.jpg","width":150,"height":150}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4546505,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":14566062,"name":"Chillihounds - Shake Your Skull CD","permalink":"chillihounds-shake-your-skull-cd","position":38,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/chillihounds-shake-your-skull-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-02T01:30:59.000Z","description":"Transubstans Label!\r\n\r\n\"we're talking blues based hard rock, with more than a touch of boogie in expression. AC/DC is a common association throughout, but in a manner that see the aggressive tendencies of this fine band from down under replaced with the laid back sound and arrangements of a band like Status Quo. Dirty Deeds All Over the World if you like. But rather than staying put within that one-dimensional sound, Chillihounds also add a touch of additional blues to the proceedings, in a Southern manner as on the lightly Allman Brothers tinged Evil Mind Blues or in a Texan-oriented manner like the subtly ZZ Top flavoured Control. The carefully blues enhanced details actually adds something of a US touch to the album throughout, even when the band does explore songs that AC/DC in particular could have added to their set list without anyone raising an eyebrow.\"  -- Musical Musings and Opinions\r\n\r\n\"\"Shake Your Skull\" is classic rock for a new generation. Even though the foundation lies steadily upon the heaviness of Black Sabbath and the riffing rampage is similar to early AC/DC, what makes this ten track onslaught unforgettable is the sonically in-yer-face production. To top it all of, the soaring vocals sounds like they belong to the long lost twin brother of Glenn Danzig or Ian Astbury (The Cult), making this a must hear for a new generation of riff loving fans. Even though the focus is set on the crunching sheer power of hard rock, a song like \"Evil Mind Blues\" pays respect to the laid back feel of southern rock, while the pumping groove of \"Heartbeater\" is music made for filling dance floors around the world. Nevertheless, what makes \"Shake Your Skull\" stand out in a crowd is because its filled to the brim with unforgettable choruses you can clench your fist and sing along to.\"\r\n","options":[{"id":47171100,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.5,"amount_with_others":6.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126861912/-/I00361960.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126861912/-/I00361960.jpg","width":180,"height":180}],"artists":[{"id":245655,"name":"Chillihounds","permalink":"chillihounds","url":"/artist/chillihounds"}],"categories":[{"id":4546505,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":15482403,"name":"Chron Goblin -  Life of the Living LP","permalink":"chron-goblin-life-of-the-living-lp","position":39,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/chron-goblin-life-of-the-living-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-11T04:39:37.000Z","description":"\"In essence, this is a hard rock band.

Even with the dirty vocals of Matt Harrington that are being spat out of the speakers, the band still unleash some infectious melody lines and even the guitar fuzz has a catchy appeal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cortez seem to be able to find that middle ground between classic 70's rock, no-holds barred stoner-metal, doom and grunge while not sounding too derivative of any of these styles.\"\r\nDoomantia\r\n","options":[{"id":44622996,"name":"Default","price":11.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.5,"amount_with_others":6.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125140902/-/Cortez-ST.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125140902/-/Cortez-ST.jpg","width":160,"height":160}],"artists":[{"id":235941,"name":"Cortez","permalink":"cortez","url":"/artist/cortez"}],"categories":[{"id":4546505,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":14567121,"name":"The Crystal Caravan - With Them You Walk Alone CD","permalink":"the-crystal-caravan-with-them-you-walk-alone-cd","position":48,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-crystal-caravan-with-them-you-walk-alone-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-02T02:53:32.000Z","description":"Transubstans Label!\r\n\r\n\"Our friends over at Transubstans Records have once again produced another solid entry in the retro sweepstakes with the latest from Swedish band The Crystal Caravan, titled With Them You Walk Alone.\r\n\r\nThis six-piece band show their love for Uriah Heep, Deep Purple, The Doors, Danzig, Steppenwolf, and Atomic Rooster on this latest release, which is a dramatic platter of heavy guitar riffs, powerful vocals, driving keyboards, and memorable arrangements.\r\n\r\nVocalist Niklas “RG” Gustafsson soars over most of the heavy rocking songs here with his Jim Morrison-meets-Glenn Danzig approach, as he powers through the crunchy riffs, haunting Mellotron, and spacey Moog synths of the crushing, somewhat psychedelic title track, the hard rocking ‘Hour of the Wolf’, as well as the more textured, prog / folk / psych piece ‘Against The Rising Tide.’\r\n\r\nThe bleak, almost doom laden ‘Roses And Morphine’ has elements of The Doors and The Jefferson Airplane, until massive, Black Sabbath inspired riffing joins in on the fun, while the heavy rock freakout of ‘Brick By Brick’ will instantly appeal to fans of fellow Swedes Witchcraft with its mix of ’70s styled hard rock and Sabbath / Pentagram inspired doom.\" -- Sea of Tranquility","options":[{"id":47174346,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.5,"amount_with_others":6.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126864342/-/The-Crystal-Caravan-With-Them-You-Walk-Alone-300x300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126864342/-/The-Crystal-Caravan-With-Them-You-Walk-Alone-300x300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":245709,"name":"The Crystal Caravan","permalink":"the-crystal-caravan","url":"/artist/the-crystal-caravan"}],"categories":[{"id":4546505,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":15630090,"name":"Cultura Tres - El Mal Del Bien","permalink":"cultura-tres-el-mal-del-bien","position":49,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cultura-tres-el-mal-del-bien","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-18T04:57:27.000Z","description":"Cultura Tres is a Venezuelan sludge band.

Its energy is born of both the band’s youth and their beginning the process of sorting out their sound, but its energy is infectious most of all, and as guitarist/vocalist Justin Toland, bassist Thomas Storz and drummer Andrew Denham lay down classic-styled boogie and heavy rock – Grand Funk, Humble Pie, but most of all, Blue Cheer – they present their homage with an air of freshness that can’t be faked.

Their sound is hard '70s southern rock. Vocalist Justin Toland has a voice that reminds me of a mix between Leslie West (Mountain), Burton Cummings (The Guess Who), and to a point, Sam Velde (Night Horse). The vocals are certainly a strong point. They’re very soulful and full of energy and give Movements that extra element that can make or break an album. In this case it certainly makes it. Vocals aren’t everything though. The instruments are just as strong. Justin’s guitar is just as equally good, bassist Thomas Storz certainly can kick it with the best as you can hear some pretty mean riffs and the beat gets stuck in your head. Andrew Denham’s drums sound basic but they certainly get the job done without all the extra pizazz that some bands go for. \" -- The Soda Shop\r\n","options":[{"id":44187252,"name":"Default","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":19.5,"amount_with_others":9.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124810878/-/thedirtystreetscover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124810878/-/thedirtystreetscover.jpg","width":1747,"height":1518}],"artists":[{"id":235932,"name":"The Dirty Streets","permalink":"the-dirty-streets","url":"/artist/the-dirty-streets"}],"categories":[{"id":5705397,"name":"12\" Vinyl","permalink":"12-vinyl","url":"/category/12-vinyl"}]},{"id":14565996,"name":"Dodaren - Maen CD","permalink":"dodaren-maen-cd","position":61,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dodaren-maen-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-02T01:25:18.000Z","description":"Transubstans Label!\r\n\r\n\"DÖDAREN was formed late 2010 by four devoted musicians in Gothenburg, Sweden.

I discovered them back in 2010 and loved their brand of high quality catchy heavy hardrock in the vein of Black Sabbath and Grand Funk Railroad. Their Heavy yet clear sound comes from the fact that the guys use Fender amps instead of the 70's retro norm: Marshall or similar. This album is a work of talent and originality unlike any of those other 70's inspired bands outthere who seem to focus more (read : entirely) on clothing, nice retro guitars and amps than the most important thing: good songwriting. Ett Rop På Hjälp ( A Call For Help) like their fellow westcoast SWE psych /hardrock bands Centralstödet and A Sense Of Blue Cream focus on original personality filled songwriting and basically toss the posing aspect entirely. Because these bands ignore image and focus on songwriting they don't get the limelight like say, lesser SWE bands like say Graveyard or that Dungen for instance, bands which are in my opinion overrated at best.\r\n\r\nThis album is a very solid debut and each song contains lots of great riffs and tasteful ideas from downright Heavy cruncher riffs to suttle psychedelic moves combined with tasteful execution from the individual musicians.

Way fuzzed out riffs come from all angles and merge into one TCA haze of burning intensity.\r\n\r\nI'd easily put these guys up on the same shelf of the other leaders of stoner riffery from the undergound, like Borracho.  Not as much dynamic shifting as SuperGiant, not nearly as much modern metal influence as Snail, and not not as bluesy as Hong Faux, Firelord like their stoner rock straight up, Sabbath-inspired and growled out with honesty and ferocity.

The band, down to the duo of guitarist/vocalist/bassist Ian Gerber and drummer/vocalist/guitarist Jeff Kaleth from their original trio incarnation — bassist Scott Gilkey plays on the first half of the album — elicit a strikingly organic, jammed sensibility, resulting in a full-album flow that’s unmistakably aware of European heavy psychedelia but hardly at all reaching for it sonically, instead weaving into and around American-style riff rock with understated finesse, here a Clutch groove, there an organ-laced tribute to Neil Young that sounds more like Mark Lanegan, at least in terms of the vocals. \r\n\r\nThe Heavy Co. remain underproduced, but what’s encouraging about that in terms of the manageable 37-minute stretch of Midwest Electric is they turn that roughness into a part of their aesthetic, so that the opening push of “The Humboldt County Waltz” comes across with a garage sensibility, like a less urban The Brought Low underscored by a steady rumble of stoner-rocking low end, indicative perhaps of some of the sonic shifts to come as the songs play out. They never quite touch on Americana, and they never quite touch on retro ’70s rock, but there are pieces of both brought into the melting-pot-stew of their sound. -- The Obelisk","options":[{"id":40268703,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.5,"amount_with_others":6.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122000469/-/the-heavy-co.-midwest-electric.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122000469/-/the-heavy-co.-midwest-electric.png","width":960,"height":960}],"artists":[{"id":221904,"name":"The Heavy Co","permalink":"the-heavy-co","url":"/artist/the-heavy-co"}],"categories":[{"id":4546505,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":13772943,"name":"The Heavy Eyes - Maera CD","permalink":"the-heavy-eyes-maera-cd","position":84,"price":11.5,"default_price":11.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-heavy-eyes-maera-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-25T02:07:52.000Z","description":"\"Now from beginning to end, Maera is either a bluesy take on psychedelic rock or a psychedelic take on the blues, depending on your perspective.

Limited run of 300 on Glow in the Dark Vinyl!\r\n\r\nEvery time I hear this, I like it a little bit more.  Looking at the guys, you wouldn't know what to expect.   Check out the photos on the back, you'd think the local trailer park got overturned by a tornado and resurrected the muck hiding under the local rocks in Memphis.  And that muck formed a band.  On top of that, lead-singer/guitarist Severin Allgood (yes . . .I love his name) has the appearance of a lost Hanson Brother; the one who never made the hockey team.  But then they start playing and, holy fuck, all notions go out the window. Forget appearances.  These guys flat out rock!  \"Wine Witch\" is full on Motorhead fueled, punk-snot nosed, Angelwitch sputum NWOBHM.  Guitars flare and wind and undulate and it's all so . . . .fucking good.   There's a stoner vibe to the guitar tone, but all amped up as if the bong got filled with meth not water.  And best of all, the band just don't take themselves seriously.  I mean, come on.  Wine Witch?  666?   It's that tongue in cheek humor that just makes the damn thing so special.  \"Yellow Fever\" rocks with just as much abandon.\r\n\r\nThe heavy scene needs a band like this.  One that doesn't get lost up their own tattooed ass.  No pictures of wax dripping down skulls and burning embers. Just pure, unadulterated metallic haze.   I heard these guys are one of the most raucous acts in Memphis.  I don't doubt that for a second.\r\n\r\nHanson Brothers of metal.  Who'd a thunk it?

So much so, that I immediately asked the crazy lads to contribute to our free compilation album, The Ripple Effect Presents: Volume One - Head Music.  (go check it out, it's still free.)  I was immediately caught up in their trashy brand of post-NWOBHM madness and chunky humor.  Still, the question remained, could they do it again?   As \"Snorlokk\" the side A of this limited-to-300 hand-numbered 7\" spins on my turntable, the answer is \"hell freaking yes!\"\r\n\r\nStill as irrelevant and madcap as ever, Hosoi Bros bring it on thrashy and punky, still with that backbone of NWOBHM riffing.  I don't know what \"Snorlokk\"is about. Probably another addition to the band's growing pantheon of mythical characters like the Wine Witch.  But I don't care.  All I know is that it's a blitzkrieg assault to my frontal lobe of good, smashing fun.  B-side \"Amberlamps\" builds upon the impressive riffing with an even heavier, infused-with-hardcore, attack of metal that just refuses to take itself too seriously.  In the end, what the Hosoi Bros are about is great metallic riffing and good fun.  Isn't that what you want?\r\n\r\nAnother great addition to the bands growing discography.

The song reminds me a bit of “Cypress Groove.” The song “Book of Promise” is a lot mellower and slower tempo with a somewhat faster guitar solo to close the song. “Light Bender” is a cool instrumental song. “Dying Working Man” is a funky upbeat song with some catchy lyrics and my favorite song on the album.\r\n\r\nThe Clutch comparisons will always be there. The band did open up for The Bakerton Group before. J.P. Gastor (Clutch drmmer) did record a Live Session for Kingsnake a few years back and they even thank J.P. in the linear notes on the album.

Absence Of Light has that kind of rare creative musical momentum and infinite replay factor that Jug Fulla Sun has.  \r\n\r\nAbsence… is an incredibly enjoyable, reflective and rocking album, especially if you’re a fan of the MD/DC sound. Most of the material is mid-to upper tempo (with the notable exception of the paint-peeling, riff-o-rama “Below Zero”) interspersed with a couple of brief instrumentals. “Ly Loa” is an amazing groove-laden instrumental but I gotta tell you, it really does sound like a Spirit Caravan song. It’s a keeper, you’ll love the guitar work. “Some Might Grow” is a beautiful acoustic piece.  “Emblem” is a great choice as an up-tempo opener and sets the tone for the rest of the record both musically and thematically. “Portcullis” is equally compelling, showcasing not only Sarnie’s guitar work, but the Markowitz/Davis rhythm team for a steaming-hot midsection. “Tools Of The New Church” has the makings of a Leather Nun live must-have and would fit nicely in the set list after blowing the doors off with “Below Zero” – it has a serious tenor that would ground the audience after the adrenaline rush, features a fantastic riff and poignant message especially relevant to this day in age. \r\n\r\nThe hidden gem, the track that I fear will get overlooked is “Final Resting Ritual”. Man oh manishevitz, what a beautifully melancholic track this is, featuring some great acoustic work by Sarnie and a prime example of how this band can come together, play as one, and really make some musical magic. \" -Hellride","options":[{"id":40486812,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.5,"amount_with_others":6.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122167689/-/3785bca3b24af9ba45b03a968eeeb80d_29_LEATHER_NUN.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122167689/-/3785bca3b24af9ba45b03a968eeeb80d_29_LEATHER_NUN.jpg","width":940,"height":920}],"artists":[{"id":222699,"name":"Leather Nun America","permalink":"leather-nun-america","url":"/artist/leather-nun-america"}],"categories":[{"id":4546505,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":12723153,"name":"Leather Nun America - Kult Occult CD","permalink":"leather-nun-america-kult-occult-cd","position":99,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/leather-nun-america-kult-occult-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-01T21:20:09.000Z","description":"\"Without a doubt, this is their best album yet. What makes this album stand out as their best work to date is the diversity it presents. There is crushing doom riffage, quiet moments, and a great selection of mood changes. What seals the deal though is the kick-ass rocking moments that are backed up with some infectious melodies. Tracks like 'White Horse,' 'Murderkkult,' and 'Sacrosanct' tend to stand out as immediate favorites but the entire album is very good with no filler moments at all to be heard. There is tons of killer hooks and grooves but while this is sabbathian worship at its finest, there is also elements of grunge in there as well or at least that is what I hear. The tone of the guitars is incredibly dirty which is the first thing that will win you over followed by the irresistible riffs and the songs are mostly short, just three to five minutes so nothing ever drags. The beauty of this album is even the albums shortest track, 'Sacrosanct' is instantly memorable.\r\n\r\nIf you have heard all their influences before ( and I am sure you have) then you should know what this is going to sound like already, but the great guitar sound and the fine melodies makes it stand out on its own and that alone is worth the purchase price. There is not much more I can say about it; it won't win any prizes for originally but for infectious songs and killer riffs and sound, this album is almost flawless.

This quartet bends your mind with their sonic boom rythms. Thunder and lightning bring out heavy tunes of doom, insanity into psychedelia and stoner. The production has got a retro feeling, 70s rock had a revival during the latest twenty years, but what is it that makes a band stand out in today`s great variety of this kind of rock? Is it the encomprimising rawness of the psychedelia-based Sabbath riffs that once was written? Is it the vintage speakers, combined with pure analogue recording that the commercial scene lacks? Or is it just spelled MAMONT? Doom-based rock with heavy fuzzy elements. The result is a full-length album called `Passing Through The Mastery Door` MAMONT offers us compositions of very high caliber mixing heavy doom, psychedelic rock and stoner.

The style has always been cosmic, instrumental rock mixed with many other genres like dub and jazz.\r\n\r\nTheir self-named debut finally came out in 2012 on Record Heaven/Transubstans Records, a thrilling instrumental production resembling some OSC and Ozric Tentacles sentiment.

Mos Generator destroys planets.  At least they are doing their best on this one.  My proof is in their latest offering on the brand spanking new label Lay Bare Recordings started by the lovely Désirée Hanssen.  Mos Generator’s “In Concert” was captured at the\r\npeak of their tour opening for the legendary Saint Vitus on their last European tour and damn, they sound great.  From the pentatonic warm up licks on the opening track Lumbo Rock to the crushing heavy stoner riffing of This Is The Gift of Nature, In Concert is the first live record that I have listened to that I have gotten excited about in quite awhile.\r\n\r\nThe show, and subsequent record are relentless.  Tony Reed and the gang blast through their 7 song set with the ever so admirable “More Rock, Less Talk” mentality.  Every song has some intro banter, but they quickly launch into the sonic destruction without so much as a stutter.   The band sounds on fire.  Shawn Johnson and Scooter Haslip provide a rumbling, crushing rhythm section that is magnificently in sync with Tony Reed’s forcefully melodic guitar acrobatics.  They are well rehearsed and off the cuff all at once.  Maybe the most impressive thing about In Concert is Tony’s singing voice.  Even on their studio records, there is a certain fragile quality to them...like an amplifier that is about to blow up...but the crack never comes.  It’s a powerful voice that never seems to be overblown (overblown vocals are my biggest pet peeve these days), even when he gives them a little extra gas to get to the note.  I’m telling you, this is a brilliant performance.  I wish I could have seen some of the shows from the tour in person.  I’m horrible at making musical predictions, but I’ll say this, Tony Reed and Mos Generator are making quite the name for themselves and this disc is an undeniable example of why that is.

With signed sticker included.\r\n\r\n\"The most stunning aspect of this album is how much musical growth there is since the last disc. The songs may be shorter, but they’re more focused and more concise. The musicianship shows brighter than on the self titled release through musical shadows and light, and the overall mood is less hazy. An excellent effort worthy of your hard earned dollars. Pick up Dreadnought \r\n\r\nWhat we’ve come to expect from Jeff is acoustic guitar driven brooding music, but from the opening strains of “Born Deranged” one gets the sense that there’s something strange afoot at the Circle K. It’s a bit . . . peppier? Nah. That can’t be it. Bare with me . . . we’ll figure this out together. The tune opens the disc with a Days of the New type guitar riff, all the while being surrounded by a distorted and droning bass line, humming Hammond organ, and Bonham-esque drumming. The tune isn’t so much brooding as much as rocking, but not just meathead rocking but prog-like rocking. A little surprising, but very much welcome. “Field of Grass” follows by trudging across dusty plains traversed by few before. That distorted bass carries the tune in a retro, fuzzed out way. A little psychedelic, but heavy in an Imogene kind of way. Jeff’s vocals take on a whole new quality unlike anything he had done on the self titled disc. Notably, that acoustic guitar isn’t ringing through and is replaced with an electric that has as much tone as you would find on any classic ‘70’s album. The guitar solos are fantastic, melodic adventures. “I Don’t Belong” has that classic acoustic strumming away and the melody is awash with Jeff’s crooning voice. But, it’s the piano work that separates this song from sounding one dimensional. \"\r\n\r\n--PopeJTE","options":[{"id":39523362,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.5,"amount_with_others":6.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121493433/-/dreadnought.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121493433/-/dreadnought.jpg","width":320,"height":320}],"artists":[{"id":219573,"name":"Mountain Mirrors","permalink":"mountain-mirrors","url":"/artist/mountain-mirrors"}],"categories":[{"id":4546505,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":14565891,"name":"My Brother the Wind - Twilight in the Crystal Cabinet CD","permalink":"my-brother-the-wind-twilight-in-the-crystal-cabinet-cd","position":118,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/my-brother-the-wind-twilight-in-the-crystal-cabinet-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-02T01:18:32.000Z","description":"Transubstans Label!\r\n\r\n\"Feat members of MAKAJODAMA, MAGNOLIA and ANEKDOTEN.

It's not all old-school hippie rock worship though, Noctum have large doses of the N.W.O.B.H.M in their sound, especially bands like Diamond Head and Witchfinder General. The 70's angle that they project so wonderfully well comes in the form of the style originally created by Black Widow, Coven, early Pentagram and of course Black Sabbath. I could rant and rave about this album forever.

Their unique sound is deeply rooted in early-70's UK progressive- & art-rock, blend with a heavy psychedelic touch and a dose of stoner-rock power. People say that they sound a bit like Soft Machine meets Alex Harvey Band meets Gentle Giant meets November. But this would be too easy for to define this band's rich and varied sound, because all in all they sound like QOPH! This means marvellous vocal harmonies and dual-guitar virtuosity climbing to acrobatic hights, trippy electronical effects with Moog and Theremin, floating Mellotron here and bluesy riffing there.

The project consists of former and present members of well known underground bands as Artery, Brothers in Blood and Ebanizm. The debut release of the band is produced and recorded by the independent American producer Joey Z, the owner of Method of Groove Productions and guitarist of the legendary Life Of Agony and Carnivore. It delivers uncompromising sound ranging from fuzzy doom, stoner, southern metal to even some hardcore and heavy gothic grooves. Their music is heavily influenced by acts such as Cathedral, Kyuss, Alabama Thunderpussy, Type O Negative, The Cult. The record has few interesting guest appearances as Matt Lynch (Snail), Joey Z (Life Of Agony), Busty (Bustardolomey), Jonathan van der Haak (I-Reject) & more.

I was just run over by a riff! Sideburn really show they mean it when opening their new album with the tank-like riffing of Diamonds. What a kick in the nuts! Great feel of vintage Sabbath and a production that moves mountains. Can’t help thinking singer Jani Kataja reminds me a lot of former The Quill singer Magnus, which is a really good thing indeed. Not your ordinary low tune vocalist, but more melodic and high register, which compliments the dead heavy riffing of songs like Fire And Water just perfect. Sideburn could easily be labeled a stoner band, but they are so much more. In some moments they remind me a bit of Spiritual Beggars, then there’s some good old Black Sabbath and in the slower and cooler number, Crossing The Lines they remind me of Swedish retro colleagues Siena Root. Tomorrow’s Dream is not a Black Sabbath cover, but ironically the intro reminds me a bit of Mob Rules. Awesome tune! Guitarist Morgan Zocek is a killer guitarist, actually with some hints of John Sykes in his vibrato. When the slow and concrete heavy riffing of The Last Day starts, Candlemass immediately comes to mind. This is doom at its finest. Next up, in Silverwing, they return to the slightly psychedelic vein of Siena Root, but with a touch of Grand Magus. This is really great stuff, I must say! Versatile, yet consistent, heavy, yet melodic. I really love the band’s sound in general, the vocals, the instrumental performances, the sound and the song material. I did like the band before, but this time all the boxes are ticked!

Eerie and psychedelic-tinged, their moniker of “haunted hard rockers” is apt as evidenced on their latest release, Please Don’t Die. The eight-track album highlights the band’s myriad influences ranging from Old World sentiment to Blues and Rock. The musical journey that ensues is edgy, dark and damn exciting.\r\n\r\n“The Blood Beyond” opens the album and plods along through the initial verse work with slight bent-note Blues guitar and Eli Hargrave channeling Morrison. But as the intermittent horn blasts and backing instrumentation carries the track, you get the feeling it’s building toward something. That something occurs with a full aural assault, as the track becomes a heavy agro track in both the static-y electric and Hargrave eschewing Morrison melody for Lane Staley-esque screams. “Disposable Televisions, Disposable Guns” again opens to solo Blues guitar notes and slight backing percussion. Unplugged plucks and electric wail join the cacophony before rasp vocals take the track helm. The dark air appears on this one continuing the eerie ethos of the album. The heaviness again joins as the demeanor of the track changes from down tempo to rocker. “Loose Kites in Harbor” features a bouncing opening bass line and intricate drum fill work and assumes the role of up tempo from the get go as the vocal wail and agro guitar join the fold through the time change before the guitar explosion solo at the midpoint. “Memory Lane Needs A Garbage Man” opens to chug guitar, Wurlitzer style organ and tin can vocal delivery. This one also blasts out of the gate and reveals the clever lyrical matter to match the equally inventive title selection. Hargrave again channels Staley near effortlessly, considering the unique voice and range that was the late Alice In Chains singer.

Stylistically when I refer to old-school hard-rock I’m referencing bands such as Blue Oyster Cult, Savoy Brown, Hawkwind, Chicken Shack, and Black Sabbath et al. Its guitar laced blues riffing that comes to the fore here, but that is then expanded upon with spacey synths and sax on the heavy moments and flute to soften things up a bit. It’s a driving momentum that’s created, pulsating through time and space. There are many musical change-ups that take the compositions in unexpected directions especially instrumentally. Vocals may take some getting used to, delivered in a flat almost monotone style that kept reminding me of Frank Zappa. After a couple listens it seems to fit. At times the heavier side of the band’s music does tend to overwhelm and the progressive influences are left by the wayside. Still they never fail to put something unusual around the next corner so hand in there.         \r\n\r\nIt’s a very unique sound – heavy space rock influenced by some progressive rock accoutrements.

For all of you newbie's out there SuperGiant has been laying down the rock for a few years now. With their debut EP back in 2006 and Antares in 2008 (both of which I hold in high regard), now the boys from New Mexico are back in 2011 with their 3rd installment in sonic ear cleansing with the aptly titled \"Pistol Star\".\r\n\r\nThe boys here haven't strayed much from the formula of their previous releases much, and why should they? If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right? What you get here is ballsy rock 'n roll, southern fried riffs a plenty with enough testosterone to impregnate any female willing to give it a listen.\r\n\r\nSome of the highlights that hit me right away are the tracks \"Emotion\" which comes out of the gate swinging, with a riff that reminds me a bit of Soundgarden's \"Jesus Christ Pose\" and has that same kind of intensity, incredibly cool stuff here. The AC/DC meets Led Zeppelin stomp of \"Rosey Posey\" and \"Mexican Radio\" which at first glance, I thought was going to be a cover of the old Wall of Voodoo song, but no, rather it's a barnstorming southern rocker with tons of attitude. Then we land on the final track, the title track, \"Pistol Star\", this song really shines, starts out spacey and chill, then crushes you with a wall of guitars, showing off Joel Rogers's haunting vocal ability at the same time. \"Pistol Star\" has it all, great musicians playing great music.

This hammer hits everything that moves, and i bet these champs eat vodka marinated nails for breakfast and wipe their asses with extra coarse sandpaper!\r\n\r\nOn the second release 'Antares' you get a brilliant concoction containing 14 well alternating rock acts.

Compared to the debut \"Beneath a dying sun\", it's more 70's oriented and not so much riff focused. On Subterfuge a great change is the Hammond organ that was fully integrated on the EP\"Sign here for nothing\". The organ tends to fit in really well and takes Thalamus the extra mile. Subterfuge has equal parts of midtempo songs, low tempo and hard stuff, which makes it a great listening record, never tending to get tiring or out of focus. The guitar work is more thoughtful and the solo parts, outstanding. What may differ the most from the debut, are the vocals, which are more mature, more developed and more dynamic. The album kicks off with a low tempo introduction with a Mississippi blues feel, \"Bring down Mary\" tends to spin off into a fast hard rock tune.\"When goblins cheer\" has a low tempo doom flavor to it, with a chorus that brings your mind to early Rainbow. \"Blind\" (the bands first single) takes you into Deep Purple mood. In all, Subterfuge has something for everyone's mind or mood. You get great ballads with rock flavor in songs like\"Here today, gone tomorrow\" and\"Through the fields\". You get your blues nerve satisfied in songs like\"I hope you understand\" and\"Shot to Hell\". With songs like \"Love is shining on the dead man\" you actually get a bit of a seventies/nineties alternative pop feel.

The band is comprised of former Sienna Root guitarist/singer Sartez, bassist Olle, and drummer Christian. From the opening notes of the heavy rock 'n' funk of \"Too Many Choices\", it's pretty clear that Three Seasons has a thing for MKIII era Deep Purple. Listen along to the rest of Life's Road, and with those clear Deep Purple influences you'll also hear a little Cream, Pink Floyd, Mountain, and even Govt Mule.\r\n\r\nSartez sounds like a cross between Glenn Hughes and Jack Bruce, easily heard on the bluesy stomp of \"Cold to the Bone\", and his distorted riffs & solos on \"Down to the Bottom\" recall the late, great Paul Kossoff. The epic 11-minute \"Each To Their Own\" provides the CDs proggy centerpiece, complete with swirling organ, layers of guitars, and powerful vocals. Some sizzling guitar and Hammond exchanges here which remind of vintage Deep Purple and even the Allman Brothers Band. You'll be taken back to Stormbringer on the down & dirty heavy rock/funk of \"Feel Alive\", a real groovy number with some fantastic wah-wah licks from Sartez, and the other lengthy epic \"An Endless Delusion\" is pure psychedelia, prog, and folk, complete with 70's styled keyboards, acoustic guitar, and ripping electric lead guitar. The second half of this piece reminded me a bit of early Kansas with its heavy guitar riffs and tasty organ passages. \"Since Our First Day\" is lumbering heavy rock in the tradition of Mountain or Grand Funk Railroad, and another treat for lovers of wah-wah guitar solos, while \"Moving On\" again lets the Deep Purple influence come to the forefront. Mellotron, Hammond, and lilting guitar chords support some passionate vocals on the moody title track, which closes out this very enjoyable old school styled record.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, you either love this sort of 'trip down memory lane' or you don't.

Being the lowest frequency producers of the Netherlands TONER LOW astonished listeners with their first two albums and undoubtedly will do the same with III, as their third album is titled. However, this time the band presents a more diverse sound than ever before in their fifteen years existence.\r\n\r\nOn III TONER LOW are both faster and slower as well as rawer and more subtle, whilst making sure that the deepest sub-low frequencies are omnipresent throughout the entire album. A wide range of psychedelic sounds completes this four songs in 55 minutes ride through a musical wasteland filled with drugged out themes and doped up riffing. With one difference: this time even the cover artwork might get you high!\r\n\r\nLaying down the law once more with low-endness and undertones TONER LOW reach another high in heaviness on III, both musically and physically.\r\n\r\nPraised for the landmark artwork on their self titled debut double vinyl (2006) and II (2008), the weighty cover for the double vinyl release of III is yet another example of how bands can set themselves apart from the rest. No time or money was spared on this cannabis leaf saturated piece of art.\r\n\r\nThe album was recorded in January and February 2013 at Studio Moskou in Utrecht (Netherlands) and Studio Sissysound in Leiden (Netherlands). It got mastered at Alan Ward's Electric City in Brussels (Belgium) in March. For the double album release an appropriate green vinyl colour is used. III will be available in the doom and stoner underground up from April 2013 on\r\ndouble vinyl, cd and audio cassette through Bilocation Records (sub-label of Kozmik Artifactz, Berlin) and TONER LOW's DIY label Roadkill Rekordz.\r\n\r\n\"From Holland come Toner Low, a three piece hell bent on carrying the subsonic, mind altering heaviness of Sleep. And this is some heavy shit indeed. Like Sleep, it’s minimalist to the point of being drone. Riffs repeat to the point where they start closing in on you. This repetitious nature could be underwhelming or overbearing if Toner Low didn’t break the crawling riffs with some cool guitar soloing (such as on the second track), quieter passages, and sporadic Melvins-like singing with lyrics that are equal parts Phillip K Dick and Ed Gein. In the end you have six songs that are insidious and beautiful at the same time, an enticing contradiction. These guys know how to work a mood. It may be simple in approach, but it’s very effective.

Vocals are perfectly matched to the melody and ably adept at delivering what are some of the cleverest lyrics around. “Going Home” is a unique and brilliant masterpiece.\"\r\n- Heavy Planet\r\n\r\n\"You guys fucking ROCK!\"\r\n- Drunk Dude\r\ncredits\r\nreleased 30 April 2012","options":[{"id":42381174,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.5,"amount_with_others":6.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123522783/-/a3185464943_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123522783/-/a3185464943_2.jpg","width":350,"height":350}],"artists":[{"id":229368,"name":"Trippy Wicked","permalink":"trippy-wicked","url":"/artist/trippy-wicked"}],"categories":[{"id":4546505,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":13257240,"name":" Trippy Wicked & the Cosmic Children of the Knight - Movin On CD","permalink":"trippy-wicked-the-cosmic-children-of-the-knight-movin-on-cd","position":184,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/trippy-wicked-the-cosmic-children-of-the-knight-movin-on-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-30T04:24:39.000Z","description":"Movin On, released 30th October 2009, is the debut album by UK experimental sleaze blues rock trio Trippy Wicked & the Cosmic Children of the Knight.\r\n\r\nIt's a 10 track, 52 minute epic musical journey of songs about living the good life, fire, growing beards, girls, aliens, loneliness, pirates, love and so much more.

Songs blend elements from modern European heavy jamming, as on the thoroughly-percussed, thoroughly-soloed instrumental opening stretch of the 11:20 “Southern Comfort and Northern Lights,” with classic heavy rock boogie and shuffle – see “Master of Nuggets” – and the organic live feel of the first album is maintained even as Hofmann layers solos over top of each other and he and Schierhorn come together in sub-harmony for creepy opener “Kiss Your Friends Goodbye,” giving a sense of foreboding to what might otherwise just seem to be stonerly shenanigans and weighted jamming.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not to say that stonerly shenanigans and weighted jamming aren’t part of it and a big part at that –Wight maintain a lighthearted atmosphere even in darker moments like the opener or the somber acoustic interlude “Halfway to Infinity” – but altogether, Through the Woods into Deep Water is a more professional record than was Wight Weedy Wight on nearly every level.

These two multifaceted musicians have played in multitudes of bands over many years and toured the nation from Seattle to NYC. Gero von Dehn has most recently led the rock n' roll outfit, Shovel Duck )also with D'Cagna) sang for groove-heavy metallers, Von Dane and fronted Fear Itself before that. D'Cagna can also be heard playing bass for the buzzworthy Brimstone Coven. Prior to that D'Cagna showed off his vocal chops in true metal band Dofka and ripped the 6-string for the ultra groovy Wilderkin.Six track EP of stoner-rock tunes from ex-members of DOfka, SHovel Duck and Brimstone Coven. Impeccable recording, big sounds and plenty of those earworm-y riffs that stoner bands do so well.

From southern Russia, Vespero have released several albums on the R.A.I.G. label that keep getting better all the time. On The Split Thing they get 3 tracks, each between 7-9 minutes. Nüllus features dual psychedelic guitars and keys that build around a repeating melodic riff. It’s atmospheric, it rocks, it’s spaced out and has a Prog rock quality too. The music trips along for the first 5 minutes or so and then really rocks out for the last couple minutes, with ripping guitars, proggy keys, bubbling space electronics, and flute. Vespero demonstrate their flair for combining Rock and spaced out atmospherics on Clouds, which brings to mind a cross between Korai Orom and Ozric Tentacles. And Lifeless Pillars is a 9 minute Space-Prog excursion that takes several thematic twists and turns, including some interesting rhythmic driven segments.\r\n\r\nFrom Germany, Zone Six have been around since 1998 with several lineups, all including the constant of Dave “Sula Bassana” Schmidt (who also heads up the Sulatron Records label). In the latest version of Zone Six Dave takes the drum seat, with Komet Lulu on bass (from their other current band Electric Moon), plus Rainer Neefe from the Pancakes on guitar and members of Vibravoid. The band contribute a single 24 minute instrumental – Babapapatantramanta, which is dark and doomy and totally spaced out. We’ve got classic Space Rock bleeping and gurgling synths, molten lava dripping acid drenched trip guitar, and a potent rhythm section. There’s an edge-of-your-seat sense of tension and foreboding throughout and I love the deep space Stoner vibe. File under T.F.S.R.
