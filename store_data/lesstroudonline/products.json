No one knows this better than Les Stroud, who has spent a lifetime surviving everywhere from the Amazon jungles to the vast Arctic tundra. In his newest book, Will to Live, Stroud calls upon his decades of survival experience to recount both famous and less-renowned survival stories while explaining what went right, what went wrong – and why. Will to Live is an inspiring testament to the unyielding human instinct to prevail against all odds, a practical look at what it takes to endure the unthinkable, and a guide to help answer the eternal question: Do you have what it takes to survive?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://browseinside.harpercollins.ca/index.aspx?isbn13=9781554686407&cm_mmc=ref-_-pub-_-lesstroud-_-9781554686407\" target=\"_blank\">Browse Inside<a/>","options":[{"id":9861755,"name":"Default","price":21.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27298544/-/will.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27298544/-/will.jpg","width":383,"height":550}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":286656,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]}]
