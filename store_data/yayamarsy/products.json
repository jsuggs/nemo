Remember this year the 1st night of Hanukkah is on December 21st.\r\n\r\nFor no charge, I am happy to personalize the onesie.\r\n\r\nThis listing is for the onesie only. Washing instructions included.\r\n\r\nChoking Hazard: These crystals, if removed can be a choking hazard. I securely fasten each and every crystal, but small children should be supervised by an adult.\r\n\r\nNONSMOKING STUDIO. FREE CUSTOMIZATION. INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING.\r\n\r\nA SPECIAL NOTE: 10% of the proceeds from my Swarovski Onesie line will go directly to Dr. Denise Faustman of Harvard University at Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. Faustman is feverishly working on a cure for Type 1 Diabetes, and her work is only funded through private donations. She is my hero (although I've never met her) and I pray she is close to the cure.\r\n","options":[{"id":770558,"name":"Default","price":29.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1083737/-/Menorah_Full_2_374x300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1083737/-/Menorah_Full_2_374x300.jpg","width":374,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":141456,"name":"Onesies","permalink":"onesies","url":"/category/onesies"}]},{"id":154264,"name":"Got Presents? - Christmas T-Shirt","permalink":"got-presents-christmas-t-shirt","position":2,"price":9.0,"default_price":9.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/got-presents-christmas-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-09-18T21:05:53.000Z","description":"Can't you just see your little one toddling down the stairs wearing this t-shirt on Christmas morning?
