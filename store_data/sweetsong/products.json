Jewelweed grows along with poison ivy and I was gathering plants knee and elbow deep in the poison ivy . Later that evening I started itching above my eye like I have never itched before! After a while, with the itch not going away I realized it might be poison ivy so I went to look in the mirror and sure enough a blister had formed. I went into the shower with some alcohol and soap and washed with each 3x. Then I applied the jewelweed/marshmallow salve generously and went to bed. When I awoke I felt the other eye itching and assumed I would be swollen and looking deformed. When I went to the mirror I was shocked to see that the blister had disappeared completely. I continued to apply the salve for a few days to the area and any area that felt itchy, many times a day. No rash or any sign of poison ivy manifested.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n*Jewelweed Aerial Parts, *Marshmallow root, Leaf and Flower infused *Extra Virgin Olive oil,* Bees Wax.\r\n\r\n*Certified Organic or Organically grown.\r\n","options":[{"id":32113234,"name":"2 ounce tin","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32120581,"name":"1 ounce tin","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100816264/-/303087_266440173376983_6150968_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100816264/-/303087_266440173376983_6150968_n.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":15129249,"name":"\"Detox\" Herbal Bath Salts","permalink":"detox-herbal-bath-salts","position":19,"price":22.0,"default_price":22.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/detox-herbal-bath-salts","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-26T23:58:00.000Z","description":"Healthy detoxification includes long \r\nsoaks in the bath with fragrant salts and \r\nhealing herbs.\r\n\r\n A great way to start your\r\nday with uplifting, slimming  and \r\ndetoxifying citrus and rosewood. \r\n\r\nIngredients\r\nEpsom Salts, Baking Soda,  *Aloe Vera \r\nPowder,  essential oils of \r\n*sweet orange &  *rosewood.\r\n\r\n*certified organic\r\n","options":[{"id":49140597,"name":"Default","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128300259/-/Detox.PNG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128300259/-/Detox.PNG","width":640,"height":960},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128300283/-/detox2.PNG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128300283/-/detox2.PNG","width":640,"height":960}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":10488496,"name":"Herbal Teas","permalink":"integrity-nettle-tea","position":20,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/integrity-nettle-tea","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-11T18:23:35.000Z","description":"100% Certified Organic Herbal Tea\r\n\r\nIntegrity -

Each of these acts as a solvent to break down food for absorption, and the quantity and the quality of these fluids ensure proper nutrition. Inadequate production of these secretions is common in modern cultures (cultures lacking bitters in their diet).\r\nWhen first tasted, bitters promote salivation, which begins the process of digestion by breaking down starches and beginning to work on fats. Taste receptors in the mouth recognize the presence of bitters and trigger a system wide reaction throughout the digestive tract.\r\nIn the stomach, sufficient hormones, acids, and enzymes are needed to help breakdown proteins, and carbohydrates, and to free up minerals for assimilation. Bitters stimulate the production of gastric acid. Inadequate stomach acid will prevent the uptake of minerals, which will in turn rob the body of essential nutrition needed for wellness. Low acids also weaken stomach tissues, and is often the foundational cause of esoph-geal reflex(though most people mistakenly believe they have too much acid). It is well known that as people pass into their elder years they produce less stomach acid. Restoring bitters to the diet will allow the body to produce its own acid. Bitters also increase the production of the enzyme pepsin, which helps to break down proteins and intrinsic factor, which is essential for the absorption of Vit. B12\r\nBitters act on the both the pancreas, and liver/gallbladder, helping to normalize blood sugar and promote the production and release of pancreatic enzymes and bile which ensure good digestion of fats and oils. A healthy flow of bile helps rid the liver of waste products, prevents the formation of gall stones and emulsifies lipids, which the pancreatic enzymes then breakdown along with proteins and carbohydrates for absorption in the small intestines. Deficient bile and sluggish liver/gallbladder function can often be the cause of chronic constipation. Bitters also promote secretion of digestive juices within the small intestines, further aiding bowel transit and nutrient assimilation. They strengthen the tone of tissues throughout the digestive tract.\r\n\r\nPeople associate bitterness with negative virtues such as spite and resentment, and yet, what emotional bitterness really originates from is stagnation; the inability to release a belief or feeling that no longer serves, but rather hinders our wellness, development and growth. The bitter person is oppressed by avoidance of the very thing they cannot let go. Only by embracing bitterness can we learn the very thing it has to offer-to teach us. In this embrace we find it rich in medicine. As it applies to herbs, these same factors resonate. We avoid bitterness because its taste seems uncomfortable, it challenges us. And yet, when embraced we find what it offers us is an abundance of medicine, which allows us to escape from a state of stagnation and release those things both physiological and emotional that hinder the blossoming of our wellness.\r\nSummarized from Jim McDonald's \r\n\"Blessed Bitters\"http://www.herbcraft.org/bitters.pdf\r\n","options":[{"id":32087545,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100765432/-/60769_550490451638619_1903637633_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100765432/-/60769_550490451638619_1903637633_n.jpg","width":960,"height":960}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":13444530,"name":"Bug Repellent","permalink":"bug-repellent","position":22,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bug-repellent","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-09T00:54:24.000Z","description":"All Natural Bug Repellent\r\n\r\nKeep the bugs away naturally with Sweet Song All Natural Bug Repellent. \r\n\r\n80ml Spray Bottle","options":[{"id":43032819,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123999543/-/Bug_Spray.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123999543/-/Bug_Spray.jpg","width":1936,"height":2592},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123999576/-/Bug_Spray2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123999576/-/Bug_Spray2.jpg","width":1936,"height":2592}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":10259902,"name":"Lavender Botanical Moisturizing Cream","permalink":"lavender-botanical-moisturizing-cream","position":24,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lavender-botanical-moisturizing-cream","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-31T00:42:07.000Z","description":" INTENSE, ALL NATURAL MOISTURE. \r\n\r\nEco - Friendly, All Natural, Handmade\r\nCertified Organic and Preservative Free.\r\n\r\nLavender Botanical Moisturizing Cream is calming and soothing, balancing and normalizing.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\nRose Water, *Extra Virgin Olive Oil ,*Apricot Kernel Oil,*Coconut Oil, *Pumpkin Seed Oil, emulsifying wax, d-alpha Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Essential Oil of Highland Lavender.\r\n\r\n *Certified Organic or Organically Grown.","options":[{"id":32850121,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103082416/-/IMG_5843.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103082416/-/IMG_5843.JPG","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":10253521,"name":"Rose Petal Botanical Moisturizing Cream","permalink":"rose-petal-botanical-moisturizing-cream","position":25,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rose-petal-botanical-moisturizing-cream","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-30T16:44:57.000Z","description":"INTENSE, ALL NATURAL MOISTURE. \r\nEco - Friendly\r\nCertified Organic Ingredients and Preservative Free.\r\n\r\nSweet Song’s HAND CRAFTED BOTANICAL CREAMS are one of the HIGHEST QUALITY ALL NATURAL MOISTURIZING CREAMS available. \r\nThe scent is incredibly light, amazingly full and utterly beautiful.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\nCertified Organic Bulgarian Rose water, * Extra Virgin Olive Oil, *Apricot Kernel Oil, *Pumpkin Seed Oil *Coconut Oil, emulsifying wax, d-alpha Tocopherol(Vitamin E),  Essential Oils of *Rose Absolute, *Rosemary and *Peppermint. \r\n                                                                       \r\n *Certified Organic or Organically Grown.\r\n","options":[{"id":32850142,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110849313/-/Rose_Petal_Botanical_Moisturizing_Cream_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110849313/-/Rose_Petal_Botanical_Moisturizing_Cream_.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
