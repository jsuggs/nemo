All hanging from a fancy/dainty 18K Gold chain.\r\n\r\nThis is a special One Off piece. \r\n\r\nChain is 36 inches.\r\n\r\nQuartz pendant measures 42mm x 22mm\r\n\r\nFocal piece measures approximately 3.75 inches to bottom of star charm.\r\n\r\nAngel Aura Quartz Crystals are created by bonding a natural clear Quartz crystal with a precious metal infusion of pure platinum and silver, resulting in an immensely powerful protection combination which fuses the White, Blue, Violet and Silver Rays into an iridescent display of Light. This cousin to Aqua Aura Quartz is one of the most beautiful forms of color-enhanced Quartz I have ever seen. In a secret process which is part alchemy and part science, the three unique substances of quartz crystal, pure Silver and Platinum are commingled in a permanent way, resulting in the delicate iridescent rainbow coloring of Angel Aura.\r\n\r\nAs ancient as the moon itself, Moonstone holds the power of mystery. Its secrets are locked beneath a pearly veil, and with them, our own hidden truths. Only within its reflected light can we begin to understand what it has to teach us. Moonstone is foremost a talisman of the inward journey, taking one deep into the self to retrieve what is missing, the parts of the soul left behind or forgotten, then brought to light. Since earliest times, Moonstone has been a tangible connection to the magic of the moon - an amulet of protection for travelers, a gift of lovers for passion, a channel for prophecy, and a path to wisdom. Our ties to the moon are strong. As it waxes and wanes in cyclic perfection, it creates the tides and rhythms of our mother, Earth, and influences our behaviors, emotions and spiritual growth. Moonstone calms and encourages, teaching us the natural rhythms of life.\r\n\r\nQuartz crystals are the supreme gift of Mother Earth. Even the smallest is imbued with the properties of a master healer teacher. Ancients believed these stones to be alive, taking a breath once every hundred years or so, and many cultures thought them to be incarnations of the Divine.\r\nToday's healers agree, believing crystals are living beings, incredibly old and wise, and willing to communicate when an individual is open and ready to receive. Wearing, carrying or meditating with a Clear Quartz crystal opens the mind and heart to higher guidance, allowing the realm of Spirit to be transmitted and translated into the world of physical form. Resonating at the level of an individual's needs, Clear Quartz also amplifies whatever energy or intent is programmed into it, and continues to broadcast that energy throughout the world and into the etheric realms. This may accelerate the fulfillment of one's prayers, intensify healing or spiritual growth, or simply allow the crystal to hold a pattern of energy long enough and strongly enough for the manifestation of a goal to occur","options":[{"id":49008330,"name":"Default","price":120.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128201523/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128201523/-/image.jpg","width":1763,"height":2688},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128201544/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128201544/-/image.jpg","width":1446,"height":1840},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128201616/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128201616/-/image.jpg","width":2004,"height":2448},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128201460/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128201460/-/image.jpg","width":1856,"height":2552},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128201598/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128201598/-/image.jpg","width":2130,"height":2884}],"artists":[{"id":180674,"name":"The Uncommon Wren","permalink":"the-uncommon-wren","url":"/artist/the-uncommon-wren"}],"categories":[{"id":2939645,"name":"Jewelry","permalink":"jewelry","url":"/category/jewelry"}]},{"id":14794752,"name":"Gypsy Sprite Rosary Necklace","permalink":"gypsy-sprite-rosary-necklace-butterfly-wings-feathers","position":3,"price":52.0,"default_price":52.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/gypsy-sprite-rosary-necklace-butterfly-wings-feathers","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-12T15:12:56.000Z","description":"The Gypsy Sprite Rosary Necklace is woodland inspired and is a perfect infusion of nature and Bohemia.

Many of the words translated into English as the sky stone evoking the sky-blue shade of the stone most commonly found. Native Americans had been working turquoise mines with stone mauls and antler picks for centuries before the arrival of the Europeans.\r\n\r\nNative Americans believe that the earth is alive and that all things, no matter how small or apparently inanimate, are precious. To the Native Americans, turquoise is life. There are stones medicine men keep in their sacred bundles because they possess powers of healing. Stones and crystals have unique attributed that support and heal us. Turquoise, especially, is known for its positive healing energy, an aid in mental functions, communications and expression and as a protector. If you’re wearing a turquoise ring and you look down and see a crack in your stone, the Native Americans would say “the stone took it”, meaning the stone took the blow that you would have received.\r\n","options":[{"id":47656050,"name":"Default","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United

Even the smallest is imbued with the properties of a master healer teacher. Ancients believed these stones to be alive, taking a breath once every hundred years or so, and many cultures thought them to be incarnations of the Divine.\r\nToday's healers agree, believing crystals are living beings, incredibly old and wise, and willing to communicate when an individual is open and ready to receive. Wearing, carrying or meditating with a Clear Quartz crystal opens the mind and heart to higher guidance, allowing the realm of Spirit to be transmitted and translated into the world of physical form. Resonating at the level of an individual's needs, Clear Quartz also amplifies whatever energy or intent is programmed into it, and continues to broadcast that energy throughout the world and into the etheric realms. This may accelerate the fulfillment of one's prayers, intensify healing or spiritual growth, or simply allow the crystal to hold a pattern of energy long enough and strongly enough for the manifestation of a goal to occur. \r\n\r\nAs ancient as the moon itself, Moonstone holds the power of mystery. Its secrets are locked beneath a pearly veil, and with them, our own hidden truths. Only within its reflected light can we begin to understand what it has to teach us. Moonstone is foremost a talisman of the inward journey, taking one deep into the self to retrieve what is missing, the parts of the soul left behind or forgotten, then brought to light. Since earliest times, Moonstone has been a tangible connection to the magic of the moon - an amulet of protection for travelers, a gift of lovers for passion, a channel for prophecy, and a path to wisdom. Our ties to the moon are strong. As it waxes and wanes in cyclic perfection, it creates the tides and rhythms of our mother, Earth, and influences our behaviors, emotions and spiritual growth. Moonstone calms and encourages, teaching us the natural rhythms of life.\r\n\r\nDouble terminated points are capable of storing, transmitting and amplifying diverse energies.

Carrying the power of the sun, it is warm and comforting, energizing and life giving. It stimulates the chakras like the sunlight of spring, clearing the mind and stirring the soul to action. Its frequency awakens creativity and imagination, and sustains the process of transforming dreams and wishes into tangible form. With its pure yellow energy, Citrine encourages fullness of life, fresh beginnings and new pursuits. Citrine does not hold or accumulate negative energy, but rather transmutes, dissipates, and grounds it, making it extremely protective for the environment. It works out problems on both the physical and subtle levels, transforming negative thoughts and feelings into positive ones. It is one of only two crystals on Earth that never needs to be cleared or cleanse. The other is Kyanite. \r\n\r\nSmokey Topaz or Smokey quartz is a powerful grounding stone that is used extensively in healing and meditation work. It is one of the fundamental grounding stones. It is known to be able to establish a clear path to removing negativity by passing it back into the Earth where it can dissipate naturally. It is also used in praying to ancestors, grounding the spirit, and providing an anchor in the natural world.\r\n\r\nRainbow inclusion aids in the deep healing of any and all chakras.

Their tears of joy mixed with the rain and seeped into Mother Earth to become SkyStone Turquoise.\r\n\r\nTurquoise, the \"fallen sky stone\" hidden in Mother Earth, has been valued by cultures for its beauty and reputed spiritual and life-giving qualities for over 7000 years. It is a true gem of the centuries. A long time ago someone noticed a clear blue line running through gray rock, and saw the imagery of sky and water in stone, and from that time on, turquoise has been cherished above all else in creation - turquoise, stone of sky, stone of water, stone of blessings, good fortune, protection, good health and long life.\r\n\r\nNative American Indians had as many different words for turquoise as there were languages spoken. Many of the words translated into English as the sky stone evoking the sky-blue shade of the stone most commonly found. Native Americans had been working turquoise mines with stone mauls and antler picks for centuries before the arrival of the Europeans.\r\n\r\nNative Americans believe that the earth is alive and that all things, no matter how small or apparently inanimate, are precious. To the Native Americans, turquoise is life. There are stones medicine men keep in their sacred bundles because they possess powers of healing. Stones and crystals have unique attributed that support and heal us. Turquoise, especially, is known for its positive healing energy, an aid in mental functions, communications and expression and as a protector. If you’re wearing a turquoise ring and you look down and see a crack in your stone, the Native Americans would say “the stone took it”, meaning the stone took the blow that you would have received.\r\n","options":[{"id":44344737,"name":"Default","price":165.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124931694/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124931694/-/image.jpg","width":2448,"height":3264},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124931685/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124931685/-/image.jpg","width":2448,"height":3264},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124931736/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124931736/-/image.jpg","width":2448,"height":3264},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124931721/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124931721/-/image.jpg","width":1998,"height":2884},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124931670/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124931670/-/image.jpg","width":2246,"height":2450}],"artists":[{"id":180674,"name":"The Uncommon Wren","permalink":"the-uncommon-wren","url":"/artist/the-uncommon-wren"}],"categories":[{"id":2939645,"name":"Jewelry","permalink":"jewelry","url":"/category/jewelry"}]},{"id":13781442,"name":"Desert Sky Necklace / Amethyst Spirit or Cactus Quartz Point","permalink":"desert-sky-necklace-amethyst-spirit-or-cactus-quartz-point","position":20,"price":68.0,"default_price":68.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/desert-sky-necklace-amethyst-spirit-or-cactus-quartz-point","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-25T14:40:46.000Z","description":"Desert Sky.

a statement and adorn your neck with this bold and meant to be seen piece.\r\n\r\nA gorgeous chunk of Quartz Crystals with Hematite, Pyrite, Chalcopyrite, and Dolomite wrapped in rich saddle brown buckskin leather lace, embellished with vintage Kuchi trinkets, brass beads, and assorted exotic feathers.\r\n\r\nHangs from hand braided leather lace with a 15 inch drop (or 30 inch chain).\r\n\r\nFocal piece measures approximately 7 inches long to longest fringe.\r\n\r\nStone measures approximately 3\" x 2.5\"\r\n\r\nThis is truly a one of a kind piece.\r\n\r\n*Note: \r\nThe Hematite in the Quartz causes the crystals to turn red. This specimen is made up of several larger crystals that is tinted with red from the hematite. There is white dolomite and chalcopyrite that is iridescent throughout the crystals. The top is a combination of dolomite, pyrite, and crystals.\r\n\r\nOrdinary yet extraordinary, colorful and clear, Quartz crystals are the most common and abundant in the world, comprising the largest and most diverse family in the mineral kingdom. \"From ancient times to the present day, quartz crystals have been a source of Light to mankind. Highly valued by spiritual leaders and healers as well as scientists, the unique attributes of quartz have played a key role in mankind' evolutionary development.In the metaphysical world, Clear Quartz crystals are the supreme gift of Mother Earth. Even the smallest is imbued with the properties of a master healer teacher. Ancients believed these stones to be alive, taking a breath once every hundred years or so, and many cultures thought them to be incarnations of the Divine.\r\n\r\nHematite grounds and protects us. It strengthens our connection with the earth, making us feel safe and secure.  It endows us with courage, strength, endurance and vitality.  A \"stone for the mind\", Hematite stimulates concentration and focus, enhancing memory and original thought.\r\n\r\nPyrite is often called “Fool’s Gold,” though there is nothing foolish about this mineral. Within its gleaming beauty is a stone of hidden fire, one that can be sparked to life by striking it against metal or stone. An Earth element, it also resonates with Fire energy, symbolizing the warmth and lasting presence of the sun and the ability to generate wealth by one’s own power. It is masculine in nature, a stone of action, vitality and will, and taps into one’s abilities and potential, stimulating the flow of ideas. It brings confidence and the persistence to carry things through to completion.\r\n\r\nChalcopyrite is an excellent stone for meditation and this is its most powerful aspect, although it is also a strong healing stone for the physical body. It has a powerful resonance within the higher chakras, and is acknowledged as a stone of the mystic, as it is common for it to make a powerful connection to the higher spiritual and mystical realms. It is known to help you if you have lost something to find it, and it may even get lost to you as well. Like most gold stones, this is a stone of abundance, and it has a positive vibration that is known to increase happiness, joy and belief in yourself.\r\n\r\nDolomite is considered to be a rather gentle stone that brings to the owner increased mercy, unselfishness and giving in all its forms and manifestations. It promotes energetic mind, unique creative expression, and enables deeper manifestation of one's inner self. Dolomite can help in developing abilities for handling people that are extensively active. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":44032782,"name":"Default","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124697346/-/IMG_0503.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124697346/-/IMG_0503.JPG","width":2215,"height":2825},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124697313/-/IMG_0521.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124697313/-/IMG_0521.JPG","width":2448,"height":3264},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124697325/-/IMG_0509.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124697325/-/IMG_0509.JPG","width":1335,"height":2026},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124697376/-/IMG_0316.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124697376/-/IMG_0316.JPG","width":1163,"height":1489},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124697361/-/IMG_0334.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124697361/-/IMG_0334.JPG","width":2083,"height":3264}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2939645,"name":"Jewelry","permalink":"jewelry","url":"/category/jewelry"}]},{"id":13721181,"name":"Purple Haze / Amethyst Statement Necklace / Bohemian Gypsy","permalink":"purple-haze-amethyst-statement-necklace-bohemian-gypsy","position":27,"price":150.0,"default_price":150.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/purple-haze-amethyst-statement-necklace-bohemian-gypsy","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-22T17:49:05.000Z","description":"Make a statement and adorn your neck with this bold and meant to be seen piece.\r\n\r\nA gorgeous chunk of amethyst wrapped in warm chocolate brown buckskin leather lace, embellished with vintage Kuchi trinkets, brass beads, and assorted exotic feathers.\r\n\r\nHangs from hand braided leather lace with a 15 inch drop (or 30 inch chain).\r\n\r\nFocal piece measures approximately 6 inches long to longest fringe.\r\n\r\nStone measures approximately 2 inches long by 2 inches at the widest point.\r\n\r\nThis is truly a one of a kind piece.\r\n\r\nAmethyst has been highly esteemed throughout the ages for its stunning beauty and legendary powers to stimulate, and soothe, the mind and emotions.
