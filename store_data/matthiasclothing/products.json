Unfortunately, people take that kind of attitude and apply it to relationships. People are afraid to reach out to people because they are afraid of the cost of getting involved, as well as the work it requires to be a friend. In order for somebody to reach anybody, they need to meet them where they are at, as well as take a risk of being a part of that person&#8217;s life. People tend to forget that, despite the hard work and messyness involved in painting, that the end will justify the pain it took to get you there.\n\n","options":[{"id":94808,"name":"Adult Small","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":94809,"name":"Adult Medium","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":94810,"name":"Adult Large","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":94811,"name":"Adult X-Large","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/10554/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/10554/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4554,"name":"Shirts","permalink":"shirts","url":"/category/shirts"}]},{"id":5678,"name":"Lion-O (White)","permalink":"lion-o-white","position":4,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lion-o-white","status":"sold-out","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2006-10-11T18:25:16.000Z","description":"Lions.
