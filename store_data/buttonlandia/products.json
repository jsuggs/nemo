They are perfect for any age & any occasion! Place these cuties in a nursery, office, living room, kitchen, pretty much anywhere.\r\n\r\nNot only do we love PB&J but we also love our best friends. Which include our mom (super cheesy, huh?)! We really wanted to celebrate closeness & all the good things that come with it (like long talks, awesome presents, amazing hugs, etc.) We love hearing stories about these cuties. People have used them for ring bearer pillows (AWW), to frame in shadow boxes, as a proposal prop (SUPER AWW), etc. What's your story for giving these PB&J?\r\n\r\nThis set of breads are adorable to the max! They are lovingly made with Eco Fi Felt (100% recycled from post consumer plastic bottles) and embroidery thread. PB&J are hand sewn and cut. They are stuffed with Poly-Fil. Best Friends PB&J are approx. 4.5\" (H) x 3.5 (L) x .5 (W). They are close to the actual size of real pieces of bread. They both feature a heart; one red (jelly) & one orange/brown (pb). \r\n\r\nPlease allow 2-3 days to make from your purchase date.
