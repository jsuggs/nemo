A great \"jadeite\" or \"depression glass\" green color, it stands  approx 10 inches high, and has a embossed green shade to go with it.  It is in working order, as can be seen in the picture.  I always recommend having any vintage lighting wiring checked.  It has one defect on the drum, and I'm happy to provide any additional information you might like.
