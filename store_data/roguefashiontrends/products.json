More on the formal side, it can be perfectly paired with a suit, however, it can look just as great on a pair of jeans and a shirt. \r\n\r\nConsisting of 70% new wool blend, this coat is thick and is effective at keeping the cold at bay. The fabric is very durable and will definitely stand up to rain. The quilted lining is a quintessentially British and trimmed in a dark green akin to the classic British Racing Green. \r\n\r\nThis coat narrows slightly at the waist to fit snugly, while its double breasted feature makes you look tough and sturdy, like you are ready to climb into your spitfire and enter a dogfight. \r\n\r\n\r\nSizing Chart:\r\n\r\nLength (Neck to bottom) \r\nS:94cm M:96cm  L: 98cm \r\n                     \r\nChest Width (Underarm to underarm)  \r\nS:53.2cm  M:57cm L:60.8cm \r\n\r\nSleeve Length (Crown to Cuff)    \r\nS:67.3cm   M:68cm L:68.7cm    \r\n\r\nShoulder Width (Across Shoulders) \r\nS:46.2cm   M:48cm     L:49.8cm     \r\n\r\nWaist (Across front of waist)  \r\nS:48.7cm      M:52.5cm   L:56.3cm ","options":[{"id":22460525,"name":"Small/Charcoal","price":159.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":22460527,"name":"Medium/Charcoal","price":159.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":22460529,"name":"Large/Charcoal","price":159.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70449615/-/IMG_6705-127.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70449615/-/IMG_6705-127.jpg","width":679,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70459999/-/IMG_6698-125.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70459999/-/IMG_6698-125.jpg","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70460175/-/IMG_6719-131.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70460175/-/IMG_6719-131.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70460311/-/IMG_6738-132.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70460311/-/IMG_6738-132.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70460415/-/IMG_6715-129.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70460415/-/IMG_6715-129.jpg","width":667,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":7099847,"name":"The Oxford Military","permalink":"the-oxford-military","position":8,"price":135.99,"default_price":135.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-oxford-military","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-08-29T21:03:31.000Z","description":"The Oxford Military is an exceptionally unique coat. It takes it's inspiration from British Military jackets and takes them to the next level with the quilted gilet. The quilting on the inside adds to the style and can be zipped up all the way to keep the weather at bay.  Whether worn with a sweater or a V-neck, the Oxford is bold and unique.\r\n\r\nThe fabric is also unique, but you have to look closely to notice the intricate detail in the weave. We used a Tweed-like fabric, made of a 38% recycled wool blend.   The lining is quilted and pays homage to the British roots with its dark British Racing Green lining. We believe that this unique fabric will keep you warm and looking sharp throughout this winter. \r\n\r\nThe fit of this coat is rather straight, it does taper slightly in on the waist but it meant to give you a bit of space to pack on the underclothes. \r\n\r\n\r\nSizing Chart:\r\n\r\nLength (Neck to bottom) \r\nS:76cm M:78cm  L: 80cm \r\n                     \r\nChest Width (Underarm to underarm)  \r\nS:56.2cm  M:60cm L:63.8cm \r\n\r\nSleeve Length (Crown to Cuff)    \r\nS:66.3cm   M:67cm L:67.7cm    \r\n\r\nShoulder Width (Across Shoulders) \r\nS:49.2cm   M:51cm     L:52.8cm     \r\n\r\nWaist (Across front of waist)  \r\nS:52.7cm      M:56.5cm   L:60.3cm ","options":[{"id":22460835,"name":"Small/Charcoal","price":135.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":22460837,"name":"Medium/Charcoal","price":135.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":22460839,"name":"Large/Charcoal","price":135.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70448439/-/IMG_6929-161.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70448439/-/IMG_6929-161.jpg","width":672,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70461263/-/IMG_6900-158.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70461263/-/IMG_6900-158.jpg","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70461427/-/IMG_6950-164.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70461427/-/IMG_6950-164.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70461647/-/IMG_6961-165.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70461647/-/IMG_6961-165.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70461775/-/IMG_6930-162.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70461775/-/IMG_6930-162.jpg","width":667,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":7099887,"name":"The French Navy Duffle","permalink":"the-french-navy-duffle","position":9,"price":135.99,"default_price":135.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-french-navy-duffle","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-08-30T01:07:49.000Z","description":"The French Navy Duffle is one of the two Duffle Coats we are offering this season.

What makes this coat truly unique is the same feature that makes it exceedingly useful; it is actually two coats in one.  The lining of the duffle is actually a wool blend which is both thick and warm - winter will not penetrate this coat.\r\n\r\nIt is 60% new wool blend on both the inside and outside, making this coat the warmest wool coat we have to offer.  The lining has a unique plaid style, that sets it apart from any other coat.\r\n\r\nIt is a longer coat that does not taper, and rather it gives you a complete surrounding feeling.  This coat combines style and warmth unlike anything on the market.
