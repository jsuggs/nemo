The elastic string allows movements among the struts, and maintains the shape when handled. The basic tetrahedral geometry prevents that the structure can collapse in itself like the octahedral models.\r\n\r\nThe model can balance on each of its corners, and the three different colours outline the tetrahedral structure in surprising ways.","options":[{"id":19379045,"name":"Default","price":80.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":20.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59552589/-/rasta-parsed-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59552589/-/rasta-parsed-1.jpg","width":1000,"height":837}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2252615,"name":"Artworx","permalink":"artworx","url":"/category/artworx"}]},{"id":6065347,"name":"Nippon","permalink":"nippon","position":2,"price":40.0,"default_price":40.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nippon","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-30T10:03:23.000Z","description":"This tensegrity octahedron is made of bamboo and elastic string. The colour combination resembled me of the rising sun in the Japanese flag. It has a robust bounce way and weighs only about 30 grams. The models collapses in three ways, creating different pattern each way.\r\n\r\nWith a size of 20x20x20cm it fits nicely on a desktop or book shelf, and the little weight makes it well suited for hanging installations. But then you couldn't play with it anymore.....\r\n\r\nAll models for sale are hand made in Brunswick, a suburb of Melbourne.

Depending on the size chosen (starter - 12 elements, standard - 32 elements) many geometric shapes can be build.
