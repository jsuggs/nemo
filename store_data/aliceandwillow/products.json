It's 100% cotton so lovely and soft (and breathable), and very light weight\r\n2.It can be washed as any other garment would be, and over time will wear into a soft and weathered look\r\n3. It's full enough to fit up to a 50\" waist without losing its gather\r\n4. It's full length and has enough pleats to be worn on it's own or with another skirt\r\n5. And this is the best one-it has long ribbons stitched into the waistband at the front, which can be wrapped under and over the front of the skirt, and used to bustle up the front as shown in the pictures!\r\n\r\nThis skirt can be worn as a simple long, full skirt, or with the use of the ribbons, can be bustled up.\r\nThis skirt looks amazing when bustle and gives a real psycho circus/old western feel when bustled up, and it's as easy as pulling the ribbons around and tying in a bow-no faffing with pins, needles or thread to bustle this up.\r\nIt can be worn at any bustle height you fancy, and the higher the front is bustled up, the more the back pulls in to give fantastic gathering and shape.\r\nIt also looks equally awesome worn cheekily on its own (perhaps with stockings and lace up boots showing underneath), or with another skirt layered underneath. \r\n\r\nMade in a full length style, 39\" total length and designed to fit any waist size at all. Made with a drawstring waist to tie at the back for the best fit.\r\n\r\nThis does of course look fantastic when teamed with one of our corsets, and can be worn in many different ways, creating so many different looks.\r\n\r\nThe red skirt and the black corset are for sale separately in our shop. \r\n\r\nFancy something plainer or in a different colour?\r\nConvo me and I can make this up for you in a fabric of your choice.
