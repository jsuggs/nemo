AMAZING SPECIFICATION AND TOP QUALITY</B></U><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDo you sometimes wish you could leave your house secure without having to take keys with you?\r\n\r\nThe Yale Keyless Digital Lock brings many of the same advantages, but can be fitted to most timber front doors just like a conventional night latch.\r\n\r\nYale Keyless Digital Lock lets you unlock your front door by entering a simple code. No keys, no hassle, no fuss ? just keep a PIN number in your head! You can even create a temporary code to give other people access to your home when you want to, and delete that code just as easily.\r\n\r\n<b><u>Features</b></u><br>\r\n\r\nTouch Screen Keypad\r\nThe touch screen keypad has no mechanical buttons which means no trace of your secret pincode.\r\n\r\n4-12 Digit Pin Code\r\nChoose a pin code from 4-12 digits, this could be ideal for children or occupants that lose keys on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nFake PIN code\r\nPrevent others from identifying your pin code during access, the fake PIN code function confuses the onlookers but at the same time allows you to enter.\r\n\r\nLow Battery Warning\r\nWhen battery reaches critical level, a warning light will come on reminding you to change the batteries.\r\n\r\nInsurance approved\r\nUse this product in conjunction with the BS3621 mortice lock and make it insurance approved.\r\n\r\nLow Power Consumption\r\nUnlock your door up to 10,000 times with one set of 4 x AA batteries. We recommend the batteries are charged every 12 months.\r\n\r\nOutdoor Weather Resistant Keypad\r\nThey keypad is designed to withstand UK weather conditions. Also had IP protection 5,5.\r\n\r\nUser Codes and Setting Remain if Batteries are Replaced\r\nThe settings and codes will remain programmed in the lock in the even the batteries are depleted.\r\n\r\nEmergency Battery Connection\r\nIn the even your battery goes flat you have two battery contact points that fit a standard 9V battery, you can place the battery here and power the lock temporarily to enter your pin.\r\n\r\n<B><U> How to Fit Video </b></u>\r\n<iframe width=\"230\" height=\"200\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/M7_MOoUlBQg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<b>TRACKING INFORMATION SENT WITH EVERY ORDER</B>\r\n\r\n<center><b><font color=\"red\">Pay by PayPal</center></b></font> \r\n<font color=\"red\"><center><b>For Direct Payment Please Call 01922 636033</b></font></center>","options":[{"id":28613783,"name":"Default","price":89.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.99,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89744774/-/Kayless_Digital_Door_Lock_All_Components_Large.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89744774/-/Kayless_Digital_Door_Lock_All_Components_Large.jpg","width":438,"height":307}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3136395,"name":"Alarms/ Security","permalink":"alarms-security","url":"/category/alarms-security"}]}]
