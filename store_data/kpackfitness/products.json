The K-Pack’s pouch is very shallow to further reduce motion of items in the pouch. The K-Pack uses a front buckle to enable the straps to be adjusted and to take the K-Pack on and off. This acts to further stabilize the pouch during physical activities. The K-Pack can be worn so that the pouch is on the wearers back or their front. The primary problem that the K-Pack solves is that it is a backpack that creates pouch stability and reduces the motion of the pouch. This is important from a comfort standpoint.
