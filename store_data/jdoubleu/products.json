THE most amazing glaze ever. It's hard to photograph, but believe me, it makes you feel like your flying over a mercurial celestial body. It appears dark and shiny in a normally lit room, but when the light directly hits, the glaze ignites with amber sparks intertwined with deep pools of indigo. \r\n\r\nHearty enough for everyday use.
