Trace foot on a piece of paper with 1/2 inch allowance for flexibility, comfort and growing room.\r\n\r\nBenefits of Wool Fibers: Unlike synthetic materials, wool is taken from sheep fleece, and is considered to be a natural fiber that is soft, breathable, biodegradable and renewable. It has the amazing ability to absorb up to 30 percent of its weight in moisture without ever feeling damp. Another important aspect of wool is that it regulates the body's temperature, which means the wearer feels warm during winter and cool during summer.\r\n\r\nThe quality of natural wool sweater slippers/boots offers good support, comfort and protection for kids feet.\r\n\r\nWe do accept custom orders on all of our products.
