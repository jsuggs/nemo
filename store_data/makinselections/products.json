Out of struggle comes great artistry. Grand Rapids is the 2nd largest city in the state with the worst economy & highest unemployment rate in the US. There is little to no radio airplay or media exposure in ultra-conservative West Michigan. These artists got together as one voice to express their unfiltered opinions on the political & economic state of affairs in their environment. All of the production was handled by Nottingham UK resident, Anno Domini (bangin boom-bap beats for fans of DJ Muggs, Evidence & Alchemist). \r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\n1.

She was a beautiful , eclectic woman, who loved sports (Lions), fashion, and people. Me and DJ M-Select produced the music on rudimentary beatmaking tools. The sessions were open and accepting, we listened, sampled, and programmed a little. Me, Freeze and Mean Mark later added some freestyle vocals. This project was envisioned as a record, we will be pressing the vinyl version soon. We hope you enjoy the vibe of \"My Aunt Bobbies Records\". Feel free to post any samples you recognize in the comment section. Rest in Peace, Aunt Bobbie\r\n\r\n- Vito, Vegtible Bro 1 \r\n\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\n1   Trippin' (3:10) \r\n2   Mono (1:20) \r\n3   Krash Bandit (2:45) \r\n4   1956 (2:30) \r\n5   Uppineah (4:11) \r\n6   Mono 2 (0:13) \r\n7   Keyholes (4:12) \r\n8   Live On (3:22) \r\n9   Trippin' (Vocals) w/ Freeze & Mean Mark (3:09) \r\n10 Uppineah (Vocals) w/ Freeze & Mean Mark (2:35) \r\n    \r\n","options":[{"id":681265,"name":"Default","price":3.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/884030/-/2794680872_4f2011250a_m.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/884030/-/2794680872_4f2011250a_m.jpg","width":240,"height":180}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":143477,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":148155,"name":"Recoil Collage 21","permalink":"recoil-collage-21","position":3,"price":30.0,"default_price":30.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/recoil-collage-21","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-09-06T02:41:47.000Z","description":"11\" x 8½\" collage culled from material in the August '08 issue of West Michigan News & Entertainment/News Satire publication, Recoil Magazine.","options":[{"id":681276,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/884038/-/2807285911_cc87603416.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/884038/-/2807285911_cc87603416.jpg","width":500,"height":361}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":143485,"name":"Artwork","permalink":"artwork","url":"/category/artwork"}]},{"id":148156,"name":"Recoil Collage 20","permalink":"recoil-collage-20","position":4,"price":30.0,"default_price":30.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/recoil-collage-20","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-09-06T02:43:05.000Z","description":"8½\" x 11\" collage culled from material in the July '08 issue of West Michigan News & Entertainment/News Satire publication, Recoil Magazine.","options":[{"id":681277,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/884042/-/2713040224_41ccf14a41.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/884042/-/2713040224_41ccf14a41.jpg","width":376,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":143485,"name":"Artwork","permalink":"artwork","url":"/category/artwork"}]},{"id":148157,"name":"Recoil Collage 19","permalink":"recoil-collage-19","position":5,"price":30.0,"default_price":30.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/recoil-collage-19","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-09-06T02:44:07.000Z","description":"8½\" x 11\" collage culled from material in the June '08 issue of West Michigan News & Entertainment/News Satire publication, Recoil Magazine.","options":[{"id":681279,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/884046/-/2615608282_45c7f23638.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/884046/-/2615608282_45c7f23638.jpg","width":378,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":143485,"name":"Artwork","permalink":"artwork","url":"/category/artwork"}]}]
