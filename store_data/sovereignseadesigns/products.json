The numbers you recieve may be different from the ones pictured here, but you can be sure they'll have the same nerdtastic appeal. \r\n\r\nI use a water resistant epoxy, but since one element of these earrings is paper, you should remove them before bathing or swimming.\r\n\r\nFYI - this pair is my own, the 810.9 is a book of American Literary Masters, and the 299.16 from a book on Celtic Folklore.\r\n","options":[{"id":12033398,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/34973078/-/Earring_Trays_and_Librarian_017.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/34973078/-/Earring_Trays_and_Librarian_017.jpg","width":964,"height":876}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
