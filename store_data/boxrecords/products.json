They make a big loud raucous circus like clatter comprising of pounding drums, detuned guitar, gnarly baritone sax and sticky banshee vocals. Sometimes playful, sometimes minimal, always noisy! Beauty Pageant's searing new EP drives hone the bands' desire to offer you something out of the ordinary. Trouncing waves of distortion are delivered over a bed of vigorous clunk and interwoven with sporadic invasions of erratic baritone sax. Revered in their hometown for their unbridled live shows, Beauty Pageant's unique and chaotic sound has been expertly captured on ‘Torso'.\r\n\r\nFor fans of broken riffs, repetitive beats and creeping people out.\r\n\r\nwww.box-records.com","options":[{"id":43408629,"name":"Default","price":6.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":6.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124247469/-/Front_Cover_-_Beauty_Pageant_-_Torso.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124247469/-/Front_Cover_-_Beauty_Pageant_-_Torso.jpg","width":570,"height":570}],"artists":[{"id":232782,"name":"Beauty Pageant","permalink":"beauty-pageant","url":"/artist/beauty-pageant"}],"categories":[{"id":219252,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":11079282,"name":"Khunnt - Dead Eyes 12\"","permalink":"khunnt-dead-eyes-12","position":2,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/khunnt-dead-eyes-12","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-10T19:23:17.000Z","description":"180g 12” w/ hand screen printed sleeves.\r\n\r\nFormed in 2006, Khünnt have fervently explored the boundaries of esoteric music, from minimalist noise to live improvisation and psychedelic mantra. Focusing exclusively on a more aggravated and blighted composition, 'Dead Eyes' reflects the bands most recent forages into noise and sludge. Comparable to works by Corrupted, Khanate and Noothgrush, the bleak and at times unbearable landscape of 'Dead Eyes' is a passage of hypnotic despair.\r\n\r\nSludgelord – “If you want something bleak to take over your soul then you have found the right band for you. Excellent and highly recommended”\r\n\r\nBeard Rock -“Whatever audio system you choose to play Khünnt on will sound fucked beyond repair. The vocalist sounds like he’s been smoking the bones of a dead elephant. It is truly horrible and immensely satisfying.”\r\n\r\nBoomkat – “Dead Eyes displays a fearsome mastery of their sound, erecting walls of feedback and distortion only to tear them down with bare-fisted riffs and wraith-like howls. Powerful stuff – highly recommended”\r\n \r\nRush On Rock – “Like a perpetually tortured entity, their frustration crawls out in the most agonising, bone-grinding, existential struggle, echoing similar threads tp Gnaw Their Tongues, but in a more doom oriented fashion.”\r\n \r\nThe Ripple Effect – “Everything is drenched in tar. This kind of guitar fuzz played along to such plodding rhythms is probably only soothing to me or other die hard funs of sludge but it does the trick. It has a cool evil vibe, not unlike Burning Witch.”\r\n\r\nBoomkat - “'Dead Eyes' displays a fearsome mastery of their sound, erecting walls of feedback and distortion only to tear them down with bare-fisted riffs and wraith-like howls.
