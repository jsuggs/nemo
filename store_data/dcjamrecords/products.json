With\r\na blistering combination of punk and funk, they\r\ndemolished genre walls and challenged the racial\r\nstereotypes and political order of the music\r\nindustry and the nation.\r\n\r\nFormed in 1979 in South Central Los Angeles,\r\nFishbone landed a major label record deal soon\r\nafter the members graduated from high school.\r\nHowever, after this early success the band\r\nstruggled for acceptance in a racially stratified\r\nmusic industry while their unabashedly hybrid\r\nstyle kept them proudly out of fashion. When the\r\ngroup emerged in the 80s, America s melting pot\r\nwas being stirred by a mosh pit of disenfranchised\r\nyouth confronted with lingering racial and economic\r\nissues left unresolved by previous generations.\r\nToday, the band members are increasingly\r\nrecognized as pioneers, and younger musicians\r\noften cite them as big influences in creating new\r\nmusical possibilities in a blooming multicultural\r\nworld. As Gwen Stefani of No Doubt remembers,\r\nFishbone was the band that gave us the inspiration\r\nto be a band. They are just so unique and that is\r\nwhat I love ... that they were super underground.

In \r\n2004, Jeff Nelson (co-founder of \r\nDischord Records and former \r\ndrummer of Minor Threat) visited \r\nToledo because of his obsession \r\nwith old Jeep Wagoneers. After \r\nvisiting the old Jeep plant and \r\nthe Toledo Museum of Art, he \r\nwas stunned to come across the\r\nlargest neighborhood of Victorian \r\nhouses east of the Mississippi. \r\nHaving dreamed of owning a \r\nVictorian for years, Jeff returned \r\na year later, and while looking at\r\nhouses there with a realtor, he \r\nheard music coming from the park \r\nacross the street. Minutes later, \r\nhe struck up a conversation with \r\nthe guitarist. Tony later gave him \r\na demo of his band, and jaded as \r\nJeff was, he could not stop listening \r\nto it. Although he had not played \r\ndrums in 12 years, and was \r\nnotoriously picky, he was so \r\nimpressed by Tony's guitar, vocals, \r\nand songwriting that after moving\r\n to Toledo he came out of retirement\r\nto join Tony’s band. After many \r\ndifferent lineup changes, bassist\r\nMahlon Orrin and keyboard player \r\nErika Kuester joined Tony and\r\nJeff to record their first album.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing overblown about\r\nthe melodies, arrangements and \r\nmusicianship of this appealing, \r\ngently eclectic Ohio quartet\"\r\n-The Washington Post\r\n\r\n1 Berlin\r\n2 Trouble Now\r\n3 Can I Believe in You?\r\n4 Miles From Nowhere\r\n5 Stay Tonight\r\n6 Wears Me Down\r\n7 Ready When You Are\r\n8 Pictures of You and Me\r\n9 Hand Me Down\r\n10 Sad Lie\r\n11 The Wolves\r\n12 Out of Time\r\n","options":[{"id":13317897,"name":"Default","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/39152469/-/fpof.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/39152469/-/fpof.jpg","width":200,"height":200}],"artists":[{"id":71391,"name":"Fast Piece Of Furniture","permalink":"fast-piece-of-furniture","url":"/artist/fast-piece-of-furniture"}],"categories":[{"id":2218949,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":4019559,"name":"Government Issue \"The Punk Remains the Same\" 7\" vinyl","permalink":"government-issue-the-punk-remains-the-same-7-vinyl","position":15,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/government-issue-the-punk-remains-the-same-7-vinyl","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-07-01T21:04:32.000Z","description":"Brand New EP release from the DC boys that need no introduction with 5 never before released live tracks that were recorded in 1982 at the Wilson Center and 1983 at Space II Video Arcade In Washington DC.\r\n\r\n1.Notch In My Crotch \r\n2.Snubbing \r\n3.Hour Of One \r\n4.Happy People \r\n5.Sheer Terror\r\n","options":[{"id":13331537,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/39202651/-/GI_Cvr_Vnyl_300dpi.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/39202651/-/GI_Cvr_Vnyl_300dpi.jpg","width":1000,"height":992}],"artists":[{"id":71373,"name":"Government Issue","permalink":"government-issue","url":"/artist/government-issue"}],"categories":[{"id":2218949,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":4014809,"name":"Government Issue \"The Punk Remains the Same\" CD","permalink":"government-issue-the-punk-remains-the-same-cd","position":16,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/government-issue-the-punk-remains-the-same-cd","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-06-30T23:57:16.000Z","description":"Brand New EP release from the DC boys that need no introduction with 5 never before released live tracks that were recorded in 1982 at the Wilson Center and 1983 at Space II Video Arcade In Washington DC.\r\n\r\n1.Notch In My Crotch\r\n2.Snubbing\r\n3.Hour Of One\r\n4.Happy People\r\n5.Sheer Terror","options":[{"id":13317513,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/39151373/-/GI.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/39151373/-/GI.jpg","width":200,"height":200}],"artists":[{"id":71373,"name":"Government Issue","permalink":"government-issue","url":"/artist/government-issue"}],"categories":[{"id":2218871,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":2221503,"name":"Sale Item","permalink":"sale-item","url":"/category/sale-item"}]},{"id":4013337,"name":"Machine 22 \"Off the Record\" CD","permalink":"machine-22-off-the-record-cd","position":17,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/machine-22-off-the-record-cd","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-06-30T19:14:47.000Z","description":"While not yet in the realm of classic \r\nAmerican genius, Minneapolis based \r\nMachine 22 have stayed true to the\r\nmusical poltergeist long established \r\nby Creedence, the Replacements, \r\nand Alex Chilton in the writing and\r\nrecording of this debut album titled \r\n\"Off the Record\".
