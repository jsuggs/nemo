They might all cross your path someday. They have shared with us their emotions, their art and their passion for travel.\r\n\r\nReykjavik Boulevard is a 162-pages-trip where curiosity meets artistic sensibility, so be curious: meet them all in this unique format guide!\r\n\r\n*** Due to the Christmas peak time, shipping might take a little longer ***\r\n\r\nFull description and more pictures of the Creative Guide on http://www.reykjavikboulevard.com/creative-guide","options":[{"id":49915065,"name":"Default","price":16.2,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.8,"amount_with_others":2.6,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":13.8,"amount_with_others":6.6}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128924082/-/Schermata_2013-12-05_alle_10.19.48.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128924082/-/Schermata_2013-12-05_alle_10.19.48.png","width":428,"height":570}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
