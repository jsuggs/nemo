While the theme of THE FARM was “to err is human, to forgive divine”, we now delve more deeply and find hope for “reconciliation and release”. Angola is America’s oldest and largest prison, with 5,000 inmates, most of whom have received life -, or death-, sentences for violent crimes, and will never leave Angola. THE FARM continues to provide extraordinary opportunities for learning through storytelling.\r\n\r\nFor National Geographic Channel\r\n2009\r\n1x90 minutes\r\n","options":[{"id":1574961,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3512364/-/10downcartel.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3512364/-/10downcartel.jpg","width":833,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":311071,"name":"DVDs","permalink":"dvds","url":"/category/dvds"}]},{"id":391587,"name":"THE FARM: LIFE INSIDE ANGOLA PRISON","permalink":"the-farm-life-inside-angola-prison","position":2,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-farm-life-inside-angola-prison","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-09-08T22:45:51.000Z","description":"THE FARM: LIFE INSIDE ANGOLA PRISON intimately captured the day-to-day reality of six men living – and dying- in America’s largest and oldest penal institution.

Many women served as combatants in rebel factions and were both the victims and perpetrators of unspeakable atrocities. This documentary short is a beautiful and moving tale of the journey these women must make as they resolve to either seek revenge against those who stole their childhoods, or seek forgiveness and reintegration into their communities. They courageously choose to release the darkness in their souls by sharing their intimate stories, in order to, in the words of one, “become a human being”.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentary Short \r\n2008 \r\n1x25 minutes","options":[{"id":1575052,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3170399/-/cartelrr.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3170399/-/cartelrr.jpg","width":172,"height":128}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":311071,"name":"DVDs","permalink":"dvds","url":"/category/dvds"}]}]
