They are a good choice for most surfaces and are made of pure squirrel and black ox hair. \r\n\r\nThese brushes have a lot of similarities to the Mack 1962 Series and are the same daily go-to brushes used in our studio. The set contains (4) brush sizes which will work for the majority of lettering projects, which include: (1) .5\" (1) .375\" (1) .25\" (1) .125\"\r\n\r\nThis is a Limited Edition Series and we only have a small stock on hand. Once these are gone, they are gone for good. Mack has been the leader in lettering brushes since 1891 and have been our brush of choice since the 1980s.\r\n\r\nAvailable exclusively here in our store.
