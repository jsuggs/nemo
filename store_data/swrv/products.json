If you were in NYC in 2003, you will definitely remember this monumental blackout and how it shut everything down. And if you weren't, you're in for a good story. One superhot day in August, just before sun down,  trains, elevators, lights and all shut down across the entire Big Apple due to an oversurge of energy. Millions of people crossed the Brooklyn Bridge in the dark, danced in Union Square in the dark and flooded the streets in panic and amazement. While people couldn't turn on their tvs (and didn't have Twitter) they did what was natural...came together to watch the stars in the sky.
