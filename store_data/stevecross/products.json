Hours, weeks, months – what seems like a lifetime – has been spent sitting in cafes reading, writing, drawing and observing.\r\nWhat you see here is a small caffeinated collection of visual diary pages, a recollection of the past three years of my life.\r\nThese are not finished works, they’re simply rough caffeine sketches, the results of long hours spent drinking coffee in cafes all across the world.\r\nEnjoy.
