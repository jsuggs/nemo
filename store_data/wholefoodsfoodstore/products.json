Since 2005 Organic Indulgence has developed a range of organic dips that have redefined the taste of commercially prepared food. The key is the application of a home-made mentality to a large scale output; the beetroot is cooked from scratch, the carrots are peeled by hand and the herbs are fresh, not dried. Top quality sunflower oil is used instead of the highly processed canola oil found in many brands. These high standards and the best quality ingredients result in a delicious, naturally organic taste bursting with home-cooked goodness. One taste and you'll be hooked.\r\n\r\nWholefoods Food Store stocks a large range of Organic Indulgence dips.
