This is a very satisfying doll to make even though I feel it is the most difficult. If one can really curb the tendency to over-stuffing, then, all will be well. Baby Companion is a doll that can take being slept all over and dragged everywhere. It is easy to repair, so you won't be bothered as much as with a button-jointed doll. This baby will need many baths in the sink with luke-warm water!\r\n\r\nPattern comes complete with detailed instructions, diagrams and pattern pieces to make this wonderful 16\" Baby Companion Doll, Nightgown, Nightsac and Diaper.\r\n\r\nFor a list of materials needed to complete this doll, see the additional photos for this item.\r\n\r\nWe have the items needed to make this doll available for purchase. \r\nPlease see our SUPPLIES category or purchase a complete KIT to make this doll.
