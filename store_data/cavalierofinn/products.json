A piece of London history destined to be an antique of the future.\r\n\r\nSingle destination solid mahogany light boxes, wall mounted, vintage style cable, containing original destination paper.\r\n\r\nAbout Rebecca Oldfield\r\n\r\nBecky Oldfield marries the traditional with the contemporary to create an original yet evocative range of products. This contemporary nostalgia has broad appeal and sits comfortably in both traditional and modern surroundings.\r\n\r\nRecycling within design is more relevant than ever. Becky's work attempts to look beyond recycling and asks the question \"what makes an object worth saving?\". Is it purely sentiment that makes us hold onto things? The value we place on objects today has changed. Lost and Found endeavours to reintroduce this sense of value by using forgotten skills and forgotten objects to create new pieces, modern collectables from traditional sources.\r\n\r\n‘The devil is in the detail’ Becky is keen to emphasise the heritage of the materials used and the processes by which they are revived as well as celebrating the finished works themselves. The involvement of the client can be key; personal collectables are often incorporated into the work in order to bring a third dimension, a connection with the work, thus hopefully rendering it a desirable object of personal worth.\r\n\r\nFrom source to salvage to studio to home, the whole process is a story Becky thinks deserves to be told.\r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n\r\nWe have this item in stock, expect delivery in 2-5 days.","options":[{"id":50194488,"name":"Default","price":395.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129076641/-/photo.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129076641/-/photo.JPG","width":640,"height":480}],"artists":[{"id":51387,"name":"Becky Oldfield","permalink":"becky-oldfield","url":"/artist/becky-oldfield"}],"categories":[{"id":1847781,"name":"Contemporary Design","permalink":"contemporary-design","url":"/category/contemporary-design"}]},{"id":15412068,"name":"Trevor Burgess: A Place to Live 62","permalink":"trevor-burgess-a-place-to-live-62","position":2,"price":680.0,"default_price":680.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/trevor-burgess-a-place-to-live-62","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-08T10:56:14.000Z","description":"Oil on board\r\n34cm x 41cm\r\n\r\nAbout Trevor Burgess\r\n\r\nRecent regional prize winner of the The Discerning Eye, most of Trevor's work is about the ordinary business of living. Trevor is interested in a painting that explores relationships, people, contemporary urban spaces.\r\n\r\nAlthough people tend to be the focus of attention, he is also concerned with the context of social interaction. There are recurring themes in the pictures which fascinate him, such as the interplay of signs within the cityscape, or how urban architecture creates a visually distinctive micro-environment at street level, and how momentary appearances are registered, glimpsed or over-looked in passing by.\r\n\r\nTrevor’s work developed over a period of time when he was exploring the use of a less literally descriptive, painterly, figurative language in a series of paintings on the theme of the family, which culminated in some large works done on the MA Fine Art course in Barcelona in 1997/8. After this Trevor moved to London, and felt the need for a more concrete subject and specificity for his work. He turned to the immediate urban environment, and began using his own photographs as source material.\r\n\r\nTrevor does not attempt to replicate the conventions of photography. In all representational art there is a gap between what is depicted and how it’s depicted. The peculiar pleasures of painting, for him, are all about this gap.\r\n\r\nHe uses a glossy liquid paint which brings out the flashes of bright colour that animate urban space. The fluidity, coarseness and texture of the paint contribute to a sense of the thickening of the air in the urban atmosphere, the ambiguity and the discontinuity of visual experience.\r\n\r\nThe recent series, \"A Place to Live\" draws on property adverts in newspapers. These paintings use thin glazes directly onto plywood, which absorbs the colour.\r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n\r\nWe work with specialist art handlers to deliver our paintings and wall work.

Her recent paintings focus on liminal spaces, when shifts in light have a transformative effect on the landscape and suggest a threshold between the everyday and the extraordinary. The landscapes draw upon observation, memory and invention to present an ambiguous and elusive reality at a point where the familiar is rendered strangely unfamiliar. Always uninhabited, these illusionary scenes are often played out at night; the anonymity of woodland, still lakes and deserted roads, attempting to assimilate themselves into the viewer’s own memories, weaving together narratives of places both real and imagined.\r\n\r\nThe work varies in size from the intimacy of the miniature pieces on cast resin and panel - the Cabinet Painting series - to monumental scale large landscapes on canvas.\r\n\r\nFormal influences shaping Gill's work include the landscapes of German Romantic painters such as Caspar David Friedrich and The Sublime within English Romantic painting to American photographers and filmmakers such as Robert Adams and David Lynch. Her subject matter is directly influenced by Gill's own experience and travel often forms an integral part of the development of new bodies of work.\r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe work with specialist art handlers to deliver our paintings and wall work.

Formal influences shaping Victoria’s work include the old masters such as Velasquez to the more contemporary figurative artist, Alice Neel. \r\n\r\nVictoria believes the painted portrait still has a great deal to offer as a unique, handmade, often protracted response to the way we look at a face, in contrast to the ever present photographic world.\r\n\r\nVictoria has been awarded The Elizabeth Greenshield Foundation award for painting, The Cyril Sweet Award and The Woo Foundation Art Award. Her work is included in the Private Saatchi Collection and has been featured in publications such as ‘Young British Art’ – The Saatchi Decade and ‘The New Neurotic Realism’ The Saatchi Gallery, London\r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe work with specialist art handlers to deliver our paintings and wall work.

As a process this allows Sam to embroider a new history into them and makes each one slightly different. The shape of the chair allows the print to flow into the chair structure, giving a figurative character and seeming to personify the piece.  \r\n\r\nEach chair is fully reconditioned and upholstered by Sam with his design.  \r\n\r\nAbout Sam Edkins\r\n\r\nSam Edkins is a London based artist/designer living and working in London.\r\n\r\nHe studied Fine Art at Goldsmiths College. Sam's work is a combination of the sculptural and the practical.  By working with antique pieces, Sam successfully marries the old with the new, creating something altogether contemporary and bespoke. His work combines traditional craft and technology. \r\n\r\nTaking inspiration from the cabinet of curiosity, museums and personal collections alike, Sam uses them as a source of reference, visually, conceptually and historically. Containing a degree of nostalgia all of his work harks back to a time when knowledge was craved and a desire to understand the world was paramount.\r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nWe have this and a number of other anatomically correct chairs in stock in various designs.

The collections traditionally contain vast numbers of insects carefully preserved, pined, categorized and displayed.\r\n\r\nIn an almost anarchic break from traditional display the bugs contained within the pieces burst out of their petrified state and back to life seeming to move freely across the surface of the works. In turn creating an uneasy sense of chaos and decay to the decadently over stuffed pieces of furniture. Some pieces remain more rigid and true to the museum format; with the traditional buttoning bringing a sense of structure.\r\n\r\nThe works are all old pieces fully reconditioned and upholstered. As a process this allows Sam to embroider a new history into them and makes each one bespoke. They are chosen for their overstuffed, bourgeois nature, which creates an evocative contrast next to the sense of decay lent by the bugs bursting from the seams freely occupying the pieces. The minimal color palette and simple use of fabric is intended to reflect the under layers of traditionally upholstery which usually remain hidden by heavy top fabrics.\r\n\r\nThe images are sourced from old natural history journals, adapted and then digitally printed.\r\n\r\nAbout Sam Edkins\r\n\r\nSam completed his BA in Fine Art at Goldsmiths College and has had exhibitions in the Hamburg School of Art (HBFK), Germany, 2010 and the Condemned Exhibition, Hackney Wick, 2009\r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n\r\nAs all of our items are bespoke and made to order by our artists and designers, delivery may take up to six or this case eight weeks.

Exhibitions include Brave Soldier and Black Butterfly; a solo exhibition at Liberty of London and an exhibition at Skylark, the artist-run gallery at the Oxo Tower on London’s South Bank.\r\n\r\nAchievements include a tea set for the Liverpool Tate to support their Alice in Wonderland exhibition, a tea set collection she created for Paul Smith, and a greeting card collection for Liberty of London. Her work has appeared in Company magazine, The Independent on Sunday and Elle Decoration to name but a few.\r\n\r\nAli's work is fundamentally an amalgamation of personal experiences, family history, religion and identity and also the relationship between the individual to the material.\r\n\r\nMemory for Ali is a source of euphoric inspiration and, whilst her work might signify a nostalgic reminiscence of years past, it also carries with it the weight of pressures and experience of real life. It is the memories that Ali believes shapes her life and art, first and foremost.\r\n\r\nShe presents these to the viewer as an aesthetic composition enriched by the use of different textures, material and patterns: the artworks created are an expression of Ali’s design perspective and interest in family history - an unusual combination, but one that succeeds in creating artwork of remarkable intimacy and harmonious composition.\r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n\r\nWe have this range in stock so delivery should be expected within 2-5 days.\r\n","options":[{"id":48029820,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.95,"amount_with_others":2.95,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127504905/-/milk_jug_home_sweet_home.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127504905/-/milk_jug_home_sweet_home.jpg","width":800,"height":861}],"artists":[{"id":101283,"name":"Ali Miller","permalink":"ali-miller","url":"/artist/ali-miller"}],"categories":[{"id":1847779,"name":"Ceramics","permalink":"ceramics","url":"/category/ceramics"}]},{"id":14818788,"name":"Mineheart: Classics Revisited Cushions","permalink":"mineheart-classics-revisited-cushions","position":31,"price":72.0,"default_price":72.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mineheart-classics-revisited-cushions","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-13T15:53:06.000Z","description":"Cushions designed by American Artist Chad Wys, cotton satin, backed with black cotton and with feather filled pads, 45 cm x 45 cm\r\n\r\nAbout Chad Wys \r\n\r\nIn this collaboration between artist Chad Wys and UK designers Mineheart, the Classics Revisited cushions are based on a series of Chad's paintings called the 'Nocturne' series.  In these works Chad took portraits from the Renaissance era and then openly played with the allure of foreign and aggressive new colors and forms into the otherwise familiar and traditional settings. Barriers and obstacles were created between the viewer and the object through which one must negotiate an understanding of what is both present and hidden.\r\n\r\nAbout Mineheart\r\n\r\nMineheart produces furniture, lighting, wallpaper and interior accessories. The pieces are on the boundary between objects of art and mass produced items and many of the products are made to order or produced in small batches by UK based craftspeople.\r\n\r\nMineheart proudly supports British design and manufacturing. All Mineheart products are produced in the UK by passionate people who enjoy what they do; they hope this love is captured inside their pieces and their quality. \r\n\r\nMineheart was launched in 2010 by designers Brendan Young and Vanessa Battaglia of Studiomold and Young & Battaglia. The duo is known for their playful approach to design, and innovative re-appropriation of materials and imagery. \r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n\r\nAs all of our items are bespoke and made to order by our artists and designers, delivery may take from 2 days if we have something in stock to up to six weeks if we don't.

Her recent paintings focus on liminal spaces, when shifts in light have a transformative effect on the landscape and suggest a threshold between the everyday and the extraordinary. The landscapes draw upon observation, memory and invention to present an ambiguous and elusive reality at a point where the familiar is rendered strangely unfamiliar. Always uninhabited, these illusionary scenes are often played out at night; the anonymity of woodland, still lakes and deserted roads, attempting to assimilate themselves into the viewer’s own memories, weaving together narratives of places both real and imagined.\r\n\r\nThe work varies in size from the intimacy of the miniature pieces on cast resin and panel - the Cabinet Painting series - to monumental scale large landscapes on canvas.\r\n\r\nFormal influences shaping Gill's work include the landscapes of German Romantic painters such as Caspar David Friedrich and The Sublime within English Romantic painting to American photographers and filmmakers such as Robert Adams and David Lynch. Her subject matter is directly influenced by Gill's own experience and travel often forms an integral part of the development of new bodies of work.\r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe work with specialist art handlers to deliver our paintings and wall work.

Her recent paintings focus on liminal spaces, when shifts in light have a transformative effect on the landscape and suggest a threshold between the everyday and the extraordinary. The landscapes draw upon observation, memory and invention to present an ambiguous and elusive reality at a point where the familiar is rendered strangely unfamiliar. Always uninhabited, these illusionary scenes are often played out at night; the anonymity of woodland, still lakes and deserted roads, attempting to assimilate themselves into the viewer’s own memories, weaving together narratives of places both real and imagined.\r\n\r\nThe work varies in size from the intimacy of the miniature pieces on cast resin and panel - the Cabinet Painting series - to the monumental scale of the large landscapes on canvas like this one featured here.\r\n\r\nFormal influences shaping Gill's work include the landscapes of German Romantic painters such as Caspar David Friedrich and The Sublime within English Romantic painting to American photographers and filmmakers such as Robert Adams and David Lynch. Her subject matter is directly influenced by Gill's own experience and travel often forms an integral part of the development of new bodies of work.\r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe work with specialist art handlers to deliver our paintings and wall work.

As a process this allows Sam to embroider a new history into them and makes each one slightly different. The shape of the chair allows the print to flow into the chair structure, giving a figurative character and seeming to personify the piece.  \r\n\r\nEach chair is fully reconditioned and upholstered by Sam with his design.  \r\n\r\nAbout Sam Edkins\r\n\r\nSam Edkins is a London based artist/designer living and working in London.\r\n\r\nHe studied Fine Art at Goldsmiths College. Sam's work is a combination of the sculptural and the practical.  By working with antique pieces, Sam successfully marries the old with the new, creating something altogether contemporary and bespoke. His work combines traditional craft and technology. \r\n\r\nTaking inspiration from the cabinet of curiosity, museums and personal collections alike, Sam uses them as a source of reference, visually, conceptually and historically. Containing a degree of nostalgia all of his work harks back to a time when knowledge was craved and a desire to understand the world was paramount.\r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nWe have this and a number of other anatomically correct chairs in stock in various designs.

The people he paints are popular icons, but he is neither a pop artist nor a portraitist. He isn’t po-faced but he doesn’t do irony either. “I love pop art but it’s not my sensibility”. He stresses “I think my paintings are quite physical – not in a macho way, but I want to feel my way in. They’re all images we know really well, but I need to have my own empathy with them. \r\nBeaver’s on-going preoccupation with the king of Carry On dates from childhood “I remember hearing Kenneth Williams on the radio when I was small and thinking what is this strange thing? We’re all so used to him now, but when you think about him he was such an extraordinary personality-just completely outrageous, we forget how incredibly he is”. But there’s more to these paintings than a recognisable grimace. “I really liked Francis Bacon’s paintings of the screaming pope, and I was also struck by Munch’s “The Scream” when I was younger so I wanted to do a really English version”, he explains. “Bacon’s scream reaches such a point of despair that it disintegrates towards the mouth, and with Munch the whole landscape is a scream. But the difference with Kenneth Williams is that the sound isn’t coming out, it’s going in.”\r\n\r\nWhatever Beaver’s feelings for his subjects the source is always specific. Each face comes from a freeze-framed video image, which is then photographed directly from the television screen. These snapshots of blurred gestures and snatched moments lie scattered, crumpled and paint-spotted all over the studio floor. Mention the word photo-realist though, and you get a flinch, and certainly there’s nothing photographic about the end result.\r\n\r\nTony Beaver went to Goldsmiths’ College in the mid-Eighties, just before Hirst and Co. where he was taught by Brit-art mentor Michael Craig Martin.\r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n\r\nWe work with specialist art handlers to deliver our paintings and wall work.

Her recent paintings focus on liminal spaces, when shifts in light have a transformative effect on the landscape and suggest a threshold between the everyday and the extraordinary. The landscapes draw upon observation, memory and invention to present an ambiguous and elusive reality at a point where the familiar is rendered strangely unfamiliar. Always uninhabited, these illusionary scenes are often played out at night; the anonymity of woodland, still lakes and deserted roads, attempting to assimilate themselves into the viewer’s own memories, weaving together narratives of places both real and imagined.\r\n\r\nThe work varies in size from the intimacy of the miniature pieces on cast resin and panel - the Cabinet Painting series - to the monumental scale of the large landscapes on canvas like this one featured here. \r\n\r\nFormal influences shaping Gill's work include the landscapes of German Romantic painters such as Caspar David Friedrich and The Sublime within English Romantic painting to American photographers and filmmakers such as Robert Adams and David Lynch. Her subject matter is directly influenced by Gill's own experience and travel often forms an integral part of the development of new bodies of work.\r\n\r\nDelivery \r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe work with specialist art handlers to deliver our paintings and wall work.

As a process this allows Sam to embroider a new history into them and makes each one slightly different. The shape of the chair allows the print to flow into the chair structure, giving a figurative character and seeming to personify the piece.  \r\n\r\nEach chair is fully reconditioned and upholstered by Sam with his design.  \r\n\r\nAbout Sam Edkins\r\n\r\nSam Edkins is a London based artist/designer living and working in London.\r\n\r\nHe studied Fine Art at Goldsmiths College. Sam's work is a combination of the sculptural and the practical.  By working with antique pieces, Sam successfully marries the old with the new, creating something altogether contemporary and bespoke. His work combines traditional craft and technology. \r\n\r\nTaking inspiration from the cabinet of curiosity, museums and personal collections alike, Sam uses them as a source of reference, visually, conceptually and historically. Containing a degree of nostalgia all of his work harks back to a time when knowledge was craved and a desire to understand the world was paramount.\r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nWe have sold out of this chair.

As a process this allows Sam to embroider a new history into them and makes each one slightly different. The shape of the chair allows the print to flow into the chair structure, giving a figurative character and seeming to personify the piece.  \r\n\r\nEach chair is fully reconditioned and upholstered by Sam with his design.  \r\n\r\nAbout Sam Edkins\r\n\r\nSam Edkins is a London based artist/designer living and working in London.\r\n\r\nHe studied Fine Art at Goldsmiths College. Sam's work is a combination of the sculptural and the practical.  By working with antique pieces, Sam successfully marries the old with the new, creating something altogether contemporary and bespoke. His work combines traditional craft and technology. \r\n\r\nTaking inspiration from the cabinet of curiosity, museums and personal collections alike, Sam uses them as a source of reference, visually, conceptually and historically. Containing a degree of nostalgia all of his work harks back to a time when knowledge was craved and a desire to understand the world was paramount.\r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nWe have this and a number of other anatomically correct chairs in stock in various designs.

The collections traditionally contain vast numbers of insects carefully preserved, pined, categorized and displayed.\r\n\r\nIn an almost anarchic break from traditional display the bugs contained within the pieces burst out of their petrified state and back to life seeming to move freely across the surface of the chairs. In turn creating an uneasy sense of chaos and decay to the decadently over stuffed pieces of furniture. Some pieces remain more rigid and true to the museum format; with the traditional buttoning bringing a sense of structure.\r\n\r\nThe chairs are old pieces fully reconditioned and upholstered. As a process this allows me to embroider a new history into them and makes each one bespoke. They are chosen for their overstuffed, bourgeois nature, which creates an evocative contrast next to the sense of decay lent by the bugs bursting from the seams freely occupying the pieces. The minimal color palette and simple use of fabric is intended to reflect the under layers of traditionally upholstery which usually remain hidden by heavy top fabrics.\r\n\r\nThe images are sourced from old natural history journals, adapted and then digitally printed.\r\n\r\nAbout Sam Edkins\r\n\r\nSam completed his BA in Fine Art at Goldsmiths College and has had exhibitions in the Hamburg School of Art (HBFK), Germany, 2010 and the Condemned Exhibition, Hackney Wick, 2009\r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n\r\nAs all of our items are bespoke and made to order by our artists and designers, delivery may take up to six or this case eight weeks.

Her recent paintings focus on liminal spaces, when shifts in light have a transformative effect on the landscape and suggest a threshold between the everyday and the extraordinary. The landscapes draw upon observation, memory and invention to present an ambiguous and elusive reality at a point where the familiar is rendered strangely unfamiliar. Always uninhabited, these illusionary scenes are often played out at night; the anonymity of woodland, still lakes and deserted roads, attempting to assimilate themselves into the viewer’s own memories, weaving together narratives of places both real and imagined.\r\n\r\nThe work varies in size from the intimacy of the miniature pieces on cast resin and panel - the Cabinet Painting series - to the monumental scale of the large landscapes on canvas. The Cabinet Paintings allude to the tradition of intimate and secretive collections of small works made popular in the 15th C in Europe.\r\n\r\nFormal influences shaping Gill's work include the landscapes of German Romantic painters such as Caspar David Friedrich and The Sublime within English Romantic painting to American photographers and filmmakers such as Robert Adams and David Lynch. Her subject matter is directly influenced by Gill's own experience and travel often forms an integral part of the development of new bodies of work.\r\n\r\nDelivery \r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe work with specialist art handlers to deliver our paintings and wall work.

Her work is influenced by memory and the relationship between people and objects.\r\n\r\nAlexena’s background is far from conventional, brought up on a Leicestershire farm, she was introduced to art at an early age by her father, also a trained furniture designer. After graduating from a Fine Art degree Alexena became interested in pursuing a career within the social sector, working in art therapy and then as a paramedic. In 2003 Alexena returned to university to study design. Her work is informed by her experiences of working with people, of gathering stories and wanting to retell narratives through objects.\r\n\r\nAlexena’s work is diverse. Her ceramic hip flask and silver chip fork play with ideas regarding the value of objects and reflect her interest in Britishness. Her latest work is inspired by the traditional skills and materials of Midlands based shoemakers and saddlery companies. The companies work in areas of the UK renowned for these manufacturing industries and all of their work is made by hand by skilled craftsmen and women. The Brogue Wingback Armchair has been reupholstered with leather brogue patterns hand-crafted by Cheaney Shoes in Northamptonshire and Scottish Tweed.\r\n\r\nAlexena Cayless was Designer in Residence at the Design Museum 2010\r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n\r\nAs all of our items are bespoke and made to order by our artists and designers, delivery may take up to eight weeks.

The viewpoint of each piece is low, as seen by a child, and wallpaper featured is suggestive of a family home. It would be easy to view these works as sinister, the series title suggests otherwise and immediately challenges our perception of the pieces. Each piece is named ‘The Last Place You Thought I Would Be’, in doing os Alison transports us back to our own childhood home, instigating emotions from the time, perhaps the daunting prospect of life beyond the house.\r\n\r\nAlison graduated from Central Saint Martins in 2012 with a BA (Hons) in Fine art, where her work was described by Jonathan Jones of The Guardian as ‘curious and memorable’ when he saw it at the final year show. While still studying, Alison had her work included in a number of group shows around London, including Chateau D’lf at Shoreditch Town Hall in 2009 and at the OXO in 2011. She was selected for the Clyde & Co. Art Award in 2012 as part of their Community Investment programme to support and mentor emerging artists.","options":[{"id":24802359,"name":"Default","price":250.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/77173404/-/The-Last-Place-You-Thought-I-Would-Be-Nr3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/77173404/-/The-Last-Place-You-Thought-I-Would-Be-Nr3.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":150357,"name":"Alison Griffin","permalink":"alison-griffin","url":"/artist/alison-griffin"}],"categories":[{"id":1848499,"name":"Paintings and Wall Art","permalink":"paintings-and-wall-art","url":"/category/paintings-and-wall-art"}]},{"id":7628214,"name":"Pia Wustenberg:  Red Stacking Vessels","permalink":"pia-wustenberg-red-stacking-vessels","position":126,"price":795.0,"default_price":795.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pia-wustenberg-red-stacking-vessels","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-22T14:53:58.000Z","description":"Nominated by Elle Decoration for the British Design Awards 2012, Royal College of Art graduate, Pia Wustenberg produces these gorgeous functional sculptures made from ceramics, glass and wood.\r\n\r\nEach of the 3 elements to each sculptural vessel is the fruit of careful craftsmanship: wood turning, ceramic throwing and glass blowing form the functional sculptures. The individual components are positioned into one another, the wood being burned to fit into the hot glass profile, to create a single piece.\r\n\r\nAbout Pia Wustenberg\r\n\r\nA young Finnish-German designer, Pia graduated from Bucks New University in 2008 with a collection of mixed media furniture, having spent her final year focused on wood construction in combination with other materials (ceramic, glass, leather). She completed her postgraduate studies in Design Products at the Royal College of Arts carrying out research into craft and materials in contemporary culture.\r\n\r\nPia strongly believes a curious and observing mind is the main medium in a designer’s toolbox. Her aim is to design objects to contain stories she perceives as relevant today: juxtapositions of materials, surfaces, textures, symbols and colours can unfold to tell new stories through objects, just as letters and words make up the stories in a book. Her current research is concerned with urbanisation as a critical step in cultural evolution.

Trevor is interested in a painting that explores relationships, people, contemporary urban spaces.\r\n\r\nAlthough people tend to be the focus of attention, he is also concerned with the context of social interaction. There are recurring themes in the pictures which fascinate him, such as the interplay of signs within the cityscape, or how urban architecture creates a visually distinctive micro-environment at street level, and how momentary appearances are registered, glimpsed or over-looked in passing by.\r\n\r\nTrevor’s work developed over a period of time when he was exploring the use of a less literally descriptive, painterly, figurative language in a series of paintings on the theme of the family, which culminated in some large works done on the MA Fine Art course in Barcelona in 1997/8. After this Trevor moved to London, and felt the need for a more concrete subject and specificity for his work. He turned to the immediate urban environment, and began using his own photographs as source material.\r\n\r\nTrevor does not attempt to replicate the conventions of photography. In all representational art there is a gap between what is depicted and how it’s depicted. The peculiar pleasures of painting, for him, are all about this gap.\r\n\r\nHe uses a glossy liquid paint which brings out the flashes of bright colour that animate urban space. The fluidity, coarseness and texture of the paint contribute to a sense of the thickening of the air in the urban atmosphere, the ambiguity and the discontinuity of visual experience.\r\n\r\nIn his market stalls series, he explores how every shop and market stall trying to sell you something is wanting to catch your eye. Most of the intense colour on the street is there for that reason. In that way the paintings come to him ready-made: somebody has already done the composing.

Because of the way the clay moves in the kiln, each lamp is slightly different in form. The lamps have a bayonet bulb fitting, and are ideally suited to take a low-energy bulb.\r\n\r\nEach lamp is 20cm x 12cm diameter\r\n\r\nAbout Liz Emtage\r\n\r\nLiz Emtage Ceramics make bespoke, translucent, porcelain lighting, hand-built in unrestrained natural forms that exploit the malleable quality of the clay. These lamps are inlaid with different organic textures, which leave a delicate impression in the clay surface. When lit these lamps emit an ethereal glow, converting the surface decoration into textures of light. When off the lamps become sculptural pieces, rich with subtle surface pattern. The lamps are naturally ivory in colour, although they can have stains mixed into the clay body, creating subtle colour tones - which become more dramatic when the piece is illuminated.\r\n\r\nCurrently the range consists of table and floor lamps, pendant shades, standard lamps, wall lights and night lights. We also do commissions for clients and develop site specific pieces. Often working with architects, interior designers, visual merchandising managers for high end shops, hotels and restaurants. Individuals can request particular leaves or flowers from their gardens to be inlaid into their light, or a favourite pattern or texture.\r\n\r\nMore than 20 years experience has gone into the making of Liz Emtage’s unique porcelain lighting. A passion for art and design that has developed over a lifetime. Liz is inspired by the power and the beauty of the natural world. She constantly experiments with the clay in order to expand the range of lights and finishes that can be produced.\r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n\r\nWhile delivery will usually be within 2-5 days, because all of our items are bespoke and made to order by our artists/designers, delivery may take up to six weeks.

Initially she resisted the temptation to make a chandelier because that would be too obvious, however, she later succumbed and has been making them ever since.\r\n\r\nWhen she started to gather other things to make a structure with, she discovered that everything she needed was right there just waiting to be assembled; glass teacups, trifle moulds, tea strainers etc all for the taking. She'd never used a pastry cutter for pastry or a toast rack for toast but they seemed to have more potential, so she liberated them from their domestic duties by incorporating them in her chandeliers.\r\n\r\nMadeleine prefers to work with things she's found and let their qualities dictate what happens. Each piece is unique and begins with a really simple set of ideas, a shape, a colour combination and the objects she wants to use.\r\n\r\nThe Jelly bowl lanterns are a recent development to complement the Teacup chandeliers. She wanted to make a pendant light that would house a low energy bulb.\r\n\r\nMadeleine has exhibited in Denmark, Belgium, Switzerland and Japan as well as the UK.\r\n\r\nThe British Council have a large piece in their collection, which toured in Australia, India and Egypt and is now installed in their residences in Cairo.\r\n\r\nDue to the bespoke nature of Madeleine's chandeliers they are priced individually. Madeleine will undertake commissions larger than regular domestic sizes, for bars and shops, past clients have included Bar Room Bar for 10 venues, Laura Ashley, Harrods and Triskel Arts in Cork for European City of Culture 2005.","options":[{"id":20207247,"name":"Default","price":400.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/62288519/-/DeLuxe-Duet.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/62288519/-/DeLuxe-Duet.jpg","width":367,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":51401,"name":"Madeleine Boulesteix","permalink":"madeleine-boulesteix","url":"/artist/madeleine-boulesteix"}],"categories":[{"id":1847781,"name":"Contemporary Design","permalink":"contemporary-design","url":"/category/contemporary-design"},{"id":1921544,"name":"Lighting","permalink":"lighting","url":"/category/lighting"}]},{"id":6273917,"name":"Daniel Reynolds: Large Stoneware Vessels","permalink":"daniel-reynolds-large-stoneware-pots","position":180,"price":550.0,"default_price":550.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/daniel-reynolds-large-stoneware-pots","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-05-24T17:20:35.000Z","description":"Large hand-built pots between 45 and 60 cm high the price of £550 refers to each vessel.\r\n\r\nAbout Daniel Reynolds \r\nDaniel explores the dichotomy between the traditional and contemporary and the natural and synthetic in his beautiful hand-built porcelain and stoneware work.\r\n\r\nHe recreates both organic and man-made forms using hand-built moulds to create stunningly natural, organically shaped forms.

Jim meticulously constructs each of his sculptures laminating, gluing and dowling each layer of wood, which he pre-cuts, finishes and carves down with rasps files and a grinder. His forms are influenced mostly by nature and are concerned with growth and movement. Jim's work is very labour intensive sometimes taking up to three months to make. He works from exploratory drawings, colour, sketches and etchings and often works on more than one piece at once, each one influencing the other in some way - sculptures making sculpture. Like nature itself, Jim's sculptures are objects of great beauty. In a room they command huge presence and it is hard to resist touching them and handling the seductive curved tactile forms. Jim Jack has been sculpting for more than twenty-five years and has had group and solo shows nationally. \r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n\r\nWe work with specialist art handlers to deliver our heavier sculptures, paintings and wall work.

Her current work, a series of paintings which explore the area between figuration and abstraction. Images are ‘stolen’ using her mobile phone in public areas A narrative emerges in Kate's mind from these 'stolen' images. Often after Kate has painted the initial figurative image in oil on linen, a photograph is pasted on a board of the same size, abstracting from the replica to arrive at the essence of the image by simplifying the elements, using mixed media and resin, and simultaneously working further on the original work.\r\n\r\nKate uses many creative platforms in her work including animation, film, paints, photography and textiles.\r\n\r\nKate studied fine art at the Ruskin School in Oxford and at the Florence Academy of Art.

Exhibitions include Brave Soldier and Black Butterfly; a solo exhibition at Liberty of London and an exhibition at Skylark, the artist-run gallery at the Oxo Tower on London’s South Bank.\r\n\r\nAchievements include a tea set for the Liverpool Tate to support their Alice in Wonderland exhibition, a tea set collection she created for Paul Smith, and a greeting card collection for Liberty of London. Her work has appeared in Company magazine, The Independent on Sunday and Elle Decoration to name but a few.\r\n\r\nAli's work is fundamentally an amalgamation of personal experiences, family history, religion and identity and also the relationship between the individual to the material.\r\n\r\nMemory for Ali is a source of euphoric inspiration and, whilst her work might signify a nostalgic reminiscence of years past, it also carries with it the weight of pressures and experience of real life. It is the memories that Ali believes shapes her life and art, first and foremost.\r\n\r\nShe presents these to the viewer as an aesthetic composition enriched by the use of different textures, material and patterns: the artworks created are an expression of Ali’s design perspective and interest in family history - an unusual combination, but one that succeeds in creating artwork of remarkable intimacy and harmonious composition.\r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n\r\nWhile delivery will usually be within 2-5 days, because all of our items are bespoke and made to order by our artists/designers, delivery may take up to six weeks.

The mirrored cups reflect the patterned saucers, uniting them as a perfect couples.  \r\n\r\nMade in Stoke-on-Trent, the bone china cups are hand painted with platinum and then paired with orphan saucers, which are meticulously selected from antique dealers across Britain.\r\n\r\nThe range of antique saucers date from 1870-1930 (with the odd gem from the 50s occasionally too).  Richard has also sourced some rather rare saucers pre-1850.  To qualify as rare they must be produced by a prestigious factory and be very beautiful. \r\n\r\nAs all saucers are unique and individually sourced, it is not possible to choose a certain design currently.  If you give us an idea of the colourway you would like we will do our best to match it when selecting your saucer.\r\n\r\n-Fine bone china with platinum gilding\r\n-Made in Stoke-on-Trent, England\r\n-Handwash only\r\n\r\n\r\nComes in a specially designed gift box.\r\n\r\nAbout Richard Brendon\r\n\r\nRichard is a London based designer.

Inspired by Liz's happy childhood memories of relaxing in meadows on hot summer afternoons.\r\n\r\nSlip cast in the UK, in Bone China. Each one is slightly different in form, because of the way the clay moves in the kiln. \r\n\r\nAbout Liz Emtage\r\n\r\nLiz Emtage Ceramics make bespoke, translucent, porcelain lighting, hand-built in unrestrained natural forms that exploit the malleable quality of the clay. These lamps are inlaid with different organic textures, which leave a delicate impression in the clay surface. When lit these lamps emit an ethereal glow, converting the surface decoration into textures of light. When off the lamps become sculptural pieces, rich with subtle surface pattern. The lamps are naturally ivory in colour, although they can have stains mixed into the clay body, creating subtle colour tones - which become more dramatic when the piece is illuminated. \r\n\r\nCurrently the range consists of table and floor lamps, pendant shades, standard lamps, wall lights and night lights. We also do commissions for clients and develop site specific pieces. Often working with architects, interior designers, visual merchandising managers for high end shops, hotels and restaurants. Individuals can request particular leaves or flowers from their gardens to be inlaid into their light, or a favourite pattern or texture. \r\n\r\nMore than 20 years experience has gone into the making of Liz Emtage’s unique porcelain lighting. A passion for art and design that has developed over a lifetime. Liz is inspired by the power and the beauty of the natural world. She constantly experiments with the clay in order to expand the range of lights and finishes that can be produced.  \r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n\r\nWhile delivery will usually be within 2-5 days, because all of our items are bespoke and made to order by our artists/designers, delivery may take up to six weeks.

Often after Kate has painted the initial figurative image in oil on linen, a photograph is pasted on a board of the same size, abstracting from the replica to arrive at the essence of the image by simplifying the elements, using mixed media and resin, and simultaneously working further on the original work.\r\n\r\nKate uses many creative platforms in her work including animation, film, paints, photography and textiles.\r\n\r\nKate studied fine art at the Ruskin School in Oxford and at the Florence Academy of Art.

Trevor is interested in a painting that explores relationships, people, contemporary urban spaces.\r\n\r\nAlthough people tend to be the focus of attention, he is also concerned with the context of social interaction. There are recurring themes in the pictures which fascinate him, such as the interplay of signs within the cityscape, or how urban architecture creates a visually distinctive micro-environment at street level, and how momentary appearances are registered, glimpsed or over-looked in passing by.\r\n\r\nTrevor’s work developed over a period of time when he was exploring the use of a less literally descriptive, painterly, figurative language in a series of paintings on the theme of the family, which culminated in some large works done on the MA Fine Art course in Barcelona in 1997/8. After this Trevor moved to London, and felt the need for a more concrete subject and specificity for his work. He turned to the immediate urban environment, and began using his own photographs as source material.\r\n\r\nTrevor does not attempt to replicate the conventions of photography. In all representational art there is a gap between what is depicted and how it’s depicted. The peculiar pleasures of painting, for him, are all about this gap.\r\n\r\nHe uses a glossy liquid paint which brings out the flashes of bright colour that animate urban space. The fluidity, coarseness and texture of the paint contribute to a sense of the thickening of the air in the urban atmosphere, the ambiguity and the discontinuity of visual experience.\r\n\r\nThe recent series, \"A Place to Live\" draws on property adverts in newspapers.

After this Trevor moved to London, and felt the need for a more concrete subject and specificity for his work. He turned to the immediate urban environment, and began using his own photographs as source material.\r\n\r\nTrevor does not attempt to replicate the conventions of photography. In all representational art there is a gap between what is depicted and how it’s depicted. The peculiar pleasures of painting, for him, are all about this gap.\r\n\r\nHe uses a glossy liquid paint which brings out the flashes of bright colour that animate urban space. The fluidity, coarseness and texture of the paint contribute to a sense of the thickening of the air in the urban atmosphere, the ambiguity and the discontinuity of visual experience.\r\n\r\nThe recent series, \"A Place to Live\" draws on property adverts in newspapers.

Every time she had to adjust and familiarise herself with a new home, school and friends. Sometimes a box or two of her stuff went missing during the move and she would lose a whole lot of things suddenly. All this meant that she become increasingly unattached to objects. She found that it was her recollection of childhood which became more palpable and concrete instead.\r\n\r\nHer memories often do not involve particularly significant events.  Many of them are featureless everyday observations like remembering the pattern of a stone pavement on her way to school or the silhouette of a light bulb hanging from the ceiling of her grandmother's house. She still feels an acute affinity with these small scenes. She unwraps them slowly in her mind and inhabits, even smells them.\r\n\r\nKaori uses clay as a device to make fragments of time visible. She wants to preserve the intimate and transient recollections of our lives and seal them in the clay like a fern petrified into a fossil. Firing changes soft, malleable clay into hard, breakable ceramic. As clay loses its organic life in the firing, it allows time to become encased. The nature of fired clay incorporates both fragility and permanence and it is this which enables the material to record elusive things like memory.\r\n\r\nKaori traces everyday objects in clay like an old pair of shoes, a girls camisole or a discarded box of buttons - the sort of bits and pieces you might have owned once but forgotten all about. Through looking at her work, you are led back into those tiny, quiet recesses of your past.\r\n\r\nBorn in Arita, a small village in Japan renowned for its fine porcelain, Kaori Tatebayashi grew up in a family who traded in pottery. She studied ceramics at Kyoto City University of Art for a Bachelors and Masters in ceramics during 1991-97. During the initial year of her Masters degree she became London's Scholarship ceramic student at the Royal College of Art, and in 1999 participated in Japan's 6th Ceramic Biennale. In 2006, Kaori won the Crafts Council Development Award and set up her workshop at 4011⁄4 Studios in Wandsworth, London. She has widely exhibited throughout the UK and Japan and her exhibitions include, two years at Chelsea's Craft Fair - winning the Design for Scandinavian Award in 2004, three years at Origin, London (2006-08) and has exhibited for two years at Ceramic Art, London (2005 & 07).\r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n\r\nWhile delivery will usually be within 2-5 days, because all of our items are bespoke and made to order by our artists/designers, delivery may take up to six weeks.

Both drawing and painting inform the work and all pieces are one off or small limited editions. Each of Kate's vessels is hand built using slabs of white stoneware clay. The clay surfaces are drawn onto and incised into both before and after she builds them. Layers of colour are then built up using slips, oxides, body stains, underglaze colours and glazes. Kate then fires the work to about 1120 degree C.\r\n\r\nKate's work is in both private and public collections in Britain and abroad, including the Crafts Council collection and South East Arts.\r\n\r\nShe is the founder and head of the Ceramics Diploma course at City Lit College in central London.\r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n\r\nWhile delivery will usually be within 2-5 days, because all of our items are bespoke and made to order by our artists/designers, delivery may take up to six weeks.

Her inspiration originally came from an urge to react against much of the traditional ceramic pieces she had seen, whose glazes seemed dark and murky. She wanted to create pieces where colour embodied the pot, rather than being surface decoration. She looked to towers and sky-high buildings for her inspiration initially but essence of form and simplicity are now the main factors.\r\n\r\nHer new work features fluid abstract lines which are transformed into a landscape by adding graphic architectural figures and trees.\r\n\r\nThe making of Sophie's bottles and pods is quite complicated. Each of Sophie's bottles or pods are thrown on the wheel. They are then left to dry overnight and then carved by hand to give extra definition to their shape. It is an incredibly delicate process and at any point the piece can crack. Each piece is then fired in the kiln and the glaze is applied by a spraying technique. The glazes are original and have taken several years of testing to fine tune.\r\n\r\nThe pieces are then further fired to 1260’C. During the firing there are further risks due to the fragility of the porcelain and the heat of the kiln. On average, during the entire making process, only fifty per cent of the pieces will survive.\r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n\r\nWhile delivery will usually be within 2-5 days, because all of our items are bespoke and made to order by our artists/designers, delivery may take up to six weeks.

Initially she resisted the temptation to make a chandelier because that would be too obvious, however, she later succumbed and has been making them ever since.\r\n\r\nWhen she started to gather other things to make a structure with, she discovered that everything she needed was right there just waiting to be assembled; glass teacups, trifle moulds, tea strainers etc all for the taking.  She'd never used a pastry cutter for pastry or a toast rack for toast but they seemed to have more potential, so she liberated them from their domestic duties by incorporating them in her chandeliers.\r\n\r\nMadeleine prefers to work with things she's found and let their qualities dictate what happens. Each piece is unique and begins with a really simple set of ideas, a shape, a colour combination and the objects she wants to use.\r\n\r\nThe Jelly bowl lanterns are a recent development to complement the Teacup chandeliers. She wanted to make a pendant light that would house a low energy bulb.\r\n\r\nMadeleine has exhibited in Denmark, Belgium, Switzerland and Japan as well as the UK.\r\n\r\nThe British Council have a large piece in their collection, which toured in Australia, India and Egypt and is now installed in their residences in Cairo.\r\n\r\nDue to the bespoke nature of Madeleine's chandeliers they are priced individually.  Madeleine will undertake commissions larger than regular domestic sizes, for bars and shops, past clients have included Bar Room Bar for 10 venues, Laura Ashley, Harrods and Triskel Arts in Cork for European City of Culture 2005.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":17274933,"name":"4 cup chandelier electric","price":650.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":17517255,"name":"6 cup chandelier electric","price":850.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17517257,"name":"4 cup chandelier candle only","price":575.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17517259,"name":"4 cup chandelier candle only","price":575.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17517261,"name":"Duet chandelier candle only","price":350.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53293691/-/Elec-Quartet.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53293691/-/Elec-Quartet.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53292483/-/6cup-green-turq.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53292483/-/6cup-green-turq.jpg","width":600,"height":799},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/52455263/-/opal-rasp-quartet.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/52455263/-/opal-rasp-quartet.jpg","width":600,"height":850},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/52456511/-/GreenQuartet.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/52456511/-/GreenQuartet.jpg","width":447,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53292619/-/Chinoiserie-Duet-e.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53292619/-/Chinoiserie-Duet-e.jpg","width":409,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":51401,"name":"Madeleine Boulesteix","permalink":"madeleine-boulesteix","url":"/artist/madeleine-boulesteix"}],"categories":[{"id":1847781,"name":"Contemporary Design","permalink":"contemporary-design","url":"/category/contemporary-design"},{"id":1921544,"name":"Lighting","permalink":"lighting","url":"/category/lighting"}]},{"id":5342191,"name":"Furniture Magpies - Lovely Legs Lights","permalink":"furniture-magpies-lovely-legs-lights","position":240,"price":325.0,"default_price":325.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/furniture-magpies-lovely-legs-lights","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-01-27T15:37:38.000Z","description":"Lovely Legs lights - made from upcycled furniture \r\n\r\nLampshade made from recycled wool, base of the lamp made from recycled chair legs\r\n\r\nAbout Furniture Magpies\r\n\r\nFurniture Magpies is a furniture ‘design and make’ company offering an alternative to mass-produced products and specialising in regenerating old furniture to meet the requirements of the modern consumer.

By combining these old components with new and vintage fabrics, as well as using some traditional techniques such as deep button upholstery, they create pieces with a distinctive and contemporary twist.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“Our company explores the extensive possibilities of creating unique, yet functional pieces through the process of upcycling discarded furniture.”\r\n\r\n“Our designs are a little bit like a recipe, we always use the same ingredients but each piece comes out a little different every time.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of reusing existing furniture and reclaimed materials, consumers can be confident that each piece is entirely individual and sold as a unique item.\r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n\r\nWhile delivery will usually be within 2-5 days, because all of our items are bespoke and made to order by our artists/designers, delivery may take up to six weeks. We will confirm expected delivery once your order has been received.

He pursues these interests in an abstract sense by exploring shape and making mathematically constructed pieces in clay, each built up of many different wheel-thrown sections. On completion each form conveys different and individual properties of space, light, and colour, and sustains an expression of abstract and rhythmical beauty from its pattern of shape.\r\n\r\nMatthew's sculptures are made using either an earthenware or stoneware clay, with colours added directly into the body. When each form has been constructed, several weeks are allowed for slow drying to minimise shrinkage and warping problems. Once dry the piece is sculpted to achieve a finer shape and then low fired.  It is sanded and then high fired again.  Once fully fired each piece is polished once again, this time with diamond abrasives to help achieve a very smooth overall finish.\r\n\r\nMatthew studied his MA at the Royal College of Art. He was also winner of the Poole Pottery award for Ceramic Shape.

She went on to do her degree in workshop ceramics at Harrow College and later embarked on a Masters at the Royal College of Art.\r\n\r\nThe main inspiration for Alice's work is her local environment and the everyday, mundane experiences that occur within it. She walks around armed with her camera ready to catalogue these experiences so that she can incorporate them into her work.\r\n\r\nShe uses vivid imagery to create an almost utopian sense of place.\r\n\r\nAlice's work has been shown at a prestigious exhibition held at Canary Wharfs' Canada Square foyer with nine other ceramic/glass artists.

Inspired by Liz's happy childhood memories of relaxing in meadows on hot summer afternoons.\r\n\r\nSlip cast in the UK, in Bone China. Each one is slightly different in form, because of the way the clay moves in the kiln. \r\n\r\nAbout Liz Emtage\r\n\r\nLiz Emtage Ceramics make bespoke, translucent, porcelain lighting, hand-built in unrestrained natural forms that exploit the malleable quality of the clay. These lamps are inlaid with different organic textures, which leave a delicate impression in the clay surface. When lit these lamps emit an ethereal glow, converting the surface decoration into textures of light. When off the lamps become sculptural pieces, rich with subtle surface pattern. The lamps are naturally ivory in colour, although they can have stains mixed into the clay body, creating subtle colour tones - which become more dramatic when the piece is illuminated. \r\n\r\nCurrently the range consists of table and floor lamps, pendant shades, standard lamps, wall lights and night lights. We also do commissions for clients and develop site specific pieces. Often working with architects, interior designers, visual merchandising managers for high end shops, hotels and restaurants. Individuals can request particular leaves or flowers from their gardens to be inlaid into their light, or a favourite pattern or texture. \r\n\r\nMore than 20 years experience has gone into the making of Liz Emtage’s unique porcelain lighting. A passion for art and design that has developed over a lifetime. Liz is inspired by the power and the beauty of the natural world. She constantly experiments with the clay in order to expand the range of lights and finishes that can be produced.  \r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n\r\nWhile delivery will usually be within 2-5 days, because all of our items are bespoke and made to order by our artists/designers, delivery may take up to six weeks.

Alice also won the Queensbury Hunt award for most innovative use of ceramic material. \r\n\r\nDelivery\r\n\r\nWhile delivery will usually be within 2-5 days, because all of our items are bespoke and made to order by our artists/designers, delivery may take up to six weeks.
