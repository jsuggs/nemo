When it comes to photographing children - particularly your younger ones - there's infinitely more for them to interact with.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, location shooting feels so much more natural (and relaxing) than studio sessions, particularly if anyone is camera shy.\r\n\r\nDevelop a theme with your children, bring a picnic, go mad with bubbles! It's all about their smiles. Whatever you decide to do, you'll receive a photographic blow-by-blow account (at least 10 images).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, a studio session may be booked for babies and toddlers. Bring their favourite outfit and/or cuddly toy.\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n\r\n* All photoshoots take place on location (agreed by the client when organising a date). \r\n* The price covers photoshoots taking place within the Sheffield/Barnsley area. Any additional travel expenses will need to be subsidised. \r\n* A Children's Photo shoot should last approximately 1 hour. \r\n* All final images will be available to purchase from a secure online portfolio with password. \r\n* Parents must accompany their children throughout the session. \r\n* Vouchers are valid for 6 months from date of purchase. No refund will be made if the voucher is not used within this time.\r\n\r\nIf you have any further enquiries, please feel free to email me at jacqueline@jacquelineallott.co.uk\r\n","options":[{"id":20765499,"name":"Default","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69836521/-/Children_s_Portraiture.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69836521/-/Children_s_Portraiture.jpg","width":900,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/66591077/-/Baby_Triptych.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/66591077/-/Baby_Triptych.jpg","width":1000,"height":394}],"artists":[{"id":155601,"name":"Jacqueline Allott | Photographer","permalink":"jacqueline-allott-photographer","url":"/artist/jacqueline-allott-photographer"}],"categories":[{"id":3378385,"name":"Photo Shoots","permalink":"photo-shoots","url":"/category/photo-shoots"}]},{"id":6532813,"name":"Teenagers and Prom Photography by Jacqueline","permalink":"teenagers-model-experience","position":3,"price":95.0,"default_price":95.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/teenagers-model-experience","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-24T22:26:21.000Z","description":"No idea what to buy the teenager in your life?
