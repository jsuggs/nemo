Scorching radiation and fast winds (streams of charged particles) from these stars are sculpting the pillar and causing new stars to form within it. Streamers of gas and dust can be seen flowing off the top of the structure. Nestled inside this dense structure are fledgling stars. They cannot be seen in this image because they are hidden by a wall of gas and dust. Although the stars themselves are invisible, one of them is providing evidence of its existence. Thin puffs of material can be seen traveling to the left and to the right of a dark notch in the center of the pillar. The matter is part of a jet produced by a young star. Farther away, on the left, the jet is visible as a grouping of small, wispy clouds. A few small clouds are visible at a similar distance on the right side of the jet. Astronomers estimate that the jet is moving at speeds of up to 850,000 miles an hour.

The image shows the Orion nebula, a happening place where stars are born. The young stars dip and peak in brightness due to a variety of reasons. Shifting cold and hot spots on the stars' surfaces cause brightness levels to change, in addition to surrounding disks of lumpy planet-forming material, which can obstruct starlight. Spitzer is keeping tabs on the young stars, providing data on their changing ways.\r\n\r\nImage credit:\r\nNASA/JPL-Caltech ","options":[{"id":32936779,"name":"48\" by 48\"","price":185.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32936782,"name":"48\" by 55\"","price":220.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102764044/-/Orion_s_Dreamy_Stars_48in_Section2thumb.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102764044/-/Orion_s_Dreamy_Stars_48in_Section2thumb.jpg","width":864,"height":864},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102974200/-/Orion_s_Dreamy_Stars_48in_Section23dthumb.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102974200/-/Orion_s_Dreamy_Stars_48in_Section23dthumb.jpg","width":864,"height":379}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5027635,"name":"Galaxy Chair Mats","permalink":"galaxy-chair-mats","url":"/category/galaxy-chair-mats"}]},{"id":10454428,"name":"North America Nebula in Different Lights","permalink":"north-america-nebula-in-different-lights","position":14,"price":185.0,"default_price":185.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/north-america-nebula-in-different-lights","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-10T05:12:16.000Z","description":"This new view of the North America nebula combines both visible and infrared light observations, taken by the Digitized Sky Survey and NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, respectively, into a single vivid picture.\r\n\r\nThe nebula is named after its resemblance to the North American continent in visible light, which in this image is represented in blue hues.
