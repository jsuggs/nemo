These advances on the LiquidSeam System use 60% less material but achieve a lighter, more flexible yet still durable seam. The more precise & controlled application of the Power Seam fused with a triple glued seam & the internal use of C-Skins exclusive C-Flex HOTTape creates a ‘Stitchless’ seam which is the lightest, warmest & most flexible seam C-Skins has ever developed.\r\nThe HotWired QuickDri Polypro now features Extreme pilling & a more relaxed weave creating an insane amount of flexibility, enhanced thermal properties & a drying time of 15 minutes. The QuickDri Polypro not only covers the chest and back but the entire lower body of the suit, which means you can jump into a dry suit for your afternoon session.\r\n\r\n• STITCHLESS\r\n• 100% External Power Seam Power\r\n• 100% Internal C-Flex HOTTaped Seams\r\n• Dura Mesh AirLoc Chest and Back Panels\r\n• QuickDri Polypro chest, back and lower body, 15 minute dry time\r\n• 100% Ultra Stretch C-Flex Neoprene\r\n• Free Floating Enigma Chest Zip\r\n• Lock Down Cuff seals\r\n• DuroFlx Knee pads\r\n• Ultra minimal Seam Styling\r\n• Knee Flex Emboss\r\n• C-Skins New 2012 Future Fit\r\n• Super seal glideskin collar\r\n• External Key Pocket.","options":[{"id":37973328,"name":"Small","price":549.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":37973331,"name":"Medium","price":549.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":37973334,"name":"Large ","price":549.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/118211646/-/HotWired_Front_W12.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/118211646/-/HotWired_Front_W12.jpg","width":425,"height":848}],"artists":[{"id":96495,"name":"C-Skins","permalink":"c-skins","url":"/artist/c-skins"}],"categories":[{"id":2706987,"name":"Wetsuits","permalink":"wetsuits","url":"/category/wetsuits"}]},{"id":6506445,"name":"OAM Lowers Back Pack","permalink":"oam-lowers-back-pack","position":2,"price":109.0,"default_price":109.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/oam-lowers-back-pack","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-21T10:26:14.000Z","description":"<b>Product Description<b/>\r\n\r\nDurable 600D polyester\r\nNon corrosive zippers\r\nPadded ergonomic shoulderstraps\r\nWet & Dry wetsuit Compartment\r\nFelt lined iPod compartment \r\nSkate straps\r\nLaptop stash\r\nInternal organizers","options":[{"id":20691955,"name":"Coloured","price":109.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":20691957,"name":"Black","price":109.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63896181/-/OAM_Lowers_ECO_Mission_Pack.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63896181/-/OAM_Lowers_ECO_Mission_Pack.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":80051,"name":"OAM -
