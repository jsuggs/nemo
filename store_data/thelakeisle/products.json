The album title itself, was Inspired by the William Butler Yeats poem, Easter 1916 .\r\n\r\nTerrible Beauties is a nod to those elements of life that give us a sense painstaking comfort and unsettling joy; just as were so eloquently penned by Yeats in his poem. \r\n\r\nThe core of the album is about the friction we need to survive and grow and become, and of finding that friction in the construct and hectic commotion of our daily lives. In the end, it is always about finding ourselves.\r\n\r\nEnjoy,\r\nMark Dougherty (The Lake Isle)","options":[{"id":1639210,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.25,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3365465/-/Screen_shot_2009-09-25_at_11.59.36_PM.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3365465/-/Screen_shot_2009-09-25_at_11.59.36_PM.png","width":503,"height":504}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":321663,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
