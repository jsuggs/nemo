Three stories. The end of one world.\r\n\r\nNine years ago, the Earth struggled in the throes of an industrial revolution. Steam trains scythed across the countryside, and great aerostats drifted lazily across the skies. The cities swelled with factory-smoke and bilge-water while people thrived or starved in their streets.\r\n\r\nOn All Souls Day, that all changed. A great star fell into the sky, bringing a perpetual twilight that turned most of the population against each other—twisting men and women into the ferocious, sky-mad Affected. When the star finally disappeared, the world froze. Now, Callista trudges across the icy wastes in search of her mentor: everyman-turned-folk-hero The Web of the North, who might just be the last frozen glimmer of hope that she has left.\r\n\r\nAllegra Hawksmoor, John Reppion and Dylan Fox come together for an exercise in collective storytelling and world-building that will lead you into the ruins of factories submerged beneath the ice, probe the wrecks of burned-out airships, and provide a glimpse into minds and the deranged communities of the Affected and Unaffected that struggle to survive out in the snow.\r\n\r\nFlip down the sky-guards on your goggles, and step into the\r\nWinterlands…\r\n\r\nAvailable in hardcopy chapbook (53 pages at A5 size–printed on recycled papers by the Footprint Workers Co-Operative in Leeds), or in a number of digital formats for e-reader, Mac, PC etc. Hardcopies ship worldwide from the UK.\r\n\r\nPrint £4 (+ P&P)\r\nDigital £2 (all formats) \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.moorereppion.com/fiction/journeys-in-the-winterlands/\"><b>Click here to go to page to purchase</b></a>","options":[{"id":31050010,"name":"Default","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.75,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/97526887/-/Winterlands-Cover-Website.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/97526887/-/Winterlands-Cover-Website.jpg","width":292,"height":420}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1159541,"name":"Short story booklet","permalink":"short-story-booklet","url":"/category/short-story-booklet"}]},{"id":1880361,"name":"On the Banks of the River Jordan - Swan River Press Haunted Histories #7 HALF PRICE","permalink":"on-the-banks-of-the-river-jordan-swan-river-press-haunted-histories-7","position":3,"price":2.5,"default_price":2.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/on-the-banks-of-the-river-jordan-swan-river-press-haunted-histories-7","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-03-09T02:24:50.000Z","description":"<b>On the Banks of the River Jordan (a psychogeographical metafiction)</b>\r\n\r\nWritten by John Reppion\r\nCover by <a href=\"http://www.meggankehrli.com/index.html\">Meggan Kehrli</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://brianjshowers.com/swanriverpress.html\">Haunted History Series</a> #7\r\n<a href=\"http://brianjshowers.com/postscript_jordan.html\">Postscript</a>\r\n\r\nPrintings: March 2010 (150 copies)\r\nStyle: A5, staple-bound pamphlet\r\nLength: 20 pages\r\n\r\n\"<i>Going through my notes I came across a mass of material concerning Princes Park—the Victorian park adjacent to where I live—which I gathered whilst researching my book 800 Years of Haunted Liverpool. \r\n\r\nThe thing is, even though I managed to include several pages of Toxteth tales in my book, there was so much I couldn’t include due to space restrictions. Much of this remainder data is still “raw”: photocopied newspaper articles, printouts, poorly written notes and the like. My first thought was that it should be possible to work through the data and turn it into something resembling a history of the park, but I must admit that I am already struggling. I’m sure there is an obvious angle, a path winding through these disparate elements that would draw the whole thing together, but I’m afraid I can’t see the wood for the trees at the moment.</i>\"\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nBooklet will be signed and dedicated upon request.
