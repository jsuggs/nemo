The white guitar is a rare 1980 Fender \"Jimi Hendrix Model\" Stratocaster; the same construction as the 25TH ANNIVERSARY, except that it had a reverse headstock and an additional body contour on the front. According to Fender only 25 of this highly unusual Strats were ever made. Stevie purchased this guitar that very day at PETE'S GUITAR in St. Paul, Mn.","options":[{"id":12544324,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36496980/-/srvcontact1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36496980/-/srvcontact1.jpg","width":1000,"height":726}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2099126,"name":"Photographs","permalink":"photographs","url":"/category/photographs"}]}]
