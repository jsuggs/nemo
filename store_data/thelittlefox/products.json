It measures 8x10 inch., and will feel right at home in any standard 8x10 inch frame or matte.\r\n\r\nIt is printed on lovely, velvety, archival acid-free matte paper, with archival pigment inks, both of which are tested and guaranteed against smudge, scratch, and water, and are fade resistant for up to 108 years.\r\n\r\nAll prints are signed and dated on the back, and will come to you safely sealed in a cello sleeve and a protective stiff envelope.\r\n\r\n♥Follow us on Facebook for fortnightly giveaways, updates, exclusive offers and news:\r\nwww.facebook.com/thelittlefox.net\r\n\r\n♫♪ PRINT SALE ♪♫\r\n2 additional FREE prints of your choice, when you buy any 4 prints!\r\nJust add ANY 4 prints you want to your cart and let me know in the 'notes to the seller' section, when checking out, the name of the 2 additional prints you want for free.","options":[{"id":28793642,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90367718/-/41.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90367718/-/41.jpg","width":500,"height":501}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2018478,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":9197024,"name":"The Love Bandits 8x10 Print","permalink":"the-love-bandits-8x10-print","position":2,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-love-bandits-8x10-print","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-29T06:07:53.000Z","description":"Carnival, Circus, Girls Art, Girls Room Art, Girl Art Print, Whimsical Art, Girls Decor, Art for Girls, Sisters - Love Bandits 8x10 Print\r\n\r\nI love the way these two curious and enigmatic characters manage to hold on to their heart and to each other simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThis print is reproduced from an original painting by me, inspired by a make-believe world filled with curious and enigmatic outcasts, runaways, and lovely pirate-y gals.\r\n\r\nThis borderless print is reproduced from a painting by me.
