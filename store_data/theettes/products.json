Get your copy here!\r\n\r\nAllmusic Review:\r\nThe Ettes' third album, Do You Want Power, marks something of a departure for the band. Produced in Nashville by modern-day garage rock hero Greg Cartwright (most recently of the Reigning Sound), the record is their most focused and diverse set to date and widens their garage rock sound without diluting it. Released in 2008, Look at Life Again Soon was produced by Liam Watson to have a very retro-leaning sound relying on Watson's vintage equipment and Joe Meek-influenced style. Cartwright gives Do You Want Power a modern, in-your-face sound with less reverb and more punch. This serves the flat-out rockers like \"I Can't Be True\" and \"Take It with You\" well, giving Coco's guitar extra bite and Poni's drums extra kick. Cartwright also adds some vocals and guitar to the mix, as well as co-writing (with bassist Jem) the best song on the album, the sassy \"I'll Be Your Lover (But I Can't Be Your Baby).\" To match the clean sound of the album, the band turns in remarkably tight and powerful performances that may sacrifice some noise and bluster but gain back loads of power and toughness in the bargain. It's a change in philosophy that makes for a more mature but no less ferocious record. Another positive difference this time out is Coco's more nuanced vocal approach. When she's angry she spits out the words like they are poison; when she's melancholy there's a quiet power in her voice that she hasn't displayed before. In fact, on the album's ballads the bandmembers show a side they have kept hidden before. They've always had slow, melancholy numbers in their repertoire, but this time out they are less beat group-sounding and instead have a Laurel Canyon (\"While You're Girl's Away\") or psychedelic (\"Seasons\") feel. The song that ends the album, the piano-and-strings ballad \"Keep Me in Flowers,\" could even be a different band if not for Coco's tear-stained vocals. The production shifts and slight changes in philosophy are interesting, but it all comes down to the songs in the end. Tracks like \"No Home,\" the burning hot \"Red in Tooth and Claw,\" and \"Blood Red Blood\" (to name a few) are first-rate rockers that stand with the best songs cranked out by any modern-day garage punkers, and Do You Want Power is the band's best work to date.\r\nCOLLAPSE","options":[{"id":23873375,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":8.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74171995/-/dywp_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74171995/-/dywp_cover.jpg","width":500,"height":447}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1317791,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":6423535,"name":"TEETH 7\" - Black Vinyl ","permalink":"teeth-7-red-vinyl-version-limited-to-7-copies","position":3,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/teeth-7-red-vinyl-version-limited-to-7-copies","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-11T23:14:48.000Z","description":"Here is the Black and Red Vinyl version of the TEETH 7\".

The LP is the first release on Sympathy since 2006. The album was recorded in London at Toerag Studios and produced by Liam Watson, here's what all music guide has to say about it:\r\n\r\nAfter working with the Reigning Sound's Greg Cartwright on their previous album (Do You Want Power) and stretching the boundaries of their well-established garage punk sound a bit, the Ettes headed back to Liam Watson’s Toe Rag Studio to crank out the more Ettes-y sounding Wicked Will. This time out there are precious few ballads or moments of introspection, no psych-y interludes, not much subtlety, and lots of raw and ready energy. Once they get past the seething acoustic ballad “Teeth,” which opens the album, Coco, Jem, and Poni sound like they are on a mission of destruction. Even with Watson dumping a bucket of old-time reverb over their heads, they rage and pound through the songs with a tight, sparse abandon and a barely controlled fury. As with the other albums Watson produced, the monstrous and distorted bass and drums give the songs all kinds of power, while Coco's guitar adds razor-sharp toughness and her voice soars over the top alternately pleading with honey or spitting with fire. The songs range from slow-burning rockers like \"You Never Say\" and \"The Pendulum\" to fast and furious rockers like \"Excuse\" and \"Don’t Bring Me Down,\" all with hooky choruses and enough energy to power a small town. Throw in a rollicking cover of the Lee Hazlewood-penned \"My Baby Cried All Night Long\" and the busted-up sounding lament \"The Worst There Is,\" which closes the album on a down note, and you have a record that stands with their best work and makes for a truly invigorating listen. If the band were merely backtracking from the more arranged and fleshed-out sound Cartwright gave them, this record could be seen as a retreat. Instead, it sounds like they needed to go back to Watson to root out demons and get back to basics; instead, it sounds like a charge.
