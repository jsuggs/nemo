Unfortunately, he’s always covered in rubbish so very few animals get to see him in all his natural glory. Freddie doesn’t care what he looks like, but he is always extra careful to poke the bins before he roots in them: he once woke a sleeping vixen and got more than he bargained for!","options":[{"id":26184375,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81768789/-/freddie-the-fox1-white.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81768789/-/freddie-the-fox1-white.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3475981,"name":"Cute Acrylic Necklaces","permalink":"cute-acrylic-necklaces","url":"/category/cute-acrylic-necklaces"},{"id":3476159,"name":"Hoobynoo Forest","permalink":"hoobynoo-forest","url":"/category/hoobynoo-forest"}]},{"id":6759327,"name":"Flamingo Acrylic Fashion Necklace","permalink":"florence-the-flamingo-acrylic-necklace","position":2,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/florence-the-flamingo-acrylic-necklace","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-21T22:45:45.000Z","description":"This flamingo necklace would make an ideal gift for any occasion for those who love colourful statement jewellery!
