Returning with the concept album <strong><em>Dusty Rainbow From The Dark</em></strong>, the French producer gives us a musical tale inspired in large part by the enchanted world of children. His fourth long player is also a charming allegory on the escapist power of music.\r\n\r\nHaving worked extensively with studio musicians for his last two albums, <strong>Wax Tailor</strong> decided to work exclusively with samples to craft the music on this album, with a unique twist. Rather than replicating loops, he sampled to gather textures and rework them into individual notes, which are then programmed into melodies, giving a very vintage feel to the sound of the album.\r\n\r\nAnother key element of this album is that it follows a plot, co-written with singer-songwriter <strong>Sara Genn</strong>, and narrated by the legendary voice of <strong>Don McCorkindale</strong> (<em>The Avengers</em>, on <strong>BBC Radio</strong>). This album manages the feat of utilizing each guest (<strong>Aloe Blacc</strong>, <strong>Elzhi</strong>, <strong>Shana Halligan</strong> from <strong>Bitter:Sweet</strong>, to name but a few) in the context of this plot.\r\nThe opening notes of <em>Exordium</em> set the stage: luxuriant orchestrations and ethereal female murmurs parade in the background while <strong>Don McCorkindale</strong>’s captivating voice leads the way. The story unfolds as the album charts its course, alternating between scenic moments (<em>No</em>) and psychedelic notes (<em>Heart Stop</em>). Some tracks (<em>Past, Present &amp; Future</em>) are built around the type of scratch dialogues reminiscent of <strong>Wax Tailor</strong>’s classic <strong>Tales of the Forgotten Melodies</strong> album. Others find the producer acting as an alchemist, combining genres such as swing and funk (<em>The Sound</em>), or soul and traditional Indian music (<em>Time To Go</em>). Instrumental tracks ooze symphonic orchestrations (<em>Phonovisions</em>) or venture into movie soundtrack territory (<em>From The Dark</em>).\r\n\r\nWith this grand mosaic, Wax Tailor gives us a work that is at once modern and timeless.\r\n\r\nThe CD is a Digisleeve with 2 CD's, including the instrumental version of the album, while the LP is a gatefold 2xLP with printed inner sleeves.\r\n\r\nCD1 / LP tracklisting:\r\n\r\n1.

This album takes you on a 52 minutes long journey into the depth of his “cinematic hip hop” - 18 tracks which will awaken the music lover in you.\r\n\r\nWax Tailor uses samples in his music as Film directors use actors. His record is conceived as an orchestral movie between hip-hop and downtempo where Wax Tailor hijacks “The forgotten melodies” and tells a story of his own where each track is a sequence. In this large patchwork of numerous influences and multiple references to the seventh art, major names of the twentieth century music (Doris Day, Nina Simone...) meet Stanly Kubrick, Woody Allen or Alfred Hitchcock and engage in a virtuoso dialogue.\r\n\r\nUS rappers The Others appear on the record to offer a tribute to the hip-hop culture in which Wax Tailor has been involved for 20 years. We also get a chance to discover Charlotte Savary from the French Band Clover. Finally, Marina Quaisse’s cello runs through the whole album and delicately colors it with darker shades of melancholy.\r\n\r\nAn instant classic !","options":[{"id":11787716,"name":"CD","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":37926540,"name":"2xLP","price":15.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/34080014/-/LPL002cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/34080014/-/LPL002cover.jpg","width":900,"height":900}],"artists":[{"id":58298,"name":"Wax Tailor","permalink":"wax-tailor","url":"/artist/wax-tailor"}],"categories":[{"id":1993098,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":1993130,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":4388877,"name":"Wax Tailor 'In The Mood For Life'","permalink":"wax-tailor-in-the-mood-for-life","position":3,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wax-tailor-in-the-mood-for-life","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-09-06T15:54:32.000Z","description":"His first album <i>Tales of the Forgotten Melodies</i> drew comparisons to the likes of <b>Ratatat</b>, <b>Portishead</b> and <b>DJ Shadow</b>, while his second <i>Hope & Sorrow</i> landed him a nomination at the prestigious French <b>Victoires de la Musique</b>, as well as the <b>US Indie Awards</b>. <b>Wax Tailor</b> is coming off a year which saw him tour relentlessly and\r\nscore the title track for the movie <i>Paris</i> by <b>Cedric Klapisch</b> as well as a few remixes (<b>Nina Simone</b>, <b>ASA</B>).\r\n\r\n<i>In The Mood For Life</i> was recorded over the last six months of 2008 between New York City and Paris and features vocal contributions from UK artists <b>Charlie Winston</b> & <b>Dionne Charles</b>, Americans <b>Ali Harter</b> & <b>Sara Genn</b> as well as the returning participation of past collaborators <b>Charlotte Savary</b>, <b>Voice</b>, <b>A.S.M.</b> & <b>Mattic</b>.\r\n\r\nThe writing has continued to evolve from where <i>Hope & Sorrow</i> left off, emphasizing string instruments and more mature arrangements. <i>In the Mood for Life</i> is an organic landscape with orchestral accents where Soul, Funk, Hip-Hop or 60’s Pop Music intertwine, to create one eagerly awaited 52 minute journey.","options":[{"id":14414345,"name":"CD","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/42941643/-/LPL010_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/42941643/-/LPL010_cover.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":58298,"name":"Wax Tailor","permalink":"wax-tailor","url":"/artist/wax-tailor"}],"categories":[{"id":1993098,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":1993130,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":4388917,"name":"Wax Tailor \"Hope & Sorrow\"","permalink":"wax-tailor-hope-sorrow","position":4,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wax-tailor-hope-sorrow","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-09-06T16:01:44.000Z","description":"With his first album, <b>Wax Tailor</b> became the independent European sensation of the past year, popularizing his brand of cinematic soundscapes to the masses.
