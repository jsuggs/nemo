There are even some drowning sinners (such as Ann Coulter, Larry Craig, and Fred Phelps)!\r\n\r\nThis special edition also includes a portrait of Joshua and Steve Snyder-Hill, the two founders of MarriageEvolved. Steve is the soldier who was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9CUj8YIFzg\">booed during the Republican primaries</a> last year after asking a question about Don't Ask, Don't Tell. Together, he and Joshua have championed the cause of marriage equality, even fighting DOMA on the national level to establish equality for LGBT military spouses. \r\n\r\nIn June, my partner and I are participating in a special initiative by MarriageEvolved called the C-Bus of Love.

With the sun’s rays now shining upon his white rump, Alan strikes a pose reminiscent of another tan-line exposing icon from years past.\r\n\r\n©2011 Paul Richmond\r\nOriginal painting is available through <a href=\"http://www.lymaneyerart.com/ItemDisplay.aspx?artistid=83 \">Lyman-Eyer Gallery</a>","options":[{"id":15729549,"name":"Small","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15729551,"name":"Medium","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47273421/-/Beach_Bum__Starring_Alan_Ilagan_lowres.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47273421/-/Beach_Bum__Starring_Alan_Ilagan_lowres.jpg","width":800,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47273455/-/Beach_Bum__Starring_Alan_Ilagan_DETAIL1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47273455/-/Beach_Bum__Starring_Alan_Ilagan_DETAIL1.jpg","width":757,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47273463/-/Beach_Bum__Starring_Alan_Ilagan_DETAIL2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47273463/-/Beach_Bum__Starring_Alan_Ilagan_DETAIL2.jpg","width":869,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47273479/-/Beach_Bum__Starring_Alan_Ilagan_DETAIL3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47273479/-/Beach_Bum__Starring_Alan_Ilagan_DETAIL3.jpg","width":673,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47273487/-/Beach_Bum__Starring_Alan_Ilagan_DETAIL4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47273487/-/Beach_Bum__Starring_Alan_Ilagan_DETAIL4.jpg","width":794,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1864745,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"},{"id":1870705,"name":"Cheesecake Boys","permalink":"cheesecake-boys","url":"/category/cheesecake-boys"},{"id":5236224,"name":"Rainbow","permalink":"rainbow","url":"/category/rainbow"}]},{"id":4140480,"name":"Sanctuary | prints","permalink":"sanctuary-prints","position":16,"price":35.0,"default_price":35.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sanctuary-prints","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-07-24T03:46:02.000Z","description":"Small: 13\" x 11\" \r\n(image size: 11” x 8.25”)\r\n$35.00\r\n\r\nMedium: 20” x 16” \r\n(image size: 18\" x 13.5\") \r\n$75.00\r\n\r\nLarge: 26” x 20” \r\n(image size: 24\" x 18”)\r\n$150.00\r\n\r\n• Limited-edition (small and medium: series of 200, large: series of 100)\r\n• Printed on enhanced matte paper \r\n• Signed below image\r\n\r\nEveryone needs a respite from turmoil, a safe haven where troubles can be left at the door, a true escape. As a child, I often disappeared into my imagination. There, I could explore fantastical worlds where bullying, self-doubt, and fear were never welcome. A gangly, awkward boy from the Midwest could become a fairy tale princess or a glamorous movie star. And when the white walls of home felt too confining, more enchanted surroundings were just around the corner. Art gave me a means of capturing my daydreams, making them real, and seeing the work of other artists meant being invited into their secret worlds too. My hope for everyone is that they can discover their own sanctuary — a place to restore, nurture, and protect themselves — even if it exists only in their imagination.\r\n\r\n©2011 Paul Richmond","options":[{"id":13681376,"name":"Small","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":13681378,"name":"Medium","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":13681380,"name":"Large","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/40434040/-/Sanctuary_lowres.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/40434040/-/Sanctuary_lowres.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/40434048/-/Sanctuary_detail1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/40434048/-/Sanctuary_detail1.jpg","width":774,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/40434056/-/Sanctuary_detail2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/40434056/-/Sanctuary_detail2.jpg","width":583,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/40434072/-/Sanctuary_detail3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/40434072/-/Sanctuary_detail3.jpg","width":1000,"height":725},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/40434088/-/Sanctuary_detail4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/40434088/-/Sanctuary_detail4.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1864745,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"},{"id":1876725,"name":"Personal Narrative","permalink":"personal-narrative","url":"/category/personal-narrative"}]},{"id":3453062,"name":"Saving His Ass | print","permalink":"saving-his-ass-print","position":18,"price":35.0,"default_price":35.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/saving-his-ass-print","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-03-19T20:29:42.000Z","description":"Small: 11\" x 13\"\r\n(image size: 8.25\" x 11\")\r\n$35.00\r\n\r\n• Limited-edition (series of 200)\r\n• Printed on enhanced matte paper\r\n• Signed below image\r\n\r\nOur steadfast hero certainly has his hands full in this cheeky medieval scene!

I had to approach the piece from an angle that I could relate to, so in addition to an elephant, circus tents, whips, and other more literal references, my tortured animal’s pain is masked by a vibrant splash of drag-queen make-up mimicking that of the ominous clownish, drag queen/ringmaster face looming in the background.\r\n\r\nMedium: Painting Oil\r\nSurface: Panel, unframed with painted edges\r\nWidth: 9 inches\r\nHeight: 12 inches\r\nDepth: 1 inches\r\n\r\n©2009 Paul Richmond","options":[{"id":11033749,"name":"Default","price":750.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":20.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":20.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":40.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31450651/-/Elegant_Imbalance.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31450651/-/Elegant_Imbalance.jpg","width":674,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31450613/-/Elegant_Imbalance4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31450613/-/Elegant_Imbalance4.jpg","width":672,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31450627/-/Elegant_Imbalance5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31450627/-/Elegant_Imbalance5.jpg","width":900,"height":693},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31450659/-/Elegant_Imbalance2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31450659/-/Elegant_Imbalance2.jpg","width":764,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31450675/-/Elegant_Imbalance3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31450675/-/Elegant_Imbalance3.jpg","width":766,"height":900}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1864743,"name":"Paintings","permalink":"paintings","url":"/category/paintings"},{"id":1876723,"name":"Political Themes","permalink":"political-themes","url":"/category/political-themes"}]},{"id":3258221,"name":"In Hot Pursuit, Starring Jesse Archer | prints","permalink":"in-hot-pursuit-starring-jesse-archer-print","position":27,"price":35.0,"default_price":35.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/in-hot-pursuit-starring-jesse-archer-print","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-02-09T03:46:42.000Z","description":"Small: 11\" x 13\"\r\n(image size: 8.25\" x 11\")\r\n$35.00\r\n\r\nMedium: 16” x 20”\r\n(image size: 13.5” x 18”)\r\n$75.00\r\n\r\nLarge: 20” x 26”\r\n(image size: 18” x 24”)\r\n$150.00\r\n\r\n• Limited-edition (small and medium: series of 200, large: series of 100)\r\n• Printed on enhanced matte paper\r\n• Signed below image\r\n\r\nHeartthrob Jesse Archer is having a rough day. While jogging through the dark, spooky forest (possibly not his smartest choice), he realizes that he isn’t alone. And his pursuant, a shadowy, knock-kneed monster with an appetite for cute hunks, seems to be picking up speed! It doesn’t help that suddenly the branches in Jesse’s path act like menacing claws, tearing his skimpy outfit to shreds and blocking his path to freedom. Like the countless female victims of slasher flicks that came before him, our hero’s fate is sealed. But that won’t stop him from putting up a good fight — and of course losing his clothes in the process!\r\n\r\nJesse Archer shared his thoughts about the painting: \"I've never been painted before and it’s an honor because Paul is so talented. I also love his concept for me. I can't think of anything better than an homage to female slasher victims who can't keep their clothes on!\" \r\n\r\n©2010 Paul Richmond\r\nOriginal painting is available through <a href=\"http://www.lymaneyerart.com/ItemDisplay.aspx?artistid=83 \">Lyman-Eyer Gallery</a>","options":[{"id":12868334,"name":"Small","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":12706922,"name":"Medium","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":11084869,"name":"Large","price":150.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31620361/-/In_Hot_Pursuit__Starring_Jesse_Archer.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31620361/-/In_Hot_Pursuit__Starring_Jesse_Archer.jpg","width":747,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31620249/-/In_Hot_Pursuit__Starring_Jesse_Archer_Detail4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31620249/-/In_Hot_Pursuit__Starring_Jesse_Archer_Detail4.jpg","width":704,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31620265/-/In_Hot_Pursuit__Starring_Jesse_Archer_Detail3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31620265/-/In_Hot_Pursuit__Starring_Jesse_Archer_Detail3.jpg","width":788,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31620283/-/In_Hot_Pursuit__Starring_Jesse_Archer_Detail2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31620283/-/In_Hot_Pursuit__Starring_Jesse_Archer_Detail2.jpg","width":748,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31620313/-/In_Hot_Pursuit__Starring_Jesse_Archer_Detail1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31620313/-/In_Hot_Pursuit__Starring_Jesse_Archer_Detail1.jpg","width":702,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1864745,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"},{"id":1870705,"name":"Cheesecake Boys","permalink":"cheesecake-boys","url":"/category/cheesecake-boys"}]},{"id":3668040,"name":"Woke Up in a Strange Place | print","permalink":"woke-up-in-a-strange-place-print","position":28,"price":35.0,"default_price":35.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/woke-up-in-a-strange-place-print","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-04-28T08:30:37.000Z","description":"Small: 11\" x 13\"\r\n(image size: 7.3\" x 11\")\r\n$35.00\r\n\r\n• Limited-edition (series of 200)\r\n• Printed on enhanced matte paper\r\n• Signed below image\r\n\r\nThis dramatic scene was commissioned by Dreamspinner Press for their novel release \"Woke Up in a Strange Place\" by Eric Arvin.

In a delightful, mid-afternoon backyard setting, man’s best friend unleashes a revelatory inspection of his owner’s unmentionables. And of course this brief exposure occurs in open view of lucky neighbors and passersby. A Cheesecake Boy, always suave and collected, must face these daily hindrances to staying dressed with trademark composure. So even with a dog on a mission and trousers around his knees, our boy doesn’t fret. He knows he’s got what it takes, despite the curious puppy trying to strip it away.
