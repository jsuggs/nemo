Cave States’ first album, The Great Divide, is a low-key headphones record with songs recorded live with minimal overdubs. The acoustic-based songs on “The Great Divide” suggests a loose, internal dialogue or perhaps even a conversation between two close confidants regarding themes of love, loss, hope, alienation, doubt and devotion.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nABOUT GRABAU & KATHRINER\r\nBoth Grabau and Kathriner have a long history of playing music in and around the St. Louis music community.  Each have led bands or have supported other artists and projects.  Danny Kathriner’s band, Half Knots, released their 4th record “Proof” in early 2013.  Danny also led the seminal alt-country band, Wagon and is currently the drummer for both Colonel Ford and Magnolia Summer.\r\n\r\nGrabau’s most current project, Magnolia Summer, is planning to release their 4th record on Undertow in January 2014.  In addition to his songwriting pursuits, Chris is often seen playing lead guitar for several St. Louis-based bands including; Half Knots, Finn’s Motel, and Waterloo.\r\n","options":[{"id":48059763,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.85,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":6.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127529658/-/cavestates_greatdivide_hires_utow.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127529658/-/cavestates_greatdivide_hires_utow.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":1746,"name":"Magnolia Summer","permalink":"magnolia-summer","url":"/artist/magnolia-summer"}],"categories":[{"id":52398,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":14414193,"name":"Overseas: Navy Blue with Yellow \"s.V.s\" T-Shirt","permalink":"navy-blue-with-yellow-overseas-t-shirt","position":2,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/navy-blue-with-yellow-overseas-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-25T21:06:35.000Z","description":"American Apparel shirt.

A lot of people didn't much like that yard, so that's why I felt compelled to pay tribute to it as part of my Dead Stadiums series. Many of us saw incredible feats by Nolan Ryan, Fergie Jenkins, Ruben Sierra, Julio Franco, and Pete Incaviglia there. It's also where Robin Ventura got his face pummeled by Ryan in August of '93. \r\n\r\nMy pals Satch Grimsley and Sarah Costilow did a great deal of the legwork on this batch.

After the huge crossover success of 2002's Control (JT1072), it was only a matter of time before David Bazan and company would fully realize their potential swansong. Beautifully achieved, Achilles' Heel (JT1095) is crafted as a scathing glance into the crosshairs of the American dream, a heartbreaking sketch of husbandhood and ultimately an exploration of faith as told through eleven perfectly textured vignettes. As sonically mature as it is emotionally complex, Achilles' Heel is imbued with the hopeful sadness that only Pedro The Lion can, and do deliver.\r\n\r\n* Each album comes with a digital download coupon inside.\r\n* Album art printed on high-quality uncoated paper. \r\n* Records pressed in Cleveland, OH by Gotta Groove Records.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2626437&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=false&amp;color=a9c8e6\"></iframe>","options":[{"id":29200478,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":7.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.75,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":22.0,"amount_with_others":11.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91727330/-/achilles-vinyl.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91727330/-/achilles-vinyl.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":1579,"name":"David Bazan","permalink":"david-bazan","url":"/artist/david-bazan"},{"id":1633,"name":"Headphones","permalink":"headphones","url":"/artist/headphones"},{"id":1580,"name":"Pedro The Lion","permalink":"pedro-the-lion","url":"/artist/pedro-the-lion"}],"categories":[{"id":52431,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":6774435,"name":"Pedro The Lion: Control - Remastered Vinyl Re-Issue","permalink":"pedro-the-lion-control-remastered-vinyl-re-issue","position":63,"price":14.0,"default_price":14.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pedro-the-lion-control-remastered-vinyl-re-issue","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-24T01:51:41.000Z","description":"BACK IN STOCK!!!\r\n\r\nPedro The Lion's 2002 landmark album is available on vinyl once again after being out of print for years. \r\n\r\nRemastered for vinyl by TW Walsh.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Pedro The Lion returned, armed with a ten-song arsenal that heralded another beautiful progression within the band’s sound and lyrical vision.

Stripped down to a voice and a guitar, Bazan is a modern-day folk champion. Behind a band, he loses his timidity and commands attention with an impassioned voice and a compelling narrative.

What makes this album such a rarity in today's music world is the allowance of the songs' infectious simplicity to stand alone in all their glory. In doing so, Farrar, Johnson, Parker, and Yames have paid the greatest compliment to Woody Guthrie and the collaborative spirit he so greatly embodied. This is an album which seamlessly converges the sepia-toned essence of the time honored past with the risks needed to forge the future.\r\n\r\n1. Hoping Machine\r\n2. Fly High\r\n3.

Look for it in the summer.\r\n\r\nHere's the skinny from the band:\r\n\r\n\"Although it may not be obvious, most Bottle Rockets songs are written on acoustic guitar. In contrast to being identified as a loud rock band, we enjoy the opportunities to perform without amplifiers and electricity. Songwriting is distinctly showcased under those stripped down conditions and requires the songs to sink or swim on their own. And on such occasions, we are always amused by the tangle of cords, plugs, and wires that are still involved with supposedly 'unplugged' music.\r\n\r\nChoosing the right venue is important to the success of any show, and the Lucas School House in St. Louis was our correct choice for two sold out shows. Located on the edge of the historic Soulard neighborhood, the venue was formerly a one-room school built in 1898. The small, second floor gymnasium had been renovated into a concert hall with a beautiful wooden interior, stained glass, plush leather seating and state-of-the-art sound system. Serving as an ideal listening room during its short life, any performance in that space was an intimate music experience.\r\n\r\nRecordings from those shows provide the material for this live album and the songs selected here include a mix of favorites, rarities, reinventions, and performances in-the-moment. Although the Lucas School House has since closed, this album preserves the essence of those two special nights.\"\r\n\r\n-Bloodshot Records\r\n\r\nTrack Listing\r\n1. Early In The Morning\r\n2.

The song \"Milk Man\" was chosen in 2009 as one of Pitchfork's top tracks of the decade.","options":[{"id":22464597,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":14.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":19.0,"amount_with_others":19.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":21.0,"amount_with_others":21.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69654529/-/05147_prc-222estore.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69654529/-/05147_prc-222estore.jpg","width":438,"height":438}],"artists":[{"id":137443,"name":"Deerhoof","permalink":"deerhoof","url":"/artist/deerhoof"}],"categories":[{"id":52431,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":7100961,"name":"Deerhoof: Reveille LP","permalink":"deerhoof-reveille-lp","position":194,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/deerhoof-reveille-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-30T02:33:33.000Z","description":"180 Gram Light Blue Vinyl.\r\n\r\n1.
