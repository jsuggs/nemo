This is about simply 'being' in whichever way you choose, or whatever way you have to. <br>\r\nThis is about letting go, moving on and searching for the life that is out there just waiting to be lived. \r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n<i>71 pages\r\n6x9\"\r\n\r\nReleased: \r\n14th August 2013\r\n\r\nCover Illustration: \r\n© Yasmin
