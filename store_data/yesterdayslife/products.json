For me poetry is music without a beat, its raw, no interruptions. We all live a life with a mixture of emotions; a life with various experiences. Death, life, love, hate; it's all here in.....Yesterdays Life. \r\n\r\nYESTERDAY'S LIFE is a collection of 60 poems written by myself from 2002 to 2009","options":[{"id":10263575,"name":"DEFAULT","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/28817789/-/YES.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/28817789/-/YES.jpg","width":604,"height":450}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1742103,"name":"POETRY","permalink":"poetry","url":"/category/poetry"}]}]
