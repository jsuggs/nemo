From the playfully teetering “Projections,” to the somber ballad “Nathan,” to the night sky tone poem “Camp,” each song seems to create an unheard-before mood. All players are featured interacting throughout with Schuller’s drums starting off the album on “Tonic.” Baggetta’s electric guitar is featured on the uptempo “Momentum,” while his acoustic playing is showcased on the Ralph Towner-esque solo piece “The Winter Moon.” “The Sky & The Sea” features a beautiful solo bass introduction by Opsvik. This is truly new music full of original voices and beautiful heartfelt performances.\r\n\r\nTo sample tracks, visit:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.mikebaggetta.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mikebaggetta.com</a>","options":[{"id":14863359,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/44467637/-/source_material.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/44467637/-/source_material.jpg","width":900,"height":891}],"artists":[{"id":84279,"name":"Mike Baggetta","permalink":"mike-baggetta","url":"/artist/mike-baggetta"}],"categories":[{"id":2486171,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":4536189,"name":"Canto - Mike Baggetta (CD)","permalink":"canto","position":5,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/canto","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-09-30T09:32:34.000Z","description":"Mike Baggetta, Solo Prepared Guitar\r\n2010\r\nMabnotesMusic (MMCD001)\r\n\r\nTracks:\r\ni\r\nii\r\niii\r\niv\r\nv\r\nvi\r\nvii\r\nviii\r\nix\r\n\r\nCanto is Mike Baggetta’s seminal album of prepared guitar etudes. Originally released in 2002 on the now defunct Optical Sounds label, this new reissue features an impressive remastering of the audio by engineer Jon Rosenberg as well as a completely redesigned package, including Baggetta’s new liner notes about the project. The reissue of this important work is also the first release on the new label, MabnotesMusic. The music on this album captures the nuance and subtlety of tone that has become part of Baggetta's musical trademark, establishing him as one of his generation's most thoughtful and adventurous improvisors. The nine etudes included on Canto explore the inherent flexibility of the prepared guitar, its productive sounds and their application as melodic material. Testing the boundaries of form and aesthetics, Baggetta delivers a powerful musical statement that is sure to delight and challenge his listeners.\r\n\r\nTo sample tracks, visit:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.mikebaggetta.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mikebaggetta.com</a>","options":[{"id":14849997,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/44466417/-/canto.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/44466417/-/canto.jpg","width":588,"height":577}],"artists":[{"id":84279,"name":"Mike Baggetta","permalink":"mike-baggetta","url":"/artist/mike-baggetta"}],"categories":[{"id":2486171,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
