Gender unknown. $90</b>\r\n\r\nThese beasts make great pets, but please note: Although bites are rare and non-life threatening, there is always a risk of infection or allergic reaction to bites, so care must be taken.\r\n\r\nIt is <b>legal</b> to own these Australian native invertebrates in all states except TAS and WA. \r\n\r\nCaring for your pet: make sure you keep your invertebrate in a secure container with access to food and water. Do not attempt to house them together, they will probably fight. \r\n\r\nFeeding: Small live insects are best, such as crickets, grasshoppers, silverfish, slaters, and moths. Do not use ants, wasps or biting insects as food. If you are catching live food yourself, make sure it has not been in contact with poison or pesticide! In the winter, your pet may only feed once or twice a month. Keep your pet in a dark, cool place with plenty of ventilation, dirt/sand and bark.\r\n\r\nAll creatures should arrive by post within a week. Spiders and Centipedes not suitable for schools.","options":[{"id":20761757,"name":"Delena Cancerides juvenile 50mm - $70","price":70.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":20761759,"name":"Delena Cancerides 100ml","price":120.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":20761761,"name":"Scolopendrid Centipede 70mm","price":90.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":20761763,"name":"Native black cockroach 30mm","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64148117/-/photo__11_.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64148117/-/photo__11_.JPG","width":900,"height":900}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
