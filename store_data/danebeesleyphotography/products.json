With cheeky and endearing cartoon sketches and hasty diary scribbles, take a peek at the sweaty, boozy life of the rock photographer as he moves from gig to portrait to band shoot, from Nick Cave to Evan Dando to the The Dandy Wharhols. Dirty and beautiful, Splitting the Seconds bottles a decade in Australian rock.\r\n\r\n\"Flick through this book, grab your jacket and run out that door 'cos something magical has to happen.\" —Rolling Stone\r\n\r\n93 pages\r\n215  x 215 mm\r\nISBN: 978-0-646-55215-6 \r\n ","options":[{"id":9897762,"name":"Default","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":30.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":35.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":35.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":35.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":30.0,"amount_with_others":30.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":35.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/38947955/-/Splitting_The_Seconds.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/38947955/-/Splitting_The_Seconds.jpg","width":425,"height":367}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1680476,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":7641099,"name":"The Road","permalink":"the-road","position":2,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-road","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-23T05:35:15.000Z","description":"Long before Kerouac enticed a generation of Beatniks westward across an unknown America, the Road has occupied a mythic place in the Western imagination, between obligation and adventure, between truth and fantasy, between youth and young manhood.  \r\n\r\nSemioticians may argue that the Road leads nowhere, that the Road itself is the destination, and it's perhaps this theme that Beesley explores most deeply. His images trace an unknown timeline to an unknown destination, where Dane appears only as a tall shadow. There's an honesty, a quest for truth, perhaps a naiveté in the images reminiscent of cinema verite that captures the adolescent wanderlust it seeks to document.  \r\n\r\n50 pages\r\n210 x 260 mm \r\nHardcover with dust jacket\r\nISBN: 978-0-646-58254-2\r\n\r\nFree postage in Australia.","options":[{"id":24120867,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75009600/-/Book_Depeched.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75009600/-/Book_Depeched.jpg","width":432,"height":352}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1680476,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":4670123,"name":"Large Car of Brooklyn (Print)","permalink":"large-car-of-brooklyn-print","position":3,"price":150.0,"default_price":150.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/large-car-of-brooklyn-print","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-10-20T04:33:07.000Z","description":"A select group of Dane's most popular images are now available for sale.
