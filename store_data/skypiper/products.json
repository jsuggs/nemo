So HERE'S THE REAL DEAL!\r\n\r\nTHIRTEEN ARTISTS created thirteen works of art to accompany thirteen songs by Skypiper.  Each art piece is in order with the album so that the listener may view the art piece while listening to the song.\r\n\r\nEach artist was given an unfinished version of a song from \"SKYPIPER\" (while the band was still in the studio) with the only instructions being to create an art piece based on that song.  No rules.  No direction.  Only that the piece be directly based on the song.  Artists had no idea what other artist's pieces looked like.  Some used pencil, some used water color, some took photo's, some used a ball-point pen.  The finished product is EXACLY what Skypiper wanted.  A quality, hard-bound book, with high definition/color images, of pure original art based on each song from the album.  \r\n\r\nThe \"SKYPIPER BLACK BOOK\" is a landscaped, hardbound book that contains 40 pages of high definition imagery- including thirteen art pieces as well as band photo's and thanks.  The dimensions of the book are 5.5 inches tall by 8.5 inches long, when the book is closed.\r\n\r\n{THIS COMES WITH A FREE 'TROUBLEDOER' CD!}","options":[{"id":14770323,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/44151299/-/CD_book_combo.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/44151299/-/CD_book_combo.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":147476,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":4441663,"name":"SKYPIPER (Selftitled LP) ","permalink":"skypiper-selftitled-lp","position":3,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/skypiper-selftitled-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-09-14T21:57:25.000Z","description":"SKYPIPER is Skypiper's sophomore LP released on September 9th, 2011.\r\nThe album contains thirteen new Skypiper songs.  \r\nThe \"Skypiper Black Book\" is meant to accompany this album.\r\n\r\n{THIS COMES WITH A FREE 'TROUBLEDOER CD'!}","options":[{"id":14562135,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43474897/-/Skypiper_Album_Cover_thumb.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43474897/-/Skypiper_Album_Cover_thumb.jpg","width":734,"height":736}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":147476,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":154528,"name":"Lay Low and Pretty (Debut LP)","permalink":"cd-lay-low-and-pretty","position":4,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cd-lay-low-and-pretty","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-09-19T06:52:23.000Z","description":"\"Lay Low and Pretty\" is the title of Skypiper's DEBUT album released in May of 2008.
