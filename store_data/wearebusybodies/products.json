Smith has performed under the moniker Mayor McCA for the past 15 years. Operating as a one-man band he borrowed the term, and half jokingly, referred to himself as “The hardest working man in showbiz”, funny but no less true. It’s safe to say that as a vaudeville style act (singing, playing, and tap dancing) he turned a few heads.\r\n\r\nThe charismatic Smith has gained recognition among his peers as a hard working talent. That reputation led to opening slots for Feist, Daniel Johnston, Chad VanGaalen, Slow Club, Noisettes, and more. Beyond his hard work, the real achievement has been the songs and that’s the reason for the new direction Smith has chosen.\r\n\r\nAfter five albums, and two tribute shows the focus is being placed solely on songwriting. As a solo act (or occasionally with a backing band) Smith will showcase his new direction and let the music speak for itself.","options":[{"id":19339785,"name":"Default","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59404689/-/jacket.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59404689/-/jacket.jpg","width":988,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":118535,"name":"CA Smith (formerly Mayor McCa)","permalink":"ca-smith-formerly-mayor-mcca","url":"/artist/ca-smith-formerly-mayor-mcca"}],"categories":[{"id":1534790,"name":"LPs","permalink":"lps","url":"/category/lps"}]},{"id":3605488,"name":"Rock Plaza Central - Cow and Bird 7\"","permalink":"rock-plaza-central-cow-and-bird-7","position":10,"price":9.5,"default_price":9.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rock-plaza-central-cow-and-bird-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-04-15T23:35:40.000Z","description":"Limited edition single as part of the We Are Busy Bodies single series by Toronto folk/rock storytellers Rock Plaza Central.\r\n\r\n100 copies have been printed on clear flexi vinyl, 60 of which are available for sale.\r\n\r\n\r\nSide A: Cow and Bird\r\nSide B: I Want You\r\n\r\n* cost includes shipping to wherever records can be shipped to.
