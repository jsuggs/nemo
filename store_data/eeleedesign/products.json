Because owls have forward-facing eyes, they have well-developed binocular vision. Contrary to popular myth, an owl cannot turn its head completely backwards. It can turn its head 135 degrees in either direction; it can thus look behind its own shoulders, with a total 270-degree field of view\r\n","options":[{"id":22780977,"name":"A4 Framed ","price":15.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":22780979,"name":"A4 Print","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/70541999/-/owlframed.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/70541999/-/owlframed.jpg","width":1000,"height":707}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3680861,"name":"Illustration","permalink":"illustration","url":"/category/illustration"}]},{"id":7190165,"name":"The Celt","permalink":"the-celt","position":3,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-celt","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-09-08T21:31:05.000Z","description":"The Idea behind the Celt was to create an abstract interpretation of an old Celtic soul.
