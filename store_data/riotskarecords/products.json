Lyrically the EP tackles ethics and morality in our modern societies and the battle of religion vs science in this arena. Do the cardinal sins matter any more? Should society allow religion to determine morals and ethics? How ethical is our culture and do we care about the right things?!\r\n\r\n10 Tracks in just under twenty minutes and in full color digipak ltd edition CD\r\n\r\n01. Preface \r\n02. Sloth \r\n03.
