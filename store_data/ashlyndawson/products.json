We are: marketers, accountants, client care specialists and advertisers among many other things. Many of us are also moms, wives, daughters, sisters and friends. \r\n\r\nE-mailing clients back and forth was very time consuming. Instead of customizing an e-mail for each client I created 10 commonly sent templates from the moment my clients initially contact me to the moment they receive their galleries. \r\n\r\nThe Newborn E-mail Templates will help to streamline your workflow, increase your efficiency by responding to e-mails quickly, cut down work hours and eliminate the tedious and seemingly endless task of e-mailing. Spend less time e-mailing and more time doing what you love, better yet, spend more time with those whom you love!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PDF is designed to serve as a starting point for newborn photographers. It is recommended that you tweak these templates to suit your specific business needs.\r\n\r\n- Initial E-mail Response For New Client Inquiries\r\n- Client Asking For A Discount\r\n- Client Is Requesting A Style Contrary To Yours\r\n- Confirming Session Info\r\n- Thank You E-Mail (Immediately Following Session)\r\n- Viewing Gallery: Digital Downloads\r\n- Viewing Gallery: When Offering A CD or USB\r\n- Viewing Gallery: Online Sales\r\n- In Person Sales Session\r\n\r\n\r\nThis template is a digital download, NO REFUNDS OR EXCHANGES are permitted under any circumstances.
