In the mid-nineteenth century, a very large lumberjack - some say he was eight feet tall - named Paul Bonjean lived in New Brunswick, Canada. He is told to have been a fierce and brave lumber boss, and apparently helped the French Canadians win in the Papineau Rebellion of 1837. As men moved between lumber camps, they told the tale of Paul Bonjean. Over time, his name became anglicized to Paul Bunyan, and his size grew to over 30 feet tall. \r\n\r\nHand printed chine-colle lino cut. \r\n4\"x6\"","options":[{"id":33988767,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/106380285/-/WMTC_bonjean.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/106380285/-/WMTC_bonjean.gif","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5154564,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":10772307,"name":"Wild Man Trading Card: The Krampus","permalink":"wild-man-trading-card-the-krampus","position":5,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wild-man-trading-card-the-krampus","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-25T20:09:23.000Z","description":"Number two in the series of Wild Men Trading Cards is 'The Krampus.' \r\nOnce the chained slave of Saint Nicholas, this snarling creature was presented as a threat to all those naughty children who could not rehearse biblical verse on command: if they failed, Krampus would steal them back to his cave and gobble them up. \r\n\r\nHand printed chine-colle lino cut. \r\n4\"x6\"","options":[{"id":33984576,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/106379961/-/WMTC_krampus.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/106379961/-/WMTC_krampus.gif","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5154564,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]}]
