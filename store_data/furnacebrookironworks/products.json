Able to fit into nearly any home decor. No two are the same and the history and character attached to each piece of this wood cannot be duplicated.\r\n\r\nThis one was made with a 2\" thick piece of white oak flooring from an ancient dairy barn here in Vermont that was dismantled last year. Shown with four of our large hand forged ball end wall hooks in the rust finish. It is a heavy impressive wall rack that can hold nearly anything you choose to hang on it.\r\n\r\nThe look of real barn wood and hand forged wrought iron is extremely popular now and we will be adding new pieces in the coming months.\r\n\r\nApproximately 32\" long but can be made in other lengths and hook sizes.
