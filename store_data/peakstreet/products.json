The group show at Per Square Metre featured work by some of Australia’s most infamous graf writers, illustrators, designers & other assorted art delinquents. The theme of the show was inspired by the classic Nas Illmatic-era lyric ‘Sleep is the Cousin of Death’ and the canvasses that each artist has to work with are two old vinyl LP’s.\r\n\r\nFeaturing: \r\nADNATE / AEON / AKSIS / AMUCK/ APE7 / APRIL77 / ATOME / BEASTMAN / BENZO / BLIGS / CHAD MANN / CULTURAL URGE / DABS / DAEK / DEB / DUEL / DVATE / GIMIKS / ITCH / JOSH2000 / JOTA ONE / KID9 / KID ZOOM / MAKATRON / MEGGS / MEXI / MIKE / MISTERY / MYLA / MYSTIK / NATE HOLMES TRAPNELL / NICK BAZAROW / NOBODY / ORBSEY / PHIBS / PHIGER 1 / PIKER / POISE / PORE / REACH / REKA / SEAR / SHIME / SLEEP / SMC / SON OF SANCHEZ / SOSIO / SPICE / STORE / SUBWAY SUDS / SWAZE1 / TAHNS / TEAZER / TIMBA / TUSK2 / VANS\r\n\r\nCheck photos and videos here;\r\n\r\nhttp://peakstreet.com/exhibition\r\n\r\nWe produced a limited run of 500 booklets which we still have a handful of.
