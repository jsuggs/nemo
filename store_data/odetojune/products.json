The Swiss Military manufactured these blankets from 1917 until the early 1960s. The 2 that I have listed are \"new old stock\" - meaning that they were never issued for use once manufactured. They are from the tail-end of manufacture.\r\n2. Some blankets do have a stainless steel coin attached but not all were manufactured that way - these do not.\r\n3. From my understanding, the blankets were numbered when issued, and some of the early blankets from the World War I & II era had initials for the manufacturer name and year. After World War II they stopped requiring this of their war vendors As these were never issued for use - they are blank.\r\n4.. They are 100% wool and there are no moth holes, smells, defects or stains.\r\n\r\n\r\nC L E A N I N G:\r\nThe blankets are 100% wool and should never be washed.\r\nOptions:\r\n1. Dryclean\r\n2. Hand wash in Woolite & hang dry.\r\n3. Use drycleaning sheets in the dryer\r\n\r\nI N T E R N A T I O N A L  S H I P P I N G\r\nI am more than happy to ship internationally, \r\nplease send me a note so that I can calcuate the best shipping price prior to buying.\r\n\r\nBUYING MORE THAN 1?\r\nSend me a note & I will calculate the best shipping price for you!\r\n\r\nenjoy!\r\n\r\nHave any questions?
