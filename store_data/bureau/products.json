She works across a range of media, incorporating painting, installation, and video, in a practice that is underpinned by an interest in the concept of balance, discordant and harmonious. For 'Lobachevsky's Dream', Popova continues to engage with the materiality of painting, which is central to her practice, in conjunction with ideas of installation and display. \r\n\r\nHer paintings have a graphic quality, featuring elliptical curves and repeated, rhythmic shapes, recalling the aesthetics of both Russian Constructivism and Minimalism. As abstraction they have an immediate tie to the twentieth century history of abstract painting. Yet Popova moves beyond the confines of this specific historic legacy, producing works that have the ability to speak and connect meaningfully to painting’s past and to the present. \r\n\r\nRecent solo exhibitions include: The Portrait Gallery, Cole, London (2013); Portrait Gallery Withdrawn, as part of Abstract Possible, Eastside Projects, Birmingham; Olympic Throw, Zabludowicz Collection ‘Invites’, London; and Unnamed, Figge Von Rosen Gallery, Berlin (2012).
