Recorded over a period of six months in 2010 this release finds a balance between the sporadic but rhythmic vigour of the first two tracks and the dynamic post-rock noise explosions of the later tracks, culminating in an impromptu untitled track that ends the record in quintessentially Silent World fashion. Recorded, mixed, mastered and pressed in Perth, Western Australia.","options":[{"id":10108110,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/28230806/-/Cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/28230806/-/Cover.jpg","width":509,"height":509}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1716652,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
