But that doesn’t stop him trying and failing and trying again. The Swamp that Ding calls home features two good runways, an Air Traffic Controller, a Flying School and a host of other assorted wildlife including all the other Ducks who get to do what Ding is hoping to do himself one day.. Fly South for the Winter with all the other Ducks.\r\n\r\nAs you follow Ding’s daily life cycle of flying attempts, failures, flying lessons, theory classes, exams and everything else that goes on in this feathered parallel world to the other less natural, mechanical form of aviation you will discover a wonderful truth: There is little difference between these two worlds and there is much humour to be enjoyed in both.\r\n\r\nThis book is dedicated to everyone who has ever wanted to fly.","options":[{"id":25071855,"name":"Default","price":14.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/78004860/-/iwanttofly-cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/78004860/-/iwanttofly-cover.jpg","width":417,"height":602},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/78004872/-/iwanttofly-page012.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/78004872/-/iwanttofly-page012.jpg","width":696,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/78004884/-/iwanttofly-page015.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/78004884/-/iwanttofly-page015.jpg","width":704,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/78004824/-/iwanttofly-page124.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/78004824/-/iwanttofly-page124.jpg","width":693,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/78004836/-/iwanttofly-back.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/78004836/-/iwanttofly-back.jpg","width":393,"height":570}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2619629,"name":"Aviation Comics & Cartoons","permalink":"aviation-comics-cartoons","url":"/category/aviation-comics-cartoons"}]},{"id":7589689,"name":"Julio's Hat \"pre-work\"","permalink":"julio-s-hat-pre-work","position":10,"price":12.95,"default_price":12.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/julio-s-hat-pre-work","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-18T18:06:58.000Z","description":"As you all know, Julio is known for wearing a red ball cap all day, every day, and backwards so the brim doesn't get in the way while he is working.\r\nNow you can have Julio's \"Roost Air\" hat as well.\r\n\r\n\"ROOST AIR\" logo embroidered in the front.\r\n\r\nPort & Company six panel twill cap\r\nAdult size\r\nadjustable strap in the back, velcro, just like Julio's hat","options":[{"id":23969783,"name":"Default","price":12.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74497393/-/hat-01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74497393/-/hat-01.jpg","width":1000,"height":778},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74497385/-/hat-02.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74497385/-/hat-02.jpg","width":1000,"height":728}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2619637,"name":"Gifts and Gags","permalink":"gifts-and-gags","url":"/category/gifts-and-gags"}]},{"id":4849921,"name":"Please Wait, to be seated!","permalink":"please-wait-to-be-seated","position":11,"price":14.95,"default_price":14.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/please-wait-to-be-seated","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-15T04:35:03.000Z","description":"“Please Wait, to be seated” is the third book of the very succesful aviation cartoon collection put together by Martin Leeuwis.

Those insights are presented as a series of tales (of the sort told by flight crews everywhere) that, while amusing and lighthearted, give reason to pause and think.\r\n\r\nPublished by iUniverse, Inc.

We have taken him in and made him a Chicken Wings character for many reasons but one sticks out: He is really funny !!\r\n\r\nHis book is really a good gift for anybody you know who loves to read. It's a compilation of tales and funny stories that are very, very loosely connected. This alone also makes it perfect for a pilot like Chuck who can’t follow a storyline through the whole book. But you don’t have to be a pilot to enjoy this book. It’s a lighthearted outlook on life through the eyes of an aviator. We would even go a step further and claim him to be sort of a “modern Saint Exupery” we like the book so much. It is also extremely well written and a real pleasure to read.\r\n\r\nAnd since Captain Ed is a friend of ours (hell, he’s Chucks uncle for crying out loud) we can offer you every copy signed by the author!
