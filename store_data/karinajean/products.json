I modified the traditional form for softness and removed portions of each facet to create a feeling of airiness, and to allow the hollowness of the pendant to be evident. It measures 30 x 25 x 25 mm and is made from bronze-infused stainless steel. \r\n\r\nThe leather I use in this design is both strong and super supple and is naturally dyed with leadfree dyes. The leather is looped through the pendant, wraps around one of its links and then becomes the neckpiece. In Tamani Duo, I add a secondary leather colour to complete the neck-piece loop. When worn, the Tamani pendant hangs roughly at lower ribcage level. \r\n\r\nTamani Duo, is available in a multitude of colour combinations, based on 6 leather colours: \r\n1 blueberry hill, 2 keppel blue\r\n3 mehandi green, 4 snow white\r\n5 violet femmes & 6 hot cocoa\r\n\r\nPlease note: this item is made to order and has a 7-10 day wait.
