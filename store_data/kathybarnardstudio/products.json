The sculpture was completed in Germany and is made of laminated art glass that features a variety of glass techniques including painting, etching, and the use of colored glass.  We are still raising funds to complete the installation of the project which includes the creation of a steel frame for the glass and a base, the pouring of concrete pylons to support the base, and the installation of the glass into the frame and the frame installed on-site on the base.
