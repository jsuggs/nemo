After all, her poems have been upsetting people in magazines and anthologies, as well as causing consternation at spoken word gigs, for around two years now. \r\n\r\nLeanne has a clinical obsession with rhyming couplets, and her playful, comedic verse has been described as 'just the right side of filthy', 'completely unexpected' and 'fucking hilarious'.\r\n\r\n'Inconceivable' is Leanne's first collection of poetry, and deals with all the important aspects of modern living. From the decline of the Goth population and the rise of the feline con artist, to the need to dress appropriately for adverse weather conditions and the importance of maintaining your follicle integrity, Leanne's poems are fun, funny and always surprising. \r\n","options":[{"id":29242145,"name":"Default","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91855202/-/BOOK_COVER_1__copy.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/91855202/-/BOOK_COVER_1__copy.png","width":349,"height":462}],"artists":[{"id":118333,"name":"Leanne Moden","permalink":"leanne-moden","url":"/artist/leanne-moden"}],"categories":[{"id":3158369,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":6036195,"name":"28 Sonnets Later","permalink":"28-sonnets-later","position":2,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/28-sonnets-later","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-26T15:01:50.000Z","description":"“The whole collection is bursting with modern life ... \r\nIt’s immediate, relevant and has a great sense of fun!” - Luke Wright\r\n\r\n\r\nIn February 2012, four poets challenged themselves to write a sonnet a day. \r\n28 Sonnets Later is the result.\r\n\r\nAndy Bennett is a poet, comedian, and idiot.

His wilfully shambolic style belies a cerebral and acerbic wit, and an honest and celebratory approach to life and performance. Andy writes poems that, two hundred years ago, would have got him rusticated. Andy also likes the word ‘rusticated’ a little more than a man should.\r\n\r\n“Daddy, What’s A Poet?” is Andy’s first collection of poetry, and contains a mixed and satirical selection of poems that combine Andy’s huge historical geekery with a desire to understand how the lessons of history can be applied to 21st Century Britain. There’s also a fair bit in there about drugs, and some really groan-worthy cartoons.\r\n\r\n32pp","options":[{"id":19297627,"name":"Default","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59253035/-/Daddy_Cover_web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59253035/-/Daddy_Cover_web.jpg","width":410,"height":539}],"artists":[{"id":116121,"name":"Andy Bennett","permalink":"andy-bennett","url":"/artist/andy-bennett"}],"categories":[{"id":3158369,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]}]
