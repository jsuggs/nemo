My hair looks better after only one overnight application!! And it doesn't weigh it down like some products I've tried.  This is my third time purchasing. I got it the first time about a year ago. About six months after that, I noticed that I had lots of short, aggravating hairs sticking up. Then I realized, oh my gosh, that I was actually growing new hair! Now I have them in all lengths all over my head. I hadn't previously been using any kind of oil on my hair because it is oily anyway, but when I researched thinning hair, oil was recommended. So I bought this and voila--new hair!! I'm not kidding, this stuff works. I'm in love with BeijaFlores products. Never stop making this stuff, please!\"  A+++\" Linda Raleigh, North Carolina\r\n\r\nCouldn't be happier with this product. All of the previous reviews I read were absolutely true. I've tried numerous drugstore OTC products for dry scalp, and this is the only one that came close to the results of a prescription treatment I used years ago. It's part of my weekly regimen now, and I will have to come back for refills.

I'm extremely picky and skeptical regarding skin care, so even though this got great reviews I decided to give it a few weeks worth of use before writing mine. The results are really that good- I've never had great skin, (too oily or too dry and always uneven and blotchy) but now I get so many compliments on my skin! My acne cleared up, all dryness is gone, and I have a much more even complexion now. I feel like this absorbs just the right amount without leaving my skin looking oily and makes me glow. I love it.

For hundreds of years it has been valued for its vitamin properties because it is rich in Vitamins A, E and F.\r\n\r\nRaw unrefined shea butter comes in a few different colors and textures from bright yellow to beige. Ours is 100% unrefined and organic and comes in a beige color that has a creamy (not sticky) texture so it easily penetrates skin and hair, providing moisture without clogging pores.\r\nNew 4oz Size\r\n\r\nCUSTOMER REVIEWS\r\n\"Incredible stuff. I've paid a small fortune for dilutions of shea butter from large companies. Here's the pure, \r\nreal deal at a fraction of the cost. Nothing moisturizes dry skin better. Period.\" Heather, Connecticut\r\n\r\n\"Your raw shea is the best i've ever had !!! my face is luminous.. i love it !!! Xx\" Dawn, London UK\r\n\r\n\"Oh my goodness! I don’t know how I ever lived without this! After experiencing the magic of shea on my face,\r\nI started using it everywhere else!

I LOVE this stuff and will be back for more. \r\nMay I never run out...\" Aisha, Utah\r\n\r\nSuggested uses for shea butter:\r\n* Daily skin moisturizer (face and body)\r\n*Overnight face cream\r\n* Treatment for premature facial lines and aging\r\n* Dry scalp treatment\r\n* Great for African hairstyles-locks, twists, braids or chemically processed hair.\r\n* Skin rash- including diaper rash\r\n* Sunburn sun damange and skin peeling, after tanning\r\n* Itching skin due to dryness\r\n* Small skin wounds, skin cracks, and minor burns\r\n* Soften tough skin on feet (especially heels)\r\n* Stretch mark prevention during pregnancy\r\n* Fade blemishes, scaring and even skin tone\r\n* Eczema and psoriasis\r\n* Sun and wind protection\r\n* Helps restore elasticity to skin\r\n* Restores luster to hair\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Shea Butter texture will be inconsistent and slightly chunky as it is 100% pure and comes straight from gourd of the Karite Nut.
