It also represents peace, tranquillity and spirituality along with a strong sense of regrowth or a new beginning. It is also often associated with nurturing so when interlocked with others is frequently used to represent strength and purity, a maze creating a spiritual centre of vital energies. The pattern is symbolic of lifeâ€™s journey, and innovation of self-discovery through the maze of existence. This design in particular shows the joining together of two in unity. Even though they sometimes move away from each other on their own journey, they will always come together again sharing their lives and blending to become one. It tells how the strength of bond of friendship, loyalty and love will last forever.","options":[{"id":19649721,"name":"Default","price":650.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60511191/-/1336694063540.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60511191/-/1336694063540.jpg","width":480,"height":270}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3200727,"name":"Sterling Silver","permalink":"sterling-silver","url":"/category/sterling-silver"}]},{"id":6182151,"name":"Circle Pendant","permalink":"koru-pendants","position":5,"price":250.0,"default_price":250.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/koru-pendants","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-05-14T09:01:30.000Z","description":"New circle pendant with a fusion of 3 materials: sterling silver, garnet cab stone and whale bone.
