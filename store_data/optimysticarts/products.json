It is based on twelve point geometry, the geometry of Anahata, the heart chakra. It is a guiding light that gently opens and attunes the heart through subtle vibrations, to pure alignment with infinite source energy. In union with Source, our boundaries of ego and skin dissolve into unity consciousness. We see beyond the illusion of separation, cultivating compassion for every human being as our brother and sister.  \r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\n12 x 12 in \r\n\r\nPrinted on Premier 310g 100% cotton archival paper\r\n\r\nEach print is hand signed and numbered, and comes with a Certificate of Authenticity.\r\n\r\nShipped flat via USPS \r\nPlease allow up to 2 weeks for your order to be shipped\r\n\r\nUS $5.00\r\nInternational $15.00\r\n","options":[{"id":48145566,"name":"Default","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127597743/-/Print02square.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127597743/-/Print02square.jpg","width":640,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128373099/-/IAmYou-detail-sm.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128373099/-/IAmYou-detail-sm.jpg","width":800,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6666543,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":14853717,"name":"The Inner Radiance | Limited Edition Giclée Print ","permalink":"the-inner-radiance-limited-edition-giclee-print","position":2,"price":60.0,"default_price":60.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-inner-radiance-limited-edition-giclee-print","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-14T21:11:06.000Z","description":"Limited Edition Giclée Print \r\nEdition of 100\r\n_\r\n\r\nEvery physical being is essentially an aggregation of material substance, and yet we are alive with consciousness and energy.
