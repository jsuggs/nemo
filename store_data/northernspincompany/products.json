The oversized diameter creates extreme stability while still maintaining maneuverability during play. The Quantum offers a completely different experience from the Aurora and Helix while still keeping our signature uncompromising performance and incredible smoothness. Each return top is enhanced with a light soda blast before coloured anodization making for a smooth, durable finish and timeless aesthetics. \r\n\r\nMaterial: \t   6000 Series Aluminium\r\nFinish: \t   Soda blasted, Colour anodized\r\nResponse:  Flowable Silicone\r\nDiameter:   60mm\r\nWidth: \t  45mm\r\nGap: \t  4.5mm\r\nWeight: \t  67 grams\r\nBearing: \t  CORE bearing\r\nUnits:         50 Units World Wide\r\nMSRP:        $125 ","options":[{"id":23592261,"name":"Green/Brown","price":125.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32099839,"name":"Blue/Grey","price":125.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34801368,"name":"Green/Grey","price":125.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34801371,"name":"Green/Blue","price":125.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34801374,"name":"Blue/Brown","price":125.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":34801377,"name":"Brown/Grey","price":125.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":20.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/101645104/-/Edit4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/101645104/-/Edit4.jpg","width":1000,"height":664},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/101645188/-/Edit3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/101645188/-/Edit3.jpg","width":1000,"height":664},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111667521/-/IMG_6705.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111667521/-/IMG_6705.JPG","width":1000,"height":667}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3787607,"name":"NS Co Return Tops","permalink":"ns-co-return-tops","url":"/category/ns-co-return-tops"}]},{"id":10809261,"name":"CORE bearing ","permalink":"core-bearing","position":2,"price":9.0,"default_price":9.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/core-bearing","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-27T18:14:56.000Z","description":"Our CORE Bearings are a ceramic and stainless steel hybrid.
