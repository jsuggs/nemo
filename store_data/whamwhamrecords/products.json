Yet they are unlike anything you have ever heard before. They combine cold Teutonic beats with loud noise eruptions, with a constant subtle erotic layer underneath. Live, the band is a four piece, with vocals, synths, guitar and cymbals.\n\n\tIn 2007 the band released their self-titled debut album on <span class=\"caps\">WHAM</span><img src=\"WHAM\" alt=\"\" />records. It was nominated record of the year by Dutch national radio station 3voor12. Adept did numerous live shows throughout the Netherlands, in Berlin, England and New York. They also performed at the Lowlands Festival (with <span class=\"caps\">LCD</span> Sound System, M.I.A., Nine Inch Nails, Interpol and others), Clash Festival (with Mr. Oizo, Jeff Mills, Noisia and others) and Rauw (3 times, with Arthur Baker, Larry Tee, Tommie Sunshine and others).\n\n\tListen to tracks on www.whamwhamrecords.nl/adept\n\n\t<span class=\"caps\">PRICE INCLUDES SHIPPING WORLDWIDE</span>!\n\n","options":[{"id":448008,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/188975/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/188975/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":2869,"name":"ADEPT","permalink":"adept","url":"/artist/adept"}],"categories":[{"id":95651,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":91330,"name":"BONNE APARTE","permalink":"bonne-aparte","position":3,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bonne-aparte","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-04-06T22:53:24.000Z","description":"BONNE APARTE – BONNE APARTE\r\nCD – 10 TRACKS\r\n\r\nOverwhelmingly loud chaos rock by six healthy young men with their hearts in the right place. We’ll be darned.\r\n \r\nThe lively scene surrounding Adept has now come up with a smack on the head released on =WHAM!WHAM!= records. Ultra short, extremely fierce songs that leave just enough space for melody. Brutal and gallant at the same time. The boys have pulled off a masterpiece in capturing their harsh live sound in the studio. The result is unprecedented in the Netherlands. Loud, in your face. An international future is ahead for the boys. References: Captain Beefheart, Shellac, Sonic Youth, Millionaire, Adept.\r\n\r\nBonne Aparte was founded in 2006. In 2008 they played on Noorderslag/EuroSonic. In May/June/July 2008 they will play Dutch clubs and festivals to promote their debut album. In September 2008 the band goes to Russia to do some shows, and in October they’re going to New York, US.\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":448012,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/188982/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/188982/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":95651,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
