You know what I mean. \r\n\r\nAnswer: you are, if your heart starts racing when you see this 1940s Wittnauer chrono with the famous Valjoux 22 movement. \r\n\r\nThis is a great WWII era watch, in solid stainless steel, not chrome-plated base metal like a lot of WWII chronos.  Check out, too, the stainless steel pushers, with beveled edges. Touches like that make this a watch to drool over. \r\n\r\nThis is eminently wearable, at 33mm across, excluding the unsigned crown, by 40mm from lug to beefy lug. \r\n\r\nCheck out the cool and complicated dial, with its share of patina, as you'd expect in a watch of this vintage. \r\n\r\nThe watch is powered by a Valjoux 22 movement, the same movement used in Rolex chronos of the period, freshly cleaned and working well. \r\n\r\nAre you a chrono guy? \r\n","options":[{"id":34790085,"name":"Default","price":799.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":35.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":70.0,"amount_with_others":70.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109176477/-/IMG_8041.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109176477/-/IMG_8041.jpg","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109176489/-/IMG_8044.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109176489/-/IMG_8044.jpg","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109176513/-/w.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109176513/-/w.jpg","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109176537/-/IMG_8045.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109176537/-/IMG_8045.jpg","width":640,"height":394},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109241649/-/IMG_8066.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109241649/-/IMG_8066.jpg","width":640,"height":480}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3596813,"name":"Sold Watches","permalink":"sold-watches","url":"/category/sold-watches"}]},{"id":8142150,"name":"VINTAGE LECOULTRE MEMOVOX - ORANGE/GRAY/AWESOME -SOLD!","permalink":"vintage-lecoultre-memovox-orange-gray-awesome","position":100,"price":1950.0,"default_price":1950.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/vintage-lecoultre-memovox-orange-gray-awesome","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-11-22T19:23:27.000Z","description":"Everyone who comes to Vintage Watch Classics knows there are two things we love:  Orange and LeCoultre. \r\n\r\nBehold, our latest find: A Lecoultre Memovox, 1970s style...slate gray dial with, yes, an orange accent.

All chrono functions working flawlessly, as you'd expect.  \r\n\r\nThe massive but manageable dimensions of the day: 42mm wide, excluding the unsigned crowns, by 38mm from lug to lug.  Comes on a new Morellato leather strap. \r\n\r\nThe watch is unused; the plastic still stuck to the back of the solid stainless steel case. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with this boutique collector's brand, here's a history written by a collector we know:  \"Ollech and Wajs, usually known among collectors as O & W, may be the only Swiss manufacturer since WWII that started as a small company, stayed small during its entire career, but gained iconic status. So many Swiss companies have come and gone since the end of WWII, it's hard to remember the names of even the really top ones, and so many of the small ones are so obscure that watch bulletin boards and collector sites are filled every day with inquiries whether anyone has heard of this brand or that brand.\r\n\r\nWithin this context, O & W, which still is active to this day, stands out as being particularly remarkable. Although they have never really grown in size beyond the two owners, they have over the years, due to their shrewd choice of niche markets, their innovative marketing and their consistent choice of excellent movements and stable quality at highly competitive prices, gained a following that many larger brands would envy.\"\r\n\r\nEnvy is right. Strap this one on.

Magnificent. \r\n\r\nThe solid 18k rose gold case is in excellent condition and it is no shrinking violet vintage: 35mm wide, excluding the unsigned crown, by a massive 42mm from lug to ribbon lug. \r\n\r\nThe manual Cal. 89 movement is keeping excellent time. There are some tiny pinpoint indentations in the dial, as photo shows.  \r\n\r\nThese IWC vintage watches are in red-hot demand. Want to know why? Take a look. Strap this one on. People will notice.
