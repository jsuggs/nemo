Each letter is individually hand stamped and variations on letter alignment is normal. The simple style makes this ring suitable for both men and women and features a smooth matte finish both inside and out. The ring also makes for a unique substitute for an otherwise traditional wedding band. \r\n\r\nThe ring measures 5mm in width, and 1mm in thickness. Because this ring is made of 100% copper, keep in mind that the metal may react with your skin. A clear wax sealant has been applied to this ring to minimize the reaction as well as general oxidization, however the wax may wear off over time. The reaction to skin is generally harmless and results in a greenish/grayish tint on the skin that can easily be washed off. \r\n\r\nEach ring is hand crafted from copper metal, and made to order. If you are unsure of your size, refer to the last image to get an idea of sizing. The copper band has been soldered with sterling silver and does feature a tiny silver sliver at the seam. \r\n\r\nThis ring will arrive to you boxed and ready for gift giving.","options":[{"id":32669551,"name":"size 4","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32669554,"name":"size 4.5","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32669557,"name":"Size 5","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32669560,"name":"Size 5.5","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32669563,"name":"Size 6","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32669566,"name":"Size 6.5","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32669569,"name":"Size 7","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32669572,"name":"Size 7.5","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32669575,"name":"Size 8","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32669578,"name":"Size 8.5","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32669581,"name":"size 9","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32669584,"name":"size 9.5","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32669587,"name":"size 10","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32669590,"name":"size 10.5","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32669593,"name":"size 11","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32669596,"name":"size 11.5","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32669599,"name":"size 12","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32669602,"name":"size 12.5","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32669605,"name":"size 13","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102536344/-/103_2777.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102536344/-/103_2777.jpg","width":1000,"height":753},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102536311/-/103_2775.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102536311/-/103_2775.jpg","width":1000,"height":753},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102536296/-/103_2772.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102536296/-/103_2772.jpg","width":1000,"height":752}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2152696,"name":"Rings","permalink":"rings","url":"/category/rings"}]},{"id":8997686,"name":"Simplicity Band - She","permalink":"simplicity-band-she","position":20,"price":48.0,"default_price":48.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/simplicity-band-she","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-17T21:16:36.000Z","description":"This ring is simply timeless.

For those unaware, Loteria is very much like BINGO, except instead of calling out letters and numbers, characters/icons are called out (and in some cases riddles) from a deck of loteria cards.  When a character on your card is called, you place a bean over it and continue to try and connect a line or group of spaces... much like BINGO. \r\n\r\nSeveral of these iconic images from loteria cards have been transformed into lovely pendants.  Each pendant is handcrafted and cast in resin and hangs from a silver tone bail off a 17 inch chain.  The entire necklace is fastened with a silver plated lobster clasp and findings.  While these pendants are water resistant, they are not entirely waterproof.  Please refrain from swimming or showering with the necklace.  \r\n\r\nMany icons have been created and are readily available, but not all loteria characters are currently available.
