Please don't hesitate to convo about colors!\r\n\r\nWhen you purchase this listing, you will receive the pair in the first picture: Black w/ White, Gray & Hot Pink skulls.\r\n\r\nPlease leave sizing choice during checkout..\r\n\r\nSizing Options:\r\n\"Regular\": 12-16 inches\r\n\"Infant\": 8-10 inches\r\nAll Leg Lovies will be made in the \"Regular\" size unless otherwise noted or requested by seller.\r\n\r\nAll of my \"Leg Lovies\" have tapered cuffs to help prevent slipping down over the feet and seams are trimmed to help them lay flat and to cut down on the bulk. I have been making these for my girls and wouldn't consider selling them if I wasn't more than satisfied with the quality of the product!\r\n\r\nWhy Leg Lovies are so great:\r\n\r\n*Leg Lovies provide extra warmth for all ages on cooler days!\r\n*Pair them with a onesie, dress or skirt and they make diaper changing a cinch! (No off and ons!)\r\n*They protect your lil crawler from chaffed knees!\r\n*Use them as Arm Lovies for those cool autumn mornings!\r\n*And, they are just so darn cute!\r\n\r\nI am not a Leg Lovie wholesaler. I buy patterns that I find cute and would put on my own girls so I don't always have an excess of each pair.
