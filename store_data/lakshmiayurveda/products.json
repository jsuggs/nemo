This precise adherence to tradition and detail ensures that you get an authentic product of unparalleled quality. \r\n\r\nAmrit Kalash is and Ayurvedic Herbal Masterpiece and a true gift to the world!\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":19396307,"name":"Default","price":76.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":11.9,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":25.7,"amount_with_others":12.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59623351/-/amrit_kalash.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59623351/-/amrit_kalash.jpg","width":225,"height":225}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1607141,"name":"Organic Ayurvedic jams","permalink":"organic-ayurvedic-jams","url":"/category/organic-ayurvedic-jams"},{"id":1608401,"name":"Organic Ayurvedic herbs","permalink":"organic-ayurvedic-herbs","url":"/category/organic-ayurvedic-herbs"}]},{"id":5974373,"name":"Dadimadi ghrta ","permalink":"dadimadi-ghrta","position":13,"price":21.5,"default_price":21.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dadimadi-ghrta","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-19T12:46:53.000Z","description":"Ingredients \r\nPomegranate juice, Coriander, Leadwort, dry ginger, long pepper and ghee. \r\n\r\nDadima is a well known medicine for pitta dosha, distate, colitis, cough, worms, indigestion, dyspepsia, anaemia and tumor. \r\n\r\nExcellent blood purifier and boosts the energy. \r\n\r\n150 gm \r\n","options":[{"id":19118595,"name":"Default","price":21.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58662813/-/ghee.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58662813/-/ghee.jpg","width":113,"height":150}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1608442,"name":"Ghrta/ Ghee","permalink":"ghrta-ghee","url":"/category/ghrta-ghee"}]},{"id":5974087,"name":"Lavender Sleep Pillow ","permalink":"lavender-sleep-pillow","position":14,"price":25.95,"default_price":25.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lavender-sleep-pillow","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-19T11:56:58.000Z","description":"If your mind is still in top gear when your head hits the pillow, try using a sleep pillow.

One of the properties that makes Amla divine is that it contains five of the six tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, astringent and pungent. This gives it a holistic, balancing effect on the doshas meaning it is tridoshic and is pacifying to all three doshas (Vata, Pitta and Kapha). Very few fruits have this quality.

Triphala is mild, non-habit forming, and a rejuvenative.\r\n\r\nTriphala is so effective because its three herbs are potent healers.\r\n\r\n1. Amalaki (Emblica Officinalis) one of Ayurveda's greatest rejuvenators and a strong natural anti-oxidant, also helps to boost the immune system. Its the highest natural known source of vitamin C. Having 20 times the vitamin C content of an orange.\r\n2. Haritaki (Terminalia Chebula) the Tibetan \"king of medicine\", a classic heart-brain-longevity tonic, is often depicted in the extended palm of the Buddha.\r\n3. Bibhitaki (Terminalia Belerica) a powerful rejuvenative that reduces liver and heart disease, also improves the voice, vision and promotes the growth of hair.\r\n\r\nTriphala is considered a 'tridoshic rasayana', having balancing and rejuvenating effects on the three constitutional elements that govern human life: Vata which regulates the nervous system, Pitta which maintains metabolic processes, and Kapha which supports structural integrity. Triphala uniquely cleanses and detoxifies at the deepest organic levels without depleting the body's reserves. Triphala combines both nutritional as well as blood and liver cleansing (detoxifying) actions. This makes Triphala one of the most valuable herbal preparations in the world. A popular folk saying in India is, No mother? Don’t worry so long as you have Triphala. The reason is that Indian people believe that triphala is able to care for the internal organs of the body as a mother cares for her children.\r\n","options":[{"id":9483135,"name":"Default","price":25.7,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":25.7,"amount_with_others":12.5,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":25.7,"amount_with_others":12.5,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":25.7,"amount_with_others":12.5,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":25.7,"amount_with_others":12.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":25.7,"amount_with_others":12.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.7,"amount_with_others":12.5,"country":{"id":207,"name":"South Africa","code":"ZA"}},{"amount_alone":25.7,"amount_with_others":12.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25982935/-/Triphala_caps.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25982935/-/Triphala_caps.jpg","width":609,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1608400,"name":"Organic Herb vegi caps","permalink":"organic-herb-vegi-caps","url":"/category/organic-herb-vegi-caps"},{"id":1686857,"name":"Ayurvedic Eye, Nose and Ear Care","permalink":"ayurvedic-eye-nose-and-ear-care","url":"/category/ayurvedic-eye-nose-and-ear-care"}]},{"id":2692175,"name":"Organic Ashwagandha vegi caps x 108 large pack","permalink":"ashwagandha-vegi-caps-x-90","position":42,"price":25.7,"default_price":25.7,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ashwagandha-vegi-caps-x-90","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-08-09T12:06:54.000Z","description":"Ashwagandha Capsules \r\n\r\nSanskrit Name: Ashwagandha\r\nEnglish Name: Wintercherry\r\nBotanical Name: Withania somnifera\r\nAyurvedic Energetics: V-P+K-\r\n\r\n\r\nASHWAGANDHA holds a place in the Ayurvedic pharmacology similar to ginseng in Chinese medicine.

Triphala is mild, non-habit forming, and a rejuvenative.\r\n\r\nTriphala is so effective because its three herbs are potent healers.\r\n\r\n1. Amalaki (Emblica Officinalis) one of Ayurveda's greatest rejuvenators and a strong natural anti-oxidant, also helps to boost the immune system. Its the highest natural known source of vitamin C. Having 20 times the vitamin C content of an orange.\r\n2. Haritaki (Terminalia Chebula) the Tibetan \"king of medicine\", a classic heart-brain-longevity tonic, is often depicted in the extended palm of the Buddha.\r\n3. Bibhitaki (Terminalia Belerica) a powerful rejuvenative that reduces liver and heart disease, also improves the voice, vision and promotes the growth of hair.\r\n\r\nTriphala is considered a 'tridoshic rasayana', having balancing and rejuvenating effects on the three constitutional elements that govern human life: Vata which regulates the nervous system, Pitta which maintains metabolic processes, and Kapha which supports structural integrity. Triphala uniquely cleanses and detoxifies at the deepest organic levels without depleting the body's reserves. Triphala combines both nutritional as well as blood and liver cleansing (detoxifying) actions. This makes Triphala one of the most valuable herbal preparations in the world. A popular folk saying in India is, No mother? Don’t worry so long as you have Triphala. The reason is that Indian people believe that triphala is able to care for the internal organs of the body as a mother cares for her children.\r\n\r\nSuggested Usage: 2 to 6 gm (½ to 1½ teaspoonful) twice a day with lukewarm water.

It glides on the tongue and removes harmful bacteria and debris,even from the back of the tongue. \r\n\r\nTongue cleansing also helps improve your sense of taste, remove the coating on the tongue and slow the growth of plaque. We use stainless steel because it is impervious to bacteria, and is more comfortable and gentle on the tongue than plastic.

Includes Ginger, Pepper and Saffron.\r\n\r\nSpice Wise\r\nSpices are ingredients in many synergistic ayurvedic herbal formulations, and an ayurvedic expert, when giving you advice, is as likely to recommend specific spices to include in your diet as to suggest herbal supplements for you to take. \r\nDried ground ginger is a warming spice, contributing the pungent taste. It helps pacify Vata and Kapha and increases Pitta. It is included in many Maharishi Ayurveda formulations because of its healing properties. \r\nIn ayurveda, cloves are considered to enhance circulation, digestion and metabolism and help counter stomach disorders such as gas, bloating and nausea. \r\nBlack Pepper is considered an important healing spice in ayurveda. It has cleansing and antioxidant properties, and it is a bioavailability enhancer -- it helps transport the benefits of other herbs to the different parts of the body. It helps the free flow of oxygen to the brain, helps enhance digestion and circulation and stimulates the appetite. \r\nCardamom is tridoshic (good for balancing all three doshas). Cardamom is considered an excellent digestive, especially beneficial in reducing bloating and intestinal gas. It is excellent for balancing Kapha, particularly in the stomach and the lungs. \r\nTurmeric is ubiquitous in ayurvedic cooking. It contains the flavanoid curcumin, which is known to have anti-inflammatory properties. This all-around wonder spice is said to help detoxify the liver, balance cholesterol levels, fight allergies, stimulate digestion, boost immunity and enhance the complexion. It is also an antioxidant. \r\nIn ayurvedic cooking, saffron is used widely: in desserts, vegetable dishes and to season rice. It is used for both its royal color and delicate aroma. \r\nIngredients\r\nGinger, Cloves, Pepper, Cardamom, Turmeric, Saffron.\r\n\r\nHerbal Recommendations\r\nDrink Maharishi Ayurveda Kapha Tea any time of the day for its stimulating effect or especially when feeling lethargic, overweight, digestion is slow, or when the weather is cold and wet.

The coconut tree is referred to as the ‘tree of life’, ‘tree of heaven’, or ‘tree of abundance” reflective of its essentiality to everyday life.\r\nIn India every auspicious occasion is recommended by offering prayers to the Lord along with coconut. During a ritual worship, gods and goddesses are invoked with the holy offering of Narikela as a symbolic expression.\r\nAyurveda has documented around 60 Sanskrit names of coconut/ Narikela. The exact meaning of the word “Narikela” is that which has flowers and fruits with long tendrils.\r\nThe Ayurvedic properties of Narikela are madhura/ sweet in taste, sweet in the post digestive taste (vipaka) and has a cold potency (virya).

With revitalizing ingredients such as demeter-Ghee, organic oils and waxes, Lakshmi® Kajals soothe your eyes with their cooling effect – all day long. \r\n\r\nCooling Freshness through Camphor\r\nCertain Lakshmi® AYURVEDIC BEAUTY Kajals bear the description “Cold”, a term which reflects their pleasantly cooling camphor content. Purified natural camphor has antibacterial properties and helps prevent inflammation. Its astringent properties also help rid the eyes of unsightly red capillaries, leaving them clear and bright. \r\n\r\nFunctional Form, Captivating Colours\r\nLakshmi® AYURVEDIC BEAUTY’s smooth cone-shaped Kajals are gentle to apply and ideal for the sensitive inner rim of the eyes. Placing the tip sideways and rotating it during application ensure that the colour is applied evenly and that the Kajal retains its shape. This technique makes the Kajals very economical in use. An applicator or brush can then be used for the lower, broader base of the Kajal.\r\nAvailable as Colour Kajal (with 0.5% camphor) and Colour Kajal Cold (2.6-2.8 % camphor).

Lakshmi Kajals bind irritating pollen, dust and other particles, allowing them to be washed out by tears. At the same time, the dark colour imparted by the carbon provides protection against excessively strong light.\r\n\r\nFunctional Form, Captivating Colours\r\nLakshmi AYURVEDIC BEAUTY’s smooth cone-shaped Kajals are gentle to apply and ideal for the sensitive inner rim of the eyes. Placing the tip sideways and rotating it during application ensure that the colour is applied evenly and that the Kajal retains its shape. This technique makes the Kajals very economical in use.
