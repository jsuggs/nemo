This compilation is something I was waiting for a long time. Bringing fresh blood from East part of Europe/Russia. People over there are still very pasionate about hard core punk and living hard times. I am still thinking that most of the bands in East Europe are far more better then those coming from West - when it comes to passion, commitment and dedication - hard core in East Europe is about day to day struggle rather then fucking fashion and pose for a year. Here is the deal: Engage at Will/old school youth crew/, Verdict/mosh core/, Deviant/metalcore/, Still/youth crew/, High X Hopes/nyc style/, Appleshout/trash old school/, Face Forward/melodic old school/, Keep on Fighting/old school/ and Ace Ventura/old school/. Most of the bands sing russian what gives this compilation different dimension and fresh air to my old ears. I love it and would like to see more kids from west supporting \"exotic\" scenes and inviting those bands to play their towns. What I am missing on this compilation are the lyric sheets with english translation and I dont like the back cover too, however the front is cool rip off of Soviet Union logo with band names and Stay true to yourself slogan.
