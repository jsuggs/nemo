It's about adventures, civil partnerships and hairy ladies.\r\n\r\n24 pages, quarter size. \r\n\r\nReview by Review by <a href=\"http://lauramarieszinereviews.blogspot.com\">Laura-Marie</a>.\r\n\"Appealing and good looking, this is Bettie's new perzine. Before, Bettie made mental health zine Anatomical Heart, which I loved, and I'm sorry to see it go. But Buy Her Candy #1 covers some important ground: being hairy, things she likes to do with her partner, marriage and how she can't marry her girlfriend where she lives in England, and having a lot of stuff. I can't not mention her layout. I love her use of images, like the old advertisement picture of a shaving baby. It's a short but solid perzine giving the sense of a person, a person who I happen to like a lot.\"","options":[{"id":24088770,"name":"Default","price":1.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.7,"amount_with_others":0.3,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.6}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74897748/-/bhc1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74897748/-/bhc1.jpg","width":535,"height":535}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3856689,"name":"Zines","permalink":"zines","url":"/category/zines"}]},{"id":7629807,"name":"Buy Her Candy #2","permalink":"buy-her-candy-2","position":2,"price":1.0,"default_price":1.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/buy-her-candy-2","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-22T17:05:29.000Z","description":"This is the second issue of my perzine, Buy Her Candy.

We read about Bettie’s concerns surrounding privacy in her zines, a little guide to her favourite parts of Chorlton, her feelings as she approaches the end of her nursing degree, and her future plans for when she qualifies as a nurse.  The layouts are as pretty as ever, with handwritten and typewritten sections, and lots of cool pictures and patterns pasted in.  However, my favourite thing has to be the cover – a cartoon of Cinderella and Snow White sharing a passionate kiss, printed on lilac paper!
