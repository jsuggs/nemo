As a response to the overwhelming interest in the Connected Poster, we've chosen to make it available for purchase. It's currently available in a limited edition of 73 numbered prints.\r\n\r\nThe poster is crafted in the southern Denmark, Kolding by the two designers Joaquim Marqués Nielsen and Anders Baden Nielsen from the Danish design studio <a href=\"http://www.barq.dk\" target=\"_blank\">Barq</a>. It is offset printed on thick 200g recycled paper, which goes perfectly hand in hand with the retro vibe of the design.\r\n\r\nSet in the distant future, Connected is a story about survival and greed with a post apocalyptic wasteland as its backdrop. Survivors of an unknown disaster shuffle through a desolate landscape, as it quickly becomes clear that not everybody has the strength to survive.\r\n\r\n<b>Details</b>\r\n\r\n<i>Format: </i> 66 x 100 cm (26,0 x 39,3 inches)\r\n\r\n<i>Paper:</i> 100% recycled Cyclus Offset 200 g/m2\r\n\r\nRead more about the movie at the official website <a href=\"http://www.ov43.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.ov43.com</a>.\r\n\r\nCheck out more of Barq's work in their portfolio at <a href=\"http://www.barq.dk/index-portefolje.html\" target=\"_blank\">www.barq.dk</a>.\r\n\r\nGet an in-depth into the proces of creating the poster at <a href=\"http://jokke-svin.dk/?p=3725\" target=\"_blank\">Joaquim's blog</a>.","options":[{"id":1618925,"name":"Default","price":59.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":6.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3303123/-/preview.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3303123/-/preview.jpg","width":768,"height":689}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":316218,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":1966481,"name":"Connected Poster: Original Print-run","permalink":"connected-poster-original-print-run","position":2,"price":39.0,"default_price":39.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/connected-poster-original-print-run","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-03-15T18:53:31.000Z","description":"<i>Good news for those of you who didn't manage to get one of the personally numbered and signed prints.
