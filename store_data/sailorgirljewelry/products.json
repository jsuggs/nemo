Lately I've taken to popping in there every single morning. It's so nice to be surrounded by flowers. I've also taken to buying large bunches of green stuff. Not only are flowers great, but big bouquets of leaves are terrific. Especially since my studio is so covered in small bright coloured beads, the green stuff is nice backdrop. So yes, I am obsessing with green things and leaves. That's why I made a small green leaf cluster necklace. \r\n\r\nThe leaf cluster necklace has 12 mini beads in various shades of green. Each bead measures approximately 8mm x 6mm. At the bottom of the cluster is a sterling silver leaf that measures 15mm. The total length of the cluster is approximately 40mm. The cluster hangs from a sterling silver snake chain, your choice of lengths. \r\n\r\nEach bead is individually made by me! I use Moretti (Effetre) glass, a little CIM and occasionally Vetrofond. There is no paint on any of my beads, just glass upon glass upon glass.

One of my dreams came to life in my Tuscan Vineyard series, here's the Tuscan Mini Stranc necklace. Gorgeous for fall. My mini strand necklaces are perfect when you want just the right amount of statement. Excellent in an open neck shirt, fabulous with a t-shirt, in fact, perfect.\r\n\r\nEach of the 5 handmade beads (by ME!) measures approximately 11mm x 14 mm and they alternate with sterling silver balls. The necklace closes with a sterling silver lobster claw anywhere on the sterling silver chain. The maximum length of this necklace is 19\".\r\n\r\nMy hands made these beads. I use Moretti (Effetre) glass, a little CIM and occasionally Vetrofond. All my beads are kiln annealed, thoroughly cleaned and inspected. There is no paint on any of my beads, just glass upon glass upon glass.\r\n\r\nPlease remember the jewelry looks larger than life in the pictures which is why it is important to check the size. I have tried to capture the colours as accurately as possible but many monitors vary.\r\n","options":[{"id":9739492,"name":"Default","price":79.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26895247/-/tuscan5-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26895247/-/tuscan5-2.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26895243/-/tuscan5-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26895243/-/tuscan5-1.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26895251/-/tuscan5-3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26895251/-/tuscan5-3.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26895239/-/tuscan5-5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26895239/-/tuscan5-5.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26895255/-/tuscan5-4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26895255/-/tuscan5-4.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1069271,"name":"NECKS","permalink":"necks","url":"/category/necks"}]},{"id":2574033,"name":"carnival squiggle bracelet","permalink":"carnival-squiggle-bracelet","position":202,"price":75.0,"default_price":75.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/carnival-squiggle-bracelet","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-05-14T22:38:42.000Z","description":"Carnival!
