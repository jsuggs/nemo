Transpacific Comfort spans the musical palette by offering fun-loving pop tracks reminiscent of early Beatles tunes to passionate love songs full of substance to cause-driven-power-ballads. This release is poised to become a Winter favorite with songs for all occasions, earning it the classification of a classic album.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n\r\n1.
