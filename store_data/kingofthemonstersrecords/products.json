The phenomenal Mitchell Luna (formerly of blitzing grind unit Maruta) makes a guest appearance and shares vocals with Artz on one track too!

Herein, he explores sound, volume and depth. Forged in the outer rings of Boston in 2009, High aura'd was born of a mutual respect for what had come before and a longing for a timely future. Influenced as much by Richard Serra and Robert Smithson, Jarmusch and Jodorowsky as Loren Connors and Lichens, he set foot on a path of enlightenment through self exploration and innovation: trying to capture space, time, and raw emotion. Guitars of all sorts, acoustic, electric, pedal steel, field recordings are all utilized.\r\n\r\nBlood Bright Star originally took form under the given name of the solo artist Reuben Sawyer and released his first recorded output; a limited edition CD-R, in 2010. After about a year of using his real name, Sawyer took on the moniker \"Blood Bright Star\" named after the final track on that CD-R. Blood Bright Star remains a solo project which allows Sawyer to incorporate guest musicians and collaborate with an array of varying artists, depending on the desired intentions of a recording or live event. With undisclosed information about the instrumentation used, Blood Bright Star taps into many different elements to create their sound including elements of western occultism, psychedelia, magic and the private, sometimes dark world of one's own dreams and subconscious.\r\n\r\nAll of the artwork for this split was supplied by none other than Reuben Sawyer of Rainbath Visual.

This recording also features vocals by James R. of Swamp Witch and Your Enemy.\r\n\r\nCircle of Eyes was conceived in 2008 for the love of resonance and embracing the realization of decay in the intent to record/release records and perform the occasional live performance. The creative core-duo of Kevin Gan Yuen (Sutekh Hexen, Fermentæ, OGHAM) along with Thrull (Black Fucking Cancer and Necrite) proceed with Circle of Eyes as an on-going project in the practice of unraveling and challenging the conventional notions of the loud, slow and down-tuned metal traditions of the Bay Area's rich sonic tapestry. Joined by vocalist/collaborator James R. (Swamp Witch and Your Enemy) this entity's uncompromising collective vision is to present an exclusive aural documentation of the unquestionable decay of black metal, drone, and experimental music genres.\r\n\r\nWith three mammoth tracks that spread over 37 minutes, this recording is mastered by James Plotkin specifically for the vinyl and digital formats. The artwork and design was executed by Kevin Gan Yuen with help from Stephen Wilson for an 18” x 24” fold-out poster and Icelandic (by way of Sweden) artist and musician Jóhannes Gunnar Þorsteinsson (Ziz) for the insert photography. The jackets are a tip-on style, single sleeve jacket printed from Stoughton Printing Company, black dust sleeves, a three button set that’s housed in a black zip lock bag, and a download card printed on 32 lb. metallic stock to redeem the entire recording which also includes the re-mastered 2009 demo as an an added bonus.

Also Shades of Night Descending is the first demo of Evoken, released in 1994, and for a debut demo, it is a surprisingly mature creation. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the music is of the same funeral doom-death variety as found on the later albums, all the way to the excellent Antithesis of Light and A Caress of the Void, but the unrefined production on Shades of Night Descending, with its barren character and  heavy echoing sound scape, brings out the nihilism of funeral doom more effectively than the more professional production jobs of the later albums. The atmosphere on the demo is bleaker, even less forgiving, and perhaps even more desperate and repulsive in a positive sense than what can be found on A Caress of the Void. Even the considerably melodic guitar part in \"Towers of Frozen Dusk\" and other sweeter spots on the demo have a taste of ash and feel of pumice in them; Evoken walks on a musical lava field here, and manages to paint the true meaning of funeral doom in slow death metal colors on the canvas. \r\n\r\nIn comparison to their later works, this is perhaps the essence of the whole band in the original, pure form. It would be silly to say that some fundamental rule of Evoken's music had changed since then, but for those who wish to have a certain rawness and honesty in what they hear, Shades of Night Descending is a good choice. \r\n\r\nConsidering the year and the fact that this demo was recorded by a very recently formed band, the originality and the merciless exploration of new fields of abrasive nihilism are astounding. What's more, the songwriting and technical performance sound exceptionally evolved, and the demo could well be considered a finished and debugged product, ready to be sold to the eager masses.

There are moments reminiscing of a classic doom metal sound, although the death reeking funeral vibe is what overwhelms you with emotions. Combining that ultra heavy riffing with the rhythmic drumming easily sends you into a catatonic state, with wickedly beautiful and masterful drum-work. Adding yet another aspect of saddened atmosphere via the keyboard just enhances all previously said emotions. The vocals vary from funeral to death, clean to slow, harsh to deep growls, all masterfully done. There’s not an aspect of this album that isn’t top notch.\r\n\r\nPut on Embrace the emptiness, shade your windows, turn off the light, lie down in bed and let yourself get overwhelmed with emotions. Drift away in your mind and just let the feelings of solitude hit you.

Mining a sound world that draws on the latent abstraction within doom, the hallucinatory drift of ambient, but also the unremitting sonic bleakness of black metal.\r\n\r\nA contrast to the vaguely more extrovert progressive metal of Orca, Gates eventually grew from being an exploratory side project to a primary musical outlet. Gates eviscerations of the harmonic and timbral languages of metal and drone also digetst the minutia of various experimental styles to forge a bludgeoning take on spectralism.\r\n\r\nConstructed from layers of densely textured drone, haunted melodies, forlorn voices and processed field recordings, ‘Moths Have Eaten the Core’ opens a dark yet strangely meditative void. Its thick, opaque sonics unfurl a spiritual journey through intense and enveloping emotion, yet evoke a state of abject solitude.\r\n\r\n\"Moths Have Eaten the Core\" was origianally released in limited quantities as a CD via Bryan W. Bray's own Astral Ra (which later saw a reissued through Ivory Antler Recordings and Publications with slightly altered artwork).

In the aftermath, members found themselves pressed to continue the slow-burning drudgery sparked that September ninth into the months that followed, leading to shows, recordings, band members towing themselves out of the smog from Central Valley, CA into Oakland (and Arcata, respectively) and finally, the vinyl release that recollects the original material of that night of the ninth; GNOSIS.\r\n\r\nThe punishing, murky layers pertruding from this release drip with the trance ladden, drug induced efforts of 70's psychedelia compressed into the claustrophobic toil and painful repetition of 90's sludge. This concept of \"Gnosis\" actually seems more akin to H.P.

In other words, it's fucked up.\r\n\r\nThe original GNOSIS, recorded by Greg Wilkinson (Brainoil) at Earhammer Studios in Oakland, California would see a revised version just a few short months later at the same hand, and shortly thereafter, a pressing of 100 cassettes would be released in August of 2011 through Gay Scientist Recordings.

I just love hearing Bob bash the shit out of a drum kit. Dude really blasts like no other, he definitely has captured a sound that is uniquely his own, with the very dry drum tone and super hard attack. It's also great to hear Chris Dodge, Caveman almighty, front a band again. Again, very early Lack Of Interest style vocals; gruff, low, and kind of cheesy.\r\n\r\nACxDC stands for Antichrist Demoncore. The band was founded in 2003 by Sergio, Pablo, Jeff, and JC. Within 2 years of playing together they released the Jack Trippin’ Demo, He Had it Comin’ 7”, and had 2 tracks on the Signs Of An Impending Doom Compilation. They quickly made their mark in the power violence/grindcore scene by playing tons of wild shows all over Southern California. By 2005 the band had called it quits, but in the summer of 2006 they decided to have a reunion show with all original members for one night only. Since then most of them went their separate ways and started working on other bands and projects. After years of talk between Sergio and Jose from Shoes Of Cement (formerly Hitem Where It Hurts) they decided to bring ACxDC back. They played a comeback show in 2010 with the two new members Bobby and Jose at the Workmens Circle in Los Angeles, California. Pablo and Bobby recently left the band and ACxDC recruited Jorge from Asshole Assassination Squad/Ruptures to play drums. The line up now consists of Sergio, Jeff, Jose, and Jorge.
