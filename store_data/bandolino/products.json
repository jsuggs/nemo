During the summer of 2013 this studio became host to 7 musicians, from 7 different countries, most of whom had never met before, yet who, during the course of 6 days, wrote, arranged and recorded an album of original material due for release on the 8th November 2013.  \r\n\r\nThe songs represent a veritable mixing pot of cultures, styles, backgrounds and languages, all the more unique because of the short timescale in which it was created.\r\n\r\nThe music in the Humanitarium, is unashamedly human.  There is no autotune, quantizing, overdubbing or drum programming, looping, synthesising editing or correcting.  Just people with acoustic instruments making fresh, new music with one eye on its roots and the other on the future.\r\n\r\nNow the musicians have returned to their homes, thousands of miles apart, and yet, from these 6 days together, the songs they wrote together and the album enclosed, they are forever connected to each other, and to that small French village in the Pyrenees.","options":[{"id":48125262,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127580229/-/1167942_564233096947428_1534127051_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127580229/-/1167942_564233096947428_1534127051_n.jpg","width":960,"height":960}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1545382,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":9815071,"name":"Nothing Concrete album","permalink":"nothing-concrete-album","position":2,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nothing-concrete-album","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-03-09T02:40:24.000Z","description":"Album of new material from international folk rock band Nothing Concrete, featuring the songs of Fergus McKay (UK) and Daniel Wall (USA) played with an international group of musicinas from 7 different countries.\r\n\r\nRecorded at Pear studios Manchester and in Lahitere France, produced by Mick Brophy and the band,\r\n\r\nTo hear sample tracks visit https://soundcloud.com/fergus-mckay\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":30705178,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127580838/-/nothing_concrete_bugs1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127580838/-/nothing_concrete_bugs1.jpg","width":1476,"height":1476}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1545382,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":4812067,"name":"Puck Fop T shirt","permalink":"puck-fop-t-shirt","position":3,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/puck-fop-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-09T19:50:57.000Z","description":"my new 100% cotton T shirt, available in all sizes just make sure you tell me which size you want, available in Blue, if you would rather another colour, make a request and I may get some other colours printed! \r\n\r\ndisplays on the front \"PUCK FOP - support street music\" with a picture of Bandolino!","options":[{"id":15709651,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47199607/-/puck_fop.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47199607/-/puck_fop.jpg","width":350,"height":350}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1545385,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":3069483,"name":"Bandolino and the Ringmasters Wife, CD album","permalink":"bandolino-and-the-ringmasters-wife-cd-album","position":4,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bandolino-and-the-ringmasters-wife-cd-album","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-12-28T14:56:53.000Z","description":"The new album by Bandolino contains 16 studio recorded tracks, and comes with a 3d cover and free 3d glasses and 3 specially commissioned cartoons depicting 3 of the songs.\r\n\r\nlimited edition: the first 200 copies sold will be personally signed","options":[{"id":10533193,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29768723/-/frontcover.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29768723/-/frontcover.png","width":400,"height":354}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1545382,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
