This is one of my most popular pieces. When printed on metallic paper or brushed aluminum, this print takes on so many shades of Indigo. I still find this piece so tranquil. The subtle waves in the water soothe and calm.\r\n\r\nI am always asked why I like to hang this piece on its side, and I always reply \"I like an asymmetrical world... it just feels right to me.\" This piece can be displayed vertically or horizontally and still maintain compositional balance.\r\n\r\nThank you for your visit!\r\nMalia","options":[{"id":26620605,"name":"9 x 12 open-edition print on metallic paper (not signed)","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":26620608,"name":"11 x 14 print on metallic paper, signed and numbered","price":115.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":26620611,"name":"16 x 20 print on metallic paper, signed and numbered","price":333.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":26620614,"name":"20 x 30 print on metallic paper, signed and numbered","price":425.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":26620617,"name":"16 x20 print on aluminum (ready to hang)","price":599.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/83258289/-/The_Water_Trees_72digi.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/83258289/-/The_Water_Trees_72digi.jpg","width":722,"height":531}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4187835,"name":"giclee prints on metallic","permalink":"giclee-prints-on-metallic","url":"/category/giclee-prints-on-metallic"}]}]
