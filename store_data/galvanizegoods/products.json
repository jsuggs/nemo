What we mean by that is that everyone can wear Triple Black and look great in it. \r\n\r\nThe name “Triple Black” is inspired by the experience of the founder of LOOK/SEE, Kyle Yamaguchi, during his days as a Nike Basketball Footwear Promo Product Line Manager. Each season, Kyle would work on colorways which would bring “heat” to the product line; meaning he would primarily work on the more bold and irreverent colorways to grab the consumer’s attention, which, in turn, would generate additional energy and visibility for the “foundational” colorways. Nearly every inline model would have a Black/Black-Black colorway, which would otherwise be known as “Triple Black”. With basketball shoes, the Triple Black colorway was often the most purchased style by the accounts for the simple reason that everyone can wear it and look great at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis insight inspired them to create the L/S1 in a similar colorway. However, in order to bring an additional level of energy to the product, they decided to apply a matte finish to the outer surfaces of the frame. Only the inside surface has a shiny finish, which helps to hide face oils and sweat while wearing the product.","options":[{"id":36421575,"name":"Default","price":69.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":24.0,"amount_with_others":14.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":12.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/113665626/-/LOOKSEE_Triple_Black_Iso_1024x1024.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/113665626/-/LOOKSEE_Triple_Black_Iso_1024x1024.jpg","width":1000,"height":591},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/113665638/-/LOOKSEE_Triple_Black_Rear_Iso_1024x1024.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/113665638/-/LOOKSEE_Triple_Black_Rear_Iso_1024x1024.jpg","width":1000,"height":591},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/113665653/-/LOOKSEE_Triple_Black_Side_1024x1024.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/113665653/-/LOOKSEE_Triple_Black_Side_1024x1024.jpg","width":1000,"height":591}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3705363,"name":"Accessories","permalink":"accessories","url":"/category/accessories"}]},{"id":11547324,"name":"LOOK/SEE MIAMI NIGHTS SUNGLASSES","permalink":"look-see-miami-nights-sunglasses","position":4,"price":70.0,"default_price":70.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/look-see-miami-nights-sunglasses","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-06-03T15:24:47.000Z","description":"From LOOK/SEE GOODS comes:\r\n\r\nLOOK/SEE MIAMI NIGHTS SUNGLASSES\r\n\r\nPRODUCT:  Each pair is handmade from high quality custom acetate with \"Miami Nights\" graphic on the temples and \"flamingo\" metal inlay along inner left temple end.\r\n\r\nLENS COLOR: Dark grey \r\n\r\nLENS MATERIAL: 100% UV-protectant CR-39\r\n\r\nFRAME SIZE: 53mm (width of lens) – 19mm (distance between lenses) – 145mm (temple length);
