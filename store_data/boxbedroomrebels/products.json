They’ve got a slightly thinner and less reverby sound to them which gives them a bit of a New Zealandy jangliness that fans of bands like The Clean will appreciate. When they do use fuzz, particularly on closer ‘Wakeboarding’, it’s really chunky and dirty like Urusei Yatsura. I like that. Cool EP, seems like a bit of a shame they’ve made so few of them' - Norman Records, Leeds.","options":[{"id":33465556,"name":"Default","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":4.0},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":4.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129280281/-/waterwhite.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129280281/-/waterwhite.jpg","width":1684,"height":1603}],"artists":[{"id":168572,"name":"Water World","permalink":"water-world","url":"/artist/water-world"}],"categories":[{"id":4432937,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]}]
