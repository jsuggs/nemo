Fortunately, I'm able to show a closeup of a sleeve sewn of this material. \r\n\r\nIt's the openwork design that makes this pearl cotton fabric light and airy. It possesses a wonderful drape and subtle sheen and is suitable for a woman's sweater or dress. When used sideways, it forms stunning textured horizontal stripes, while the selvedges make perfect bottom edges for the garment with no extra finishing necessary (as shown). \r\n\r\nWhen washed in cool water and allowed to air dry, shrinkage in this cotton knit is minimal (<2%). Fabric can also be dry cleaned. Remember to always prepare your fabrics properly before using. Using a temporary stabilizer, such as Super Solvy, before cutting and sewing this fabric is recommended.\r\n\r\nThis fancy ribbed fabric is approximately 26 inches wide (unstretched). Fabric must be ordered by the whole yard only and comes in a continuous piece.
