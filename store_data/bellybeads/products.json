The Green Aventurine, Pearls, Rainbow Moonstone and Jasper also have healing properties that are especially helpful for Cancer Sun Signs:\r\n\r\nGreen Aventurine releases the Cancerian potential for nurturing and caring. It is a stone that rules sisterrhood and group stability, teaching its native to care about others rather than for others. The Aventurine encourages the Cancer soul to hold on to its internal energy while they aid others in building their own paths. The ability to create a boundary between ‘self’ and ‘other’ is essential for the Cancer soul and something that this stone can definitely help with.\r\n\r\n The Moonstone is the symbol for the Cancer soul because it helps the native to harness her emotional undertones and psychic gifts and encourages acceptance of them. In addition, it also promotes vivid dreaming and helps to bring unconscious thoughts to the surface.\r\n\r\nJasper, known as the ‘supreme nurturer,’ has the power to sustain the soul during times of stress and pressure…allowing for a replenishment of spirit and a calming of the tides. \r\n\r\nFreshwater Pearls impart a soothing energy for all those who come into contact with this luminescent stone. Pearl it is said strengthens the mind, aids sleep and cures insomnia. Pearls are also reputed to aid memory, are good for heart trouble and eye diseases. Pearls are also said to increase sexual strength and to make the conjugal life a happy one! \r\n\r\nWaist beads have also been traditionally used as a means to Tone Abdomen muscles. The way it works is that wearing the jewelry makes you more aware of your core muscles. This awareness gives you an opportunity and a reminder to engage your abs. You can think of Belly Beads as a beautiful way to stay in shape! \r\n\r\nBenefits and Information:\r\n\r\n- Crystals and stones can help release potential for nurturing and caring\r\n-Sustain soul during times of stress and pressure\r\n-Harness psychic and spiritual gifts\r\n-Soothing and calming\r\n-Aids in ab muscle toning\r\n- Provides visual stimulation for intimate partners (similar to lingerie)\r\n-Adds sensuality and beauty to ALL body types\r\n\r\nPlease send me your waist or hip measurements--wherever you would like the jewelry to lie.

Included in the listing are (2) pieces that feature Dark Black Onyx, Red Garnet and Genuine Red Ruby with Coal-Black seed beads. The set comes with two (2) pieces of jewelry that can be layered or worn alone. The Red Garnet, Black Onyx and Red Ruby also have healing properties that are especially helpful for Scorpio Sun Signs:\r\n\r\nRed Ruby stone has a strong energy of sensuality and love for life, and of beauty. It works within the sacral chakra, to aid your sexuality and sociability (not that you need it, Scorpio!!) Through the sacral chakra this stone will also help you to be more creative as it is also a positive stone for enhancing creativity. This naturally red crystal allows you to be comfortable with taking risks... and teaches you to not to fear, but to embrace all of life's experiences.\r\n\r\nBlack Onyx gives strength. It promotes vigor, steadfastness and stamina. Imparts self-confidence, helping you to be at ease in your surroundings. Onyx banishes grief, enhances self-control and stimulates the power of wise decision-making. It encourages happiness and good fortune.\r\n\r\nRed Garnet balances the sex drive and alleviates emotional disharmony. It activates and strengthens the survival instinct, bringing courage and hope. Stimulates past-life recall. Sharpens perceptions of oneself and others. Garnet removes inhibitions and taboos. It opens the heart and bestows self-confidence.\r\n\r\nWaist beads have also been traditionally used as a means to Tone Abdomen muscles. The way it works is that wearing the jewelry makes you more aware of your core muscles. This awareness gives you an opportunity and a reminder to engage your abs. You can think of Belly Beads as a beautiful way to stay in shape! \r\n\r\nBenefits and Information:\r\n\r\n- Crystals and stones can help build inner strength and confidence\r\n-Add Love and Sensuality to your Life\r\n-Reduces feelings of fear\r\n-Balances the Sex Drive and harmonizes emotions\r\n-Aids in ab muscle toning\r\n- Provides visual stimulation for intimate partners (similar to lingerie)\r\n-Adds sensuality and beauty to ALL body types\r\n\r\nPlease send me your waist or hip measurements--wherever you would like the jewelry to lie. A suggestion: Low lying Belly Beads (right above the pubic bone) are very sexy!\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":19131603,"name":"Default","price":39.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58711717/-/Scorpio_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58711717/-/Scorpio_1.jpg","width":570,"height":861},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58711765/-/Scorpio_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58711765/-/Scorpio_2.jpg","width":570,"height":424},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58711813/-/Scorpio_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58711813/-/Scorpio_3.jpg","width":570,"height":317},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58711831/-/Scorpio_4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58711831/-/Scorpio_4.jpg","width":570,"height":378},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58711861/-/Scorpio_5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58711861/-/Scorpio_5.jpg","width":570,"height":861}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3133609,"name":"Custom Belly Beads","permalink":"custom-belly-beads","url":"/category/custom-belly-beads"}]},{"id":5979373,"name":"100% Organic Cotton Vibrant Royal Blue Harem Pants with Hand Block Print","permalink":"100-organic-cotton-vibrant-royal-blue-harem-pants-with-hand-block-print","position":28,"price":30.0,"default_price":30.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/100-organic-cotton-vibrant-royal-blue-harem-pants-with-hand-block-print","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-19T21:28:49.000Z","description":"These Handmade 100% Organic Cotton Royal Blue Harem Pants with Hand Block Prints are absolutely amazing and beautiful!
