These bracelets are named after each of the five Blue Zones in the world. A Blue Zone is a region of the world where people commonly live active lives past the age of 100 years. Scientists and demographers have classified these longevity hot-spots by having common healthy traits and life practices that result in higher-than-normal longevity.\r\n\r\nThis bracelet was named after Nicoya, Costa Rica. It's an isolated region, accessible only by ferry until 2003, when the Taiwan Friendship bridge was constructed. A Costa Rican man at age 60 has about twice the chance of reaching age 90 as does a man living in the United States, France, or even Japan.\r\n\r\nNicoyan centenarians feel needed through fostering a plan de vida, or reason to live. This sense of purpose often centers around spending time with and providing for their family. This often results in centenarians retaining an active lifestyle, reaping the benefits of physical activity and exposure to the sun. Faith plays a strong role in the Nicoyan lifestyle. Relinquishing control of their life to God helps relieves stress and anxiety related to well-being.\r\n\r\nThis bracelet has the powerful lava (basalt) rock which amplifies inner strength, power and the healing properties of the oils.
