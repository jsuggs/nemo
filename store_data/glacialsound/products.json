In between illustrating label art and making the gulliest of bassline as DJ Sharda, he has seen his Murlo alias gather breakneck momentum thanks to his diverse array of leftfield grime-centred instrumentals. Murlo keeps the vibe varied, infusing his tracks with elements from soca, funky and R&B to create a unique sound that has received support from some of the games heaviest selectors including Blackdown, Oneman, Brackles and Slackk.\r\n\r\nMost excitingly, Murlo has linked up with Glacial Sound to deliver their imminent second record on November 25th, the much anticipated 'Last Dance' EP. You may have seen Chris's own Last Dance video doing the rounds, a backdrop of regal opulence to suit the quirkiness of the track; sparse handclap percussion and punchy kicks beneath ornate snyth trills and broad violin strokes, like some kind of sleek dancefloor-aimed grime banger from the Baroque era.\r\n\r\nIf you have caught Oneman lately, you will have heard him battering the living daylights out of 'Robes', using its buoyant carnival rhythms to deadly effect. 'Velvet Wall' is built in a similar vein, with Murlo flipping the eski sound and packing it with snappy rhythms and gliding melodies to form a heavy orchestral-edged cut. To round off the EP, Glacial Sound have enlisted Slackk to twist Velvet Wall into a woozy, sino-grime flavoured beat with a similar aesthetic to some of his recent Minor Triads material, and Robes receives a rough, bassline lead 4x4 treatment from Manchesterâ€™s excellent Swing Ting outfit.\r\n\r\nA1/ Last Dance\r\nA2/ Velvet Wall\r\n\r\nB1/ Robes\r\nB2/ Robes (Swing Ting Remix)\r\n\r\nLimited pressing.","options":[{"id":48415329,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127785396/-/MURLO12FRONT.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127785396/-/MURLO12FRONT.png","width":621,"height":618}],"artists":[{"id":250887,"name":"Murlo","permalink":"murlo","url":"/artist/murlo"}],"categories":[{"id":4698243,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":9618165,"name":"Rabit - Double Dragon EP (GLACIAL001) ","permalink":"rabit-double-dragon-ep","position":2,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rabit-double-dragon-ep","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-24T22:10:57.000Z","description":"Reigning in the inaugural release on Dublin based label Glacial Sound, is the Double Dragon EP by Rabit.\r\n\r\nFresh off his recent contribution to Keysound Recordings' This Is How We Roll compilation, Double Dragon is Rabit's full take on the sounds of both Eski minimalism and dubstep sub pressure, crystallizing the cold, biting synths and paranoid soundscapes across a variety of tempos.\r\n\r\nBacked with stellar remixes by Epoch and Logos, the Double Dragon EP is a bold statement, with the artist sharpening the grime aesthetic into his own bright and terrifying vision.
