The next time I came to her art studio I saw her plying yarns unlike anyone else I'd ever seen. \"You are a GENIUS!\" I said. So this tutorial is dedicated to her and her boundless creativity and fearlessness in the fiber art world. She is a wonderful light to the fiber art community and has a studio called \"Wild Woman Creations\" in Depoe, Bay Oregon where you can hear the surf and seagulls.\r\n\r\nThis yarn BREAKS ALL THE RULES. Take any commercial yarns in your stash and we will be spinning them using Rosie's original \"bicycle\" technique, and my own \"blind-folded\" technique. If you are finding yourself creatively worn out, use this video as spinning therapy. Don't worry about yarns matching or looking perfect, just do it. Break some rules. Dare to make something ugly. Let your creativity flow. Next time you spin at your wheel you'll feel refreshed and excited from all the new ideas you have flowing thru the joy of imperfection.\r\n\r\nSkill Level: Beginner/Intermediate\r\n\r\nSUPPLIES:\r\n- Any commercial yarns. I used four novelty yarns, and will show techniques for three and two novelty yarns. Use as many commercial yarns as you dare.\r\n\r\nDedicated to Rosie Wildwoman\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Wildwomancreations\r\nhttp://www.wildwomancreations.com/\r\nhttp://wildwomancreations.etsy.com","options":[{"id":44968719,"name":"Default","price":7.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125356011/-/spinwild.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125356011/-/spinwild.jpg","width":2346,"height":2346},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125356005/-/screenshots.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125356005/-/screenshots.jpg","width":1200,"height":2400},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125355993/-/rosie.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125355993/-/rosie.jpg","width":700,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2126806,"name":"Video Tutorials","permalink":"video-tutorials","url":"/category/video-tutorials"}]},{"id":13975113,"name":"How to Spin Swanky Singles","permalink":"how-to-spin-swanky-singles","position":2,"price":7.5,"default_price":7.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/how-to-spin-swanky-singles","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-04T18:11:24.000Z","description":"Tired of the everyday single spun yarn?

This document will also tell you the supplies you need to create all the yarns in this video series. Following is a description of what you will learn how to spin in these videos. This series is for intermediate/advanced spinners. You will need a basic understanding of core-spinning.\r\n\r\n1. UNBREAKABLE: Using an unbreakable core, we will core-spin and troubleshoot how to create super bulky yarns that are perfect for projects you need to put under a lot of tension (great for weaving!) or projects you plan on sculpting with freeform crochet or knitting. We will discuss troubleshooting and project ideas as well.\r\n\r\n2. UNBREAKABLE II & WIRE: In the second video of this collection we will learn how to core-spin thick and bulky yarns on a different unbreakable core that is more drapey than the first tutorial. We will also be experimenting with wire. This technique I use for spinning wire is different than in my book, and much easier for me personally work with. We will troubleshoot the difficulties that come with spinning wire and discuss project ideas.\r\n\r\n3. STRETCHY: In the third and final video we will talk about spinning on stretchy cores and you will learn how to keep your stretchy yarn from unraveling from its core. We will talk about mixed media additions you can include in this yarn as well as troubleshooting and the best elastic cores to use.\r\n\r\nThanks to the following fiber artisans for supplying the art batts for this video tutorial.\r\n\r\nSayra Adams of Atomic Blue Fibers\r\nhttp://atomicblue.etsy.com\r\n\r\nKimberly Buchy of Woodland Hills Alpacas\r\nhttp://WoodlandHillsAlpacas.etsy.com","options":[{"id":44774304,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125243397/-/spinning_sculptural.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125243397/-/spinning_sculptural.jpg","width":1407,"height":1204}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2126806,"name":"Video Tutorials","permalink":"video-tutorials","url":"/category/video-tutorials"}]},{"id":13927530,"name":"Josephine Cowl Knitting Pattern","permalink":"josephine-cowl-knitting-pattern","position":7,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/josephine-cowl-knitting-pattern","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-02T16:10:20.000Z","description":"A super easy pattern for beginners to knit this extra bulky chunky cowl from two handspun yarns.

You can use the dimensions of this pattern to work with any art yarn as long as you know about how many stitches per inch you need.\r\n\r\n>>>> After you purchase this item I will email the pattern to you as a PDF.  \r\n\r\nCorespun Bulky Art Yarn by Lisa Renee McKenzie of Oscar & Sophia:\r\nhttp://oscarandsophia.etsy.com\r\n\r\nTailspun Art Yarn by Esther Rogers of JazzTurtle\r\nhttp://jazzturtle.etsy.com","options":[{"id":44366136,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124949424/-/mukluk.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124949424/-/mukluk.jpg","width":2111,"height":2111},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124946931/-/IMG_6611.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124946931/-/IMG_6611.JPG","width":2592,"height":3888},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124946871/-/mukluckysimage.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124946871/-/mukluckysimage.jpg","width":2212,"height":2212}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6304983,"name":"Patterns","permalink":"patterns","url":"/category/patterns"}]},{"id":10468051,"name":"Spinning and Dyeing Yarn: The Home Spinners Guide to Creating Traditional and Art Yarns [Hardcover]","permalink":"spinning-and-dyeing-yarn-the-home-spinners-guide-to-creating-traditional-and-art-yarns-hardcover","position":12,"price":29.99,"default_price":29.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/spinning-and-dyeing-yarn-the-home-spinners-guide-to-creating-traditional-and-art-yarns-hardcover","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-10T20:49:34.000Z","description":"I am no longer selling books from my shop, but you can purchase them on Amazon!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Spinning-Dyeing-Yarn-Spinners-Traditional/dp/0764166077/\">Click Here to Purchase the Book on Amazon!</a>\r\n\r\nIf you would like your copy to be autographed, please email me at neauveau@gmail.com for my address.

Blog includes links & pages.  This will be linked to a domain name (www.yourwebsite.com) and will become your website.\r\n- Graphics for your blog\r\n- Graphics for all your blog pages.\r\n- Graphics for business cards and postcards thru VistaPrint.\r\n- Graphics for your ETSY shop\r\n- Graphics for your Ravelry page\r\n- Graphics for your Facebook page\r\n- Technical Support for one month.  I only take on one of these projects a month, and make sure you have everything you need and everything is updated and running smoothly.  After 30 days additional graphics, ads, banners, etc. will an additional cost.\r\n\r\nAll of the graphics I create are from your photos.  It's important to have a somewhat large collection of ready-to-use photos for me to pull from and create graphics for you.  I recommend uploading your photos into a Flickr album for me to download and edit into your graphics.  Remember to include photos in all the categories that you blog about: gardening, knitting, spinning, weaving, fiber, sheep, animals, family, etc.  A minimum of 50 photos is required, and I may ask for more as we progress.  Feel free to upload 100+ photos if you have them.  The more I have to work with, the faster your blog overhaul will be completed.\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n- Create a blog thru blogger.com that I will use as the foundation for your website & blog.  Blogger is free.\r\n- Choose a domain name (www.yourwebsite.com) that we can use to forward/mask your blog address.  Your blog and your website will be the same.  You will be responsible for purchasing and paying for this domain name.  Price range is about $10-12 per year.  \r\n- I will take care of the layout, pages, and graphics.  You will only need to post new blogs (I recommend blogging at least once a week) to keep your blog updated and looking fresh.\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the features of most blogs.  All of these are options and you can either choose to include them or not.\r\n\r\n- Social Networking (option): Links will be created for all the networking sites you are on (ex: Twitter, Flickr, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest).  Before starting the remodel I will need to know what social networking websites you are on and what those links are (example: http://www.facebook.com/yourname/)\r\n\r\n- Galleries (option): will be created using Flickr slideshows.  That way when you have more items to add to a gallery, just upload them into the correct Flickr album and they will automatically show up on your website.  Before the blog remodel, if you want galleries, please create sets on your Flickr account and upload the photos you want into each gallery.  Then give me a link to those galleries and I will create a graphic for each one and embed the slideshow into your blog seamlessly.  \r\n\r\n- Online Shop (option): will be embedded into your website.  That way when you add an item to your show, it will show up automatically on your website.\r\n\r\n- Tutorials (option): Depends on if the tutorials are written, videos, links.  But this can be it's own page linking to all your blog posts about Tutorials, or featuring groups of tutorials on a page (ex: knitting videos) or linking to your YouTube account.\r\n\r\n- Press (option): Will showcase where you have been linked/published \r\n\r\n- About Me (option): Before the blog remodel, please write up the text that you'd want in your biography if you choose to have this page on your blog.\r\n\r\n- Contact (option): This can be a direct link to your email address or a page with your Name, address, email, etc. \r\n\r\nIf this sounds like what you need to get your website off the ground, please send me an email to neauveau@gmail.com.  Each blog redesign takes 1-2 weeks to complete.  Payment will be agreed upon before the beginning of the remodel, and is 100% due up front.  \r\n\r\nRECOMMENDED READING\r\n\r\nPlease read the link on blog design and complete the printable below and email to me before we get started.
