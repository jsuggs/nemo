Free updates to the status of the graffiti in the book will periodically be made available on my website - www.shellshockpublishing.co.uk - once I get the site going again. Until then I can email you all three of the free updates, which are now available in one huge 38 page PDF.  Updates can save you a long walk if you are planning to visit the sites and they have since gone.

It includes over 135 different locations of Banksy's street graffiti, past & present (almost half of which are still worth visiting); over 230 colour photographs; information, random facts & idle chit-chat on each location; a full walking tour of his remaining work in Bristol; and also snippets of art/graffiti by Eine, Faile, Inkie, Kato, Mode 2, BA / DBZ, & Rowdy. \r\n\r\nCollect all the locations like a geek or just wander around, stop at the various quirky local attractions and explore parts you may never have visited before. Alternatively, get your slippers on, and settle back for an open-top bus ride though some of Banksy's best public work... \r\n\r\n<b>General Information</b>\r\n\r\nI will do my best to provide a very swift send out of goods, and will usually not take more that say 2 days to send something once payment is confirmed / cleared.  I do though have a 'normal' job as well and can't always joyfully join the huge queues at the post office every day :-)\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions which may help you to understand the item better. Just ask and I‘ll do my best to help.\r\n\r\n<b>Postage and Packing</b>\r\n\r\nP&P in the UK is free for you (it costs me about £2.70).  As I also buy many things through the post and I’m a great re-user/recycler in life, so I will often recycle packing material, which keeps costs down for all of us.  I will always pack items as carefully and fully as possible.\r\n\r\nFor Europe please add £4.99.  For elsewhere please add £9.99.  Sorry, but it is a heavy, hardback book (800g).\r\n\r\nIf you require extra insurance or special packing / postage requests please let me know as early as possible.  For recorded delivery in the UK please just add £1.10p.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking and happy buying.\r\n\r\nMartin\r\n","options":[{"id":11676700,"name":"BLT Volume 2","price":8.49,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.99,"amount_with_others":3.69,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":9.99,"amount_with_others":6.99,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":4.99,"amount_with_others":3.69,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":4.99,"amount_with_others":3.69,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":4.99,"amount_with_others":3.69,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":4.99,"amount_with_others":3.69,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":4.99,"amount_with_others":3.69,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":9.99,"amount_with_others":6.99,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":4.99,"amount_with_others":3.69,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":9.99,"amount_with_others":6.69,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":9.99,"amount_with_others":6.69,"country":{"id":207,"name":"South Africa","code":"ZA"}},{"amount_alone":9.99,"amount_with_others":6.69,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.99,"amount_with_others":3.69,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/33696974/-/Banksy_Locations__and_a_tour__-_Vol.2_-_Front_Cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/33696974/-/Banksy_Locations__and_a_tour__-_Vol.2_-_Front_Cover.jpg","width":571,"height":404}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2684337,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":3469264,"name":"Banksy Locations (& Tours) Vol.1 - NEW 5th edition - FREE UK P&P","permalink":"banksy-locations-tours-vol-1-new-4th-edition","position":2,"price":6.99,"default_price":6.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/banksy-locations-tours-vol-1-new-4th-edition","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-03-23T03:40:30.000Z","description":"DIRECT FROM THE AUTHOR...\r\n\r\n5th edition - Heavily revised and updated in late 2013\r\n\r\n<b>BRAND NEW EDITION OF THIS LONG RUNNING BOOK</b>\r\n\r\nI am the author, photographer and publisher of this book.
