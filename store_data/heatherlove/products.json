Cornelius and Heather chose to save their very first kiss for their wedding day. They realized quickly that after their wedding day, there was still much that they had to learn about marriage God’s way. There are many examples of marriage, all around us, but many of those examples are not representative of the covenant union between Christ and the Church. This book is purposed to provide married couples with the biblical understanding of how to operate in their marriage, to provide a single person with insight on what marriage will be like for them, and to provide those that are divorced with insight on what they can do differently in their next marriage. In this book, you will be encouraged to: - Understand the connection between our Christian faith and family - Compare the “ideal” marriage to what actually happens in marriage - Learn about the relationship between you, your spouse, and God - Realize how to break free from feeling like a prisoner in your marriage - Learn what it means to be a submitted wife or a peace-making husband Also, read the tough, personal stories Cornelius shares about his marriage. Inside, he shares some intimate moments he and his wife experienced when a very tragic situation occurred that rocked their marriage to the core. You will be encouraged by what you read, and realize that you are not alone.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":29611868,"name":"Default","price":16.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":17.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/93061154/-/THUMBNAIL_IMAGE-1.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/93061154/-/THUMBNAIL_IMAGE-1.jpeg","width":160,"height":240}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4395773,"name":"Book","permalink":"book","url":"/category/book"}]},{"id":9386174,"name":"Cornelius Lindsey&#x27;s book: So, You Want To Be Married?","permalink":"so-you-want-to-be-married","position":64,"price":15.99,"default_price":15.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/so-you-want-to-be-married","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-08T17:57:54.000Z","description":"An Alternative to Dating and Perfecting the Journey to Marriage\r\nAuthored by Cornelius Lindsey \r\n\r\nDo you want to be married?

But as life continued to go on, she found herself searching to fill her insecurities with temporary voids and ended up broken, rejected, exhausted and frustrated. Desperate to let God change her from the inside out-she shares her story, struggles and triumphs as she went from having Pink Lips & an Empty Heart to having Pink Lips and a Heart that is completely surrendered to God.\r\n\r\nIn a society where women are encouraged to portray a certain self-image, Heather challenges women in saying that it is not enough to just get dressed up and portray a \"perfect appearance\" when deep down, you're empty.

The Official Pinky Promise Purity & Promise Ring! It's a beautiful mesh ring with a silver heart. The HEART is the same HEART that is in the Pinky Promise logo. It's a reminder that whether single or married-- God has our HEART. We remain married to Him no matter what is going on in our life. It's a reminder to guard your HEART because out of it flows the issues of life. It took me about 9-10 months to come up with a ring that we could wear that would represent our honor to God. So, wear this ring with great honor. \r\n\r\nSome may ask-- which ring finger should I wear it on? When I was single, I wore my promise ring on my left ring hand finger to run off randoms. I knew at the right time-- the right guy would measure up and he would KNOW I was single. But wear it wherever you would like! \r\n\r\nItem is true to size.\r\n\r\nThis item will arrive within 2-3 weeks of ordering.
