To Whom It May Concern (September 3rd,2013), is his 3rd solo and has been labeled as his best album yet. Combining styles of Hip Hop, Dance, Dubstep and R&B with the help from an outstanding producer, Smash Beatz , has forced 2Edge’s creative bar’s movement to be higher than it’s ever been. To Whom It May Concern brings you special appearances from Phili emcee Young Joshua (Why Lie, We Different), pure vocalist Courtney Chadwick (Forever Luv, Guess Again Revisited), introduces you to the new comer Christopher Sears and the beautiful vocals of 2Edge’s baby sister, Rachel Lewis.  \r\n\r\nOne of the biggest inspirations for the latest project, To Whom It May Concern, is the life lived and passing of his mother, Brenda Lewis in October of 2012. For a short moment, 2Edge thought about ending his music career but was very encouraged by the memories of how he and his mother connected with music. Her abilities as a singer/songwriter gave him a humble benchmark to model after.  Lyrically, this album pulls from so many different experiences and sonically touches your heart, soul and feet all at the same time. If you’ve heard him before, beware because the intense, transparent, Christ –driven style is like nothing he’s done on previous projects. As stated in the intro, “3rd time around, no pressure…I’m happy to say it’s been a pleasure”!","options":[{"id":41779482,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123096864/-/2Edge_-_T.W.I.M.C._Front_Cover.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123096864/-/2Edge_-_T.W.I.M.C._Front_Cover.png","width":674,"height":674}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":226692,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":4151250,"name":"2Edge - Second Wind","permalink":"second-wind","position":2,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/second-wind","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-07-26T06:51:28.000Z","description":"Second Wind is 2Edge's sophomore project.
