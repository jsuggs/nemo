Located in Baghdad, Iraq and established 800 AD this vast institution was a common play ground for scholars. A huge focus was translation of books from every language and constant teaching of  one another to further enhance many aspects of society. It was said that the Imam of the time would give a scholar the weight of a book translated in gold once completed, hence “Knowledge is gold.” \r\n\tThe Graphic NovelTee Vol.III is an extension of this time period to further provoke thought and speak to those who set foundations to our everyday lives. During my research of this time period and in particular the House of Wisdom I found no graphic representation of how the “logo” for this institution would have looked. I decided I would simply make my own to pay homage to such a remarkable place in time. \r\n\r\nAlamic shirts all have labels and printed tags. \r\n100% supersoft ringspun cotton. \r\nManufactured in the USA and printed in Portland, Oregon.\r\nTropical Blue color shirt with two color soft print.","options":[{"id":32746237,"name":"Small","price":24.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32746240,"name":"Medium","price":24.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32746243,"name":"Large","price":24.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32746246,"name":"Xlarge","price":24.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32746249,"name":"XXLarge","price":24.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102769564/-/House_of_Wisdom_-_Almiac_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102769564/-/House_of_Wisdom_-_Almiac_1.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102769600/-/House_of_Wisdom-Almaic2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102769600/-/House_of_Wisdom-Almaic2.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/102769672/-/house_of_wisdom-almaic3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/102769672/-/house_of_wisdom-almaic3.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3459065,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":10455001,"name":"Guns & Roses","permalink":"guns-roses","position":2,"price":24.0,"default_price":24.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/guns-roses","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-10T06:03:57.000Z","description":"This graphic is to help bring light to how our media tries to constantly cover what truly goes on in the world.
