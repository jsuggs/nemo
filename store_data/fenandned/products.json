We went in search of inspiring individuals, and came back with our ideas challenged and perspectives broadened. Paraphrasing Nick Hand, cyclist and storyteller (pg. 14), ‘people are quite often extraordinary without even realising it’, which is definitely true of those that we met in the making of this volume.\r\n\r\nWe all have stimuli, and inspirations can be so varied; so subjective, and so personal. It is the people that we met – those that drive the stories and bring the features to life – that truly inspire us. From fumbling around limestone caves 200 feet underground in search of ochre pigment with a seventh generation miner (pg. 74), to clambering up rock-faces with boulder-climbers (pg. 82), to grazing on the urban landscape with an urban forager (pg. 22), to tending to bees on London’s high-rise tower blocks with an enthralled beekeeper (pg. 28) – these people are passionate and enthusiastic about what they do, and it is often their fervid spirits that most excite us.\r\n\r\nWe celebrate the real people behind ideas, practices and processes; they are what make them interesting. Equally behind Another Escape there are real people too. And like those that we feature, we also have our quirks and imperfections – Another Escape is very much a work in progress; a journey to discovery, and we’d like to invite you along for the ride","options":[{"id":48329613,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127723662/-/Another_Escape_digital_samplecover_low_res.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127723662/-/Another_Escape_digital_samplecover_low_res.jpg","width":754,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5532234,"name":"Publications","permalink":"publications","url":"/category/publications"}]},{"id":14922945,"name":"CURRENT ISSUE | The Plant Issue 5","permalink":"current-issue-the-plant-issue-5","position":19,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/current-issue-the-plant-issue-5","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-18T12:38:55.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":48393273,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127768668/-/the_plant_5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127768668/-/the_plant_5.jpg","width":733,"height":960}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5532234,"name":"Publications","permalink":"publications","url":"/category/publications"}]},{"id":14922957,"name":"CURRENT ISSUE | Apartamento Issue 12","permalink":"current-issue-apartamento-issue-12","position":20,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/current-issue-apartamento-issue-12","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-18T12:40:22.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":48393399,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127768710/-/apartamento_12.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127768710/-/apartamento_12.jpg","width":680,"height":960}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5532234,"name":"Publications","permalink":"publications","url":"/category/publications"}]},{"id":11795706,"name":"SALE | Cereal Vol. Three","permalink":"current-issue-cereal-vol-three","position":21,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/current-issue-cereal-vol-three","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-06-14T21:55:31.000Z","description":"CEREAL VOL. 3 \r\n\r\nSALE | WAS £10.00 NOW £5.00\r\n\r\nIn the third volume of Cereal, we travel to Reykjavik, Iceland; Santa Barbara, USA; and the Antrim Coast in Northern Ireland.
