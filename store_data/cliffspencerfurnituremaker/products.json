It provides seating for two at an eclectic dining table. It shoulders your collection of art books and cocktails as a coffee table.\r\n<br>Before 80% of the earths old growth forest had been cleared, every beam was rift sawn, entire barns were built out of walnut. \"Dunnage\", the square pieces of wood used as support and padding in building, shipping and trucking, were made of high quality wood species, like oak. \r\n<br>The Miyake Bench elevates the unique and incredibly dense grain of this vintage wood to heirloom quality, small batch furniture. The finish is a traditional and completely non-toxic process, using a rusty nail and vinegar. Floating dovetail joints provide both solid craftsmanship and understated design detail. \r\n<br>43\" W x 18\" H x 15\" D, oak with an oil/wax finish OR an exterior-grade, water-base poly urethane for outdoor use\r\n<br>Please call to quote shipping outside the 48 continuous states.","options":[{"id":21403695,"name":"INDOOR: oil/wax finish","price":975.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46809591,"name":"OUTDOOR: poly urethane","price":975.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/107429385/-/Seating_04_06.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/107429385/-/Seating_04_06.jpg","width":615,"height":649},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/107429625/-/Seating_04_04.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/107429625/-/Seating_04_04.jpg","width":582,"height":618},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/107429733/-/Seating_04_05.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/107429733/-/Seating_04_05.jpg","width":582,"height":618}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2026436,"name":"Home and Furniture","permalink":"home-and-furniture","url":"/category/home-and-furniture"},{"id":4425647,"name":"Ready to Ship","permalink":"ready-to-ship","url":"/category/ready-to-ship"}]},{"id":3585812,"name":"Wine Oak Cocktail Table","permalink":"wine-oak-modular-cubes","position":21,"price":450.0,"default_price":450.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wine-oak-modular-cubes","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-04-12T21:00:35.000Z","description":"These cocktail tables can work as more than tables.
