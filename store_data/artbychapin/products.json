A French word signifying vellum lace. \"Vellum\" means \" parchment,\" and parchment is sheep-skin, tanned and bleached white fit for writing or printing on. \" Cartisane \" is another French word signifying a long thin strip of parchment or vellum rolled round and completely covered with twisted silk. To produce Guipure lace, the old French lace-makers first formed the outlines of the intended pattern of these car-tisanes, they being held together at various points by stitches called \"brides \" or \"bars,\" worked with the needle. These minute cords or car-tisanes were either arranged so as to touch one another, and be sewed together often enough for solidity, or were attached in the form of a figure by the \"brides.\"","options":[{"id":19923231,"name":"9.25x7.5 Wedding Guest book (blank pages)","price":165.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19927837,"name":"9x12 Wedding Photo Guest Book with spacers","price":245.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":19927839,"name":"Matching Pen","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":19927841,"name":"Glassine Paper (protects photos)","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":25606368,"name":"rush order","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":22.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61349653/-/vignettelace_002.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61349653/-/vignettelace_002.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61349855/-/il_570xN.213275678.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61349855/-/il_570xN.213275678.jpg","width":570,"height":379},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61349871/-/il_570xN.213275683.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61349871/-/il_570xN.213275683.jpg","width":570,"height":379}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3172609,"name":"Lace Wedding","permalink":"lace-wedding","url":"/category/lace-wedding"}]},{"id":5385631,"name":"Photo Album Pen, Wedding Guest Book Pen, Custom Made Pen, Archival, Indian Ink","permalink":"photo-album-pen-wedding-guest-book-pen-custom-made-pen-archival-indian-ink-artbychapin","position":17,"price":30.0,"default_price":30.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/photo-album-pen-wedding-guest-book-pen-custom-made-pen-archival-indian-ink-artbychapin","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-02T20:59:58.000Z","description":"Pen Brush with Lace cover\r\n\r\nMy newest offering is a Brush Pen with lace cover.

It is a OOAK original point de gaze in mint condition displaying wheat shafts and leaves. I've sewn it to a large 15x15 board covered with a shimmering copper charmeuse silk in a custom color mix that I've hand dyed and a new color that I'm adding to my shops because it is soooo beautiful.... it shimmers and changes color with the light. \r\n\r\nI created this for the Etsy Wedding Team (EWT) Fall Challenge, a contest we've set up between the vendors to inspire a special creation. This is for sale but it is priced as a work of art. \r\n\r\nPoint de gaze is made with super fine thread, finer than sewing thread. It takes 60 hours to make one rose so I estimate that this represents 3-6 months of work. If you were able to find a skilled worker who could recreate this for you it would cost for the time of the maker anywhere from $9600-$19,000 in time. \r\n\r\nIt is possible to buy this book all the policies of the shop apply. This book is 100 pages ( 100 sides) with archival 190 gsm paper and spacers for a photo album or scrapbook use. Shipping would be by Fed Ex only and special charges do apply for artship box insured.
