This letter is perfect for the kids just starting out with their correspondence with old St. Nick, all they have to do is fill in the blank spaces, maybe draw Santa a little something special, have fun using the stickers to seal the letter and take a trip to the mailbox! What a fun way to spend some time with your kid as the Holidays approach.\r\n\r\nThe Letter to Santa comes scored so all you have to do is have fun filling in the letter, fold it down and use the awesome stickers to seal the letter. Within Canada & the US, letters to the Jolly Guy are free (um hell yeah!) so no postage necessary, just drop in the post box and wait for his arrival. Don't forget to bake him those cookies, he gets pretty hungry with all that travelling!\r\n\r\nIf you are from a country outside of North America, just hit the custom button and I can make a special letter for your children. Just let me know what your specific country's address for letters to Santa Claus is!\r\n\r\nThis listing is for one card 5.5 x 8.5\" flat (card is scored + folds down to 5.5\" x 4.25\"\r\nPrinted on a bright white 100lb FSC card stock\r\nset includes 3 stickers to help seal & decorate your letter","options":[{"id":50240781,"name":"Canadian Mailing address","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50240784,"name":"US Mailing address","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.25,"amount_with_others":0.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.25}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129112926/-/IMG_3529.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129112926/-/IMG_3529.JPG","width":1440,"height":1064}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2053928,"name":"cards","permalink":"cards","url":"/category/cards"}]},{"id":11682831,"name":"1st Wedding Anniversary card","permalink":"1st-wedding-anniversary-card","position":2,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/1st-wedding-anniversary-card","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-10T00:14:06.000Z","description":"The Traditional gift for a First Wedding Anniversary is paper, so why not give your other half a super fun card, you made it to the paper anniversary :) The countdown of the official days you've been married makes all the more monumental too.\r\n\r\nThis card comes in 2 colour combos right now, please select which option you'd like in the drop down.

A friend and I used to get together once a month for \"Get Shit Done Meetings\", and mostly this was so that we had someone to report to once a month (and have fun drinks while doing it) which comes in handy when you work for yourself, and don't have a boss to crack the whip when things need to get done. But now we live thousands of miles apart and co-ordinating skype meetups is tough, so I made us some notepads.
