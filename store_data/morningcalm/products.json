Compared with other wood charcoal, it has 3 times more mineral constituent and 4 times better absorption rate. The bamboo charcoal makes the soap more absorbent and as a result it can clean deep inside the skin pores. And it leaves no residue on the skin and so allows the pores to breathe and be naturally moisturized.\r\n\r\nYour choice:\r\n- 4 scented bamboo charcoal soaps 4oz $22\r\n- 4 unscented bamboo charcoal soaps 3.7oz $20\r\n- 2 scented + 2 unscented $21\r\n\r\n• approx. 4oz / 3.7oz ( unscented )\r\n• good for sensitive, acne-prone skin\r\n• unscented / scented with pure essential oils\r\n\r\n* Custom Order \r\nIf you want to purchase bigger quantities (5~14 soap bars), please send me a message.
