This is the FINAL Learn To Spin Workshop for 2013. \r\n\r\nHandspinning yarn is experiencing a revival.. It's high time you join in the fun! Join me to learn to spin our own handspun yarn using a Spindle and/or a Spinning Wheel set in my Katoomba studio, in the picturesque Blue Mountains Australia. \r\n\r\nAll the essential basics are covered & you'll be spinning yarn by the end of this course. A brief rundown of my program:\r\n- learn about various fibers available to hand-spinners, including animal, plant, man made & the value of using natural fibres.\r\n- how to choose fleece for making specific projects\r\n- fibre preparation methods & uses\r\n- so.. exactly what is woollen & worsted? I'll explain the mystery of these two spinning & fibre prep methods\r\n- navigate your way around a spinning wheel\r\n- spin a singles yarn using short-draw\r\n- ply your singles\r\n+ handspun yarn finishing methods: the conundrum to 'set the twist' or 'to NOT set the twist' will be revealed! There will be a lot of laughs & fun thrown in for good measure\r\n\r\nNOTE: The Drop Spindle module is the first session in this 2day workshop, and may be taken separately as a 1day course. Use the drop down menu to select the Drop Spindle 1day Option.\r\n\r\n*For best results, you will require a wheel to spin/practice on at home. Please drop me a comment if you need help in procuring a good 2nd-hand or new student wheel.\r\n\r\nLike to book a private workshop? \r\nContact me to request dates, then once confirmed, use this listing to book online.\r\n\r\nPrice included tea and snacks, BYO Lunch. A small selection of fibre is provided for use in class.\r\n\r\nMy Spin Sessions have been attended by a many people fascinated by this ancient art form to learn the art of hand-spinning in a friendly, professional atmosphere. I love to share my passion for spinning unique threads! You can find our more in the About Me menu below.

We highly recommend the 'Aquarelle Instructional' booklet to get you started!\r\n\r\n-Excerpt from Botanical Colours:\r\nAquarelle colors mix easily and are beautiful and lightfast. One of the most exciting colors is a liquid indigo that does not require a vat and produces a striking turquoise shade on protein fibers. \r\n\r\nThis liquid indigo is an improved formulation of Saxon Blue, which was first created in the 18th century. This means you can add the blue directly into your dyebath along with a bit of yellow and get a beautiful green. Aqua, turquoise and marine blue are now at your fingertips. If you have always wanted to use indigo but didn’t want to deal with a vat, this is an easy way to add a unique blue to your color palette. \r\n\r\nThese special dyes work with a group of non-metallic auxiliaries. The auxiliaries are non-toxic liquids and both the dyes and the auxiliaries have been certified by Control Union as compliant with the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS).  \r\n\r\nPlease note that the Aquarelle Liquid Indigo works best on wool, silk alpaca and other animal fibers.  On cotton, bamboo, Tencel, linen and hemp it is a very pale blue.  However, the rest of the Aquarelle dyes work equally well on any natural fiber.","options":[{"id":21727385,"name":"Aquarelle Booklet","price":4.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21727353,"name":"Cutch 50ml","price":8.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21727355,"name":"Cutch 100ml","price":15.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21727331,"name":"Himalayan Rhubarb 50ml","price":8.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21727333,"name":"Himalayan Rhubarb 100ml","price":15.5,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21727335,"name":"Indigo 50ml","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21727337,"name":"Indigo 125ml","price":28.5,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21727339,"name":"Lac 50ml","price":10.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21727341,"name":"Lac 100ml","price":19.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21727343,"name":"Madder 50ml","price":10.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21727345,"name":"Madder 100ml","price":19.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21727377,"name":"Myrobalan 50ml","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21727375,"name":"Myrobalan 100ml","price":15.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21727357,"name":"Pomegranate 50ml","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21727359,"name":"Pomegranate 100ml","price":15.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21727373,"name":"Pom Tannin 50ml","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21727371,"name":"Pom Tannin 100ml","price":15.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21727369,"name":"Disperse 50ml","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21727367,"name":"Disperse 100ml","price":9.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21727351,"name":"Vege Plus 50ml","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21727365,"name":"Vege Plus 100ml","price":9.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21727349,"name":"Vege Plus Bright 50ml","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21727363,"name":"Vege Plus Bright 100ml","price":9.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21727347,"name":"Vege Plus Dark 50ml","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":21727361,"name":"Vege Plus Dark 100ml","price":9.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67231885/-/Lilacs_and_Aquarelle.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67231885/-/Lilacs_and_Aquarelle.jpg","width":442,"height":354},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/67227989/-/Aquarelle-dyed-yarns-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/67227989/-/Aquarelle-dyed-yarns-2.jpg","width":632,"height":277}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":277916,"name":"Dye","permalink":"dye","url":"/category/dye"}]},{"id":2259301,"name":" Dye // Greener Shades // Starter Kit 9 colours + citric acid","permalink":"dye-greener-shades-starter-kit-9-colours-citric-acid","position":61,"price":45.95,"default_price":45.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dye-greener-shades-starter-kit-9-colours-citric-acid","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-04-07T08:52:19.000Z","description":"Now available in Australia direct from US.
