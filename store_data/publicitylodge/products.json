Inform the Junior Warden if the money is to be used for a dinner.\r\n\r\nThe Yonkers Lions Club and Publicity Lodge are in the fourth year of a Military Gifting Program, which assists US military personnel serving in harms way.\r\n\r\nBecause PXs do not exist in many combat locations, the program acquires hygiene necessities which the troops cannot obtain, such as shampoos, lotions and disinfectants, and snacks such as cookies and hot cocoa mix.  \r\n\r\nThe program then ships hundreds of cartons to the closest Forward Operations Base, (this year's is in Puli Alam, Afganistan, near the Pakistan Border).  There, a responsible military liaison officer parcels out the shipments to combat outposts either by helicopters or overland vehicles as necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the first two years, the program sent shipments during the Christmas holiday season.  This year the program is supplying nearly 500 soldiers for the duration of their deployment!\r\n\r\nYou may use this service to donate $20.00 by credit card through Publicity Lodge's Paypal account, which will be credited immediately to the program.\r\n\r\nYou may also donate any amount at any time, by sending a check, made out to: \r\n\r\nYonkers Lions Club (Memo Military Gifting)  \r\n\r\nAddress it to: \r\n\r\nRichard F.
