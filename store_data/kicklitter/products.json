They're useful for reviewers and for the book's designers to see how it reads, and if the vision lives up to holding it in our hands. \r\n\r\nReview copies are a short-run. For a color novelty book, photography book or children's book, a review copy is usually done on a digital printing press, so the quality isn't as high as the final versions. Review copies also vary slightly from the final book. In our case, no poster or book jacket was printed.\r\n\r\nWe've now got eleven copies left, and are making them available here as collector's items until they're sold out.\r\n\r\nShipping is free, and tax is collected only from California residents.
