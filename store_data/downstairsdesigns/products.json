Also, binding color and ribbons may be different as well- if this will bother you, please email BEFORE you purchase to get the available options. Thanks!\r\n\r\nThis doodle mat is a generous nearly 12\" x 18\", with high quality cotton fabric on one side, and chalkboard cloth on the other. The set comes with a matching eraser bag- simply turn inside out for the flannel eraser!  Flexible and portable, the mat rolls up and ties with a ribbon.\r\n\r\nLittle ones can use the cotton side for a placemat, especially useful in restaurants where the cleanliness of the table may be in question. Perfect for crackers, cereal, you name it. Make a mess and get the cotton dirty? No problem, the mat is completely machine washable.\r\n\r\nChalkboard surface can be wiped clean with a damp paper towel in everyday use, but if it gets dirty or a little grey from so much use, toss it in the wash! Brings the chalk surface back to life.\r\n\r\nBag comes with a pearl snap closure, and can also be thrown in the machine to clean as well.\r\n\r\nSet includes:\r\nXL Chalkboard placemat\r\nMatching Eraser Bag\r\nInstruction card\r\n\r\nGreat for car rides, restaurants, church, weddings, doctor's offices, waiting rooms...you name it!\r\n\r\nChalk is NOT included in the online sets, but may be purchased separately in the shop.","options":[{"id":26321097,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/82245345/-/DSC08383.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/82245345/-/DSC08383.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/82245753/-/DSC08385.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/82245753/-/DSC08385.JPG","width":1000,"height":892}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4147908,"name":"DoodleMat™ Chalkboard Placemats","permalink":"doodlemattm-chalkboard-placemats","url":"/category/doodlemattm-chalkboard-placemats"}]},{"id":8362596,"name":"In Touch Clutch (tm) in Cinnamon Swirl","permalink":"in-touch-clutch-tm-in-cinnamon-swirl","position":3,"price":29.0,"default_price":29.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/in-touch-clutch-tm-in-cinnamon-swirl","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-04T16:01:19.000Z","description":"..The In Touch Clutch (tm) is the perfect way to stay close to what you hold near and dear.
