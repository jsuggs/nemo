It's another portal into the complex and melodramatic world of the Johnny Parry Chamber Orchestra, with some of the best arrangements to date (Keep Kicking and Screaming, rebuild it Piece by piece) and a delicate, ambiguous balance between the dark and light, with an even greater sense of performativity than any of the previous albums, and finding Johnny in full voice and opening up many possibilities for further adventures.
