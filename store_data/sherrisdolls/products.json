Each Nativity comes with a little card attached saying, \"Jesus Christ, the Light of the World. \"I am the light of the world:He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.: (John 8:12). I like to open the door to the Lantern. When I hang it in the tree, you can put a christmas light in the top of the lantern, and it lights up the nativity. This is a perfect gift to give your friends and family members who collect nativities. This is hand made and very unique. You will not find another one like it out there. This Nativity can also set on the table or shelf as a new addition to your nativity collection. Each figurine is hand made without the use of any molds. Mary, Joseph and Baby Jesus are all hand sculpted. It stands about 5 1/2 inches tall. Custom orders can be made. The nativity costs $19.99. Shipping is $7.00. Total cost includeing the shipping is $26.99.","options":[{"id":31217101,"name":"Default","price":26.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98065183/-/light_of_world_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98065183/-/light_of_world_1.jpg","width":366,"height":550},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98065219/-/light_of_world_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98065219/-/light_of_world_2.jpg","width":366,"height":550},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98065255/-/light_of_world_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98065255/-/light_of_world_3.jpg","width":392,"height":550}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4842226,"name":"Figurines","permalink":"figurines","url":"/category/figurines"},{"id":4842988,"name":"Ornaments","permalink":"ornaments","url":"/category/ornaments"}]},{"id":9979876,"name":"Amber Lynn","permalink":"amber-lynn","position":15,"price":295.0,"default_price":295.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/amber-lynn","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-16T23:38:44.000Z","description":"Born: Jan 18, 2011.
