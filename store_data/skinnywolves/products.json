Along with aid of a brass and string combo, Depth of Field is a totally new sound for Somadrone; a minimalist inspired electronic pop songbook, somewhere between Ennio Morricone, Jim O Rourke and Air.\r\n\r\nDepth of Field is out on Skinny Wolves Records, December 3rd 2010 on Vinyl, Cassette and Download.\r\n\r\n==\r\n\r\nListen to VAPOURs, the opening track from the LP, here : <a href=\"http://somadrone.bandcamp.com\">http://somadrone.bandcamp.com</a>\r\n\r\nView the video for PROVIDENCE from the LP here :\r\n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/16881766\">http://vimeo.com/16881766</a>\r\n(The video was made by Eoghan Kidney, who recent CV includes work for Sh1t Robot, Valerie Francis, Delerontos, Fight Like Apes, etc...)","options":[{"id":9967101,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27679057/-/wolf007-600.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27679057/-/wolf007-600.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":47425,"name":"Somadrone","permalink":"somadrone","url":"/artist/somadrone"}],"categories":[{"id":224989,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]},{"id":2761629,"name":"WOLF006 // CAP PAS CAP - Haunted Light : LP","permalink":"wolf006-cap-pas-cap-haunted-light-lp","position":3,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wolf006-cap-pas-cap-haunted-light-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-09-21T12:16:07.000Z","description":"<h1>CAP PAS CAP<br />\r\n  <em>Haunted Light</em></h1>\r\n<p>The long awaited debut album from dark pop  wonders, Cap Pas Cap.</p>\r\n<p>Official Release Date : <em>12 November 2010</em></p>\r\n<p>Limited Vinyl w/ Free Download Codes</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li> Mirrors *</li>\r\n  <li> We Are Men</li>\r\n  <li>Ship Shadow</li>\r\n  <li>Friends</li>\r\n  <li>Hearts</li>\r\n  <li>Can't Say</li>\r\n  <li>Brand New Town</li>\r\n  <li>Y Lies</li>\r\n  <li>Save Our Sights</li>\r\n  <li>Night Tribes</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>* Listen to MIRRORS here:<br />\r\n  <a href=\"http://cappascap.bandcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://cappascap.bandcamp.com</a><br />\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/cappascap\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.myspace.com/cappascap</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.soundcloud.com/cappascap\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.soundcloud.com/cappascap</a></p><p>WATCH \"Friends\" Video here : <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/16656859\">http://vimeo.com/16656859</a></p>\r\n\r\n==\r\n\r\nREVIEWS\r\n\r\n\"At times they sound like the best bits of CSS and New Young Pony Club but all the while there is something altogether more mysterious going on.\" - Sunday Tribune\r\n\r\n4/5 : \"There's an edge and artifice here that the folks at Pitchfork would go gaga for, but Haunted Light is far more than just an album for the scenesters to name-check\" - Irish Independent\r\n\r\n4/5 : \"This is one of the Irish albums of the year\" - Metro Ireland\r\n\r\n4/5 : \"Bottom-heavy rhytms and grooves topped with angular guitars, and edgy attitude and a pop sensibility that shines through the over-riding melancholia\" - The Star\r\n\r\n\"We're happy to announce this particular monster a vicious bitch baying for blood - Haunted Light is 36 minutes of sonic terrorism from a perhaps unsuspecting source.
