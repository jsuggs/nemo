(Although we wouldn't recommend it).\r\n\r\nIt's not bad on the nose, either, in terms of scent, that is!  Combining lemongrass, tea tree and eucalyptus, you'll not smell like a walking chemical bomb, and your kids won't be enhaling all sorts of noxious fumes like some other repellent sprays that shall remain nameless.\r\n\r\nHoneycomb Valley chooses to use organic ingredients to blend with farm produce to encourage sustainable farming practices, and to minimise the synthetic chemicals going into the environment.\r\n\r\nIngredients: Organic oils of castor, jojoba, soya bean. Beeswax & honey, organic cocoa butter, carnauba wax.  Organic essential oils of citronella, lavender, geranium, rosemary, eucalyptus, tea tree, lemon eucalyptus, lemongrass.\r\n\r\nBe sure to test for allergies before full application.  17gms.","options":[{"id":12847976,"name":"Default","price":9.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37535482/-/beeoff.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37535482/-/beeoff.jpg","width":700,"height":467}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2147098,"name":"Skincare","permalink":"skincare","url":"/category/skincare"},{"id":2147100,"name":"HONEYCOMB VALLEY FARMECEUTICALS","permalink":"honeycomb-valley-farmeceuticals","url":"/category/honeycomb-valley-farmeceuticals"}]},{"id":3805042,"name":"Purple Diamond Hairbows by MABEL & DAISY","permalink":"purple-diamond-hairbows-by-mabel-daisy","position":3,"price":9.95,"default_price":9.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/purple-diamond-hairbows-by-mabel-daisy","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-05-24T14:22:06.000Z","description":"Entirely hand-sewn from vintage and repurposed fabrics, mabel & daisy hairbows are a cute way to add a bit of old-school flair to your hair.
