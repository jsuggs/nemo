The emigrant straddles two places and cultures, the old and the new, and often must live in the in between.\r\nThe gash in the earth functions in a number of ways: it refers to a physical separation of land, a psychological wound, and an interruption in continuity. The hand similarly offers multiple reads but ultimately its intentions and desires remain ambiguous. Does it look forward, seeking to wrap a finger under the earth to peal back the sod and reveal a future? Or does it reach longingly into the darkness in the hope of touching the past?\"\r\n\r\nRead more about Gwynne and this photograph <a href=\"http://fractionmagazine.com/artist/gwynne-johnson\">here</a>","options":[{"id":28945745,"name":"Default","price":100.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":20.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90880727/-/Johnson_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90880727/-/Johnson_1.jpg","width":700,"height":579}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3508251,"name":"Photographs","permalink":"photographs","url":"/category/photographs"}]},{"id":9247847,"name":"Galina Kurlat - Amanda IIIX","permalink":"galina-kurlat-amanda-iiix","position":27,"price":100.0,"default_price":100.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/galina-kurlat-amanda-iiix","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-31T22:33:28.000Z","description":"Artist: Galina Kurlat\r\nTitle: Amanda IIIX\r\nSize: 8.5x11\r\n\r\nPrint Type: Archival Pigment Print\r\nPrinter Type: Epson R2400\r\nPrinter Ink Type: Epson \r\nPaper: Epson Premium Luster\r\n\r\nEdition: 12\r\nPrice: $100\r\n\r\nSIGNED\r\n\r\nFrom Issue 47\r\n\r\n\"The photographs in this series are made using Type 55 Polaroid positive/negative film, a film which was expired in 2008.
