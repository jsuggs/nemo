Included in this album are three rock videos of some of the songs.","options":[{"id":2913361,"name":"CD and DVD set","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/6853861/-/cousins_CD.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/6853861/-/cousins_CD.jpg","width":964,"height":945}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":307161,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":427255,"name":"HI BUD - T - Shirt","permalink":"hi-bud","position":16,"price":65.0,"default_price":65.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/hi-bud","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-10-15T06:38:43.000Z","description":"A hand drawn t-shirt by Harland. It's the only one of its kind. Harland only draws the design once so that you own the only copy. \"It's all about being original baby!\"\r\n\r\nHarland draws directly on the shirt with waterproof markers. Image will fade slightly the more the shirt is washed but image can not be washed out.","options":[{"id":1700114,"name":"WIFE BEATER - LARGE","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3528436/-/hi_bud0001.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3528436/-/hi_bud0001.jpg","width":400,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":307164,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":1605341,"name":"ONE OF A KIND BUBBLES PAINTING","permalink":"one-of-a-kind-bubbles-painting","position":17,"price":170.0,"default_price":170.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/one-of-a-kind-bubbles-painting","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-02-15T20:46:14.000Z","description":"This is a one of a kind painting done by Harland.
