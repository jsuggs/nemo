It’s a dark cut of social commentary that Mr. Hillyard attacks with his instantly recognizable sax work.\r\n\r\nDave had this to say about the tune: “The original song, Evil, was about adultery. For me though, the tune is about the risks you take when put everything out there. Its about touring. When you go on the tour, you never know if this is going to be the tour that is the straw that breaks the camel’s back. That your family may or not survive this obsession you have to make music and share it with people.\r\n\r\nMusic is powerful magic so when you practice magic sometimes it has a way of backfiring on you. Or at least you have to be aware of it.\r\n\r\nSo the evil is the potential of bad stuff happening at home (the original turnaround is ‘you better watch your happy home’). Its also the evil that posesses you to make music. Which is also a beautfiul, vibrant, fiery thing.”\r\n\r\nThe release features the tune in 2 parts on a vinyl 7” record.\r\n\r\nFREE SHIPPING","options":[{"id":20185545,"name":"Default","price":9.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/62214423/-/md-7002.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/62214423/-/md-7002.png","width":905,"height":694}],"artists":[{"id":124355,"name":"David Hillyard & The Rocksteady 7","permalink":"david-hillyard-the-rocksteady-7","url":"/artist/david-hillyard-the-rocksteady-7"}],"categories":[{"id":2430303,"name":"vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":5314159,"name":"Moondust T-Shirt","permalink":"moondust-t-shirt","position":3,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/moondust-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-01-24T02:18:07.000Z","description":"Be proud!
