The issue was available for pre-order on the Arkitip website beginning 05/05/2009 for $70. Any subscriptions purchased before that date included issue #51, but any purchased on or after 05/05/2009 began with issue #52. The estimated ship date for issue #51 is 06/19/2009.\r\n\r\nAs with all the prints included with Arkitip issue #51, this print is signed but not numbered.\r\n\r\nFrom Obeygiant.com:\r\n\r\nArkitip Issue No. 0051: Shepard Fairey\r\n\r\nI have known Scott, the creator of Arkitip for ten years when he was on issue 2. I was in issue 3 and I later contributed writing to a few other issues. The magazine started off only black and white, but has evolved into a very beautiful and sophisticated publication. I am very proud to be the featured artist in Arkitip 51. The issue includes current exclusive content from my indoor and outdoor work for the Boston ICA as well as a large selection of my newest fine art. There is an extensive interview with me by Simon Steinhardt and a great essay by ICA curator Pedro Alonzo. The magazine is packaged in a premium box with hand placed stickers on the outside. The magazine itself is perfect bound and has a die-cut cover. There is also a magazine sized, one color signed and numbered version of the Obey Eyeball print. The run is limited to 5,000. Check it out.
