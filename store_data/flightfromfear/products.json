These geode spheres appear as crystal rock formations, but are fabricated in ceramic from cast flotsam and glazed with recycled glass shards.  These objects tastefully comment on the longevity of disposable products and highlight the reusability of ceramics.\r\n\r\nMini geode spheres are made from ceramic and glass, and hang easily on the wall with one nail. Each geode is unique and approximately 3 ½” x 2 ½”.\r\n\r\nThe geode you receive will slightly vary from the ones in the image.\r\nGeodes come in white, black, silver, blue, aqua, green, pink, red, yellow, or brown.
