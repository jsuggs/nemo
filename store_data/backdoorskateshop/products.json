Ed Templeton grinds, Mike Maldonado goes big, Elissa Steamer packs a good part, and Satva Leung rocks it with some nice grinds & smooth f/s flips. Donny Barley delivers a nice switch 180 to smith grind on a hand rail and Brian Anderson throws his sweet big spin flips. The crash section is how this video got its name, so keep that in mind if you don't want to lose your lunch. Check out Chad Muska's unrealesed part before he left Toy Machine for SHORTY's.","options":[{"id":28597868,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1771101,"name":"DVDs","permalink":"dvds","url":"/category/dvds"}]},{"id":5228973,"name":"Sk8 Mafia DVD","permalink":"sk8-mafia-dvd","position":2,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sk8-mafia-dvd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-01-11T11:04:53.000Z","description":"The Newest video from the Mafia featuring Wes Kremer, Tyler Surrey, Jamie Palmore, Kellan James, Jimmy Cao, Larelle Gray and the rest of the Sk8Mafia Crew.","options":[{"id":16951521,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/51349887/-/sk8.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/51349887/-/sk8.jpg","width":225,"height":225}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1771101,"name":"DVDs","permalink":"dvds","url":"/category/dvds"}]}]
