The duo's \"nintendo-punk-rap\" is countered, for Art Metronome, with the ballad \"Dear Lucille, Talk Soon Aiden.\"\r\n\r\nKids On TV have established an international reputation for their genre-defying audio intersections, politicized and sexual performance antics and visual mash-ups of contemporary art references and popular culture.\r\n\r\nOn AM001, KOTV present a special remix of \"Goodbye Horses,\" a high-disco cover version featuring vocals by Julie Faught.
