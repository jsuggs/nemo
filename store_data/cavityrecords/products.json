Across Tundras was born on the Western High Prairie and has been sighted recently in the hills north of Nashville, TN. Countless mysterious audio artifacts and sonic expeditions have been made by the un-herd collective since their inception in 2003, both delighting and bewildering musical excavators who have encountered the aural, physical, and meta-evidence of this pastoral beast.\r\n\r\nHailing from the Midwest, Lark's Tongue formed in 2010 of seasoned travelers informed by all manners of cosmic pursuits. They conjure heavy, layered psychedelia with an emphasis on harmony and narrative, atop beguiling squalls of guitar, shimmering keys, and a thick low-end.\r\n\r\nThis LP comes packaged in a gatefold layout with woodcuts from Travis Lawrence @ Infinity Prints. \r\n\r\nPressing info:\r\n250 - Red Translucent/black splatter vinyl\r\n150 - White vinyl\r\n100 - Brown Translucent with White \"starburst\" colored vinyl\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":31731817,"name":"Red/Black Translucent Vinyl","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":31731820,"name":"White Vinyl","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":31731823,"name":"Brown Translucent with White \"starburst\" colored vinyl","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":22.0,"amount_with_others":14.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99619339/-/ATLThirescoverlower.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99619339/-/ATLThirescoverlower.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/99619351/-/atltbackhireslower.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/99619351/-/atltbackhireslower.jpg","width":801,"height":801},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/115226718/-/cvr20allcolors.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/115226718/-/cvr20allcolors.JPG","width":640,"height":478}],"artists":[{"id":187864,"name":"Across Tundras / Lark's Tongue","permalink":"across-tundras-lark-s-tongue","url":"/artist/across-tundras-lark-s-tongue"}],"categories":[{"id":90658,"name":"LPs","permalink":"lps","url":"/category/lps"}]},{"id":6967311,"name":"North \"The Great Silence\" 2xLP","permalink":"north-the-great-silence-2xlp","position":2,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/north-the-great-silence-2xlp","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-08-15T02:09:13.000Z","description":"NORTH has returned!

The lumbering doom machine has teamed up now with one man act Hallowed Butchery for a split album to show off the talents of lesser known doom bands that aren’t afraid to experiment. Both sides of this split have some pretty impressive takes on the genre, and serious streaks of individuality that make the songs worth hearing for fans or people who aren’t normally doom fanatics.\r\n\r\nBatillus gets the split started off with the first three tracks, which have been noticeably trimmed down from the 11 minute behemoths on the band’s earlier EP. With run times around eight minutes, each song still has plenty of time to move along at a nice simmer, however. As an added bonus, the group finally brought on a vocalist for this release. The rough growls add another dimension and make the music both more aggressive and more accessible for people who don’t care much for unending, slow moving doom.\r\n\r\nThe three Batillus songs all keep up the band’s trademark of huge, drawn out riffs that destroy everything in their path. To keep things interesting there are always a few curve balls thrown, like slow bass lines and ethereal guitar work complete with backing whispers in “The Children of Night Make Their Music.” “Beyond the River” also gets more psychedelic, but it’s more of a minor motif than a major theme.\r\n\r\nHallowed Butchery starts off its side with a slightly faster song that’s only a mere two-and-a-half minutes. The song has a strong industrial edge, with repeating guitar and drum sounds bringing to mind big pieces of machinery clanging together and shooting off steam. Before anyone thinks there isn’t any doom going on, the song leads into closing track “Coffin Life,” which is a monstrous concept song nearing 14 minutes in length.\r\n\r\n“Coffin Life” is almost a mini-album all its own, going through many different transitions and utilizing many different styles and shifting influences. From snail’s pace plodding guitar work, to segments with acoustic guitar and melancholy clean vocals, the song goes on a huge journey that seems to tell the story of a man contemplating and then finally committing suicide. The despairing intonation of “There is nothing left for me, goodbye” followed by a cocking gun before an explosion of metal is a stellar mixing of theme with music.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the split it’s clear that Batillus has the better overall quality and sound, but Hallowed Butchery is more unique and has a wider range of musical expression, which really means they both win in different ways.

[into] the frenzied blast beats we know so well from these guys.\" But the album's emphasis on movement within the songs and within the parts makes it ultimately less dynamic and dramatic, at least on initial listens; the obvious bloodlust of Dimensional Bleedthrough comes funneled into a full assault that might be mistaken for monotony, especially compared to the latest by Brooklyn black metal brethren Liturgy.

Description by Gilead Media.\r\n\r\nBarghest and False come from drastically different worlds, and drastically different are their individual approaches to black metal. Barghest, from the swamps of Baton Rouge, LA, take the misanthropic “anti-human/anti-life” angle, delivering disgustingly abrasive, lo-fi metal. A lineup without bass, but full of unflinching aggression and thickness. False, from the frozen landscape of Minneapolis, MN, begin with a foundation of synth-tinged European black metal and compliment it with hypnotic atmosphere, creating intensely eerie music.\r\n\r\nFor all of their differences, they also share some key similarities. Each group released a debut album in 2011 with Gilead Media/Howling Mine, and both were met with overwhelmingly positive response from zines, blogs, and fans. Barghest and False also each contain an oppressive quality in their respective sounds. Believe it when I say this is not music for casual listening, in each case this is a psychological journey through a realm devoid of light or hope.\r\n\r\nBarghest offer two tracks for the split. “Shifting Sands” is one of the first songs the band ever wrote, and has only been available on a limited and long out of print split cassette with Mania, released by Woodsmoke. Although an older piece it still possesses the aesthetic Barghest solidified for themselves on their Untitled debut. “Inhuman Hatred” is a brand new song with an obvious death metal influence. It carries a greater sense of focus and purpose than the material from their full-length, without abandoning their unique style.\r\n\r\nFalse have grown in an unbelievable way since their debut 12″. Their single track on this split–”Heavy as a Church Tower”–clocks in at nearly 18 minutes, and stands as hard evidence that False are quickly becoming an undeniable force within American black metal. The ferocious intensity from their debut is amplified here, and paired with a more mature sense of mood and atmosphere. Their side of the split is very much False, evolved.\r\n\r\nReleased alongside Mirror Universe.

Jackets are Stoughton tip-on style and the album includes a 10″x10″ double sided insert with lyrics, unlike the CD version. There is also a digital download code included with every copy. Each order ships with a 1″ button.\r\n\r\nKrallice are a machine. With humble beginnings and goals, they quickly evolved into a keystone of the US black metal scene. Many will argue the genre tag, if it’s applicable to the band, if they’re truly black metal. While anyone can clearly see that Krallice are by no means a typical black metal band, it’s plain to me that they’re taking legendary genre influences and processing them through their own, unique filter with incredible results. Everyone in Krallice is at a brilliant technical musician, and their ability to write music that is hypnotic while remaining technical is something that continues to blow me away.\r\n\r\nNow, four full length albums into their life as a band, Krallice’s sound continues to evolve. They continue to fine tune and hone their style. With each release I find myself believing that new record is as tight as they could be, that it is the definition of their sound as a band. With each new recording I’m proven so very wrong.\r\n\r\nYears Past Matter strikes a different chord than Diotima did, and different even than the two first albums before that. Krallice seem to be aiming for a greater level of obscurity in their work, from production to lyrics and song titles, which have not been published prior to the release of this vinyl edition. Within the mix itself you can hear a stark difference from past albums, a move towards greater cohesiveness in their sound. This is particularly apparent in the vocals, which appear to be lower in the mix, helping to drive home the aforementioned hypnotic feel. And although Nick McMaster’s metal growls are still as prominent here as they were on Diotima, the music itself has less of the up front “metal” feel than it has in the past when Nick’s vocals were present alongside Mick Barr’s signature screams.\r\n\r\nKrallice somehow continue to become more their own band without alienating their listeners. They’re not carving a new path for others to follow, they’re building a new realm of music where they themselves will dwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":37616148,"name":"Black vinyl","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":21.0,"amount_with_others":13.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/117151914/-/relic43.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/117151914/-/relic43.jpg","width":400,"height":400}],"artists":[{"id":42541,"name":"Distro Item","permalink":"distro-item","url":"/artist/distro-item"}],"categories":[{"id":90658,"name":"LPs","permalink":"lps","url":"/category/lps"}]},{"id":11894238,"name":"Mutilation Rites - \"Empyrean\" LP (Gilead Media)","permalink":"mutilation-rites-empyrean-lp","position":18,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mutilation-rites-empyrean-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-19T22:09:13.000Z","description":"Released by Gilead Media/Prosthetic Records.

On it, they forgo ambient intros, ponderous samples, and endless riffing in favor of a tight 35 minutes that manages to feel expansive courtesy of layers of dual guitars, multiple in-song shifts, and an ongoing push and pull. It's a mix of raw black metal, dark doom, and punk that rocks, but that also offers plenty of prettier surprises. Think of late-period Darkthrone vomiting the youthful version of themselves onto the crowd at a filthy DIY space.

On ISIS’ third-full-length album, Panopticon, the unblinking eye of counter-insurgency is exposed with mesmerizing stereophonic clarity. The perpetual collapse and crush of ultra-dynamic sound-design takes on the heightened dimensions of institutionally-induced anxiety, and the carefully constructed artifice of an omniscient predatory apparatus becomes the paradigm of surveillance culture. Meanwhile, panoptic cognizance, while ostensibly the utmost of all Orwellian implications, portends to far more insidious applications: Just as hidden crosshairs hold sway over every prison yard, to see everything is to know all. With guest bass (on \"Altered Course\") by Justin Chancellor of TOOL and production courtesy of Matt Bayles (MASTODON, BOTCH, etc.), Panopticon is the pinnacle of ISIS' considerable sonic achievements to date; a sprawling epic that firmly cemented their place in underground legend the world over. This deluxe double LP features a stunning gatefold jacket and double-sided insert on thick paper stock, with different artwork than the CD version on Ipecac.

The record kicks off at a breakneck pace with a half-dozen tar-thick tracks. The fleet-fingered math of \"Triumph of Venus\" gives way to the triumphant bombast of \"Grenades\", a track that's barely finished before \"Pirhaña\"'s stop/start stomp kicks into gear. Through these six songs-- including \"Sandstorm\", \"Speed of the Nail\", and \"Healer\"-- nothing necessarily feels out of the ordinary when compared to what Torche have done in the past.\r\n\r\nThe hard left turn-- and perhaps the breaking point with \"true\" metal dudes-- comes with \"Across the Shields\", a tune that could find a nice home on modern rock radio. Musically, the group finds a comfortable middle ground between their speed trials and more turgid pace, allowing Steve Brooks' militant holler-- usually more reminiscent of Helmet's Page Hamilton-- to take on a melodic bent that could bring to mind anyone from Dave Grohl to Jawbox's J. Robbins. There's even an honest-to-goodness hook: \"I am your armor,\" Brooks sings as the guitars descend. The moment stands out due to producer (and Converge guitarist) Kurt Ballou; the crisp sheen he lends to Torche's sound makes everything stand out and shimmer.\r\n\r\nTorche follow that breakthrough with a second half that contains a quick and clean 30-second instrumental (\"Little Champion\"), more catchy hit-and-run slabs (\"Sundown\", \"Without a Sound\"), and a thunderous one-two punch (\"Amnesian\", \"Meanderthal\") to finish an album that shows Torche spreading their wings and exploring new territory while still creating their heaviest music yet. It's a fitting send-off to an absolutely killer rock record-- one that's likely to appeal to listeners into any stripe of heavy music from the past 20 years.\r\n","options":[{"id":8869231,"name":"Clear w/Green translucent","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":22.0,"amount_with_others":14.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26233895/-/torchemeand.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26233895/-/torchemeand.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[{"id":42541,"name":"Distro Item","permalink":"distro-item","url":"/artist/distro-item"}],"categories":[{"id":90658,"name":"LPs","permalink":"lps","url":"/category/lps"}]},{"id":2492941,"name":"Red Sparowes \"At the Soundless Dawn\" 2xLP (Robotic Empire)","permalink":"red-sparowes-at-the-soundless-dawn-lp","position":59,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/red-sparowes-at-the-soundless-dawn-lp","status":"sold-out","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-04-25T01:01:51.000Z","description":"The debut from this monster group containing members from greats such as Angel Hair, Isis, The VSS, Neurosis and more.
