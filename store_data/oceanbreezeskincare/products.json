They float down rivers and drift across the oceans on currents and eventually find their way to the beaches sometimes thousands of miles away from their origin.  In days past they were thought to bring good luck and fortune by the sailors who found them because of their great ability to travel long distances unharmed. They are impervious to salt water, and often float in the ocean for years at a time.\r\n\r\nAll sea beans are a little different, and each necklace is made separately.  Hamburger beans come in a variety of brown and black tones, and are approximately an inch in diameter and about a half inch thick.   Sea pearls (also called nicker beans) are most often grey, but have been found in yellow and other colors.  They are about 3/4\" in diameter.  Sea hearts are in brown tones, and can grow up to 3 inches in diameter. \r\n\r\nChoose from 4 options:  Polished hamburger bean, natural (raw, unpolished) hamburger bean, Sea Heart, or Sea Pearl.  \r\n\r\nThese beans are laced onto a simple black nylon poly cord adjustable up to 18 inches.  A silver toned eye has been drilled into the top of the seed with a silver toned ring attached.  \r\n\r\nPerfect for surfers, boaters, or anybody who loves the beach!
