Despite the fact that it's on the Hotlanta label – which cut a fair bit of club-oriented work – the record's a great batch of mid and slow tempo tracks with an excellent rootsy soul style, fantastic lyrics, and great vocals by Jimmy. The songwriting is excellent, with the kind of sophisticated yet rootsy sound that you'd get from 70s geniuses like Sam Dees or Sidney Joe Qualls.","options":[{"id":12312972,"name":"Default","price":17.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/35734710/-/DSC02411.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/35734710/-/DSC02411.jpg","width":640,"height":629}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1910457,"name":"Funk/Soul","permalink":"funk-soul","url":"/category/funk-soul"}]},{"id":3682702,"name":"The Rolling Stones: Their Satanic Majesties Request","permalink":"the-rolling-stones-their-satanic-majesties-request","position":2,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-rolling-stones-their-satanic-majesties-request","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-05-01T10:39:24.000Z","description":"Vinyl: VG+\r\nCover: VG+\r\n[Borderline NM, beautiful condition]\r\n\r\nThis is the special 100% Virgin Vinyl, Digitally Remastered from original master recordings, edition!

In contrast to its title, the album is moody and hauntingly lyrical—not entirely unlike In a Silent Way. Imagine the foreboding nature of Bitches Brew, with the primitive and funky undercurrent of On the Corner, but also with the majestic melodies of In a Silent Way cresting the surface. Plus, Big Fun is tied together by a stronger Eastern vibe than any of Davis’s other albums. Big Fun is the work of a true musical craftsman and an even truer artist.\r\n—Edwin C.

The obvious highlight, and biggest hit, here is her seductive cover of Curtis Mayfield's \"Give Me Your Love\", worth the price of admission alone.
