His one flaw is his inability to win without feeling guilty for his opponent’s loss. However, do not let his humbleness fool you. He is a champion and was a top pupil during his time at the academy. He will certainly do a fine job protecting whomever is lucky enough to enlist him as their personal ninja bodyguard.\r\n\r\nGlum Ninjas C.P.F. is a covert protection force for people who want inconspicuous protection. They disguise themselves as run-of-the-mill stuffed animals and keep a watchful eye, waiting to spring into action at the first sign of danger.\r\n\r\nGlum Ninjas are around 8 inches tall by about 7.5 inches wide and are ok for play but they are made of felt which can stretch if treated too roughly. All Glum Ninjas are named, cataloged and come with an authentic Glum Ninja coin that identifies them.","options":[{"id":30860857,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":9.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96920515/-/100_8638_-_Copy.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96920515/-/100_8638_-_Copy.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96920719/-/100_8633.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96920719/-/100_8633.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96920845/-/100_8664.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96920845/-/100_8664.JPG","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4796638,"name":"plush","permalink":"plush","url":"/category/plush"}]}]
