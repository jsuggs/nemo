Each garment will vary in tone)\r\n\r\nPrimarily used by the Vietnamese / Philippine armies, Asian Tiger camo is very rare and distinct compared to it's American issued counterpart. The main difference is found in the colors; the greens and browns are more vibrant, giving the pattern more visibility.\r\n\r\nAs part of the magma REISSUE program, these fatigues are made from 100% authentic Asian Tiger surplus, the fatigues are tailored to fit as a tapered leg.
