Upon moving to a new place, a very good friend decided to surprise her with a basket of encouragement & congratulations.  So we created a couple inspirational photo collages featuring images and quotes from King Bey herself, and mounted them in fabulous rhinestone-adorned pictures frames.  Also crafted specially for the recipient, was a dream board with another image of Bey hand-embedded in the center and surrounded by motivational words and phrases.  We also included some velvet jewelry displays to help the young designer show off her unique wares.  Finally, everything was packaged together in an adorable storage basket reminding her to \"Follow Your Dreams!\"","options":[{"id":48072090,"name":"Default","price":65.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127536747/-/IMG_1137.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127536747/-/IMG_1137.jpg","width":2448,"height":3264},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127537740/-/6876783.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127537740/-/6876783.jpg","width":930,"height":1395},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127537806/-/IMG_1131.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127537806/-/IMG_1131.jpg","width":2848,"height":2379}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2798139,"name":"Anti-Glummy","permalink":"anti-glummy","url":"/category/anti-glummy"}]},{"id":13843911,"name":"We can also make cards ...","permalink":"we-can-also-make-cards","position":3,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/we-can-also-make-cards","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-28T15:15:40.000Z","description":"If you wish, for an additional fee, we can make a handcrafted card to include in your gift too!","options":[{"id":44457192,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125012007/-/IMG_2018.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125012007/-/IMG_2018.JPG","width":2048,"height":1536},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125012013/-/IMG_2019.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125012013/-/IMG_2019.JPG","width":2048,"height":1536},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125012931/-/photo.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125012931/-/photo.JPG","width":480,"height":640}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":11137320,"name":"Baby's Shower Basket","permalink":"baby-s-shower-basket","position":4,"price":75.0,"default_price":75.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/baby-s-shower-basket","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-14T02:02:47.000Z","description":"Here's a custom basket designed for a baby shower for a client who had a set budget she wanted to spend.
