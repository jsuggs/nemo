Genuine amber drops add a special glow.  These all dangle from vintage lucite roses.  I rarely use lucite but if they are old, very special, glass-like, and without obvious seams then I consider them.  These beautiful old roses are divine and keep this earring on the lightweight side.\r\n\r\nThe chain is brass and the earwires are hand forged brass.\r\n\r\nI guarantee all of my work.
