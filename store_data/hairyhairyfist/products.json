Tigers definitely would have fitted in well in the mid 90&#8217;s San Diego scene but we are stuck with them in this day and age and will just have to suck it up. Originally planned to be a one-sided 33rpm record, we pressed this baby on both sides, 45rpm, to accentuate the audio quality for the audiophiles of the world. Tigers, on this LP, bring vehemence, intelligence and sexuality together which was pressed on 200 pink and pee-pee coloured records. The band also hand screened Liam Sparkes of Trencher&#8217;s cover art for you. The three different versions of the tour covers sold out but we are making the last 50 covers now. On sale very soon.\n\n","options":[{"id":17172,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/9808/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/9808/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":281,"name":"Tigers","permalink":"tigers","url":"/artist/tigers"}],"categories":[{"id":9342,"name":"Records","permalink":"records","url":"/category/records"}]},{"id":5275,"name":"Tera:Tora \"Style\" 7\" Single","permalink":"tera-tora-style-7-single","position":3,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tera-tora-style-7-single","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2006-10-01T01:53:13.000Z","description":"This is the first and only record that the now defunct new-wavers Tera:Tora released as well as being the first release from Hairy, Hairy Fist. The two-track limited 7&#8221; gave hope to the British music scene until the band mysteriously split. The short-lived off-the-wall party band were comprised of members of Death Of Love and the cult-band, The Murder Of Rosa Luxemburg. Members of Tera:Tora later went on to form acts such as Kamikazee and Lovvers. Recording and production credits go to Test Icicles&#8217; Sam Mehran. This is a &#8220;must have&#8221; for fans of Gang Of Four, Joy Division and beautifully packaged vinyl. 400 were made on grey vinyl with black splatter and 100 on transparent vinyl with black splatter. Don&#8217;t expect a repress.\n\n\tItem will be on sale online as soon as the shipping costs are calculated.\n\n","options":[{"id":17167,"name":"Default","price":3.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/9805/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/9805/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":280,"name":"Tera:Tora","permalink":"tera-tora","url":"/artist/tera-tora"}],"categories":[{"id":9342,"name":"Records","permalink":"records","url":"/category/records"}]}]
