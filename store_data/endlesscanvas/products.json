They were writing out \"DAMN BEAVERS!\" in a clean hand style with a fat cap and it made me crack up and reminded me of cartoons from my childhood.  Then I saw BVRS character and it forever burned into my mind.  Soon after I started noticing that Beaver face on rooftops in San Francisco.  This past year BVRS teamed up with JAUT CARES (who paints the bicycle character) and they have been relentlessly bombing San Francisco ever since.

In certain lighting it looks like solid black and red and in other lighting you can see all the graffiti in the background.\r\n\r\nSelf hand drew the fist, then we took photos of his graffiti on the street and patterned the background of the poster to create an interesting texture.
