The sound is exactly the same, but the artwork looks better.","options":[{"id":696405,"name":"Default","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/97528267/-/kd-small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/97528267/-/kd-small.jpg","width":988,"height":988}],"artists":[{"id":4414,"name":"Kevin Drumm","permalink":"kevin-drumm","url":"/artist/kevin-drumm"}],"categories":[{"id":55463,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":157347,"name":"Niger - Demow CDR","permalink":"ni9er-demow-cdr","position":22,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ni9er-demow-cdr","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-09-25T13:45:07.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":715559,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/97528219/-/SL10-small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/97528219/-/SL10-small.jpg","width":988,"height":988}],"artists":[{"id":1674,"name":"Nondor Nevai","permalink":"nondor-nevai","url":"/artist/nondor-nevai"}],"categories":[{"id":81911,"name":"CDRs","permalink":"cdrs","url":"/category/cdrs"},{"id":55463,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
