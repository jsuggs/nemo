Unfortunately, for NASA, this goal is scarcely even addressed and the book focuses more on extramarital affairs, bank robing owls, big gross swollen heads, ghost cow heads, olde tyme boxers, tigers eating cheeseburgers in the Crab Nebula, buffalo judges and tons of aggressive swearing. Not as much a superhero book as it is a parody of basically everything and a celebration of weird that is jam-packed with references to Robo-Cop and Die Hard.\"\r\n\r\n177 pages\r\nHardcover with gloss finish\r\n7\"x10.5\"","options":[{"id":42174342,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.75,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123386685/-/2013-02-23-god_hates_astronauts_02.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123386685/-/2013-02-23-god_hates_astronauts_02.jpg","width":533,"height":376},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123386781/-/Sir_Hippothesis_cody_schibi_god_hates_astronauts_ryan_browne.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123386781/-/Sir_Hippothesis_cody_schibi_god_hates_astronauts_ryan_browne.jpg","width":421,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123386793/-/cody_schibi_god_hates_astronauts_ghs_image_sir_hippothesis.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123386793/-/cody_schibi_god_hates_astronauts_ghs_image_sir_hippothesis.jpg","width":612,"height":481},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123386865/-/0a9c931d082c81fcc56b97a682e503f1_large.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123386865/-/0a9c931d082c81fcc56b97a682e503f1_large.jpg","width":700,"height":266}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2620419,"name":"Art Books","permalink":"art-books","url":"/category/art-books"}]},{"id":11589408,"name":"HOLLISTON \"Characters\" T-Shirt","permalink":"holliston-characters-t-shirt","position":31,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/holliston-characters-t-shirt","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-05T06:54:19.000Z","description":"<b>HOLLISTON \"Characters\" T-Shirt by Cody Schibi</b>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://goodsie.com/store/ariescopemerchandise/holliston-characters-t-shirt\">I'm not personally selling these shirts, but wanted to provide a link to Ariescope's online store so you guys can purchase them!
