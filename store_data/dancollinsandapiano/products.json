Dan began writing the first track for \"SLD\" on December 23rd, 2010 and finished recording the final track on January 11th, 2011.  In less than three weeks, Collins applied his knowledge in piano, drum set, and vocal music to seven unique tracks.  Rightfully, the album is a tribute to the lifetime of music education Collins has received.  Song topics range from angst and unease to love and discord, each with its own corresponding melodic and harmonic backstory.

During this eight month span of writing and recording his stories, dreams, and new episodes, fresh sounds emerged.  \r\n\r\nRigged with a new setup, and all by his lonesome, Dan developed 13 tracks, totaling over an hour of music, for all ears to consume.  From up-tempo tracks like “Take On The World” and “Dormitory”, to slow, personally laden tracks like “The Fourth Of July” and “Lullaby For The Patients and The Patience”, Collins and his piano have made one giant leap in music.  \r\n\r\nThe album is also available on iTunes, Amazon.com, and Rhapsody.com.\r\n\r\nFor more, visit Dan Collins and a Piano on Facebook @ http://www.facebook.com/dancollinsandapiano or on Myspace at www.myspace.com/dancollinsandapiano.","options":[{"id":1521171,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3008170/-/Album_Cover_Official_low_qual.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3008170/-/Album_Cover_Official_low_qual.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":301754,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
