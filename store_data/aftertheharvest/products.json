Drink. Connect. is a coffee table book born from my blog of the same name. It doesn't actually turn into a coffee table, but it is a great gift, especially for food lovers! \r\n\r\nThe book is a mixture of original photos, fiction, travel writing, recipes, wine pairings and entertaining tips. I was inspired by my travels, the people I've had the good fortune to eat and drink with, and my family dining experiences.\r\n\r\nI hope you find something in this book that you can relate to â€”something that brings back fond food memories or inspires new culinary adventures.
