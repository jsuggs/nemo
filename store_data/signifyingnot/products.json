It comes set in a .75\"x.50\" brass pendant with an antique/aged look.  \r\n\r\nFollowing France's \"Reign of Terror\", those who narrowly escaped the guillotine as well as the relatives of those who weren't so lucky wore red ribbons around their neck at what would have been the point of impact with the blade.  This image of a beheaded woman hangs from a red velvet ribbon that recalls this tradition.\r\n\r\nThe image inside has been treated to give it an antique/aged to match.  A layer of resin is set on top to protect and seal the image within the pendant.\r\n\r\nThese medals are a unique and fun accessory to add to any outfit – shirts, vests, jackets, everything!  The pin clasp on the back makes it easy to wear securely anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe medal measures approximately 4 inches from top to bottom.  \r\n\r\nPlease note that your medal may look slightly different than the one pictured.
