The silver is oxidised, then the surface of the moonrock is polished back to bright, leaving the craters contrasting. The bands are left black and buffed to shininess, like coal.\r\n\r\nVery pretty and delicate - the set pictured in the picture below is my own in a size 6 (I have big hands ;)\r\n\r\nI make these to order in your size - let me know on purchase what size you would like. They will take up to 3-4 days to make for you depending on how busy I am.\r\n\r\nAll metal is sterling silver or 9 carat gold; all solder is hallmark quality.\r\n\r\n***********************\r\n\r\nAll my jewellery is thoroughly cleaned after polishing. It is also guaranteed - I will refund, remake or replace it in the unlikely event that it is flawed.
