If you don't know him, look him up! This shirt, while heavily influenced by Nudie's creativity, is entirely original Kari Workman artwork, along with some help from the Garage Ts guys. Complete with mother pearl snaps, rhinestones and all the rest. The images on the shoulders are of a yucca (left) and a Bitterroot. Two stunning examples of the plant life here in the west. The back features an eagle, spread-winged and in flight.\r\n\r\nThese shirts will see their official release on 12/14/13, Saturday, but until then, we're taking pre-orders. We expect the first batch to move quickly.\r\n\r\nPrinted in Montana on American-made, American Apparel shirts. 50/50 Cotton Poly. We printed unisex, which should be true to size for men, and women typically should order a size smaller than their normal shirt size.","options":[{"id":50488728,"name":"Unisex Small","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50488800,"name":"Unisex Medium","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50488803,"name":"Unisex Large","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50488806,"name":"Unisex XL","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129359796/-/Western_Front.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129359796/-/Western_Front.jpg","width":1440,"height":1440},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129359799/-/Western_Back.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129359799/-/Western_Back.jpg","width":570,"height":570},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129304098/-/unnamed.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129304098/-/unnamed.jpg","width":1166,"height":1099}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1141131,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":15290550,"name":"NEW: Montana Coat of Arms ","permalink":"new-montana-coat-of-arms","position":2,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/new-montana-coat-of-arms","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-12-03T04:45:57.000Z","description":"We released this design last year for the kids and OH MY was it popular with the adults.

You'll need to look elsewhere for expertise on the subject, but we at Statriot have always been fans of the less symmetrical, the less perfect in everything. And thus this design here, the Atypical Muley. Released in late summer 2013, this design features a collaboration between Missoula artist Kari Workman and the Statriot team. Kari drew the deer, we laid out the type, messed around with the state outline and picked the colors. \r\n\r\nPrinted on American Apparel 50/50 cotton-poly blend, Heather Lake Blue shirts in Montana, U.S.","options":[{"id":42783474,"name":"Women's Small","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":42783471,"name":"Women's Medium","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":42783468,"name":"Women's Large","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44743665,"name":"Women's XL","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":42783486,"name":"Men's Small","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":42783483,"name":"Men's Medium","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":42783480,"name":"Men's Large","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":42783477,"name":"Men's XL","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":44743668,"name":"Men's XXL","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123814944/-/IMG_7188.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123814944/-/IMG_7188.JPG","width":1440,"height":1440},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123816009/-/AM.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123816009/-/AM.jpg","width":1440,"height":1440}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1141131,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":5652061,"name":"Moose: Monfuckintana","permalink":"monfuckintana-moose","position":10,"price":22.0,"default_price":22.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/monfuckintana-moose","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-03-09T07:06:38.000Z","description":"The ol' super-paddled, long-legged wanderer of the woods and bogs is a pretty excellent example of adaptation and the impressive way ol' Ma Nature has of figuring things out.

Did you know that Kitt Kourage is allergic (he thinks) to turkeys?\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for this shirt comes from one our big inspirations, Aimee McQ., Betty’s Divine’s owner. Aimee’s shop sells more Statriot gear than anywhere, and we’d wanted to do a new design specifically with Betty’s in mind.
