artists did paint their own Danaë. So this vivid red hair one is Troitiño's Danaë paint.<br><br></p>\r\n\r\n<h1>About Danaë Mythology:</h1><br>\r\n<p>\r\nIn Greek mythology, Danaë (/ˈdæn.eɪ.iː/ or /ˈdæn.i.iː/;[1] Ancient Greek: Δανάη) was a daughter of King Acrisius of Argos and his wife Queen Eurydice. She was the mother of Perseus by Zeus. She was sometimes credited with founding the city of Ardea in Latium.\r\nDisappointed by his lack of male heirs, Acrisius asked an oracle if this would change. The oracle told him that he would be killed by his daughter's son. She was childless and, meaning to keep her so, he shut her up in a bronze tower or cave. But Zeus came to her in the form of golden rain, and impregnated her. Soon after, their child Perseus was born.<br><br>\r\nUnwilling to provoke the wrath of the gods by killing his offspring, Acrisius cast Danaë and Perseus into the sea in a wooden chest. The sea was calmed by Poseidon and at the request of Zeus the pair survived. They washed ashore on the island of Seriphos, where they were taken in by Dictys - the brother of King Polydectes - who raised Perseus to manhood. The King was charmed by Danaë but she had no interest in him. Consequently he agreed not to marry her only if her son would travel to the foreign land of the Grey Ladies and slay the hideous Gorgon Medusa. With the use of Athena's shield, he was able to evade her gaze and eventually kill her.<br><br>\r\nLater, after Perseus killed Medusa and rescued Andromeda, the oracle's prophecy came true. He started for Argos, but learning of the prophecy instead went to Larissa, where athletic games were being held. By chance, an aging Acrisius was there and Perseus accidentally struck him on the head with his javelin (or discus), fulfilling the prophecy. Too shamed to return to Argos he then gave the kingdom to Megapenthes, son of Proetus (Acrisius' brother) and took over his kingdom of Tiryns, also founding Mycenae and Midea there.<br><br>\r\nAnother version states that Perseus was angry that he had been sent on a seemingly impossible quest to kill Medusa so that his mother, Danaë, was alone to be pursued by King Polydectes. Perseus took out Medusa's head from a sack and turned Polydectes to stone.</p>","options":[{"id":42648852,"name":"29,7x42cm (21x29,1cm printed

pretty girl who was dressing a big beach hat. It was in Es Trec beach in Mallorca island in the Mediterranean Sea. The original piece was given away to some one on the streets of Barcelona after the exhibition. Yes, the original paint 40,2x30cm, made with acrylics and really small hand cut stencils over paperboard was randomly given after the show. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe collective exhibition, named Paper Girls, had de objective of sharing art on streets as would be news papers (making art going to the people {for free} and not people going to the art). Anyway, Troito has NO news from who own the original one!</p>","options":[{"id":42597108,"name":"30x25cm (20x15cm printed area)","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123677484/-/Untitled-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123677484/-/Untitled-2.jpg","width":507,"height":507},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123677502/-/Untitled-1_borda.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123677502/-/Untitled-1_borda.jpg","width":850,"height":715},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123677523/-/Untitled-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123677523/-/Untitled-1.jpg","width":567,"height":432}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6092409,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]}]
