Whether it’s your first time or second (or third/fourth or more), documenting this holiday season makes it so much more special. What’s super neat about this concept is you get to look back on this book in the new year or years later and get to reminisce about each memory. A definite treasure for you and your family. \r\n\r\nThis kit is perfect for those of you who want to document your holidays but don’t want to spend a lot of time in putting together a book. I’ve done the design and “hard work” so all that’s left is the fun & play for you:). These journals have sold out the last 3 years so don't hesitate and get yours today! \r\n\r\nThe journal is approximately 6\"x9\" in size and made with various vintage, found, specialty and new Echo Park papers, clear overlays and fabric sample piece. Book is bound together with thick thread. Just simply loop the 2 - 1 1/2\" binder rings through the holes before cutting the thread. There are 9 unique pages that are especially handmade for this journal. They include a hand sewn transparency pocket, a hand sewn tag on Braille paper, a glimmer mist sprayed cardstock sheet, another glimmer mist sprayed cardstock pocket, a handsewn paper doilie on vintage dictionary page and more. \r\n\r\nAlter this journal by using paint, handsewing and other techniques to make it uniquely yours. There are a total of 25+ unique sheets so that you can journal all the way through to January if you choose. You can use this art journal as a recording of your daily happenings for the month of December or you could use the journaling prompts as a starting point and make up your own as you go. \r\n\r\nKit also includes a half sheet of Echo Park Elements stickers (cut into 2 parts for shipping reasons), either small EP alphabet stickers with element stickers or larger alphabet sticker set, a special set of Evalicious Joy stickers and a baggie filled with Evalicious and Echo Park tags, Evalicious felt tab, crocheted flower, washi tape sample pieces, blank quote bubbles, Jenni Bowlin printed ticket, blank tickets (4 large, 2 small), 2 glitter foam stickers, ribbon pieces & buttons. Please note that kit pieces may vary slightly from what is shown. \r\n\r\nSome items that you'll need to gather from your stash to get started with your art journal include: black permanent journaling pen (I use Sakura Microperm), scissors, double sided tape, Glue Dots, masking tape, scrap cardstock (for journaling on and cutting out into strips), stapler, photos, paper trimmer, post it notes (for writing brief journaling notes/ideas on and sticking it to your book so that you can work on it later), acrylic paint (white and other colours of your choice), paint brush from dollar store, needle with embroidery floss, hole punch (2 hole or handheld).\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: kit does not come with a PDF file - just a printout that will be included in the kit. Also some items in your kit may not be exactly as shown in photos.\n","options":[{"id":14970241,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.25,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":21.0,"amount_with_others":17.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/44788387/-/jingle_all_the_way_art_journal_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/44788387/-/jingle_all_the_way_art_journal_1.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/44788403/-/jingle_all_the_way_art_journal_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/44788403/-/jingle_all_the_way_art_journal_2.jpg","width":1000,"height":780},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/44788411/-/jingle_all_the_way_art_journal_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/44788411/-/jingle_all_the_way_art_journal_3.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/44788419/-/jingle_all_the_way_art_journal_4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/44788419/-/jingle_all_the_way_art_journal_4.jpg","width":1000,"height":998},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/44961867/-/joy_stickers_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/44961867/-/joy_stickers_1.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":320462,"name":"Art Journals","permalink":"art-journals","url":"/category/art-journals"},{"id":320301,"name":"kits","permalink":"kits","url":"/category/kits"},{"id":2767697,"name":"on sale","permalink":"on-sale","url":"/category/on-sale"}]},{"id":4574225,"name":"joy stickers","permalink":"joy-stickers","position":227,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/joy-stickers","status":"sold-out","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-10-06T02:38:31.000Z","description":"Use these stickers in your christmas projects and make them stand out without overwhelming the other elements. \r\n\r\nThese cute stickers are approximately one inch in diameter, feature felt, pretty patterned paper, transparency & glitter cardstock and even 2 mini flatback buttons.

price = $25\r\n\r\nUse this art journal to record your daily thoughts, lists, doodles or whatever - it's super easy! It's perfect to record down all the little daily happenings without feeling overwhelmed by a large blank canvas. \r\n\r\nThis little cutie is similar to my slightly larger art journals - it consists of 25+ pages of found, vintage, upcycle and patterned papers, wood veneer, transparency, Pretty Little Studio vintage cards and bracket, etc. that are of various size and texture. Only difference is the size is approximately 4\"x6\" making it even easier to work with. And each page has a lot more work done to it - they've been sewn on, embellished, altered, etc. This book is also perfect for you to use with your already existing scrap stash if you choose. Or just simply pull out the basics like double sided tape, journaling pen, scrap white cardstock/notebook paper, masking tape, your fave rubber stamps, scissors, etc. \r\n\r\nEach little journal comes with some sample strips of Japanese masking tape, a crocheted flower and special Evalicious today flower.\r\n\r\nNOTE: certain items in kits will differ slightly to what is shown (for ex. the overlay flourish on the front cover and the paper flower colour on the Evalicious today flower)\r\n\r\nPlease visit: http://www.flickr.com/photos/evalicious/sets/72157624796715143/\r\nto see the pages of my book.
