This jeweltree is a stylish way of displaying your earrings, rings, and other sparklies on your dresser or tabletop.\n\n\tIf you&#8217;re like me, sometimes jewelry is stashed away to be lost in the dark corners of a jewel box or drawer, never to see the light of day for weeks or months <del>- or heaven forbid -</del> you forget you even had them! This cute tree helps you to eliminate that problem in an organic, unconventional, and stylish display.\n\n\tThe tree is created with copper wire twisted by hand and worked into 21 separate &#8220;leaves&#8221; from which to hang your sparklies. This tree is solidly &#8220;planted&#8221; in a green ceramic pot and smooth river stones.\n\n\tIt stands approximately 12 inches tall and accented with a light blue and green bow for extra cuteness. (The bow can be removed if ribbons are not your thing.)\n\n\tPick one up from my garden today!\n\n\t[Please note: earrings in the photo are not included.]\n\n","options":[{"id":372131,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/162391/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/162391/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
