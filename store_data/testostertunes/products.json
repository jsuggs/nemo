For twisted ears only.\r\n\r\nA slight return to the red-hot, fried and twisted garage/psych/punk blasts we’ve come to expect from MIKE POLIZZE’s PURLING HISS. He’s way off the leash on this one, up Hiss creek with nobody to paddle home. Recorded in various Philadelphia-area basements and men’s rooms over the course of 2007-11, the sessions were stunted and aborted as each successive borrowed practice amp blew smoke and crapped out under the strain of Polizze’s fiery fret work. Originally a cassette-only release, but just about every tape was quickly scattered and smashed along the Schuykill Expressway after being left on the roof of the tour van.

From the tremendous early Siltbreeze singles to the magnificent Omphalos full-lengths, the galaxy and beyond were charmed by their wayward off-kilter pre/post-skiffle, pre/post-psychedelic, and pre/post-punk avant pop.  Bob Malloy crafted swaying bizarre stories & fables in a fake British accent as convincing as a perfectly fitting Toupée. But aside from 2002's unsung and virtually unheard Third Kingdom, all has been seemingly quiet in Fieldhands land.  But aha! They've only been slumbering, laying in wait writing and recording.\r\nWhich brings us here.  Two brand new songs.  One is a lively and scrappy, yet wistful anthem, perfect for hoisting a pint with the lads.  The other is a tender Ray Davies-ian ballad about a bearded lady.  Hey, you're the one who asked!

Reckless & tuneful hard-driving guitar fury custom built for those dissatisfied with the attack found on Raw Power.\r\n\r\nIt’s two sides of hi-energy psychedelic punk rock & roll that manages to weld Funhouse‘s dialed-in sleaze rhythms to the hungover excess of Hendrix at Woodstock. Or Ginn at Polliwog Park. It’s full of clanging cymbals, howling vocals, fretboard heroics, and menacing vibes. \r\nPurling Hiss is the work of a well-mannered longhair named Mike Polizze, who is best known for his reckless shredding as the guitar player for Philadelphia’s BIRDS OF MAYA. Hissteria is a suitable soundtrack for zonked drives across the dead highways of the USA. Or for predawn paranoid sessions as you pace back and forth in the kitchen trying figure out just what the hell you’re going to do, man.\r\nOr just crank it real loud when the party gets strange. Some people will love it and the rest of them can just go somewhere else and go fuck themselves.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F18817792&show_artwork=true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n\"Polizze has gotten a good handle on several forms of rock and psychedelia – budget glam, hoarse whiskey howl, space flash guitar, carpal tunnel inducing bar room prog moves, hair metal, PCP strobing, and the common sense to extend these concepts way the fuck out.\" -Still Single\r\n\r\n\"There’s absolutely nothing subtle or timid about Hissteria, but it’s far from joyless guitar-punk nihilism. This is a muscle-car cruising record par excellence that, behind the lo-fi barrage, swings and shimmies like a killer Creedence single. It makes about 90 percent of the last year’s rock ’n’ roll sound about as exciting as a wet ramen noodle on Wonder bread.\" -Charles Saufley in Premier Guitar Mag","options":[{"id":30496964,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95759435/-/tumblr_lgbj0iYu8I1qbo7i1o1_500.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95759435/-/tumblr_lgbj0iYu8I1qbo7i1o1_500.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95759591/-/tumblr_lgbizhz1lj1qbo7i1o1_500.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95759591/-/tumblr_lgbizhz1lj1qbo7i1o1_500.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95759999/-/0.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95759999/-/0.jpeg","width":456,"height":442}],"artists":[{"id":181295,"name":"PURLING HISS","permalink":"purling-hiss","url":"/artist/purling-hiss"}],"categories":[{"id":4047225,"name":"vinyl record","permalink":"vinyl-record","url":"/category/vinyl-record"}]},{"id":13606602,"name":"STRAPPING FIELDHANDS -- Discus CD","permalink":"strapping-fieldhands-discus-cd","position":5,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/strapping-fieldhands-discus-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-16T22:52:15.000Z","description":"Essential music for the discerning listener.

Richie Records steps up to the plate with Printed Gold, a quick three tracks of Taco Leg’s signature “Eddy Current Jr.” punk rock style. They look like little boys on stage, and that sort of naivete comes through their innocent rock songs – they just use guitar, drums and vocals to write these concise tunes that don’t seem as though they were created for mass consumption. That’s certainly their charm. The two on the a-side sound a little more serious and/or depressing than what I’ve heard in the past, though – maybe they’re growing up? They cover Fang’s “The Money Will Roll Right In” on the flip, and anyone dabbling with Fang clearly has a few ghosts in the attic to work out, so who knows, maybe they’re just growing up and meeting the wrong people.

The flip side is A Handy Magician, originally infamously issued as a cassette in 2004 or so.

Oddly pleasant singing, in-the-red fingerpicking, twisting swells of feedback, totally pounding drums, and Kraut-like zen fill both sides of this record.

Recorded in 2005 & a different, earlier recording of \"Early Man\" than the neutered version that ended up on Nevermind...\r\n\r\nSome CLOCKCLEANER clowns went on to things like VIOLENT STUDENTS, WATERY LOVE, & PUERTO RICO FLOWERS\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/XMtyznGoJGU?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n“Sexy new platter from Philadelphia's only punk band. Yes, that A-Side is a cover of the Remo Voor tune. And they do wonders with it. It's not slathered in distortion and scuzz-bass as you might expect. No, it's more subtle, like a really muscular group finessing their way through a pop song. Still quite brassy, a little awkward at moments, yet very tastefully done. It's actually quite magical. You'll also be surprised to hear JOHN-JOHN actually sings a little bit on this one. On the flip side, fuck, it's back to business. ‘Early Man’ is a stunner reprised from the full length and features these three savages flinging shit at the walls of their cave, drenched in delay and blood. Once again Clockcleaner proves why they are the highest paid touring band on the circuit. Scums stats: only a few, make sure to buy in bulk. Ask for the limited Richard Charles Jr. signature model.”—Terminal Boredom\r\n\r\n\"There's something perfect about Clockcleaner existing in the USofA in 2007. Their antagonistic stage presence is genuinely terrifying. In a time when metalheads are turning around and falling into their amps and most noise acts have lost all semblance of performance whatsoever, Clockcleaner's display of psychosis channels equal parts wicked humor and fear. In a perfect world, Clockcleaner have no influences; every band which came before them are shit. In reality, they're three sweet people who share a love for those nasty creases of the 80's where an underground could only see the world in decay: East coast hardcore-metal (Cro-Mags, GG) and Texas noise-rock (Buttholes, Scratch Acid), mainly.\r\nStill, amidst all this mean-spiritedness they retain a strong sense of melody and even (pop) structure, best exemplefied on \"Frogrammer\", where the band play a fairly straight cover (little to no effects) of Remo Voor's KBD classic. Sharkey sounds really different on the track - nervous and jittery rather than his usual aggro style. More Roky Erickson than Will Shatter for sure. The song is catchy as can be and Clockcleaner weird it up just enough to make it their own. Great choice.\r\n\"Early Man\" brings it back home to the mid-paced grime of the Missing Dick 7'' tracks (both 7''s were pulled from the same 2005 session). Vocals drenched in reverb, guitars like the brainwaves of an electro-shocked monkey and the thickest rhythm section (Karen, bass, and Richie, drums) in the Eastern Seaboard. As with many Clockcleaner tracks, the song ends with Sharkey molesting the mic with wails and screams as if his toenails were being removed one by one.\"","options":[{"id":31026874,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/97446559/-/frogrammer.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/97446559/-/frogrammer.jpg","width":630,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/97447159/-/IMG_20130313_183708_zps2272f501.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/97447159/-/IMG_20130313_183708_zps2272f501.jpg","width":1000,"height":491}],"artists":[{"id":184153,"name":"CLOCKCLEANER","permalink":"clockcleaner","url":"/artist/clockcleaner"}],"categories":[{"id":4047225,"name":"vinyl record","permalink":"vinyl-record","url":"/category/vinyl-record"}]}]
