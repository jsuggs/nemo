I like how the figures in the tunnel are almost silhouetted in front of the bright light that is penetrating the other opening to the tunnel. This gives this image an almost spooky, and slightly ghostly feeling.

If you look closely you can see that I captured a small bubble just as it escaped the model's mouth, this is great because it reminds the viewer that the model is under water and it almost looks like a pearl sitting on his lip.

I took the photo with a vintage black and white film camera. It is one of my favourites photos that I have taken. The composition is a satisfying balance of high contrast blocks of black and white. This gives the image a powerful aura and makes the viewer feel a combination of power and stability.
