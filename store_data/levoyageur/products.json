This type of folk art doll became popular in Hawaii in the 1940's as a souvenir for servicemen to send back home to their loved ones.\r\n\r\nThis Hawaiian Folk art doll is named after a god \"Lono\" from Hawaiian mythology.\r\n\r\nLono is the Hawaiian god of music, peace, fertility, agriculture, and rainfall.  In Lono's honor, an annual festival called Makahiki was held.  During the Makahiki season (October to February) war and unnecessary work were kapu (forbidden).  In one of the many Hawaiian legends of Lono it says that he descended to Earth on a rainbow to marry his love \"Laka\".\r\n\r\nApproximate measurement in millimeters (Height): \r\nExcluding the key ring - 68mm\r\nTotal height (including the key ring - 130mm\r\n\r\nHand crafted in Hawaii.\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\n\r\nWe currently ship to the following countries:\r\n\r\nAustralia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Netherlands, Switzerland, Taiwan, and United Kingdom\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\n\r\n***About Shipping Charges***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDear customer,\r\n\r\nWhen you are ready to check out, please select the country that you want the order to be shipped to.
