I have been working from observations that I have taken in the form of photographs and drawings from our wonderful Cornish hedgerows with an influence of 50's design from such people as Lucienne Day and more recently Angie Lewin, their work is so inspirational. The colours for this cushion were accidentally pulled out of the fleece bag together and they reminded me of a childhood book of verse that had the most wonderful whimsical illustrations. All of this inspired this original and unique design.","options":[{"id":32023126,"name":"14x20''","price":58.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":32023129,"name":"Linen and zip back","price":58.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100557271/-/IMG_2485.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100557271/-/IMG_2485.JPG","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2881775,"name":"Cushions","permalink":"cushions","url":"/category/cushions"}]}]
