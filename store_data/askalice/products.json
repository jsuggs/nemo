We hand picked a selection of incredible artists from all over the world and many different backgrounds to generously contribute to \"Wish You Were Here\" with a mind to illustrating their favourite city.  The calendar is a colourful vision of a rich and joyful world in which boarders are dissolved. \r\n\r\nArtworks include Cape Town by Studio Muti, Sydney by James Gulliver Hancock, Barcelona by Lydia Nichols, Delhi by Owen Gatley, Amsterdam by Lotta Nieminen, Montevideo by Martin Azambuja, Brighton by Ryan Gillett, Mykonos by Matt Chase, Copenhagen by Michelle Carlslund, Helsinki by Blanca GÃ³mez, New York by Nicholas Girling and Tokyo by Masako Kubo.\r\n\r\nSize: 19cm x 30cm\r\n\r\nPlease note that as this item is a charity project, we are doing everything we can to maximise our donation to the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. We have therefore chosen to charge $3 postage for our Australian customers.
