It's a classic, and everyone knows the verses...some of us by heart! I wanted to make a perfume set to celebrate this great story, and after many months of trial and error, I have 3 scents based on text from the story that are very unique - Sugar Plum Visions, New Fallen Snow and Ashes and Soot.\r\n\r\nSugar Plum Visions is just as sweet as it sounds (and tastes). Copaiba balsam, fig, plum and almond are in a jojoba oil base, and they smell good enough to eat (but don't, please).\r\n\r\nNew Fallen Snow features patchouli, clary sage, cornmint, siberian fir, balsam gurjun and peppermint in a jojoba oil base, and it's delightfully refreshing.\r\n\r\nAshes & Soot contains petitgrain, cade, muhuhu, vetiver, vanilla and tobacco diluted with jojoba oil, and it's my favorite. It smells just like a cold fireplace.\r\n\r\nYou get all 3 in this set, but don't wait - it's only offered in November and December!\r\n\r\n++++++++++++\r\n\r\nThis is my full size roll on - 1/6 oz. It's the perfect size to toss into your purse or slip into your pocket. I do not use the 1/3 oz because - if you're like me and love perfume - you end up with a handful, and then it takes forever to use them up. I use glass vials and bottles for all of my blends, so you don't have to worry about the toxins that leach from plastic.\r\n\r\nThese roll ons are shipped in tiny boxes and then carefully wrapped in black tissue paper before being mailed in padded envelopes.\r\n\r\n++++++++++++\r\n\r\nWant to use the scent for something other than perfume? Try putting some on a small piece of cloth and placing in the dryer, adding to a scent ring for light bulbs, freshening old potpourri or saturating a cotton ball and placing randomly in your home. And that's just to start!\r\n\r\n++++++++++++\r\n\r\nI use a mixture of essential oils, flavor oils, CO2s and macerations. No synthetic fragrances, nature identicals, solvents or alcohols have been used to produce any of the oils, and all sources are natural or organic. I started these blends because I had been researching perfumes for my health blog, and I just couldn't believe what I was finding as far as ingredients in regular perfumes and so-called natural/organic ones. I am very picky and selective about what I use for these, and I want them to be as natural as possible.\r\n\r\nEssential oil prices are quite fickle, as you know, so the price of each blend is based on the cost of my current stock. The prices of the samples and 1/6 oz vials are subject to change based on future market prices.\r\n\r\n** Keep in mind that just because the oils are essential or natural doesn’t mean you won’t have an allergic reaction if you’re prone to such – always try on a small area of skin first. Oils are toxic if taken internally, & you should avoid if you’re pregnant. Always keep oil blends away from children, pets & flammable objects. **\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nMake sure to FAVORITE my shop because I offer monthly specials and coupon codes! And ALWAYS check my shop announcement on the main page before making your purchase to see if there is a coupon code available!\r\n\r\nWith every order from my shop, you'll receive a free magnet and scent card that features one of my herbal oil infusions plus a small flyer that tells you a little about me (and don't forget to use the coupon code mentioned in the flyer towards your next order).\r\n\r\nYour satisfaction is VERY important to me.
