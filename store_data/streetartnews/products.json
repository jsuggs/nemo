The Special edition is released to coincide with 2013's last New Moon, December 2nd - 5:22:19 PM MST (Mountain Standard Time)\r\n\r\nThis artwork was inspired by the german theologian Rudolf Otto, referencing his analysis of the spiritual experience that, in his view, underlies all belief in deities, the supernatural, the sacred, the holy and transcendent. \r\nHe calls this experience \"numinous,\" and designated the Latin phrase: mysterium tremendum et fascinans.\r\nThe numinous is \"wholly other\"-- entirely different from anything we experience in ordinary life. \r\nIt evokes a reaction of silence. But the numinous is also a mysterium tremendum which is the tendency to invoke fear and trembling with its overwhelming power. \r\nFinally, the numinous presents itself as fascinans, merciful and gracious with a tendency to attract, fascinate and compel. -- Faith47","options":[{"id":49630050,"name":"Default","price":179.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128661165/-/streetartnews_faith47_print-10.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128661165/-/streetartnews_faith47_print-10.jpg","width":1500,"height":1500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128661174/-/IMG_8656.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128661174/-/IMG_8656.jpg","width":3482,"height":2076},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128661234/-/streetartnews_faith47_print-11.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128661234/-/streetartnews_faith47_print-11.jpg","width":1500,"height":2000}],"artists":[{"id":218427,"name":"Faith47","permalink":"faith47","url":"/artist/faith47"}],"categories":[{"id":5745735,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":14706654,"name":"2501 \"Hayagriva\"","permalink":"2501-hayagriva","position":9,"price":89.99,"default_price":89.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/2501-hayagriva","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-08T10:19:17.000Z","description":"2501\r\n\"Hayagriva\"\r\nEdition: 35\r\nSize: 50 x 70 cm\r\nOne Layer Screen-print on Somerset paper.\r\nHand Finished With Spray Paint and Ink.\r\nSigned And Numbered.\r\n\r\n2501 returns for his second print with us after his first was a quick sell-out.

Unlike many street artists he has a formal background in art studying at the Academy of Fine Arts in Valencia, where he obtained his degree. His style is influenced by past painters such as Joaquin Sorolla and Salvador Dali as well as more current artists like Ron English and Takashi Murakami. His love for graffiti has taken him all around the world where he's painted huge robot-filled murals in places like Paris, Amsterdam and Warsaw. A rising star in the street art scene, he's definitely one to watch.\r\n\r\nMen: Fruit Of The Loom Black 100% Cotton\r\nWomen: Gildan Soft Black 100% Cotton\r\n<a href=\"http://streetartne.ws/Store/Men_sizes.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: red;\">Men Sizes</span></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://streetartne.ws/Store/Ladies_sizes.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: red;\">Ladies Sizes</span></a>","options":[{"id":43673382,"name":"Small (Men)","price":29.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43896843,"name":"Small (Women)","price":29.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43673385,"name":"Medium (Men)","price":29.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43896846,"name":"Medium (Women)","price":29.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43673388,"name":"Large (Men)","price":29.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43896849,"name":"Large (Women)","price":29.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43673391,"name":"X-Large (Men)","price":29.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43896852,"name":"X-Large (Women)","price":29.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43675953,"name":"XX-Large (Men)","price":29.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":11.0,"amount_with_others":2.0},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124440990/-/mock-up.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124440990/-/mock-up.jpg","width":700,"height":700},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124441050/-/both2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124441050/-/both2.jpg","width":1200,"height":808},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124610157/-/both4_copy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124610157/-/both4_copy.jpg","width":832,"height":1945}],"artists":[{"id":233628,"name":"Pixel Pancho","permalink":"pixel-pancho","url":"/artist/pixel-pancho"}],"categories":[{"id":6234348,"name":"T-Shirts","permalink":"t-shirts","url":"/category/t-shirts"}]},{"id":13002336,"name":"Alexis Diaz \"Dentro\"","permalink":"alexis-diaz-dentro","position":12,"price":99.99,"default_price":99.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/alexis-diaz-dentro","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-16T13:58:41.000Z","description":"Alexis Diaz - La Pandilla\r\n\"Dentro\" - Mission To Art Project #1\r\nEdition: 35\r\nSize: 50 x 70 cm\r\nSix Layers Screenprint on Super fancy paper.\r\nSigned And Numbered.\r\n\r\nAvailable on Wednesday, August 21st at 4PM UK\r\nTimezone conversions : (Melbourne: 1.00AM, New York: 11.00AM, Los Angeles: 7.00AM, Tokyo: Midnight, Moscow: 7.00PM)\r\n\r\nThe Mission To Art project will fly an incredible line-up of painters to Turin to paint various murals and work on several exclusive prints, the proceeds of which will be used to fund this unique artistic program.\r\n\r\nTo kick off the project, we will be releasing Alexis Diaz's first print \"Dentro\" this Wednesday.
