AD PATRES deals with refreshing the memory of amnesiacs.\r\n\r\nThe will to perpetuate the spirit of original Death Metal led Alsvid, drummer and founder of the legendary French Black Metal band SETH, who also officiated in various bands such as ENTHRONED, <CODE> or FORNICATION to surround himself with cronies sharing this point of view.\r\n\r\nThe intent is nowhere near making a tribute band or simply accumulating old-school clichés, but to bring in fresh blood, stirring up a hornets' nest.\r\n\r\nThe first recording, released late 2010, produced by GOROD's mastermind, allowed the band to quickly immerge, making big impression and that EP led AD PATRES to open play 2011’s HellFest as well as many other gigs all around France.\r\n\r\nUnleashing torrents of ear-catching riffs at high tempo sustained by floods of blast beats and double bass, AD PATRES provides its efficient and direct neck breaking brutality on your numb ears.\r\nDare you face it?\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nTHE RELEASE\r\nWhen most people tend to put barriers between genres, even in extreme styles of music, such as Death Metal or Black Metal, it’s hard to believe for the same people how much a musician that has been known and renewed for being part of some of the most prestigious Black Metal bands from France since almost 17 years can have a clear vision of what the perfect Death Metal album could be. Anyway, that’s the prowess Alsvid just made with founding AD PATRES, teaming with members or ex-members of Withdrawn or I.O.S.T., and releasing « Scorn Aesthetics », the band’s debut full-length.\r\n\r\nWith such a displayed level of musicianship, intensity or fastness, it could also be hard to believe songs could all be catchy and memorable. Prowess done, again. Artwork? Look at it! Impressive, intense, dark, twisted… fitting their blasting tunes so well! Production? Massive, thanks to GOROD’s very own Bud studio. Listen and make an idea for yourselves but that’s for sure you’ve hardly ever heard a debut release so intense, so fast, so catchy, all at the same time!\r\n\r\nNot only is AD PATRES releasing one of the most impressive debut full-length to date but, as all the live reports already said it: this band is made for the stage.

EDITION: 100 hand-numbered copies in a carton box with black \"Awoken by Crows\" artwork and a large full color sticker.\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nHailing from London, UK, EYE OF SOLITUDE, the utterly dark creature of UNFATHOMABLE RUINATION's vocalist Daniel Dumitru, is all about the utter fragility of the very last instant of life, the absolute distress of reaching the end of existence, the beauty and release of seeing the blood of yours flowing out of that open-wide wrist vein…\r\n\r\nFuneral Doom at times with these inhuman ultra low vocals, more Gothic and Doom at others with these acoustic parts and these absolutely heart-breaking melodies, more up-tempo with a twisted sense for memorable and soulful solos, EYE OF SOLITUDE is one of the most dramatic, beautiful, fragile, intense hauting and desperate Doom Death act around, each song sounding like the original soundtrack of the saddest yet most beautiful movie you’ve ever seen but so intense you don’t even need the pictures.\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nTOX013CDLE","options":[{"id":19817259,"name":"Default","price":11.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/60981279/-/TOX013.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/60981279/-/TOX013.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/62567639/-/581062_372873652772853_1822105358_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/62567639/-/581062_372873652772853_1822105358_n.jpg","width":612,"height":612},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/62567647/-/600811_372872979439587_1670377978_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/62567647/-/600811_372872979439587_1670377978_n.jpg","width":612,"height":612}],"artists":[{"id":122033,"name":"EYE

Deep droning bass and primitive twin-percussion bring the rumble, as a roaring low-end thunder, spiked with dark melodies from the guitar tandem produce images of silver surfers riding the crest of a tsunami. This is devastation in all its beauty. Produced by (who else?)

This first effort, produced at the Bringer studio (Alea Jacta Est, Drawers…) sees the band’s style getting even more diverse yet more personal too with the addition of bits of Punk and Noise to their nevertheless massively Grindcore-based sound.\r\n\r\nAfter playing 2011’s Brutal Grind Assault (CH) alongside the likes of Gadget or General Surgery or gigs with Maruta or Wormrot and touring in countries such as France, Germany or Spain, the band starts the writing process for their new album while still sharing stages with the likes of Atara, Exhumed, Magrudergrind, Mass Grave or Rotten Sound.\r\n\r\nSigned to Kaotoxin records late 2012, Nolentia now releases this viciously hateful second full-length, showcasing a darker, more intense and dense approach of their ever-improving style.\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nTOX017CD • 2013\r\nIssued under No Master's Voice records\r\n----------------------------------------","options":[{"id":26184900,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84052785/-/760137001720_TOX017_Nolentia_artwork_600x600_300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84052785/-/760137001720_TOX017_Nolentia_artwork_600x600_300.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":132151,"name":"NOLENTIA","permalink":"nolentia","url":"/artist/nolentia"}],"categories":[{"id":3029671,"name":"Kaotoxin releases","permalink":"kaotoxin-releases","url":"/category/kaotoxin-releases"},{"id":2375529,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":6767645,"name":"NOLENTIA \"...One loud noise and it's gone...\" CD","permalink":"nolentia-one-loud-noise-and-it-s-gone-cd","position":47,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nolentia-one-loud-noise-and-it-s-gone-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-23T05:26:13.000Z","description":"Debut full-length of Grindcore sometimes bordering on Hardcore or even Rock with technical touches and d-beat breaks.

The demo is followed, in 2008, by a split CD (with Decrepify (US), Visceral (Chile) and Ad Nauseum (FR)), featuring three tracks, among which a Sepultura cover that’s gonna end on two different tributes also (“From Roots to the Seed” – Chabane’s recs & “A Grind Tribute to 80’s Thrash” – Inhuman Homicide recs). Since then, the band has constantly played everywhere they’ve been able to in Europe.\r\n\r\nFor their tenth year mark, SAVAGE ANNIHILATION are proud to announce that they’ve inked a multi-album deal with up-and-coming French label KAOTOXIN RECORDS (home of Darkall Slaves, Dehuman, Eye Of Solitude, Gronibard, Infected Society, Insain, Unsu, VxPxOxAxAxWxAxMxCx…) which will result in the release, on October 1st, of their debut full-length, “Cannibalisme, hérésie et autres sauvageries” (ten tracks, 40+ minutes).\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nCANNIBALISME, HERESIE ET AUTRES SAUVAGERIES\r\nRaw, brutal, fast, blasting and featuring sick soloing, SAVAGE ANNIHILATION's \"Cannibalisme, hérésie et autres sauvageries\" is bringing back that primal proto Death Metal feeling the likes of Morbid Angel (“Abominations” / “Altars”-era), (early) Sepultura, (early) Krisiun, Nephasth or Nefas made popular before them, with the addition of their very own vision of twisted-ness.\r\n\r\n“Cannibalisme, hérésie et autres sauvageries” will unleash SAVAGE ANNIHILATION’s heretic Armageddon upon mankind, joining the Great Old Ones in their quest for the (savage) annihilation of mankind.\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nTOX014CD •

version coming in full-cristal Jewel Box with full color 8 pages booklet including all lyrics and credits and artwork by Luciferium War Graphics.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSidious, featuring two Eye Of Solitude members, is the British black phoenix risen from the ashes of what once was Seed Of Detest, combining the former’s sorrowfull mournings with the later’s aggressivity, giving birth to a higher level of darkened alchemy, mixing influences as diverses as Deathcore, Symphonic Black Metal, Death Metal and modern Black / Death (Dimmu Borgir, Behemoth, Zyklon if you want names…) to create something of their very own transubstantiating the power of each individual afore-mentioned genre to multiply, not only add them, bringing orchestral parts to the utterly brutal blast beats and complex drumming with no grand-guignol ridiculousness, putting modern, light fast, riffing to excellence, crafting some of the most beautiful and soulful solos heard in ages, topping all of that with commanding vocals and an emphasis on creating dark arts of their very own, both powerful in meaning and delivery.\r\n\r\nThe music of SIDOUS seeks to fuel the cultivation of culture and propagation of self, whilst debasing incomprehension of the corporeal realm while lyrical content focuses on the concept of the rebirth of humanity, after generations of ignorance compounded by religious and monetary systems.\r\n“Ascension to the Throne ov Self”, produced by no less than Russ Russell (Dimmu Borgir, Lock Up, Napalm Death…) is, to quote Nico, Kaotoxin’s label manager, “Most probably (one of) the best and most impressive debut EP you’ve ever heard”.\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nTOX022CDM •

are the ultra technical albums able to be something else than a simple display of a very high-level of musicianship and a ton of complex riffs thrown one after the other. Rare are also the debut releases able to already show a real personality and a great sense of song-writing. Years Of Tyrants’ “Leading the Blind” avoids the first and has the second: a very technical, at times ultra brutal, kind of Deathcore that has a soul, that’s able to carry emotions, be them violence, frustration or, much more rare in this style, melancholy and sadness.\r\n\r\nProduced at the Iguana studios (Necrophagist, Maladie…) back in 2010 by the band’s first line-up featuring past and present Rise Of The Northstar and Resistance members, “Leading the Blind” stayed unreleased until Kaotoxin records heard about it and picked up the band. This debut is a true masterpiece of upper class technical Deathcore with a soul, the missing link between Beneath The Massacre and Necrophagist.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTOX021CDM • 2013","options":[{"id":30822373,"name":"Default","price":7.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96781627/-/760137902126_TOX021_Years-Of-Tyrants_Artwork_1400x1400-300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96781627/-/760137902126_TOX021_Years-Of-Tyrants_Artwork_1400x1400-300.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/100176883/-/2013-03-27_16.47.23.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/100176883/-/2013-03-27_16.47.23.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":183235,"name":"YEARS OF TYRANTS","permalink":"years-of-tyrants","url":"/artist/years-of-tyrants"}],"categories":[{"id":3029671,"name":"Kaotoxin releases","permalink":"kaotoxin-releases","url":"/category/kaotoxin-releases"},{"id":2375689,"name":"MCDs","permalink":"mcds","url":"/category/mcds"}]},{"id":13170528,"name":"1917 \"Actum tempus (pt.1)\" CD","permalink":"1917-actum-tempus-pt-1-cd","position":65,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/1917-actum-tempus-pt-1-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-26T00:36:20.000Z","description":"First part of the 2013 reissues of this Argentinian Death Metal band featuring remastered versions of their debut demo (\"Bienvenido a la Nada\") and full-length \"Inti Huacay\") as well as compilation tracks.

An old hand at steering grindcore in the studio, Szymon Czech (Nyia, Third Degree, Antigama), has mastered this double-barrel disc.","options":[{"id":48180708,"name":"Default","price":7.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127620126/-/SMG031.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127620126/-/SMG031.jpg","width":216,"height":216}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2375689,"name":"MCDs","permalink":"mcds","url":"/category/mcds"}]},{"id":13796958,"name":"ANTIGAMA / THE KILL / NOISEAR \"s/t\" split MCD","permalink":"antigama-the-kill-noisear-s-t-split-cd","position":79,"price":7.99,"default_price":7.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/antigama-the-kill-noisear-s-t-split-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-26T03:58:55.000Z","description":"Years in the making, this spectacular 3-way split between ANTIGAMA (Poland), THE KILL (Australia) and NOISEAR (USA) is finally available for grind masses yearning for outrageous noise! 17 blistering songs clocking in around 25 minutes; highest dose of unadulterated grindcore.

That record spotlighted underground power-violence, grindcore and hardcore bands, all handpicked by Pig Destroyer / Agoraphobic Nosebleed mainstay and go-to grind producer / engineer Scott Hull. Drugs ringleader Richard Johnson also handles bass and vocal duties in the current ANb line-up, as well as having covered guitars and vocals in influential grind-punk act Enemy Soil. Corroded, Drugs’ first full-length after multiple splits, demos and comp appearances, finds this trio once again on Poland’s Selfmadegod Records, home of their first MCD and split with Antigama.\r\nStylistically, as the “n’roll” above would indicate, Drugs is a step or two removed from either of Johnson’s other efforts—neither as outright grindcore as Enemy Soil nor as twisted or electronic as ANb. But I’m not sure that “grind’n’roll” is an apt descriptor, as, to this reviewer, at least, the “roll” implies a certain emphasis on groove and classic-rock rhythms and stylings that is absent here. Corroded is not “grind+1970’s hard rock” – pentatonic riffs do not appear; swagger is absent.  (Corroded is more post-punk-alt-grind, to give it a comically long portmanteau all its own.) The tunes on Corroded are effectively grind crossed with a hefty dash of DC-styled hardcore (and Fugazi-ish post-hardcore, to split hairs further) and then filtered through AmRep noise rock. There’s plenty of grinding to be had, certainly, but with the spurts of angular and discordant riffing, the generous use of mid-tempo and the mostly punk-shouted vocals (vs. grind’s typically screamed or grunted), much of Corroded is reminiscent of hardcore on steroids, and it’s as indebted to the clanging alt-metal harshness of Helmet and the post-punk of Killing Joke as it is to any traditional grind outfit.\r\nThe riffing alternates between more traditional power-chorded bits and those stretches of dissonant voicings. The tempos run the gamut, from blastbeats to sludge-y dirges, but more often these tracks sit in the lower-end of the uptempo range, fast but not human-tornado madness. The bass sits nicely beneath the mix, distorted and driving, underpinning the guitars with moving lines and a gnarly noisy tone – interestingly, here the bass often drives the song, walking beneath the clanging chords and not just following a riff or a root note, which is (I admit) a classic rock trait. Sonically, the production is suitable – not too raw and certainly not too polished, sitting snugly in the middle ground and perfectly fitting the overall aesthetic, with each instrument audible and clear but not clean. Lyrically, as they always have, the band keeps to the political side of the spectrum, typical of both the grindcore and hardcore sides of their equation, railing against government and the war in Iraq and all the usual suspects.\r\nAs they blend a more traditional hardcore approach with the elements of grindcore, Drugs Of Faith is and isn’t pushing the envelope – they’re something of a throwback, and yet they’re putting together a new sound nonetheless, carving a nice little place in the midst of a pair of tangential styles. While it’s honestly not the best record I’ve gotten of late, Corroded is good, and it fulfills the promise shown by the self-titled MCD and the appearance on the latest This Comp Kills Fascists. Overall, Drugs Of Faith manages to twist the standard grind formula enough to stand out, and that alone is worthy of some commendation, and in the process, they sound both familiar and yet unlike their peers and influences.

Warrior (TRIPTYKON, CELTIC FROST, HELLHAMMER)\r\n\r\nFrom the darkest abyss comes U.S. death metal/doom band ENCOFFINATION, whose album entitled “Ritual Ascension Beyond Flesh” is released by Selfmadegod Records.\r\n\r\nFormed in 2009, ENCOFFINATION is the sepulchral embodiment of rancid death. Crushing, suffocating death metal doom of the lowest caliber. Named for the ritual preparation of the dead for burial, ENCOFFINATION exists below the plane of mortality; deep within the realms of death and decay. Slowly they lurch forth with their educated form of blasphemy, occult, and ritualistic expulsion of the holy from the earth.\r\n\r\nThis is the first full length from this amazing two-piece band, which is comprised of Ghoat on vocals, guitar, and bass (also in Festered) and Elektrokutioner on drums (also in Decrepitaph, Festered, Tombstones, Beyond Hell, Scaremaker). The follow-up to their After Their Temples Descend Below The Earth 7-inch, released earlier this year, this Georgia/Texas-based duo attacks with the 8-song Ritual Ascension Beyond Flesh, featuring over 30 minutes of cryptic metal influenced by early ‘90s American doom/death and bands like INCANTATION, DISEMBOWELMENT, and MORPHEUS DESCENDS.\r\n\r\nLegacy 14/15\r\nTerrorizer 9/10\r\n\r\nHeavyMetal.About.com:\r\nYou just can’t teach a musician this kind of death metal; it is inborn and originates from the blackest of souls. You’ve been warned.\" - Scott Alisoglu (Metal-Army) \"(...) eight-track collection of monstrous and truly energy-sapping, down-tempo, doom-plus-death metal which sucks you in, enthralls you, and terrifies you all in one fell swoop.\" - The Metal Register \"If Satan were to put together a play-list to torture his victims with, Encoffination’s “Ritual Ascension Beyond Flesh” would be at the very top. This sinister debut is as grim as modern doom metal can get, with a rough production and inaudible low grunts to accentuate the proceedings.\" - Metal Underground \"Encoffination play a gloomy, darkness-ridden manifestation of death/doom, taking the very best of bands like dISEMBOWELMENT, Sempiternal Deathreign and Decomposed and melding it into an atmosphere reminiscent of Incantation or even Morpheus Descends.\" - Diabolical Conquest \"This record doesn’t offer a proper burial. It simply tosses your body into a hole and shovels tons of dank earth on you.\r\n\r\nApochs:\r\nIt's rare that a Death Metal release would actually capture a sound that could only be described as pure death, but in this case, Encoffination has done so, and it's a fantastic work that you simply cannot afford to pass up.\r\n\r\nSea of Tranquility:\r\nIf you're looking for demonic work of art equivalent to Dante's Inferno, you're in for quite a ride","options":[{"id":21027527,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64911341/-/Untitled-1.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64911341/-/Untitled-1.png","width":420,"height":420}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2375529,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":10803423,"name":"EXTERMINAS \"Seventh Demoniacal Hierarchy\" CD","permalink":"exterminas-seventh-demoniacal-hierarchy-cd","position":124,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/exterminas-seventh-demoniacal-hierarchy-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-27T09:38:14.000Z","description":"Orthodox yet very good, catchy and dark Italian Black Metal with an ex-Impiety member in the vein of the 90's Norvegian scene and an 80's Thrash-like production: best of both worlds.\r\n\r\nYear: 2012\r\nLabel: Metallic Media\r\nGenre: Black Metal\r\nTracks: 10\r\nDuration: 44+ minutes\r\nFormat: Jewel box CD with 8 pages booklet","options":[{"id":33902994,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/106245633/-/Untitled-1.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/106245633/-/Untitled-1.png","width":200,"height":200}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2375529,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":15687066,"name":"EXTERMINATION DISMEMBERMENT \"Serial Urbicide\" CD","permalink":"extermination-dismemberment-serial-urbicide","position":125,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/extermination-dismemberment-serial-urbicide","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-21T09:27:27.000Z","description":"Behold the second full-length album of Belorussian slamming guttural sickness Extermination Dismemberment, \"Serial Urbicide\": 40 minutes of brutal Death Metal brought to a whole new level.

The Album was mixed and mastered by Harris Johns in the legendary Music Lab (Sodom, Tankard, Kreator, Protector,...)\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nYear: 2012\r\nLabel: Final Gate\r\nTracks: 9\r\nDuration: 51+\r\nPackaging: Full cristal jewel box CD with 12 pages booklet.","options":[{"id":37707438,"name":"Default","price":9.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/117403794/-/Untitled-1.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/117403794/-/Untitled-1.png","width":200,"height":200}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2375529,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":12882309,"name":"INFERIS \"Obscure Rituals of Death and Destruction\" CD","permalink":"inferis-obscure-rituals-of-death-and-destruction-cd","position":138,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/inferis-obscure-rituals-of-death-and-destruction-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-10T02:37:13.000Z","description":"Dark spell was cast and spread throughout the world in the form of nine possessed rituals to harm human plague.

Outstanding sound quality! Seventeen songs including Motörhead and Venom covers, features artwork by Chris Reifert (Autopsy, Abscess), liner notes by Daryl Kahan. This release puts a final point in music history as it was the last grind/death show at CBGB before it was closed (it was recorded in 2006).\r\n\r\nJ.M. Dopico comments on the release:\r\n\r\n“The year 2006 was one of the most active in Machetazo’s history. We played a lot of shows and the high point was a mini-tour we made together with Portland’s grinders Splatterhouse around the USA East Coast on May, the week before Maryland Deathfest IV. “The House of the Blind Dead Tour” was fuckin’ awesome, and together with Splatterhouse we had the opportunity of share stage with great bands like Graves At Sea, Psycho, Demilich or Pungent Stench just to name a few. The best show was in New York City, where we played at the legendary club CBGB. Roy Fox from Necroharmonic and Daryl Kahan from Funebrarium were the promoters, and they did a great work. To be into the CBGB was like being into the highest temple of Punk and Rock’n’Roll, the place was totally old school, underground style and true as fuck. We were drinking a lot of Jack Daniels before the show and went on stage literally on fire, we played a crazy and intense set, also we had no idea about the show being recorded, later we got a cool surprise when the sound guy gave us a CD with the whole show on it!
