It is an awesome machine packed into a small ready to fly package. We are amazed by this little machine and its capabilities. \r\n\r\nThe V922 is equipped with a 3-Axis gyro that assists the pilot in flight stability. The flybarless rotor head is newly designed with main rotor blades that adds some weight to balance the helicopter. Additionally, the flybarless systems allows the CCPM rotor head to be simple and convenient in times of repair. \r\n\r\nTypically it is complicated to set up a six channel flybarless helicopter with a 3 axis flight control board. WL Toys has eliminated that complication in a ready to fly package for those who are transitioning to six channel collective pitch helicopters. Instead of messing with settings and other complicated parameters you can focus on your flight abilities right out of the box. \r\n\r\nThe V922 has a unconventional way of allowing the pilots to fly inverted. There is a helpful function dubbed “Easy control”. You’ll find a switch on the top left hand corner of the transmitter. It helps you to keep the same direction control when flying inverted, so you won’t feel lost in orientation when performing inverted flight. Of course, some of you may feel that this is totally wrong and its pretty much cheating. If so, you can switch off easy control and fly inverted normally, or the hard way. \r\n\r\nWL Toys made this helicopter suitable and fun for a variety of pilots and toned down the exponential learning curve required to pilot these 6 channel collective pitch flybarless choppers. This V922 is the very best entry helicopter for new six channel pilots. Besides, this palm size helicopter is very durable for multiple light collisions. \r\n\r\nThe V922 is great for pilots with experience and flight time with Co-Axial and Single Rotor Head helicopters. It is a very durable and stable six channel collective pitch helicopter.\r\n\r\nSpecifications:\r\nMain rotor diameter : 250mm\r\nNose to tail length : 240mm\r\nTail rotor diameter : 38mm\r\nWeight : 60g\r\n\r\nThis package includes :\r\nWL Toys 2.4G Remote controller\r\nPre-assembled Helicopter\r\nBattery Charger and cable (Powered by USB Cable)\r\n2 X 3.7V 300mAh Li-Po Battery\r\nAdjustment tool\r\nExtra 1 Pair Blade\r\nExtra 1 X Tail Rotor","options":[{"id":39454251,"name":"Red","price":129.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39454254,"name":"Blue","price":129.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.95,"amount_with_others":12.95,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121446714/-/WL-V922_LRG.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121446714/-/WL-V922_LRG.jpg","width":600,"height":450},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121446747/-/thblue.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121446747/-/thblue.jpg","width":300,"height":261},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121446753/-/V922.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121446753/-/V922.jpg","width":430,"height":286},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121446756/-/51BbdGILudL.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121446756/-/51BbdGILudL.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121446759/-/th.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121446759/-/th.jpg","width":300,"height":261}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5781015,"name":"WL Toys","permalink":"wl-toys","url":"/category/wl-toys"},{"id":5781000,"name":"6 Channel Helis","permalink":"6-channel-helis","url":"/category/6-channel-helis"},{"id":5780991,"name":"Palm size Helis","permalink":"palm-size-helis","url":"/category/palm-size-helis"},{"id":5788437,"name":"2.4 transmitter","permalink":"2-4-transmitter","url":"/category/2-4-transmitter"}]},{"id":12429879,"name":"WL Toys 2.4Ghz 4 Channel V911 RC mini Helicopter","permalink":"wl-toys-2-4ghz-4-channel-v911-rc-mini-helicopter","position":6,"price":49.95,"default_price":49.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wl-toys-2-4ghz-4-channel-v911-rc-mini-helicopter","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-18T00:10:46.000Z","description":"The new v911 4 channel fixed pitch helicopter comes equipped with a 2.4ghz transmitter so you can bring the fun outdoors!

A quadcopter is a machine that is lifted and propelled by four rotors. Unlike most helicopters, a quadcopter use symmetrically pitched blades mounted on four motors to produce lift. Controlling the speed of these individual motors allows the machine to move forward and backward, up and down, strafe left and right, and rotate clockwise and counterclockwise. \r\n\r\nThe Syma X1 4 Channel quadcopter brings a new element to radio control helicopters and offers a completely different experience of flying. It offers a refreshing change on how to hover, balance, and control a copter. With the help of an adjustable 3 axis gyro, stability and agility is achieved effortlessly. Flying the Syma helicopter is simple and intuitive allowing the pilot to enhance their skills quickly. Once you enhance your skills enough there are settings built in that you can disable to advance your ability to fly the X1.\r\n\r\nWith the use of 2.4ghz technology the Syma X1 radio system has the benefit of longer control distance, strong anti-interference technology, low power consumption, and rapid response times. The LCD screen displays helicopter trim data. The transmitter also allows you to choose between an “L” or “H” mode. This sets the sensitivity or “speed” of the controls and the motors. With the setting on “L” the X1 is less responsive and inherently more stable. With the setting on “H” mode the X1 is awaken and a lot more responsive. Additionally you can depress the top right button of the transmitter and activate the “Flip Mode” This feature deactivates some of the gyros that maintain stability and allows the pilot to perform flips and rolls. \r\n\r\nThe Syma Helicopter brand is one that is very well known in the micro helicopter industry. Its S107 helicopter has been a hot item mainly because of its stability and ease of flight.

A quadcopter is a machine that is lifted and propelled by four rotors. Unlike most helicopters, a quadcopter use symmetrically pitched blades mounted on four motors to produce lift. Controlling the speed of these individual motors allows the machine to move forward and backward, up and down, strafe left and right, and rotate clockwise and counterclockwise. \r\n\r\nThe Syma X1 4 Channel quadcopter brings a new element to radio control helicopters and offers a completely different experience of flying. It offers a refreshing change on how to hover, balance, and control a copter. With the help of an adjustable 3 axis gyro, stability and agility is achieved effortlessly. Flying the Syma helicopter is simple and intuitive allowing the pilot to enhance their skills quickly. Once you enhance your skills enough there are settings built in that you can disable to advance your ability to fly the X1.\r\n\r\nWith the use of 2.4ghz technology the Syma X1 radio system has the benefit of longer control distance, strong anti-interference technology, low power consumption, and rapid response times. The LCD screen displays helicopter trim data. The transmitter also allows you to choose between an “L” or “H” mode. This sets the sensitivity or “speed” of the controls and the motors. With the setting on “L” the X1 is less responsive and inherently more stable. With the setting on “H” mode the X1 is awaken and a lot more responsive. Additionally you can depress the top right button of the transmitter and activate the “Flip Mode” This feature deactivates some of the gyros that maintain stability and allows the pilot to perform flips and rolls. \r\n\r\nThe Syma Helicopter brand is one that is very well known in the micro helicopter industry. Its S107 helicopter has been a hot item mainly because of its stability and ease of flight. The Syma X1 Quadcopter carries all of these favorable traits over from the S107 to produce a quadcopter in an awesome ready to fly package. \r\n\r\nThe Syma X1 comes in 3 flavors.

introduces its newest S34 3 channel coaxial mini chinook helicopter! If you are familiar or have flown the S fleet of choppers, you'll know exactly how stable it is! The new S34 is equipped with all the awesome features you’ll come to expect from Syma with new features such as flashing lights, bigger battery, and a 2.4ghz LCD transmitter. \r\n\r\nThe S34 is 3 channel helicopter. This means that it can fly in 6 directions. It will maneuver Up/Down, Forward/Backward, and rotate clockwise and counterclockwise. The size of this chopper is suitable for indoor flight in smaller or confined spaces. Its coaxial rotor design is naturally stable in flight. Even beginners will find that it will control well. The built-in gyro is able to lock the heading and prevents continuous rotation of the helicopter chassis. The gyroscope is powerful and with the trim adjustment on the transmitter it can be adjusted in flight. What’s impressive is that the helicopter can hover in the air with your hands free from the transmitter. \r\n\r\nThe radio system included in this package uses 2.4ghz frequency. With the use of spread spectrum technology, the control distance of the chopper is improved. Unlike infrared systems, you can fly this chopper without having to worry about glass, mirrors, or sunlight interfering with the signal. This type of frequency also allows more helicopters to be flown at the same time. The transmitter also has an LCD screen that displays trim and flight states of the helicopter. A high and low speed switch on the transmitter allows the pilot to control the throttle rate of the chopper for greater or less sensitivity. A 7.4v 500mah Lithium Polymer battery provides good power and about 6-8 minutes of flight time. \r\n\r\nSpecifications:\r\nLength: 46cm\r\nWidth: 8cm\r\nHeight: 18cm\r\nBattery: 7.4v 500mah Li-Po\r\nFrequency: 2.4ghz\r\n\r\nIncluded in Box:\r\nS34 Chinook 3 Channel Helicopter\r\nCharger\r\nScrewdriver\r\n2.4ghz Transmitter (4 AA Batteries not included)\r\nOperating Instructions","options":[{"id":12550638,"name":"Grey","price":41.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39385767,"name":"Camo","price":41.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":14.95,"amount_with_others":12.95,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121396221/-/0.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121396221/-/0.jpg","width":600,"height":450},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121396245/-/56H-S34-Chinook-Blue-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121396245/-/56H-S34-Chinook-Blue-1.jpg","width":700,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1909999,"name":"Syma Helicopter","permalink":"syma-helicopter","url":"/category/syma-helicopter"},{"id":1899185,"name":"3 Channel Helis","permalink":"3-channel-helis","url":"/category/3-channel-helis"},{"id":1900843,"name":"Medium size Helis","permalink":"medium-size-helis","url":"/category/medium-size-helis"}]},{"id":4406037,"name":"Syma S301G Metal RC helicopter 18\" 3 Channel RTF + 27 mhz Transmitter with GYRO","permalink":"syma-s023g-large-apache-3ch-helicopter-with-gyro","position":25,"price":39.95,"default_price":39.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/syma-s023g-large-apache-3ch-helicopter-with-gyro","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-09-08T23:39:27.000Z","description":"This detailed Syma S301G is beautifully designed and made in high strength airframe, so it can survive more bumps and races than all other competitors.
