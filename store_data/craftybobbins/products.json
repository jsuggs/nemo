Sigh!\n\n\tThese are a gorgeous pair of brown leather shoes with black patent leather detail, made in Australia by Footrest.  From the logo design, I&#8217;d say about 1970&#8217;s&#8230;I wonder if the design was influenced by the 30&#8217;s revival in fashion of that decade (the result of the film version of &#8216;The Great Gatsby&#8217;)?  To me they have a very 30&#8217;s feel about them.\n\n\tThey are size 7D and measure approx 25 cm from toe to heel.  They have some scuffing on the toes, but are well made from quality materials, so the lucky peson with size 7 feet will get a lot of wear out of them.\n\n\tIf you&#8217;d like more pics or details, please contact me.\n\n","options":[{"id":358593,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/154632/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/154632/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":79760,"name":"reclaimed vintage/retro","permalink":"reclaimed-vintage-retro","url":"/category/reclaimed-vintage-retro"}]},{"id":75626,"name":"Holly Hobby bud vase","permalink":"holly-hobby-bud-vase","position":5,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/holly-hobby-bud-vase","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-02-15T02:07:25.000Z","description":"Here&#8217;s a little Holly Hobby vase, mearsing 8.5 cm high, with a 4 cm base.
