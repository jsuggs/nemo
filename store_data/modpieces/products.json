Bold.\r\n\r\nMod Pieces has joined forces with <a href=\"http://www.avrilloreti.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Avril Loreti</a> to bring you a fun & graphic, limited edition collection of one of a kind lamp shades.\r\n\r\nTextile Designer, Avril Loreti, creates patterns for the modern home based on the shapes that she finds in the world around her. Lia Fagan, the designer behind Mod Pieces, met Avril at the Toronto One of a Kind Show, where they were each exhibiting. Avril’s angular prints & off-beat colour schemes were what first attracted Lia to her work.\r\n\r\nThis collection of limited edition lamp shades is the result of their collaborative efforts. Each pattern was designed digitally by Avril & printed here, in North America. Each shade has been carefully constructed by Lia using new & reclaimed materials.\r\n\r\nDetails…\r\n\r\n* 12” top x 13” bottom x 14.25” side\r\n* Spider fitting\r\n* Harp & washer included\r\n* Works best with a 20”+ height lamp\r\n* Fabric is cotton twill\r\n* Lamp not included\r\n* This lamp shade ships from Canada\r\n* It can be shipped to Canada or the USA\r\n* Shipping charges & applicable taxes will be added at checkout\r\n\r\nView the <a href=\"http://www.shopmodpieces.com/lookbook\">Avril Loreti Collection Lookbook</a>.","options":[{"id":22343497,"name":"Default","price":85.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":20.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":20.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69235291/-/waimea-lattice-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69235291/-/waimea-lattice-1.jpg","width":540,"height":540},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69235331/-/waimea-lattice-4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69235331/-/waimea-lattice-4.jpg","width":540,"height":540},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/69235339/-/waimea-lattice-5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/69235339/-/waimea-lattice-5.jpg","width":540,"height":540}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3336977,"name":"Shades","permalink":"shades","url":"/category/shades"},{"id":3615507,"name":"Avril Loreti","permalink":"avril-loreti","url":"/category/avril-loreti"}]},{"id":11806854,"name":"18\" x 18\" Down/Feather Pillow Insert","permalink":"18-x-18-down-feather-pillow-insert","position":73,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/18-x-18-down-feather-pillow-insert","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-15T14:52:43.000Z","description":"Details…\r\n\r\n* 18\" x 18\" pillow insert\r\n* Fits inside all of our standard pillow covers\r\n* 5% white goose down, 95% white goose feathers\r\n* Washed & odour free\r\n* In a T255 100% cotton down proof shell\r\n* Made with new material only and sterilized down/feather filling","options":[{"id":37311228,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116274798/-/18-18-Down-Insert.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116274798/-/18-18-Down-Insert.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5534772,"name":"Throw Pillows","permalink":"throw-pillows","url":"/category/throw-pillows"}]},{"id":11806872,"name":"18\" x 18\" Polyfill Pillow Insert","permalink":"18-x-18-polyfill-pillow-insert","position":74,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/18-x-18-polyfill-pillow-insert","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-15T14:54:07.000Z","description":"Details…\r\n\r\n* 18\" x 18\" pillow insert\r\n* Fits inside all of our standard pillow covers\r\n* Manufactured with 100% new, pure white polyester\r\n* Contains no recycled or regenerated fibre\r\n* Durable polypropylene cover","options":[{"id":37311258,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116275614/-/18-18-Poly-Insert.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116275614/-/18-18-Poly-Insert.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5534772,"name":"Throw Pillows","permalink":"throw-pillows","url":"/category/throw-pillows"}]}]
