Not a circle! It's shaped to fit comfortably on a finger; this is more naturally shaped, well, like a finger is shaped. It puts less pressure on the side flanking fingers and the finger tendons so it's perfect for a thick ring like this one and for a person unused to wearing rings.\r\n\r\nSuitable for a man as well as for a woman who would like a simple striking piece. Available in high gloss or brushed finish.\r\n\r\nThe ring is made to your order for perfect sizing and to allow for customizations. Please allow 10 days for hand crafting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~\r\nIf you don't know your ring size, I have ring sizer tools available upon request. (Purchase a sizer & receive a small discount when you purchase a ring.) Happy to convert international ring sizes.\r\n\r\nThis style can be customized (stamped) if you wish to memorialize a date, or dedicate, or use as a replacement/workday wedding band. Send me a message if you're interested. Imprinting will have additional charges for time and refinishing. \r\nSee my flickr account for examples!\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/zestyb/\r\n","options":[{"id":576386,"name":"Size - 6","price":39.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":576387,"name":"Size - 7","price":39.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":576421,"name":"Size - 8","price":39.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":576422,"name":"Size - 9","price":39.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":576423,"name":"Size - 10","price":39.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":576424,"name":"Size - 11","price":39.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":576425,"name":"Size - 12","price":39.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":576426,"name":"Size - 13","price":39.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":576428,"name":"Size - 14","price":39.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.5,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/634109/-/ring_1.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/634109/-/ring_1.JPG","width":945,"height":945}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":78450,"name":"rings","permalink":"rings","url":"/category/rings"}]},{"id":119634,"name":"Hold On Tight - sterling silver unisex cuff bracelet","permalink":"hold-on-tight-sterling-silver-unisex-cuff-bracelet","position":2,"price":49.0,"default_price":49.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/hold-on-tight-sterling-silver-unisex-cuff-bracelet","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-06-29T21:53:57.000Z","description":"Exquisitely simple sterling silver cuff bracelet.
