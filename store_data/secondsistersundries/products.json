It was subdivided into 4 Paise or 12 Pies (thus there were 64 paise in a rupee and 192 pies). The term belonged to the Muslim monetary system. The Anna is not commonly used since India decimalised its currency in 1957. This coin is from 1938.\r\n\r\nI handstamped the band to this ring with the word \"luck\" in the center.

On the way, he suddenly fell ill. While he was passing through a mountainous village, he came across an herbal practitioner who took him to his home. Thanks to the doctor, and his young daughter, the young boy recovered soon. Leaving the doctor’s house was difficult for the young boy as he had fallen in love with the doctor’s daughter during his stay there. Before the boy left, the young girl wrote down the right hand part of a couplet for the boy. He left their house, promising that he would marry her as soon as he finished the examination. \r\n\r\nThankfully, the young boy passed the examination and received the highest score. The emperor showed appreciation for boy’s knowledge. During his interview with the boy, the king asked him to complete the right hand part of a couplet. Suddenly, the young boy remembered what his young love had written for him. Realizing that it was perfect answer to the emperor’s couplet, he answered the emperor with her words. The emperor was more than happy with his reply, and soon appointed him as a minister in the court. He also permitted the boy some time to visit his hometown before assuming the office. The young boy went straight to the young girl and told her everything about the examination. He kept his promise to her, and they got married. On their wedding day, both of them wrote the same right half of a couplet, which had kept them together.

Although the art of scrimshaw is native to the Inuit and other native groups along the Northwest Coast, it was adopted by the Yankee whalemen of the early 1800's. The Chinese, it seems, took naturally to such a delicate and meticulous art. Most scrimshaw I come across is exported from China with wonderful themes like dragons, roosters, monkeys, Buddha and lotus flowers. I have never seen a piece as wonderful as this dragonfly pendant. It is signed by the artist on the back and is truly a treasure.\r\n\r\nThe classical gardens in Suzhou are nominated as one of the Top Ten National Landscapes in China. Famous for their exquisite and free styles as well as elegance, the gardens in Suzhou directly reflect the history and development of Chinese private gardens. Zhuozheng Garden, Liu Garden, Huanxiu Villa and Wangshi Garden all have distinct artistic patterns in arrangement and structure. They represent the brilliant architecture and residential civilization in ancient China and are considered to be priceless treasure of Chinese traditional culture.\r\n\r\nChing Ting means dragonfly.\r\n\r\nThis necklace is 17 1/2\" long and cannot be re-sized. The bone (probably fish bone) pendant is 1 1\\/2\" X 2 1\\/2\". The coral beads are knotted on pale green silk.  The necklace closes with a sterling silver clasp.
