There are some more difficult techniques that we will cover, and they reinforce the knowledge you have gained while extending your skills even further. We will do one of the things that Photoshoppers love to do but often can’t quite get right - creating digital collages. This involves going into photographs and digitally cutting them out from their background, so that the object sits on a transparent space. Once we have cut out the objects, we will arrange them together on the one page in Photoshop in exactly the way you want them to look. This can involve filters, colour correction, scaling, layers and lots of easy, effective tools to add to your toolbox. If you loved the first class and want to consolidate your skills, this course will offer the same easy step-by-step instructions and fun, laid back atmosphere of the first workshop.\r\n\r\nWorkshop includes - Morning tea, yummy lunch and class notes.\r\n\r\nWhat to bring - Your own laptop with Photoshop CC installed. If you don't own it yet, you can download the free 30 day trial. Please ensure it is  installed and working before the workshop! \r\n\r\nDirections - You can park on Dunning or Morley Avenue and walk to southern side of 85 Dunning Avenue. Look around the garden for the giant spot painted on the giant roller door. Entry is through the clear door to the left.\r\n\r\nYou can take the 343, 309, 310, M20 and L09 bus routes.\r\n\r\nGreen Square train station is a 1.5 km walk away. Head south from Green Square towards O'Riordan Street, turn left into O'Riordan Street, right into Botany Road and left into Morley Avenue. At the roundabout take the first exit onto Dunning Avenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":34045983,"name":"Saturday October 19th 2013","price":280.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74823679/-/PSSydney.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74823679/-/PSSydney.gif","width":419,"height":419},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74820951/-/IMG_0078.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74820951/-/IMG_0078.JPG","width":580,"height":581},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74820987/-/IMG_0088.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74820987/-/IMG_0088.JPG","width":549,"height":549},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74821023/-/IMG_0081.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74821023/-/IMG_0081.JPG","width":556,"height":556},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74821043/-/IMG_0085.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74821043/-/IMG_0085.JPG","width":600,"height":601}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3180083,"name":"Sydney Workshops","permalink":"sydney-workshops","url":"/category/sydney-workshops"}]},{"id":7158475,"name":"InDesign Basics NEWCASTLE ","permalink":"social-media-for-crafters-brisbane","position":2,"price":280.0,"default_price":280.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/social-media-for-crafters-brisbane","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-05T10:40:47.000Z","description":"Would you like to get a quick start in using InDesign?
