can create personalized pictures made to order. \r\nIn this section, you can find information about how to get your personal Magic Picture.\r\n\r\n· ¿ What is a Magic Picture?\r\n\r\nPictures that grant wishes and enlighten your mind.\r\nThey are living symbols and this is their secret.\r\nThey change their meaning according to the spiritual state of the person who watches them.\r\nThe symbols lack magic if there is nobody to meditate in front of them- someone to give them meaning and life.\r\nThe magic pictures are ornamental tools made especially for you; they serve to decorate your home and your soul.\r\n\r\n· Pictures that answer your questions:\r\n\r\nSit down in front of the picture in a meditative attitude.\r\nThe magic picture is your oracle; answering the questions you propose.\r\nYou only have to learn to listen and be aware of the information that flows inside you as you contemplate your magic picture.\r\nThen your picture talks to you and enlightens you.\r\nYour mission is to learn to listen.\r\n\r\n· Pictures that grant your wishes:\r\n\r\nYour magic picture is now your shrine.\r\nDeposit your wishes in it.\r\nThe picture rouses the Magic Genius that lives inside you.\r\nIf your wish is genuine; your picture will grant it to you.\r\nYour mission is to find your true desires.\r\n\r\n· To Order \r\n\r\nTwo options:\r\n30 x 30 cm..........1000 euros
