People were cleaning the windshield of a car with the scrapper on fire, someone pulled a coffin through the woods in a stop-motion animation, and cheerleaders cheerleading in a cemetery.  \r\nBut now we're moving further into the future and we have questions like “how do we go on with art?” and “where do we go from here?”  Fortunately, we still are finding that 'strange but cool' idea and we're happy to announce as of late, it's coming out of Canada.  London, Ontario-based Tired Wires brings you his latest album, titled 'Hark'.  Composed of five tracks, “Hark” has ambience, found sounds and lots and lots of ease.  Tired Wires is a culmination of the weird aspects portrayed in music but also pulls at the threads of sanity and shares it with us all.  Hark, it's Tired Wires.\"<br/>\r\n<em>-Ray Jackson, Already Dead Tapes, 2013</em><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nPainting: Erika Marczak<br/>\r\nPackage Design: Joshua Tabbia","options":[{"id":46355898,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126264339/-/AD099_02.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126264339/-/AD099_02.jpg","width":790,"height":524}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2218905,"name":"Cassettes","permalink":"cassettes","url":"/category/cassettes"}]},{"id":14156898,"name":"AD098 New Tongues 'We Are the Ones We Have Been Waiting For' cassette","permalink":"ad098-new-tongues-we-are-the-ones-we-have-been-waiting-for-cassette","position":3,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ad098-new-tongues-we-are-the-ones-we-have-been-waiting-for-cassette","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-13T23:24:29.000Z","description":"<iframe width=\"46\" height=\"23\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 46px; height: 23px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3475814829/size=short/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=0687f5/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"http://alreadydeadtapes.bandcamp.com/album/ad098-new-tongues-we-are-the-ones-we-have-been-waiting-for\">AD098 New Tongues &#39;We Are the Ones We Have Been Waiting For&#39; by Already Dead Tapes and Records</a></iframe>\r\n<br/>\r\n<strong>INCLUDES DIGITAL DOWNLOAD CARD</strong><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<strong>Tapes duped in real time.</strong>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nC40<br/>\r\nEdition of 100<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\"A heavy album from Columbia, MO.  New Tongues' latest release, 'We Are the Ones We Have Been Waiting For', brings on lots of reverb, rock, and lots of instrumental parts - making it to just shy of the 40-minute benchmark.  The three-piece has been playing for over a year, composed of musicians; Justin Nardy, (bass and vocals,) Mike Quinn (drums,) and Shane Johnson (guitar, vocals.)  New Tongues pulls at the minimalist approach to making their compositions with many dynamic musical strains.  They're interests in heavier rock, the band lays a lot of weight on the downbeats and not afraid to let a clean, whole note ring.  The group has knack for pulling off steady, tight jams while still largely maintaining a loud, louder, and a very, very louder sound.  Come check out the forms of more progressive, louder, noisier sounds of what stoner rock has had to offer.  It's New Tongues' 'We Are the Ones We Have Been Waiting For.'\"<br/>\r\n<em>-Ray Jackson, Already Dead Tapes, 2013</em><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nDesign: Justin Nardy","options":[{"id":45712464,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125880036/-/AD098_03.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125880036/-/AD098_03.jpg","width":790,"height":524}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2218905,"name":"Cassettes","permalink":"cassettes","url":"/category/cassettes"}]},{"id":14156889,"name":"AD097 Ecole du Ciel 'Heartbeat War Drum' cassette","permalink":"ad097-ecole-du-ciel-heartbeat-war-drum-cassette","position":4,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ad097-ecole-du-ciel-heartbeat-war-drum-cassette","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-13T23:23:40.000Z","description":"<iframe width=\"46\" height=\"23\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 46px; height: 23px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2196798022/size=short/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=0687f5/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"http://alreadydeadtapes.bandcamp.com/album/ad097-ecole-du-ciel-heartbeat-war-drum\">AD097 Ecole Du Ciel &#39;Heartbeat War Drum&#39; by Already Dead Tapes and Records</a></iframe>\r\n<br/>\r\n<strong>INCLUDES DIGITAL DOWNLOAD CARD</strong><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<strong>Tapes duped in real time.</strong>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nC32<br/>\r\nEdition of 100<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\"When it's not just toe-tapping or catchy, it might be a good ol' heartbeat.  And when the heartbeat has its passion, it can be that manifesto-esque war song.  Ecole du Ciel's “Heartbeat War Song” is the post-punk group from Bari, southern Italy.  This album has the simplicity that screams out “simple music is simply good music.”  With four measures that build up on the tom-toms and one guitarist riding on ingenuous riffs and proceeding into a full ensemble of untutored rock music – this band has got it.  \r\nEcole du Ciel is a trio with aggressive offshoots, that dribbles in and past the punk phase of music.  With great instrumentals that speak for the group's cohesiveness as well as it's inspirations, Ecole du Ciel finds a perfect space towards expression through simple notes and pure feeling.  “Heartbeat War Song” has a consistent tension-and-release feel which makes this album as a definite grab on Already Dead Tapes and Records.\"<br/>\r\n<em>-Ray Jackson, Already Dead Tapes, 2013</em><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nDesign: Joshua Tabbia","options":[{"id":45712452,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125879388/-/AD097_03.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125879388/-/AD097_03.jpg","width":790,"height":524}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2218905,"name":"Cassettes","permalink":"cassettes","url":"/category/cassettes"}]},{"id":14156865,"name":"AD0096 Yeesh 'Yeesh' cassette","permalink":"ad0096-yeesh-yeesh-cassette","position":5,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ad0096-yeesh-yeesh-cassette","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-13T23:22:42.000Z","description":"<iframe width=\"46\" height=\"23\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 46px; height: 23px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2055557743/size=short/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=0687f5/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"http://alreadydeadtapes.bandcamp.com/album/ad096-yeesh-yeesh\">AD096 Yeesh &#39;Yeesh&#39; by Already Dead Tapes and Records</a></iframe>\r\n<br/>\r\n<strong>INCLUDES DIGITAL DOWNLOAD CARD</strong><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<strong>Tapes duped in real time.</strong>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nC32<br/>\r\nEdition of 50<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\"On the road and with a new album!  Yeesh is releasing their latest self-titled album as part of the great new bands on Already Dead Tapes and Records.  \r\nThe opening track has that epic, serenading pop-punk sound with all the necessities for a killer track; a slow build, guitars holding out power chorded riffs and the bass to snare beat, and of course, a chorus that can be shouted and repeated.\r\nThe rock trio from Chicago, Yeesh has that camaraderie feel that comes from a unified group of musicians and simply, good friends.  The song writing has romantic as well as platformed proclamation qualities within its context.  Even at the album's darkest, it still does a great job in contrasting with the band's light-hearted lyrical growth.  I would say over all, if the lyrics were a movie, they would be an indie, coming-of-age film.  And hey... who doesn't love those every now and then?\"<br/>\r\n<em>-Ray Jackson, Already Dead Tapes, 2013</em><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nDesign: George Davis Cathcart","options":[{"id":45712389,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.5,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125823879/-/AD096_02.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125823879/-/AD096_02.jpg","width":790,"height":524}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2218905,"name":"Cassettes","permalink":"cassettes","url":"/category/cassettes"}]}]
