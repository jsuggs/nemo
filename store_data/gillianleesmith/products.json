I am now combining this together for you, in a gallery/studio setting, surrounded by art and inspiration. In a relaxed and informal way you will be helped to follow a journey into learning techniques and develop your own style to create art that translates your own character onto paper.\r\n\r\nThis session is aimed at those interested in creating a unique gift for a loved one – A portrait. Working from reference imagery we will find ways of drawing an expressive portrait of your choosing that portrays a likeness but also the character of the person from the photograph. Working in pastels you can add unique touches to the portrait to make it truly unique such as a favourite belonging or text. Whilst some drawing experience is helpful it is not absolutely necessary for this class.\r\n\r\nEach day I teach is different and planned to suit the needs of the individual and the group. If you attend more than one class, as you progress you will be encouraged to follow your own interests and inspiration with my assistance and support in order to follow your own artistic journey.\r\n\r\nPlaces are very limited to only 6 in a class to ensure you gain the support you need in a small group. This session is for Saturday 7th October 2013 from 10.30am till 4.30pm. Refreshments and cake are included but you will need to bring or purchase your own lunch.\r\n\r\nBasic materials are included (paper, charcoal and student grade pastels) but there will also be a  materials kit available to purchase should you wish to carry on your work after the class (details also available on booking)\r\n\r\nPlease don’t hesitate to ask if you have any queries.\r\n\r\nFeedback from previous classes...\r\n\r\n\"I can't recommend Gillian's workshops highly enough. Not only is her teaching style relaxed and full of inspiration but I will have no hesitation in taking any student as she is welcoming no matter what age or ability. Seeing my students come away with the same enthusiasm that I feel after being taught by Gillian is all I can ask, she is a gem! I really can't wait to book myself on another!\"\r\nSarah Usher (Head of Art)\r\n\r\n\"I have been fortunate to do two of Gillian's workshops, and I have thoroughly enjoyed both. Gillian is a true inspiration, and is such a lovely lady. Her teaching methods are relaxed, and she believes in all of her pupils no matter what level they are at. In the two workshops, I learnt so many new techniques and skills\" \r\nHeidi (art teacher)\r\n","options":[{"id":40909800,"name":"Default","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122453628/-/niop.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122453628/-/niop.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":300874,"name":"Workshop places","permalink":"workshop-places","url":"/category/workshop-places"}]},{"id":11819844,"name":"Set of 4 greetings cards - Dreaming of a place","permalink":"set-of-4-greetings-cards-dreaming-of-a-place","position":23,"price":9.0,"default_price":9.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/set-of-4-greetings-cards-dreaming-of-a-place","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-16T10:26:51.000Z","description":"This set of 4 high quality professionally printed greetings cards feature my artwork in beautiful pastel colours.\r\n\r\nThe place where you remember dreaming\r\nScattered to the four winds\r\nThe dim light\r\nA moment in time\r\n\r\nEach card measures 6 x 4 inches and is wrapped individually in a cellophane wrapper with a white envelope. \r\n\r\nYour order will be mailed Royal Mail first class for UK orders and Airmail for all other orders.","options":[{"id":37355895,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.2,"amount_with_others":0.6,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116405346/-/2013-06-15_16.25.29.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116405346/-/2013-06-15_16.25.29.jpg","width":336,"height":383},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116405370/-/2013-06-15_16.17.08.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116405370/-/2013-06-15_16.17.08.jpg","width":336,"height":404}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":300876,"name":"Greetings cards","permalink":"greetings-cards","url":"/category/greetings-cards"}]},{"id":11819823,"name":"Set of 4 greetings cards - Dreams and Memories","permalink":"set-of-4-greetings-cards-dreams-and-memories","position":24,"price":9.0,"default_price":9.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/set-of-4-greetings-cards-dreams-and-memories","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-16T10:23:34.000Z","description":"This set of 4 high quality professionally printed greetings cards feature my artwork in beautiful pastel colours.\r\n\r\nThe twilight rehearsal\r\nThe heart that cannot be hidden\r\nCollecting the past\r\nIsobel's dream of life and light.\r\n\r\nEach card measures 6 x 4 inches and is wrapped individually in a cellophane wrapper with a white envelope. \r\n\r\nYour order will be mailed Royal Mail first class for UK orders and Airmail for all other orders.","options":[{"id":37355868,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.2,"amount_with_others":0.6,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116405046/-/2013-06-15_16.26.17.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116405046/-/2013-06-15_16.26.17.jpg","width":336,"height":382},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/116405130/-/2013-06-15_16.12.58.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/116405130/-/2013-06-15_16.12.58.jpg","width":815,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":300876,"name":"Greetings cards","permalink":"greetings-cards","url":"/category/greetings-cards"}]},{"id":11453058,"name":"Scattered to the four winds - Giclee Print","permalink":"scattered-to-the-four-winds-giclee-print","position":25,"price":30.0,"default_price":30.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/scattered-to-the-four-winds-giclee-print","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-29T19:08:09.000Z","description":"Print size: 9 x 13 inches \r\nImage size: 8.75 x 12.75\r\n\r\nScattered thoughts, scattered dreams, scattered seeds and beauty in unexpected places. \r\n\r\nThis is a limited edition of 100 at this size.
