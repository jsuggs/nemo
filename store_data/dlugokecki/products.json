This is the second part of our '48 Trilogy' as I am a big fan of trilogies - Star Wars, Back to the Future and Karate Kid being the best! This piano driven album was again written within a 48 hour limit, however, this time we have spent a little more time recording as we enjoy it too much. This album charts the months of January to August this year, another massive personal album for me and one I'm extremely happy with! The 8 song album includes our new single 'We are loved' - which was mixed and mastered by Glen Nichols (Save My Soul/Let this be Right). It also includes a duet with Charley Macaulay (Acid Jazz) and the new single 'No Good'. The album was produced by Tim Jackson. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed writing it - Ben Dlugokecki. \r\n\r\nForty-Eight: Part II\r\nby Dlugokecki\r\n\r\nSleepwalker\r\nWe are Loved\r\nU & Me & A & E\r\nNo Good\r\nThe Payout\r\nTake it Easy\r\nWhat are you Waiting for?\r\nWindmill","options":[{"id":41905056,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126833718/-/48_Part_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126833718/-/48_Part_2.jpg","width":687,"height":671}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1147841,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":7262767,"name":"Forty-Eight (2012)","permalink":"forty-eight","position":2,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/forty-eight","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-09-16T17:33:06.000Z","description":"‘Forty-Eight’ is 11 songs written over the 3-month period of July to September 2012 to reflect on the massive changes in my life.  Written with tears, boredom, frustration, anger and love it really is a document of where I have been, and where I am going. This is completely the most personal album I have ever written. I hope over people will get something out of it, or can take some understanding from the lyrics. \r\n\r\nInstead of sitting on these songs for years the band and I decided to take a big gamble and do something we have never done before. We have set ourselves only 48 hours to record the songs. This will be done over the next month, and will hopefully generate the rawness I believe these 11 songs hold.  \r\n\r\n- Ben Dlugokecki\r\n\r\nForty Eight\r\nBy Dlugokecki\r\n\r\nLove Will Always Win \r\nDon’t Burn Your Bridges Ben \r\nForty-Eight\r\nThe One That Got Away\r\nHow Do You Solve A Problem Like Us? \r\nCatapult\r\nThe Game\r\nBusy Keeping Busy\r\nHold me Down \r\nThe Wall\r\nTwo Houses\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":22995603,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126833730/-/48_Part_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126833730/-/48_Part_1.jpg","width":687,"height":671}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1147841,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":5858071,"name":"Complete Dlugokecki 2000-2012 (2012)","permalink":"compete-dlugokecki-2000-2012","position":3,"price":7.5,"default_price":7.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/compete-dlugokecki-2000-2012","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-04-04T18:04:50.000Z","description":"This is a limited edition CD set.
