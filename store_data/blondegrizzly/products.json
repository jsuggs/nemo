That dude swims and can talk to seahorses, who are most probably AMAZING conversationalists! What? Who's AquaLAD? His young FRIEND? He rides a MANATEE!? He's a LAD? What the fuck is that?!\"\r\n\r\nBut then the SuperFriends toys came out in the early 80's and I was obsessed with the toys and the cartoon and discovered Batman. Since then, I have always admired Batman because he was a self-made super hero. He didn't get struck by lighting, fall in a toxic fire, get bit by a super smart ant, and wasn't from another planet or dimension. He was a rich, smart kid who watched his parents get murdered and he grew into a rich smart older dude who thirsted for revenge. He was Charles fucking Bronson, only HUMAN. He worked with the cops. He hooked up with girls based on their looks. He got hurt. He DETECTED. He lied. He loved. He wore a disguise because, even though its a fictional city, there are still fictional laws and you can't just go around revenge-killing because you're rich enough to have a Manor named after you. He even pulled some Leon The Professional shit and took in the extra responsibility of a kid only to turn that kid that wasn't his into a tiny, stupid-colored little version of him. That's good parenting. Whether he was cleaning up after the Joker had fled Arkham Asylum for the 8th time, or babysitting Gleek with the Wonder Twins, he kept his fucking cool, and bathed in vengeance. \r\n\r\nSo, to honor one of my favorite Super Heroes, I asked the now-ridiculously-popular-because-of-his-new-movie-which-may-be-one-of-my-favorite-movies-of-all-time, elusive hero to take some time to sit for me while I painted his portrait. He obliged, but what do you know, during the sitting, who decided to parachute in? A handful of Supervillains that WE BOTH THOUGHT WERE LOCKED UP OR DEAD!! But I guess that's the life of Batman.

He used to say it was ‘cause of guilt for her cheating on him before I was born. He said she felt bad ‘cause she knew in her heart that he wasn’t my real Dad. But Mom never cheated, and Dad was really my Dad. Either way, Dad’s always hated me. So when Mom starved to death when I was 9, Dad started being extra mean to me. He made me mow the lawn every day, which wasn’t that bad, except he made me bite down on a piece of wood to keep my muscles tight while I did it so that I would “get my man-strength”. But all it did was cut my mouth with splinters. He hit me a lot. Mostly when I would talk about Mom, or when I would beg to sleep inside ‘cause it was too cold in the shed. And he would make me shoot things too. “G’head, you point that rifle at them bunnies and you pull that trigger to get some fuckin’ hair on that little girl chest ‘a yours!” So I did it. Bunnies, squirrels, even the occasional cat that hopped our fence just because it was OUR property, he said. And it wasn’t even for food. Dad was a vegetarian. My childhood was disgusting.

Jackson O’Malley shuttered as he quickened his step past them.\r\n”Ummmff!” Jackson grunted as he fell to the ground tripping over a rather stubborn branch.\r\nOr WAS it a branch?\r\nLooking up, Jackson laid his eyes upon what must have\r\nbeen the ugliest, oldest withered scarecrow he had ever seen.\r\nIts putrid and sunken head looked like it must have been left over\r\nfrom last year’s crop of pumpkins, and a nice family\r\nof beetles were having their way with its rotted skin as beetles often do.\r\nOn further inspection, something odd stood out to Jaded Jackson.\r\nHe hadn’t tripped over a branch or a root, but rather a curled up withered claw,\r\nand it was grasping at something. In its rigor-mortised grip\r\nwas an orange ring with some odd symbols on it.\r\n“Well this is my lucky day”, thought Jackson as he broke the ring clear of the grasping claw.\r\n“I’ll just add this to my collection of Weird Things From the Pumpkin Patch”.\r\nThat collection didn’t really exist, however. This was actually the oddest thing\r\nhe had encountered at Mrs. Cottone’s Pumpkin Patch in all of the years he had been\r\nkicking off his Autumn and coming here\r\nA strange warmth pulsed through the ring as he held it,\r\nand as he slipped it over his finger two things happened.\r\nThe fallen scarecrow’s head abruptly shifted his gaze at the boy and a wicked grin\r\ngrew across the face of the scarecrow. Then immediately,\r\nJackson bent over vomiting in horrific pain.\r\nPumpkin seeds, alongside the gooey lining of the gourd that fills the sink\r\nas it’s carved each October, seemed to leap endlessly out of his mouth and nose.\r\nThen…all went black.\r\nWhen he awoke, the pumpkin patch was bathed in darkness.\r\nAll the guests had seemingly left to return to their T.V. trays and their nightly\r\nWheel of Fortune on the Zenith. Even the scarecrow, which had caused this strange\r\nhallucination earlier, was gone. Weirder yet, it appeared as though someone had switched\r\nhis clothes with the scarecrows. “Perverts”, he thought, “who would take the time to slip my clothes off and put these filthy tights on me.\r\nI hope no one took secret photos. I won’t here the end of it”.\r\nHe said the latter part out of this thought out loud but his voice was labored,\r\nas one seed from his earlier puke-fest still remained lodged in his throat.\r\nAs he swallowed it so as not to give in completely to the desires of his bitter bowels,\r\na little crackling voice whispered inside his ear: “Please…come over here”.\r\n“What!?”\r\n“It wasn’t a question.

the most secretive and mysterious of all of the Smurfs, Guilty Smurf kept to himself the entire time all of the other Smurfs were basking in the glory of the limelight from the Saturday morning cartoon show and the popular toys. In fact, there wasn’t a single MENTION of Guilty Smurf in all of Smurf-lore until after the…incident.\r\nEnvy had built up inside Guilty’s soul as he sat in the darkest mushroom apartment, silently pining for the attention and fame that the other Smurfs were getting. But he was too prideful and stubborn to join the party after they were famous.\r\nSo instead…he sat. And HATED.\r\nAfter 6 seasons of cartoons, he couldn’t take their arrogance any longer.\r\nIn one smurfy afternoon, Guilty emerged from his mushroom abode and bare-handedly slaughtered all 24 of those famous tiny blue fame-whores.\r\nAnd then, he did something the others could never do.\r\nHe murdered Gargamel and his pet cat Azrael, too.\r\nWith blood drenching his blue hands, Guilty Smurf returned to the now-quiet (and cancelled) Smurf village and slept quietly and happily forever.","options":[{"id":10637087,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United
