A wonderful six song EP of WAV quality songs on beautiful CD-R compact disc with a printed paper sleeve in a clear, plastic cd case featuring a crocheted goldfish with each purchase!\r\n\r\nDebut Release from Members of Gatsby's American Dream and Dr. Manhattan.\r\n\r\nThe long-distance musical project of Nic Newsham (Gatsby’s American Dream) and Nick Vombrack (Dr. Manhattan), PRINCESS DINOSAUR, looks to turn heads with the release of their debut EP, A Goldfish and his Friends.\r\n\r\nWhile taking notes from their past musical endeavors and combining it with their love of calm-yet-intense bands like Brand New, As Cities Burn, and Owen, Princess Dinosaur’s debut EP is filled with subtle guitars, grooving rhythms, and honest lyrics making for a refreshing spin on the typical, acoustic spin-off band of singers past. A Goldfish and his Friends lyrically journeys through past mistakes and future concerns while stressing the importance of honesty, and most of all to live in the moment.\r\n\r\nA Goldfish and his Friends tracklisting\r\n1.
