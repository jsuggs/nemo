I like the idea of a color representing someone being enveloped by the space they are in, and that's what this piece is about...the weight of space. \r\n\r\nFor me, Grey is such a powerful color. There is a heaviness to it that I just love and it's my favorite color to paint with.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an original oil painting on wood panel. It is 9 x 12 inches and has a 1.5 inch border.
