This new line of nests features natural beads. These beads have been carefully selected to create a nest that looks just like the ones we might see in trees. \r\n\r\nA mama’s bird nest necklace represents the special love that a mother has for her young. Each nest has eggs that represent children, family members or loved ones! This bird’s nest necklace with eggs is a sweet little necklace to gift to someone special, or to keep as a special treat for yourself. Each necklace is handmade, handwoven and hand-moulded to create a small nest that perfectly and gently nestle 3 precious “eggs.” These necklaces are perfect for moms, moms to-be, grandmas and even bridesmaids! Each nest is lovingly and carefully handmade with care, and each and every nest carries it’s own special meaning unique to the person wearing it. Eggs can be customized to represent birthmonths, favorite colors or anything you would like! What a perfect way to represent your loved ones! \r\n\r\nThe size of the nest is about 3/4 inch in diameter. Please note that each and every nest will be unique as they are handmade, but each and everyone will look pretty, I promise! :)\r\n\r\nThe difference between the thinner and thicker chain? (Please see the last picture). The thinner chain is dainty and thinner than the thicker chain. The thicker chain is recommended for those who will be wearing the necklace(s) around babies or toddlers. Otherwise, the thinner chain is a lovely match for the nest necklaces and is very fine, delicate and smoother than the thicker chain! \r\n\r\nCustom orders are welcome! Would you like one with different color or number of eggs? Or add initial charms? Initial charms are $1 each, and I can set up a custom listing for you for this as well :) Please click on the \"Request a Custom\" tab at the top and we can start designing your very own nest together! :)\r\n\r\nInformation about chain length:\r\n\r\nPlease specify at checkout if you'd like a 16, 17 or 18 inch chain.

Each nest has eggs that represent children, family members or loved ones! This bird’s nest necklace with agate eggs is a sweet little necklace to gift to someone special, or to keep as a special treat for yourself. Each necklace is handmade, handwoven and hand-moulded to create a small nest that perfectly and gently nestle 3 precious “eggs.” These necklaces are perfect for moms, moms to-be, grandmas and even bridesmaids! Each nest is lovingly and carefully handmade with care, and each and every nest carries it’s own special meaning unique to the person wearing it. Eggs can be customized to represent birthmonths, favorite colors or anything you would like! What a perfect way to represent your loved ones!\r\n\r\nThe size of the nest is about 3/4 inch in diameter. Please note that each and every nest will be unique as they are handmade, but each and everyone will look pretty, I promise! :)\r\n\r\nCustom orders are welcome! Would you like one with different color or number of eggs? Or add initial charms?

Please contact me beforehand if you need a chain length longer than standard lengths. Please message me and I can create a custom listing for you with your desired length :) Unless otherwise specified, the chain length will be approximately 18 inches.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the thinner and thicker chain? (Please see the last picture). The thinner chain is dainty and thinner than the thicker chain. The thicker chain is recommended for those who will be wearing the necklace(s) around babies or toddlers. Otherwise, the thinner chain is a lovely match for the nest necklaces and is very fine, delicate and smoother than the thicker chain!\r\nPlease note that this exact one may have been sold and that I will be making a brand new one just for you, so it may look slightly different than the one in the picture.

This bird’s nest necklace with pearl glass eggs is a sweet little necklace to gift to someone special, or to keep as a special treat for yourself. Each necklace is handmade, handwoven and hand-moulded to create a small nest that perfectly and gently nestle 3 precious “eggs.” These necklaces are perfect for moms, moms to-be, grandmas and even bridesmaids! Each nest is lovingly and carefully handmade with care, and each and every nest carries it’s own special meaning unique to the person wearing it. Eggs can be customized to represent birthmonths, favorite colors or anything you would like! What a perfect way to represent your loved ones! \r\n\r\nThe size of the nest is about 3/4 inch in diameter. Please note that each and every nest will be unique as they are handmade, but each and everyone will look pretty, I promise! :)\r\n\r\nThe difference between the thinner and thicker chain?

Each nest has eggs that represent children, family members or loved ones! This bird’s nest necklace with pearl glass eggs is a sweet little necklace to gift to someone special, or to keep as a special treat for yourself. Each necklace is handmade, handwoven and hand-moulded to create a small nest that perfectly and gently nestle  precious “eggs.” These necklaces are perfect for moms, moms to-be, grandmas and even bridesmaids! Each nest is lovingly and carefully handmade with care, and each and every nest carries it’s own special meaning unique to the person wearing it. Eggs can be customized to represent birthmonths, favorite colors or anything you would like! What a perfect way to represent your loved ones! \r\n\r\nThe size of the nest is about 3/4 inch in diameter. Please note that each and every nest will be unique as they are handmade, but each and everyone will look pretty, I promise! :)\r\n\r\nThe difference between the thinner and thicker chain? (Please see the last picture). The thinner chain is dainty and thinner than the thicker chain. The thicker chain is recommended for those who will be wearing the necklace(s) around babies or toddlers. Otherwise, the thinner chain is a lovely match for the nest necklaces and is very fine, delicate and smoother than the thicker chain! \r\n\r\nCustom orders are welcome! Would you like one with different color or number of eggs? Or add initial charms? Initial charms are $1 each, and I can set up a custom listing for you for this as well :) Please click on the \"Request a Custom\" tab at the top and we can start designing your very own nest together! :)\r\n\r\nInformation about chain length:\r\n\r\nPlease select from drop down menu if you'd like a 16, 17 or 18 inch chain. I can also do 16.5 or 17.5 inches. (Please message me to let me know if you'd like half sizes). Depending on availability, longer chains are also available at cost. Please contact me beforehand if you need a chain length longer than standard lengths. Please message me and I can create a custom listing for you with your desired length :) Unless otherwise specified, the chain length will be approximately 18 inches. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this exact one may have been sold and that I will be making a brand new one just for you, so it may look slightly different than the one in the picture. I promise it will look just as pretty! <3 \r\n\r\nEach necklace comes wrapped, ready to gift to yourself or someone special.\r\n\r\nShipping costs:\r\nCanada: $2.50; $1 per additional item\r\nUS: $4.00; $1 per additional item\r\nInternational: $6.50 ; $1 per additional item\r\n\r\n*if many are ordered at once, shipping prices may increase due to the increase in weight/size of package and envelope\r\n**if you require a tracking number or expedited shipping, shipping costs will increase. Please let me know before you place your order if you need a tracking number or expedited shipping.
