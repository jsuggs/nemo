The security staff would see the light from the TV through the window whilst sitting in the security office on the other side of the stadium and would come over.

By the time they had returned to the office, the TV would be back on again.\"\r\n\r\nIt has also been claimed that a woman hung herself in the loft of the old pub which is now used as offices and lights in the vicinity are known to go on and off.
