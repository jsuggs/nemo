The District Attorneys’ previous EP’s showed promise, but I didn’t anticipate them putting out an album of this quality.   -- Hear Ya\r\n\r\nSlowburner is a damn fine album, and--as a debut--a remarkably mature and consistent album.  -- <a href=\"http://whenyoumotoraway.blogspot.com/2012/05/review-district-attorneys-slowburner.html\">When You Motor Away </a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thedistrictattorneys?fref=ts\">DAs on Facebook</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/DAsnotfound\">DAs on Twitter</a>","options":[{"id":23169651,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0},{"amount_alone":3.25,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71817487/-/SLOWBURNER_COVER.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71817487/-/SLOWBURNER_COVER.png","width":747,"height":748},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76355340/-/4205162780-1.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76355340/-/4205162780-1.jpeg","width":750,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3729081,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":11417322,"name":"Teen Getaway - Hits and Missives","permalink":"teen-getaway-hits-and-missives","position":17,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/teen-getaway-hits-and-missives","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-28T03:27:47.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":35970531,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.25,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":1.25}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112348224/-/cover.2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112348224/-/cover.2.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112348890/-/liner.1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112348890/-/liner.1.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112349154/-/back.1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112349154/-/back.1.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3729081,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":13263333,"name":"Magnolia Mountain - Town & Country (Double Vinyl LP)","permalink":"magnolia-mountain-town-country-double-vinyl-lp","position":18,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/magnolia-mountain-town-country-double-vinyl-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-30T14:28:30.000Z","description":"18-song double album in gatefold sleeve featuring photographs by Michael Wilson.

Reflective. Powerful. Contemplative. Seething. Personal. Bold.\r\n\r\nSimply put, it’s a statement of purpose.\r\n\r\nWhere The Lies Begin is the debut record from The Pollies—a collection of songs that defy categorization and signal the arrival of this oft-buzzed-about Muscle Shoals, AL group onto the national scene.\r\n\r\n“It’s more of a statement that sums up the record,” explains lead singer and guitarist Jay Burgess. “It tells stories from my childhood to the present-day. As the record ends, there are definite points where I’m coming to terms and drawing conclusions from those stories.”\r\n\r\nJust like the stories that make up the record, the actual process of writing and recording Where The Lies Begin has been years in the making—literally. It began as the brainchild of Burgess and bassist Chris James, whose musical partnership began in Muscle Shoals group Sons of Roswell. While time ticked on, the lineup of the band went through changes. Life happened, as it always does. Nevertheless, work on the record continued.\r\n\r\nWhile members began settling into the group, the sound of The Pollies grew to reflect the diversity of its parts. Daniel Stoddard (Dylan LeBlanc) uses pedal steel, keys and effects to help create the sprawling soundscapes that anchor the songs. Matt Green (Belle Adair) provides a boldly melodic and experimental edge as lead guitarist. Ben Tanner (Alabama Shakes) adds the piano and organ touches of a seasoned veteran, and Reed Watson delivers a deep pocket groove on the drums, echoing a love for the soul music of Muscle Shoals’ lore.\r\n\r\nAnd with that, The Pollies are ready to be introduced the world. It’s been a long time coming, too. Anyone who knows this band knows that the journey to the release of this record has been, well, quite a journey. Where The Lies Begin acts as a snapshot of that time. To me and you, we call that “living life”. To The Pollies, it’s something worth singing about.\r\n\r\nNow, finally, you can hear why.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow along w/ The Pollies - \r\n<a href=\"http://www.polliesband.com\">Pollies Website</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thepollies\">Pollies on Facebook</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThePollies\">Pollies on Twitter</a>","options":[{"id":23169679,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71817695/-/polliescover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71817695/-/polliescover.jpg","width":837,"height":741},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/74818743/-/Pollies_Album_back__1_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/74818743/-/Pollies_Album_back__1_.jpg","width":1000,"height":921}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3729081,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":10706664,"name":"Cosmonaut on Vacation - Let the Moment Land","permalink":"cosmonaut-on-vacation","position":21,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cosmonaut-on-vacation","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-22T20:49:34.000Z","description":"Limited Edition debut full length cd from Birmingham, Alabama Psych Rock band Cosmonaut on Vacation.  \r\n\r\nCosmonaut on Vacation - Let The Moment Land\r\n\r\nCosmonaut on Vacation is space-pop a.k.a echo-ey and melodic rock-and-roll played loud and proud. Full stop. \r\n\r\nLET THE MOMENT LAND is born from the wildly inventive, collaborative world of the Birmingham, Alabama underground rock scene. In May 2011, Greg Slamen, formerly of Through the Sparks and Stateside, decided to start his own band and his own brand of spaced-out, psychedelic rock and roll. Influenced by the whimsy of the Kinks, attitude of the Brian Jonestown Massacre, the swagger of Oasis and the melodic arrangements of Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd, Slamen twisted seemingly simple chords into songs that ring fresh and inspired. He's not trying to reinvent the wheel. He just wants to drive the goddamn thing until they fall off. \r\n\r\nLike his Through The Sparks brethren, Slamen can be a studio rat. \"I love recording, even if it's stressful at times. I recorded a few tracks at [Les] Nuby's (Vulture Whale) Ol' Elegante [studio] and a few more at Jody Nelson's (Through The Sparks / Dorado) Alamalibu, and a couple of the tracks -- those electronic numbers -- I did those on my laptop. [The recording process] was the fun part for sure. It's the mixing and mastering that was excruciatingly but necessarily tedious.\"\r\n\r\n“Les Nuby was very supportive from the beginning when I told him about this idea that I wanted to make a solo record (of sorts!). He's been a sounding board and encouraging voice throughout the process of getting this record together-- everything from advice on the demos, to engineering some of the songs, to giving me feedback on the masters when I was done with the record. The same is true of Jody Nelson. And I should mention Shawn Avery. He's got the ears and some wild ideas about production. He definitely had some influence on the way this thing sounded.” Slamen found inspiration in the feedback, and, as he puts it, “ decided to take my record a bit more seriously after that. Like pizza boxes, empty beer bottles, and lots of standing around in my underwear mixing and doing retakes instead of sleeping and spending time with friends and family. “\r\n\r\nThis attention gave forth a bizarre, crunchy, spacey throwback of a record – an album from the time when albums mattered. The sounds of a strange journey, as one might imagine if a mission-weary 1980s Cosmonaut took a much needed vacation in a Adriatic beach town.

O'Keefe Cultural Center of Arts and Education in Ocean Springs, MS for a total of six days in May and September of 2012 to work on Translation Wave. With access to the building’s Scharr-Ello studio, performance arts room, and main theater the trio was once again free to explore their sound within high ceilings and stairwells in one of the coast's most richly and artistically diversified areas. Chris Staples (TwoThirtyEight, Discover America, Telekinesis) was invited in to engineer three of the EPs more percussion oriented tracks (BlackSound, Particle and Wave, Reynosa).\r\n\r\nIn this new collection of music we find a more intimate, cinematic, and sporadic group of songs. Translation Wave is an expression of how a band can morph and evolve from time on the road and turn to reflect on those experiences through instrumentation. Having already freed themselves of popular expectations on the previous album, El Cantador appears willing and able to take us anywhere at any time without notice. In the EP's first track, \"BlackSound”, the listener is greeted by a sparse and intricately picked out acoustic guitar riff alongside Underwood's immediate foretelling to \"Don't buy into most of my dreams/I'll make your head spin with my own disconnectivity\" - lyrics which imply Underwood's satisfaction in playing with language and could serve to intimate the EP's darker hues and cathartic uplifts. Translation Wave proudly hums with a warmth and rawness akin to older classic albums you might find in your local record bin.\r\n\r\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/elcantador \r\nhttp://facebook.com/elcantadorband","options":[{"id":30102179,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.75,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94541679/-/tumblr_mi6ijixpix1r1w0lko1_1280.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94541679/-/tumblr_mi6ijixpix1r1w0lko1_1280.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94541751/-/1362917794-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94541751/-/1362917794-1.jpg","width":600,"height":530}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3729081,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":13250391,"name":"Magnolia Mountain - Redbird Green (Compact Disc)","permalink":"magnolia-mountain-redbird-green-compact-disc","position":23,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/magnolia-mountain-redbird-green-compact-disc","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-29T21:27:33.000Z","description":"17-song double album on a single compact disc in a six-panel digipak (with insert) featuring the photography of Michael Wilson.

Breakups, Death, Day Jobs, Lawyers for the estate of Bob Marley, and those damn Dexateens… \r\nTidbits/Info on 13ghosts\r\n\r\nThe name is a reference not to the William Castle movie from 1960 or to the horrible 2001 remake, but to a collection of wonderfully haunting tales by Alabama folklorist Kathryn Tucker Windham called “13 Alabama Ghosts And Jeffrey” – required reading for Alabama elementary school kids.\r\n\r\nPitchfork gave the ghosts’ 2005 record Cicada a 7.9 rating and 2008’s Strangest Colored Lights a 7.6\r\n\r\nCicada gets pulled from distributors because of a copyright infringement on the ghosts re-working of a Bob Marley song and phrase - “Three Little Birds”.\r\n\r\nShortly after Strangest Colored Lights is released in 2008 Armstrong and the rest of the band re-convene in a studio in Birmingham and start recording what will become 2011’s Garland of Bottle Flies (Skybucket)\r\n\r\n13ghosts co-founder and co-songwriter (w/ Armstrong) Buzz Russell leaves the band in the middle of recording Garland of Bottle Flies.\r\n\r\nIn late 2008 / early 2009 Armstrong joined up and began touring and playing guitar with Alabama Rock Gods, The Dexateens…Some sort of Dexateens revival happens. They play more shows than they ever did in their 10+ years of existence.\r\n\r\nMay 2010 the road catches up to The Dexateens. They call it quits. Kind of…\r\n\r\nArmstrong gets uneasy and rallies the ghosts to go record a “where they are right now” record. Liar’s Melody gets delivered to the This Is American Music gang and within days of its delivery it is available immediately digitally via This Is American Music on August 15, 2011.\r\n\r\nSkybucket releases Garland Of Bottle Flies November 8, 2011. Available on cd/digital via Skybucket.\r\n\r\n13ghosts was Paste Magazine’s Artist Of The Day – December 13, 2011\r\n\r\nRecent Press for Liar’s Melody and Garland Of Bottle Flies – \r\n\"Liars Melody is the hardest, crunchiest, most aggressive album 13ghosts have ever made, one that reflects Armstrong’s tenure in the Dexateens\" - Paste Magazine\r\n\r\n\"Liar’s Melody is well sculpted, its balance of roots folk country bottled up with raisin’ hell southern rock.A well-crafted return from hiatus, 13ghosts’ Liar’s Melody will hold its own in modern southern rock and alt-country record bins.\" - Consequence Of Sound\r\n\r\n\"It’s a “where are they now” record, and judging by the music, where they are now is a pretty good place. The songs are alternately aggressive – the first song, Water, Rise, starts with what I can only call a buzz-saw of a bluesy riff – sweet, and filthily reflective, but they are all thrumming with life.\" - Now This Sound Is Brave\r\n\r\n“Garland sounds more like their previous albums, fraught with unsettled conflicts and sundered relationships. The fruit of his perseverance is an album that sounds both enthrallingly messy and meticulously constructed, setting up camp in a bleak landscape where few other Southern rock bands will even set foot. – Paste Magazine\r\n\r\n“We’re not sure what delayed “Bottle Flies” and its eventual release on the Birmingham-based Skybucket Records, but it’s definitely a case of better late than never: Armstrong’s writing is as dark and quick-witted as ever, and his band’s Son Volt-like mix of scuzzy barroom rock and alt-country twang is in top form.” - Atlanta MetroMix","options":[{"id":28568861,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/89589758/-/artworks-000017392028-dcu6ty-original.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/89589758/-/artworks-000017392028-dcu6ty-original.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3729081,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":8943293,"name":"Dorado - Anger, Hunger, Love and the Fear of Death","permalink":"dorado-anger-hunger-love-and-the-fear-of-death","position":26,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dorado-anger-hunger-love-and-the-fear-of-death","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-14T21:05:30.000Z","description":"Dorado - Anger, Hunger, Love and the Fear of Death \r\n\r\nDORADO. Wrong blues.  Bad art.  \"Get ready for this. It's like Zevon's ghost and Nick Cave knife-fighting over which track on Pet Sounds they prefer to worship the dark lord to.\" - Chris Porter\r\n\r\nAlamalibu is sometimes reported to be a recording studio, but it is more accurately-described as a mystical nook out back behind the dimensional door.  That is, if it even exists at all.  But, if it does, it is the kind of place where Birmingham, Alabama’s resident mad genius / sonic impresario Jody Nelson can guide a merry band of musical cohorts to places most have never heard – and make us wonder why they were so hard to find.   Nelson, the scion of the should-be-legendary band Through The Sparks. gathered a group of  his TTS collaborators and other Birmingham musicians (including TiAM sister Helen Gassenheimer) for a magical ride through the alternate universe of Alamalibu and brought forth a gloriously weird vision of American rock music.  Freed from the bounds of propriety, linear thought, conventional wisdom, fear of failure, microeconomic theory, psychological stability, and a rumored restraining order (as yet unconfirmed), Dorado grabbed hold of the exhilarating, libertine desire to just play the living hell out of a whole bunch of majestic, provocative, oddly complimentary pieces of rock music without a second thought of how things are done by those in search of a radio hit or a commercial jingle. There had been discussions for a while about working on a project with TiAM, and a desire to do something, well, different - and the two impulses seemed to fit together perfectly.  \r\n\r\nOr, in the alternative universe of Dorado, things may not be at all as they appear.  Maybe some friends got together and just wanted to play some music, with a few different folks than the regular band, and some new songs that had come to life as off-kilter troubadour pieces but which showed promise of blooming into something very, very different.    To have fun with it.  To go for it.  Damn the torpedoes. Channeling this impulse, Nelson says, \"I wanted this record to be narrative but without a setting, like Quetzocoatl on his way to work at an office park. It's all modern myth and pseudo science.\" But if you mistook such a carefree approach for a deliberate effort to create the most arresting album of literate skronky beautiful art-rock you’re likely to hear in 2013, well, it would be an understandable mistake.  This is the way of Dorado – the result does not necessarily have to flow from the intention.\r\n\r\nSome things just won’t do in a pinch.  Sometimes the muse wants to dance, all night long.

These were all influences in the Muscle Shoals area where musician/artist Browan Lollar was raised, from his early experience with music in his father’s church to his time playing with several bands and local musicians in the Shoals. After years as a sought-after guitar player in the Southern independent music scene, Browan is releasing his solo debut, the EP For The Givers And The Takers.\r\n\r\nChances are you’ve heard or seen Browan play before – whether in his 6-year stint with Jason Isbell & The 400 Unit, his work with Saddle Creek artists Azure Ray, or his playing with emerging Shoals band The Pollies. Now, after relocating to Birmingham, Browan is stepping forward to the mic and unveiling this set of songs written during his time playing with the 400 Unit and The Pollies. His collaborators on the record are a Who’s Who of the up-and-coming new music scene taking shape in the Shoals, including The Pollies and members of the Alabama Shakes, Lauderdale, Doc Dailey and Magnolia Devil, and TheBear. The EP was produced by Browan and The Pollies’ Jay Burgess, with recording and engineering work from the Shakes’ Ben Tanner and Lauderdale’s Niles Lee, and was mastered by Matt Pence (who happens to play in one of Lollar’s favorite bands, Texas indie stalwarts Centro-matic). But the process was a loose, collaborative one and did not necessarily involve the kind of defined roles that would involve the assignment of titles – “Everyone knew what to do, so there wasn’t a lot of discussion about the process. Everyone was very professional, and very talented,” says Lollar.\r\n\r\nThe songs reflect a period of transition for Lollar and also his broad musical palette – there are elements of rock, jangly pop, classic country, and Shoals R&B, sprinkled with a healthy dose of the rising Southern indie sound. “I’d just call it a rock record” is the way Browan describes it. For The Givers And Takers is a finely-wrought work of artisanal craft, and reveals that in addition to his already well-known skills as a player, Lollar possesses a talented voice – both with the pen and behind the mic. And, as Levon would say, “it dances.”\r\n\r\nAlbum Credits - \r\nFor The Givers And The Takers\r\n\r\nProduced by Browan Lollar and Jay Burgess \r\nRecorded at Studio 144 in Greenhill, Alabama \r\nAdditional recording done at The Nutthouse in Sheffield, Alabama \r\nTrack 1 engineered by Ben Tanner \r\nTracks 2, 3, 4, 5 engineered by Jay Burgess \r\nTracks 1, 2, 3, 4 mixed by Niles Lee \r\nTrack 5 mixed by Ben Tanner \r\nMastered by Matt Pence at Echo Lab in Denton, Texas\r\n\r\nHorns by Seven Points Horns \r\nStrings on track 3 by Kimi Samson \r\nArrangement by Kimi Samson and Browan Lollar \r\nTambourine on 3 by Reed Watson \r\nHarmony vocal on 5 by Amber Murray \r\nThe musicians: Jay Burgess, Chris James, Jon Davis, Daniel Stoddard, Ben Tanner\r\n\r\nBrowan uses Reverend Guitars, Sommatone Amplification and Baxendale Acoustic Guitars\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:///www.facebook.com/browanlollarmusic\">Browan on the web</a>","options":[{"id":27063933,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.75,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.25}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84828657/-/Givers_TakersCoverSMALL.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84828657/-/Givers_TakersCoverSMALL.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3729081,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":8623536,"name":"Browan Lollar - 3 Brothers print","permalink":"browan-lollar-3-brothers-print","position":32,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/browan-lollar-3-brothers-print","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-19T18:34:22.000Z","description":"10 x 10 print of \"3 Brothers\" \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:///www.facebook.com/browanlollarmusic\">Browan on the web</a>","options":[{"id":27065007,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":4.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/84834369/-/photo__18_.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/84834369/-/photo__18_.JPG","width":640,"height":478}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3729085,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]},{"id":7408693,"name":"Bohannons - Unaka Rising","permalink":"bohannons-unaka-rising","position":33,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bohannons-unaka-rising","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-01T06:27:28.000Z","description":"The Bohannons inhabit a musical universe that, while certainly drawing influence from all over, is firmly rooted in their Tennessee home.  With Unaka Rising, they are clearly taking their homegrown, handcrafted rock to a new level, and we think they’ve set the bar pretty damn high with this one. The album’s title references the Unaka province of East Tennessee and western North Carolina— “One of the finest areas in all the world,” according to singer/guitarist Marty Bohannon.  The region has certainly fueled the Bohannon’s fire, providing endless stories and situations from which these songs draw. With a quiver of new material ready to follow up 2011’s stellar EP, Days of Echo, the Bohannons spent the better part of the last year tearing up the road between Chattanooga and Athens, GA where they recorded Unaka Rising at Chase Park Transduction, first with David Barbe and later Drew Vandenberg. \r\n\r\nRecorded by David Barbe and Drew Vandenberg at Chase Park Transduction in Athens, GA 2011-2012\r\n\r\nMixed by Tom Lewis at Chase Park Transduction\r\n\r\nMastered by Tom Lewis at Studio 1093 Athens, GA\r\n\r\nIn loving memory of John Johnson\r\n\r\nall songs by bohannons. lyrics to goodbye bill by ethel raim and joe hill\r\n\r\nspecial thanks to, bird, monster, alex, mattie, margaret, joey, kaycee, billy joe johnson, mike and alex at tiny buzz, the leg, lee bains III and glory fires, porkchop, jimmy, TIAM, corey, nick, jay, sean, murray, zach hobbs, chuck crowder, zack cooper, jason heaton, john bohemia, crazy lou harris, ms. re. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.chattanoogapulse.com/articles/meet-the-bohannons/page-2.html\">Meet The Bohannons </a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://thebohannons.org/\">Bohannons on The Web\r\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Bohannons\">Bohannons on Facebook </a>\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bohannons\">Bohannons on Twitter","options":[{"id":23424241,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.25},{"amount_alone":4.75,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72694151/-/unaka_rising_album_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72694151/-/unaka_rising_album_cover.jpg","width":457,"height":433}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3729081,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":7765494,"name":"Some Dark Holler - Hollow Chest","permalink":"some-dark-holler-hollow-chest","position":34,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/some-dark-holler-hollow-chest","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-31T14:48:22.000Z","description":"Combining equal parts Steve Earle, the Civil Wars, and Breaking Bad, bandleader Chris Porter (Back Row Baptists) and fiddler Helen Gassenheimer bring a mix of vocal and instrumental stylings that are as flawlessly harmonious as they are dark and haunting. Hollow Chest explores and exposes the South's gritty underbelly and its rawest nerves. Each tale is made all the more personal by the Porter's dry, gravelly snarl-- a voice perfect for his broken characters who would seem all but damned if not for the angelic redemption found in Gassenheimer's harmonies. Straightforward, uncomplicated, and unpolished, these songs resonate like the old Appalachian ballads from which they are clearly inspired. Their simple potency is highlighted by the understated production skills of Jody Nelson (Through the Sparks). Fans of acoustic music and vocal chemistry will find Hollow Chest remarkable both for the prowess of its players and the dark beauty of its songwriting. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Some-Dark-Holler/175011099220063\">Some Dark Holler on the web</a>","options":[{"id":24513741,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.75,"amount_with_others":1.25,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.0},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76251600/-/Digital-Front.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76251600/-/Digital-Front.jpeg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76251756/-/Digtial-Back-new.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76251756/-/Digtial-Back-new.jpeg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/76255236/-/photo__9_.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/76255236/-/photo__9_.JPG","width":640,"height":478}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3729081,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":7320343,"name":"Tedo Stone - Happy EP","permalink":"tedo-stone-happy-ep","position":35,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tedo-stone-happy-ep","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-09-22T06:26:08.000Z","description":"“Tedo Stone’s music lies somewhere between The Jayhawks and Gram Parsons, and then heavily dosed with psychedelic fuzziness.
