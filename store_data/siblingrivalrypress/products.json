Wetlaufer documents the search for comfort and deliverance in language rich with materiality and great pleasure. The lyrical vivacity of these poems reveals a world where bodies are capable of miracles and deterioration, tremendous loss, and grace.\r\n\r\nMark Wunderlich says of this title, \"The mysterious acts in Valerie Wetlaufer’s striking debut are many, and those acts are magnified by her keen attention to the ruptures and illusions of human longing.  Love and Eros are threaded through her taut lines, her finely crafted stanzas.  Perhaps most startling are the poems in which Wetlaufer takes her readers back into a reconstructed and imagined past in which a 19th century Midwestern woman’s psyche and passion, her madness and her revenges and loves are made manifest, imagined, shaped and voiced.  History here is harrowed, made new, made strange by being brought into language, into the light.  <b>Mysterious Acts by My People</b> marks the arrival of a poet who possesses great gifts of imagination, spirit, music and heart.\" \r\n\r\nTHIS IS A PRE-ORDER TITLE .

Brock Guthrie's territory is bone-deep bafflement as lived by young men who know that their strategic responses (alcohol, risk-taking, bellicosity, deadpan hard-edge irony, hilarity) to tedium and confusing desire won't bring enough understanding or freedom.  The wonderful rare comedy of Guthrie's work flows from defiant persistence in a world that feels rigged against individual dignity.

All the love, violence and need of a life-time happen in the time it takes to read this brilliant, brief and searing new book by Donnelle McGee. I was altered by the reading of it. Then I read it again.”\r\n\r\n– Bhanu Kapil, author of Incubation: a space for monsters and Schizophrene\r\n\r\n“Donnelle McGee finds the intersection of elegy, violence and eros in Shine. His novella etches into language the longing, bewilderment, affection, and grief of lovers, family members, and strangers. Crafted in finely compressed narrative fragments, McGee's story details the kind of material and psychic anguish most American writers would rather not consider. McGee gazes into the most difficult material unflinchingly. His pacing and language will keep you hooked with astonishing understatement and compassion.

You will never pick up a pen, a lover, or a book of poetry quite in the same way again.\r\n\r\nREVIEW BY RICHARD LABONTE:\r\n\r\nGavin lived in Hawaii. Eric lived in New York. Facebook brought them together – Gavin, a former porn star, life-long poet, one-time chef and sometime hermit in his 50s, responded to an admiring post from Eric, a poet 15 years his junior. This two-author collection of 111 poems – almost one a day from one to the other over two months – is the result. Playful and passionate, lusty and seductive, erotic and philosophical, their poem-fueled cyber-romance was to culminate in a joint “nude poet” reading in San Francisco – the first time the two men would meet in person. “I will be holding you in a few hours,” writes Eric in his last poem, emailed as his plane is landing in Oakland; and “I want...to breathe for a night – for four nights – the same bepassioned air,” writes Gavin in the besotted collection’s final poem. Did reality match expectation? This book ends at the brink of both the storytelling and sexual climax. Which is as it should be. The best romances are open-ended.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":13593123,"name":"Default","price":15.25,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43583195/-/Nocturnal_Omissions.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43583195/-/Nocturnal_Omissions.jpg","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41007175/-/Nocturnal_Back_Cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41007175/-/Nocturnal_Back_Cover.jpg","width":673,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1693333,"name":"Full-Length Poetry","permalink":"full-length-poetry","url":"/category/full-length-poetry"}]},{"id":5124281,"name":"BISEXUAL BOOK AWARDS FINALIST: Shine by Donnelle McGee: An SRP Novella (eBOOK)","permalink":"shine-by-donnelle-mcgee","position":53,"price":4.99,"default_price":4.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/shine-by-donnelle-mcgee","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-12-22T01:42:28.000Z","description":"<b>Shine by Donnelle McGee\r\nFeaturing cover art by Catskills Photography\r\nAn SRP Novella\r\nISBN: 978-1-937420-13-0\r\nAvailable in mobi (Kindle), ePub (iPad, iPhone, Nook, Adobe Digital), and .pdf formats\r\nDelivered instantly via e-mail from the SRP Store.\r\n</b>\r\n\r\nThe story of a young hustler who navigates streets, sex, and family, only to discover the light of the dark can be cruel...\r\n\r\n<b>PRAISE FOR SHINE</b>\r\n\r\n“Donnelle McGee's powerful, poetic prose gives Shine a unique voice that is fresh, bold and completely seductive.

His novella etches into language the longing, bewilderment, affection, and grief of lovers, family members, and strangers.

McGee gazes into the most difficult material unflinchingly. His pacing and language will keep you hooked with astonishing understatement and compassion.

The resulting collection of love letters and hate mail audaciously perforates the scene of the usual cultural suspects with icy shrapnel in a terrifying mirror game.  This is not a biography, but a book that reflects Andy--detects him, the Andy who deflects.\r\n\r\nWorking into territory that channels the essay as its more radical practitioners imagine, Megan revives the prose poem and rethinks herself.  As the idea of a \"real\" Andy begins to decay, the author learns to invent him and discovers herself everywhere.  Remaking this mythic man in the image of her own baggage, Megan gives us her most personal writing to date and a striking truth: everybody becomes Andy.\r\n\r\nOrder through SRP and receive 10% off the retail price of $14.95!

Jacob Pratt, a quiet man with an abusive past, is obsessed with the art of killing. When their lives intersect, so do their obsessions, and as the real becomes surreal, there’s a distinct possibility Harry won’t last through the night.\r\n\r\nLeigh Binder’s <i>How to Kill Harry</i> will change the way you view cabbies—and every chance encounter you have between dark and dawn.

It could be your town. Hell, it probably is.\r\n\r\nIf you are a fan of Chuck Palahniuk, you’ll dig this book. If you are an armchair philosopher, you’ll dig this book.

Through whispers and screams, her words shatter the glass of the page; and when the conversation is over, a song of strength reverberates.\r\n\r\n\"There’s a new TSE joining the ranks of English language poets. With VOICES THROUGH SKIN, Theresa Senato Edwards establishes herself as a no-holds-barred chronicler of the gut-wrenching feelings of love, loneliness, loss, guilt, and sometimes, in the end, redemption. Only the most gifted poets can bring such searing insight into the darkest hidden corners of the human condition.\" - Marist College’s Gloria Brownstein\r\n\r\n\"Theresa Senato Edwards is not afraid to place before the readers’ eyes topics of incipient delicacy as breast cancer, passionless physical responsibility sessions, death, lupus, physical abuse, those idiosyncratic ways we all face the big events in life and after. Even her style of writing invites the eye to jerk across the page and gather the momentum of her messages as though a willing captive. Secrets whispered, memories distorted by time and incidents – she touches these with a sense of veracity that makes us stop and relate.

The resulting collection of love letters and hate mail audaciously perforates the scene of the usual cultural suspects with icy shrapnel in a terrifying mirror game. This is not a biography, but a book that reflects Andy--detects him, the Andy who deflects.\r\n\r\nWorking into territory that channels the essay as its more radical practitioners imagine, Megan revives the prose poem and rethinks herself. As the idea of a \"real\" Andy begins to decay, the author learns to invent him and discovers herself everywhere. Remaking this mythic man in the image of her own baggage, Megan gives us her most personal writing to date and a striking truth: everybody becomes Andy.","options":[{"id":15922589,"name":".mobi (Kindle)","price":6.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15922591,"name":".epub (iPad, Nook, iPhone)","price":6.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":15922653,"name":".pdf","price":6.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47979249/-/Warholia-FrontCoverFINAL.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47979249/-/Warholia-FrontCoverFINAL.jpg","width":600,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47979263/-/Sonics_Back.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47979263/-/Sonics_Back.jpg","width":663,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47979321/-/SRPe-graphic.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47979321/-/SRPe-graphic.jpg","width":466,"height":662}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2613001,"name":"eBooks","permalink":"ebooks","url":"/category/ebooks"}]},{"id":15125331,"name":"Remain In Light: The Venus Trilogy Book Two by Collin Kelley (eBOOK)","permalink":"remain-in-light-the-venus-trilogy-book-two-by-collin-kelley-ebook","position":75,"price":6.99,"default_price":6.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/remain-in-light-the-venus-trilogy-book-two-by-collin-kelley-ebook","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-26T21:30:51.000Z","description":"<b>Available in mobi (Kindle) and ePub (iPad, iPhone, Nook, Adobe Digital).

When a rebellious streak leads to her ex-communication, she decides to hit the road. Corona moves between Razia’s childhood and the comedic misadventures she encounters on her journey, from a Puritan Colony in Massachusetts to New York City’s Bhangra music scene. With each story, we learn more about the past she’s escaping, a past which leads her to constantly travel in a spiral, always coming closer to but never quite arriving home.\r\n\r\n<b>THIS IS AN eBOOK title.
