The statue, a gift to the United States from the people of France, is of a robed female figure representing Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom, who bears a torch and a tabula ansata (a tablet evoking the law) upon which is inscribed the date of the American Declaration of Independence. A broken chain lies at her feet. The statue has become an icon of freedom and of the United States.\r\n\r\nOur artistic take on the classic symbol of liberty expresses a juxtaposition on the freedoms of street art with the freedom to Engage in it \r\n\r\nThe original perfect crew-it doesn't get any better than this tee.
