These are photographs taken by professional photo-journalists and 'civilian' photographers, chronicling protests, funerals and acts of terrorism as well as the more ordinary stuff of life: drinking tea; kissing girls; watching trains.\r\n\r\nBelfast Exposed was founded in 1983 as a response to concern over the careful control of images depicting British military activity during the Troubles. Whenever an image in this archive was chosen, approved or selected, a blue, red or yellow dot was placed on the surface of the contact sheet as a marker. The position of the dots provided us with a code; a set of instructions for how to frame the photographs in this book. Each of the circular photographs shown on the previous pages reveals the area beneath these circular stickers; the part of each image that has been obscured from view the moment it was selected. Each of these fragments – composed by the random gesture of the archivist - offers up a self-contained universe all of its own; a small moment of desire or frustration or thwarted communication that is re-animated here after many years in darkness.\r\n\r\nThe marks on the surface of the contact strips – across the image itself – allude to the presence of many visitors. These include successive archivists, who have ordered, catalogued and re-catalogued this jumble of images. For many years the archive was also made available to members of the public, and sometimes they would deface their own image with a marker pen, ink or scissors. So, in addition to the marks made by generations of archivists, photo editors, legal aides and activists, the traces of these very personal obliterations are also visible. They are the gestures of those who wished to remain anonymous.\r\n\r\nAdam Broomberg and Oliver Chanarin have been collaborating for over a decade. They have produced six books which in different ways examine the language of documentary photography; Trust (2000) accompanied their first solo-show at The Hasselblad Center; Ghetto (2003) a collection of their work as editors and principal photographers of Colors magazine, was exhibited at the Victoria & Albert Museum; Mr. Mkhize's Portrait (2004) documented South Africa ten years after apartheid and accompanied a solo show at The Photographer's Gallery; Chicago (2006), an exploration of contemporary Israel was published by SteidlMACK in conjunction with a solo-show at The Stedelijk Museum; Fig. was published in Autumn 2007, by Steidl & Photoworks, to accompany solo exhibitions at the John Hansard Gallery and Impressions Gallery, UK. The Red House (2007), produced in the solitary confinement cells hidden below the Ba'athist Party headquarters in Iraq, is published by Steidl Editions. Broomberg and Chanarin regularly teach workshops and give master classes in photography, as well as teaching on the MA in Documentary Photography at LCC in London and the MFA at the School of Visual Arts in New York. They are the recipients of numerous awards, including the Vic Odden Award from the Royal Photographic Society and the 2013 Deutsche Börse Photography Prize.\r\n\r\n2011, MACK, 416 pages, 8.5 x 9.25 inches, hardcover with circular photo inset","options":[{"id":46991952,"name":"Default","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127005474/-/people1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127005474/-/people1.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127003383/-/people2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127003383/-/people2.jpg","width":1440,"height":960},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127003398/-/people3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127003398/-/people3.jpg","width":1440,"height":960},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127003413/-/people4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127003413/-/people4.jpg","width":1440,"height":960}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4538261,"name":"Photography","permalink":"photography","url":"/category/photography"},{"id":4541978,"name":"Distributed Products","permalink":"distributed-products","url":"/category/distributed-products"},{"id":6547653,"name":"Of The Ordinary Bookstore","permalink":"of-the-ordinary-bookstore","url":"/category/of-the-ordinary-bookstore"}]},{"id":14654268,"name":"Your Time Is Gonna Come - Jason Lazarus","permalink":"your-time-is-gonna-come-jason-lazarus","position":8,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/your-time-is-gonna-come-jason-lazarus","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-06T05:37:42.000Z","description":"Chicago-based photographer Jason Lazarus (born 1975) is known for using both traditionally developed photography as well as found and solicited images and texts in collaborative installations.

Cohen, a celebrated trove of more than 20,000 vernacular and found anonymous photographs from the early to mid-twentieth century. Gathered from flea markets, dealers and Ebay, these prints have been acquired, exhibited and included in a range of major museum publications. In organizing the archive into a series of thematic catalogues, she has pursued an alternate reading of the collection, drifting away from simple typology into something more personal, intuitive and openly poetic. Her magical new artist's book, Dive Dark Dream Slow, is rooted in the mystery and delight of the \"found\" image and the \"snapshot\" aesthetic, but pushes beyond the nostalgic surface of these pictures and reimagines them as luminous transmissions of anxious sensuality. Through a series of abandoned visual clues, from the sepia-infused shadow of a little girl running along a beach to silhouettes of a group of distant figures pausing upon a steep and snowy hill, a dreamlike journey is evoked. Like an album of pop songs about a girl (or a civilization) hovering on the verge of transformation, the book cycles through overlapping themes and counter-themes--moon and ocean; violence and tenderness; innocence and experience; masks and nakedness--that sparkle with deep psychic longing and apocalyptic comedy.\r\n\r\nShortlisted for the 2012 Paris-Photo-Aperture Foundation PhotoBook Award.\r\n\r\n2012, The Ice Plant, 88 pages, 7.5 x 9.25 inches, color, hardcover","options":[{"id":48620310,"name":"Default","price":29.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128074881/-/dream.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128074881/-/dream.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4538255,"name":"Artist's Books","permalink":"artist-s-books","url":"/category/artist-s-books"},{"id":4538261,"name":"Photography","permalink":"photography","url":"/category/photography"},{"id":4541978,"name":"Distributed Products","permalink":"distributed-products","url":"/category/distributed-products"},{"id":6547653,"name":"Of The Ordinary Bookstore","permalink":"of-the-ordinary-bookstore","url":"/category/of-the-ordinary-bookstore"}]},{"id":14649798,"name":"In This Dark Wood - Elisabeth Tonnard (self published)","permalink":"in-this-dark-wook-elisabeth-tonnard-self-published","position":15,"price":65.0,"default_price":65.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/in-this-dark-wook-elisabeth-tonnard-self-published","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-06T01:38:42.000Z","description":"\"This book is a modern gothic.

Once commonplace in every home,  the photo album has been replaced in the digital age by the storage of images online and on hard drives.

Commonly a repository of family history,  they usually represented a manufactured family as edited for display.

After producing seminal exhibitions and publications as curator at George Eastman House in Rochester, New York, in the 1960s, he founded the Visual Studies Workshop, an independent arts organization where his innovative programs trained a new generation of photographers, critics, curators, and historians. Nathan Lyons: Selected Essays, Lectures, and Interviews provides the first comprehensive overview of Lyons’s career as one of the most important voices in American photography.\r\n\r\nOf primary importance in this volume are Lyons’s own writings, gathered here for the first time. These include essays and articles formulated while Lyons was a young curator, as well as early statements about his own artistic practice and his emerging philosophy of photographic education. Important unpublished lectures are presented here, most significantly “Photography and the Picture Experience,” Lyons’s groundbreaking lecture on the snapshot, and “Sequential Considerations,” addressing photographic sequence and visual books. Lyons’s recent projects bring this volume up to the present.\r\n\r\nContributions from other scholars include essays by James Borcoman, Joel Eisinger, Vicki Goldberg, Keith Smith, Anne Wilkes Tucker, and Adam D. Weinberg. Also featured are interviews with Lyons by Maria Antonella Pelizzari, Thomas Dugan, Bob Rogers, and Robert Hirsch, and a newly translated interview by Joan Fontcuberta. Two selections in this volume are drawn from rare unpublished audio recordings made by Lyons in the 1960s: the first, a 1965 interview with Paul Strand on the subject of photographic books, and the second, an extensive discussion with photographers Simpson Kalisher and Garry Winogrand recorded in 1966.\r\n\r\nJessica S. McDonald is Assistant Curator of Photography at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and a doctoral candidate in the Visual and Cultural Studies program at the University of Rochester, New York.

Each copy of the magazine, limited to a retail edition of just 1,000, represents an original collectable unto itself. As with the previous six issues, the content comprises six short works of fully illustrated fiction and six international artist portfolios.\r\n\r\nFction contributions include Gloria Beth Amodeo’s clever and eerily humorous tale titled “Repository Emporium,” illustrated with gorgeously rendered graphite drawings by Kirsten Flaherty. Ben Fleming offers a choreographed spiral through an afternoon of endurance with “Five Out of Six Ain’t Bad,” punctuated by a collaborative effort among illustrators Joo Chung and Chang Park; Regino Gonzales; Young Heller; Kenici Hoshine; and Rachel Pontious. “What the Fire Cost Us,” written by Nick Kolakowski, delves into the lives of multiple generations of a rural family, accompanied by violent and personal black and white illustrations from graphic artist Myles Karr. Erin Browne’s “Good Dog” is a powerful commentary about the lives of post war veterans coupled with illustrations by renowned artist Marshall Arisman; this one-act play was originally based on an etching by Carrier Pigeon contributor Frances Jetter as part of a public, collaborative event produced in New York by Flux Theatre Ensemble. Poet Todd Colby provides twelve beautifully crafted poems, which are complemented by Ray Jones’ thoughtful ink work; the combination yields the kind of great trip progressive American poetry and art have been making together for more than a century. “Clarence Belk” is a satisfyingly dark, psychological conceit from return contributors Daniel Borrelli and artist Max Kahan.\r\n\r\nThe first of the fine-art portfolios is a collection of mixed media works by Steve Johnson, who depicts often-overlooked animals competing over their small corners of the Earth. Etcher Craig Shannon shares a collection of that focuses on the physical presence of the body. Adam Lister, painter of the issue’s front cover and creator of the DIY sculpture, also provides a portfolio of images depicting other recent sculptures combining magnets with abstract paintings. Lister’s work is colorful, geometric and cool. Natalya Balanova uses etchings to explore inner landscapes featuring imaginary people, plants, animals and other living objects. Hye Young Shin contributes a fascinating portfolio of large-format, exquisite graphite drawings and lithographs of the human body from her “We Are” series, as well as photographs of her absorbing foot washing performances, accompanied by personal texts. Kreh Mellick’s uneasy alliance with 19th-century folk art yields a series of limited-color, narrative figure drawings that round out the issue.\r\n\r\nVolume II issue 3 of Carrier Pigeon magazine is full-color, 10”x13” and totals 148 pages. The cover is printed on 240g Rendezvous paper, and the text pages are printed on Rendezvous 106g paper. The issue designer is Irving Grunbaum, an advertising designer, photographer and sculptor in New York.\r\n\r\nEach copy of Carrier Pigeon Vol. II issue 3 includes a unique cover design that contains components for a DIY, magnetic, paper sculpture by Adam Lister.
