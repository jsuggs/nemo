It makes me smile.\r\n\r\nThe kid in me knows you can never have enough purple, so I lined the bag in deep purple linen, with a double interior pocket sized perfectly for you phone and valuables, and a magnetic snap to keep the bag securely closed. \r\n\r\nAs with all my bags I cut the strap by hand, and made it fully adjustable with two antique brass coloured d-rings. \r\n\r\nAn antique brass coloured hoop suspended on a leather strap drapes over the top of the bag and down its front, helping to keep the bag closed when the magnetic snap is not in use. \r\n\r\nBag measurements:\r\n\r\nWidth at opening: approx 8\"\r\nWidth at base: 10\"\r\nBag height: approx 9.5\"\r\nStrap length: approx 40\" when fully lengthened\r\n\r\nPlease note that this bag is hand crafted from natural materials. Slight imperfections are an inherent part of hand made products, and add to their character and uniqueness. As this bag is made of wool, treat it with care and remove any pills or loose fibers gently.  \r\n\r\n  ","options":[{"id":44472660,"name":"Default","price":210.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125236554/-/DSC_0696.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125236554/-/DSC_0696.jpg","width":3072,"height":3072},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125236566/-/DSC_0706.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125236566/-/DSC_0706.jpg","width":3072,"height":3072},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125236581/-/DSC_0711.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125236581/-/DSC_0711.jpg","width":3072,"height":3072}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6313845,"name":"Hand bag","permalink":"hand-bag","url":"/category/hand-bag"}]}]
