It is particularly popular in Europe where it is commonly used to relieve teething pain in infants.\r\n\r\nChildren's amber necklaces (36-38cm) have reportedly been beneficial for children experiencing \"growing pains\", headache or neckache. Amber has also been reported to be effective in the management of eczema.\r\n\r\nAmber is not a stone - it is fossilised tree sap. Baltic amber contains succinic acid which is a natural analgesic. The lighter and cloudier amber contains the highest levels of succinic acid.\r\n\r\nEvery piece of amber jewellery is uniquely handcrafted in Lithuania. Every bead is individually knotted to ensure beads are not lost in the event of breakage. The screw clasp should secure the amber against the skin to achieve the best therapeutic benefit.","options":[{"id":22285321,"name":"dark
