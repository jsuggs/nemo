These are a smaller and more random version of my regular Kaleidoscope batts. They don’t have a set list of ingredients, but will never contain alpaca, mohair, or angora (because I have allergies, and I know a lot of you do too!), and may or may not contain sparkle. The color blending is also much more random and will produce a very tweedy yarn in most instances.
