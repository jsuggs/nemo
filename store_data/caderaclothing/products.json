We didn't want to simply purchase a Pin Up 101 kit. We wanted the right person, the right attitude, the right look. The shoes, the purse, the flower, the dress…everything needed to be accurate. Our goal was for the Pin Up Culture to look at the image and say, ‘they did it right’. \r\n\r\nSexy, smart, quick on her feet, and hardworking. We felt these characteristics needed to represent LaDama. The answer, MissVhaven. We at Cadera cannot express how fortunate we were to find a real life Dama in MissVhaven. Not only is she flat out stunning, but her personality is equally just as beautiful. The most amazing part of MissVhaven is that we didn't have to do anything in transforming her into a Pin Up model. The way you see MissVHaven in the image is exactly the way you will see in real life. \r\n\r\nUserofreality - Photography. It has been a real pleasure and delight working with Bhavin. His work is simply stunning and breath taking. Bhavin was able to capture all of our ideas and concepts in a single shot.

Yeah not so much, not under our watch! With a name like Cadera, lank and skinny are two words we never want in our designs.\r\nOur first task was to find a model that wasn't afraid to get into character and bring it. With that said, decision was easy, Marie was the unanimous choice. She has the ability to bring a unique sex appeal to her craft, and we at Cadera knew she was the perfect fit for the job.\r\nWe didn't stop there. Enter Makeup & Beauty by Gracie, a highly talented Make-Up-Artist and Photographer. She embodies the very definition of a hustler, stopping at nothing to get the right look and shot. Carefully incorporating the “dia de los muertos” look and yet allowing Marie’s beauty still shine through was the key to the success of this design.\r\nWith all of us working together, under the Cadera Family umbrella, we feel like we killed the concept!

Sounds of bass-beats and breaks took over our imagination and brought back music video scenes of…LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, The Fat Boys, RUN DMC, Fab Five Freddy. The one common variable between them all was the use of the Boombox, aka Ghetto Blaster, aka Jambox!\r\n\r\nAs we kept letting our imaginations run wild, we continued to have movie scene flashbacks. Movies such as Krush Groove, Breakin’, and Disorderlies all carried and made use of the Boombox. It was as if the Boombox carried a life of its own. It had attitude and it became a symbol for the hip-hop culture. It is, and forever will be, a true 80’s iconic image. It’s loud enough for others to hear, it’s bright enough for others to see, and just like the boombox of the 80’s, Cadera’s El Tambor is here to carry its tradition.\r\n\r\nBe Hip, Be Cadera...\r\n\r\nDesign Work: <a href=\" http://www.facebook.com/JarrodLee86\"> Kidd Swoosh </a>\r\nShirt Info: District Thread DT104 4.3-ounce, 100% ring spun combed cotton; Sizes run big, shrink to fit.","options":[{"id":29843199,"name":"S","price":15.5,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29863859,"name":"M","price":15.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29863861,"name":"L","price":15.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29863863,"name":"XL","price":15.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29863865,"name":"2XL","price":15.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122852577/-/el_tambor_mock_up_copy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122852577/-/el_tambor_mock_up_copy.jpg","width":9963,"height":11838},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/93757429/-/IMG_20130217_133309.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/93757429/-/IMG_20130217_133309.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/93827461/-/El_Tambor.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/93827461/-/El_Tambor.jpg","width":849,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4034001,"name":"Series 1","permalink":"series-1","url":"/category/series-1"}]}]
