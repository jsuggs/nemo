It&#8217;s made of two layers of fleece and is reversible. There&#8217;s one neckhole for you and another for your baby. The MamaBean Poncho can be worn with baby in virtually any baby carrier. You can use the poncho while wearing your baby in the front or the back.\n\n\tWe live in Edmonton (northern Canada). In the fall I put my son in the wrap with an extra layer on, put a sweater or coat on myself, and then the Poncho on top. Then we are toasty when we go for a walk. In the winter I&#8217;ve put my little guy in his snowsuit and then the poncho and me with a coat.\n\n\tThis listing is for a MamaBean Poncho in your choice of colours as pictured here: <a href=\"http://lilbeanbaby.blogspot.com/2007/12/mamabean-poncho.html\">Link text</a> (feel free to ask for other colours &#8211; I&#8217;ll see what I can do). I can make it with a hood for you or your baby or both (which would mean you could only wear your baby in front), or just the way I have it, with the cowl neck for mama. Please let me know when you order. The Poncho hangs to about 30&#8221; (the front is a little longer so it&#8217;ll hang evenly with baby in it).\n\n\tHappy babywearing!\n\n","options":[{"id":356584,"name":"Default","price":78.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.3,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":12.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":12.6,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/153530/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/153530/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":81580,"name":"Babywearing","permalink":"babywearing","url":"/category/babywearing"}]},{"id":75019,"name":"Lil Bean Wrap - Buttercream","permalink":"lil-bean-wrap-buttercream","position":2,"price":43.0,"default_price":43.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lil-bean-wrap-buttercream","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-02-13T06:36:04.000Z","description":"The Lil Bean Wrap is a wraparound stretchy baby sling. If you&#8217;ve ever wished for a second pair of hands for the times when your baby is fussy or just wants to be held, here is the solution. The Lil Bean Wrap keeps baby comfortably and securely close to you. The weight of the baby is evenly distributed across the shoulders, back, and hips for maximum comfort. It can be used to carry babies and toddlers up to approximately 35 &#8211; 40 lbs.\n\n\tBabywearing is recommended by doctors and child care workers around the world. Babies learn more and fuss less while being carried during awake times, and babywearing can calm fussy babies down with the parent&#8217;s movements. The Lil Bean Wrap is also a practical way to take your baby with you wherever you go. I&#8217;ve worn my son shopping (much easier than pushing a stroller and pulling a cart&#8230;), to a wedding and reception, in church, for walks, and around the house.\n\n\tIncludes a carrying bag with a drawstring and complete instructions for use. Made of soft cotton interlock knit with finished edges, tapered at the ends for ease of tying, fits any size. May be machine washed and dried and holds up well with many washes.\n\n","options":[{"id":356594,"name":"Default","price":43.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.3,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":12.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":12.6,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/153531/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/153531/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":81580,"name":"Babywearing","permalink":"babywearing","url":"/category/babywearing"}]},{"id":75021,"name":"Aqua and Chocolate SnuggleBean Blanket","permalink":"aqua-and-chocolate-snugglebean-blanket","position":3,"price":37.0,"default_price":37.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/aqua-and-chocolate-snugglebean-blanket","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-02-13T06:49:17.000Z","description":"Snuggle your little bean close in this soft, luxurious blanket&#8230;\n\n\tThis blanket is made of one layer of cabbage rose swirl minky and a brown cotton with turquoise and pearly silver dots.
