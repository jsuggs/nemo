He serves the role of your crazy/frank uncle who can impart knowledge unto you that your parents can't.

Card three is The Empress/Nicki Minaj. The Empress card represents sexuality, desire, wealth and fertility.\r\n\r\nThe Empress stands as an icon of all feminine power. A symbol of the dominion women's curves, intelligence and intuition gives them over the natural world. The only rapper that could remotely come close to representing all of that would Nicki Minaj. An ever-changing figure that represents women as seen through the male gaze. Nicki is able to change her appearance at will, she's a theatrical performer embodying a multitude of personalities and the spiritual mother to an ever growing army of devoted followers. She also serves as the object of almost every dudes' desire if we can use the discussion at my barbershop as a barometer of such things. \r\n\r\n- Printed in a limited edition of 25 \r\n- Hand signed and numbered \r\n- Giclee print on archival, museum quality paper \r\n- Shipped rolled in a heavyweight tube","options":[{"id":13949795,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41353747/-/EmpressCard-small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41353747/-/EmpressCard-small.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/52535639/-/nicki1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/52535639/-/nicki1.jpg","width":700,"height":467},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/52535647/-/nicki2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/52535647/-/nicki2.jpg","width":700,"height":465}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2347879,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":4231321,"name":"TAROT DE LES VICIEUX PAROLIERS XV: THE DEVIL/TYLER, THE CREATOR","permalink":"tarot-de-les-vicieux-paroliers-xv-the-devil-tyler-the-creator","position":12,"price":75.0,"default_price":75.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tarot-de-les-vicieux-paroliers-xv-the-devil-tyler-the-creator","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-08-10T01:28:07.000Z","description":"Dimensions: 18\"W X 24\"H \r\nMaterial: Epson Cold Press Watercolor Paper \r\nEdition of 25\r\n\r\nFrom the ongoing series <b>Tarot De Les Vicieux Paroliers (Tarot Of The Vicious Lyricists)</b> combining rappers and archetypes from the tarot. Card fifteen is The Devil/Tyler, The Creator.\r\n\r\nThe Devil card of the Tarot does not actively represent The Devil as represented in western mythology. The card isn't about corrupting youth, sacrificing woodland creatures or possessing souls. That's more of a Marilyn Manson jumpoff. The Devil card represents passion, anger, obsession, pessimism and the uprooting of social order. Essentially, it represents the plight of the teenagerâ€”newly aware of self, full of ideas yet held in impotence by the previous generation. Tyler as the Devil breaks the bondage of society and celebrates the lustful and creative aspects of life. He gives a middle finger to the bonds of conventional society and embraces the freedom of chaos as the only way to live. Or as Tyler succinctly put it \"Kill people. Burn shit. Fuck School\". \r\n\r\n- Printed in a limited edition of 25 \r\n- Hand signed and numbered \r\n- Giclee print on archival, museum quality paper \r\n- Shipped rolled in a heavyweight tube","options":[{"id":13949423,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41352795/-/DEVILCARD-small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41352795/-/DEVILCARD-small.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/52535679/-/tyler1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/52535679/-/tyler1.jpg","width":700,"height":465},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/52535711/-/tyler2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/52535711/-/tyler2.jpg","width":700,"height":465}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2347879,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":4231031,"name":"TAROT DE LES VICIEUX PAROLIERS XIII: DEATH/WAKA FLOCKA FLAME","permalink":"viii-death-waka-flocka-flame","position":13,"price":75.0,"default_price":75.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/viii-death-waka-flocka-flame","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-08-10T00:45:25.000Z","description":"Dimensions: 18\"W X 24\"H\r\nMaterial: Epson Cold Press Watercolor Paper\r\nEdition of 25\r\n\r\nFrom the ongoing series <b>Tarot De Les Vicieux Paroliers (Tarot Of The Vicious Lyricists)</b> combining rappers and archetypes from the tarot. Card thirteen is Death/Waka Flocka Flame. The Death card represents loss, regeneration and being caught in the inescapable. \r\n\r\nListening to Waka's music it's a swirling ball of white hot rage and chaos with musical nods to the apocalypse. There's Waka, screaming unveiled threats of violence, death and chanting his own name like an ancient army calling to their god of war before a battle. All of the violence makes Waka as the  Death card seem obvious, but, it goes deeper. The Death card of the Tarot isn't strictly about death in the bodily sense, it concerns death as part of a cycle of regeneration. An end to one thing and the birth of another. Mufasa gets bodied, Simba becomes king. Entropy & enthalpy. Death here is about looking into the unknown and having it transform you. Waka's rage is fueled by bodily death, yet, for him it's become a positive force. There's a full circle of death, conflict and rebirth all contained in the flame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Printed in a limited edition of 25\r\n- Hand signed and numbered\r\n- Giclee print on archival, museum quality paper\r\n- Shipped rolled in a heavyweight tube","options":[{"id":13948927,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41349781/-/DEATHCARD-small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41349781/-/DEATHCARD-small.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/52535743/-/waka1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/52535743/-/waka1.jpg","width":700,"height":467}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2347879,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":4230963,"name":"TAROT DE LES VICIEUX PAROLIERS VII: THE CHARIOT/KANYE WEST","permalink":"vii-the-chariot-kanye-west","position":14,"price":75.0,"default_price":75.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/vii-the-chariot-kanye-west","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-08-10T00:27:56.000Z","description":"Dimensions: 18\"W X 24\"H\r\nMaterial: Epson Cold Press Watercolor Paper\r\nEdition of 25\r\n\r\nFrom the ongoing series <b>Tarot De Les Vicieux Paroliers (Tarot Of The Vicious Lyricists)</b> combining rappers and archetypes from the tarot. Card seven is The Chariot/Kanye West.\r\n\r\nThe Chariot is often decried as one of the most difficult to interpret cards of all the Tarot as it's full of contradiction and duality. It symbolizes victory, but the prize may be bitter sweet. It predicts success but warns us to be wary of what we may give up in pursuit of it. This almost too conveniently parallels the career of Kanye West. \r\n\r\nHis music embodies both the low and high brow at the same time. Ballerinas dancing to songs about being a douche bag. Writing curses in cursive. Listening to Wu-Tang trying suits on. If nothing else his work represents the pull of these two opposing worlds and the anguish of living between them. \r\n\r\nThe Chariot cautions against egocentrisim, impulsivity and anxiety. Yet, acknowledges the symbiotic relationship between these personality flaws and the drive to succeed. From his first emergence Kanye's songs have come from a man with no country. He fought hard to win his fame but has maintained a rocky relationship with celebrity. Misunderstood, reviled and cast out, his victory has come in exile. \r\n\r\n\"Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it. Screams from the haters... got a nice ring to it.\"\r\n\r\n- Printed in a limited edition of 25\r\n- Hand signed and numbered\r\n- Giclee print on archival, museum quality paper\r\n- Shipped rolled in a heavyweight tube","options":[{"id":13948759,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41348693/-/CHARIOTCARD-small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41348693/-/CHARIOTCARD-small.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/52535775/-/ye1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/52535775/-/ye1.jpg","width":700,"height":467},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/52535783/-/ye2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/52535783/-/ye2.jpg","width":700,"height":465}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2347879,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]}]
