It centers around Alish Karr, a one of a kind angelic human hybrid. Who does not know how she was created, when or even why. Fragments of confusing childhood memories haunt her. She has spent her life without her left forearm and leg. She must use prosthetics, which are enhanced with low tech and steam power. Her day job is that of an ‘Outside Consultant’ or off the books bounty hunter/detective for the multicultural, and morally corrupt, the nation state of Jericho. \r\n\r\nThe world of Faithless is rich with a variety of fantasy and mythological species and creatures, drawing from all hosts of world mythologies. The two species that take center stage at the story's beginning are the ruling Angels and Demons of the land. These two species are on the brink of an apocalyptic war against one another that threatens to consume the entire world. The small population of technologically advanced humans have cut themselves off from general society and live in reclusion. Although physically cut off, the humans still pull the strings from the shadows in various political affairs, especially those dealing with Jericho. The various other species of the world try to keep themselves away from the tensions of the dominate angel and demon classes.","options":[{"id":39457896,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":20.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121448133/-/Cover_Web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121448133/-/Cover_Web.jpg","width":995,"height":1538}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5788644,"name":"Comics","permalink":"comics","url":"/category/comics"},{"id":5788647,"name":"Art","permalink":"art","url":"/category/art"},{"id":5788653,"name":"Digital","permalink":"digital","url":"/category/digital"},{"id":5788731,"name":"Illustration","permalink":"illustration","url":"/category/illustration"},{"id":5788806,"name":"Fantasy","permalink":"fantasy","url":"/category/fantasy"}]},{"id":12430785,"name":"Faithless Issue 1 (Limited Edition Cover, only 200 in print)","permalink":"faithless-issue-1-limited-edition-cover-only-200-in-print","position":2,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/faithless-issue-1-limited-edition-cover-only-200-in-print","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-18T00:58:08.000Z","description":"Faithless is the unbelievable journey of Alish Karr, a unique angel and human hybrid, with a shattered past and dark future.\r\n\r\nWant to know more about Faithless ? \r\n\r\nIt is a dark and gritty story that takes place in a world called Adrahstea.
