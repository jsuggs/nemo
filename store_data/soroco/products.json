The Indianness of Péro rests in the process in which pieces are made; materials pass through the hands of one craftsperson to the other, all located in different areas of India, carrying forward the Indian tradition of hand weaving and crafting, to create pieces that are as unique as they are exquisite. It’s not about an age group or season; it’s a mindset, a way of life, and willingness to incorporate the effortless style of the local people into ones attire.\r\n\r\nDesigner and founder, Aneeth Arora, is a textile and fashion graduate. What fascinates and inspires her most is the way locals are so unintentionally chic. She puts machinery aside, picks up a needle and thread, and hand crafts all of her pieces, together with her network of craftspeople. The love and soul that is poured into each and every piece in her collection radiates... and when the natural materials first touch your skin, there simply is no turning back. Péro is, without doubt, a journey that must be experienced.\r\n\r\nPéro’s children’t line is the most magnificent I’ve seen, and their reversible girls dresses can only be described as ‘couture for children’. All hand tailored and cleverly cut to fit your child for two years, this ‘dress within a dress’ is double layered, with the flexibility to be worn either as beautiful blue cheque with touches of white embroidered details and ikat trim, or as a fine blue, burgundy and white plaid. With such love, care and attention to detail poured into these exquisitely unique pieces, who can resist?!

The Indianness of Péro rests in the process in which pieces are made; materials pass through the hands of one craftsperson to the other, all located in different areas of India, carrying forward the Indian tradition of hand weaving and crafting, to create pieces that are as unique as they are exquisite. It’s not about an age group or season; it’s a mindset, a way of life, and willingness to incorporate the effortless style of the local people into ones attire.\r\n\r\nDesigner and founder, Aneeth Arora, is a textile and fashion graduate. What fascinates and inspires her most is the way locals are so unintentionally chic. She puts machinery aside, picks up a needle and thread, and hand crafts all of her pieces, together with her network of craftspeople. The love and soul that is poured into each and every piece in her collection radiates... and when the natural materials first touch your skin, there simply is no turning back. Péro is, without doubt, a journey that must be experienced.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely an ideal shape and size to fit everything in! Haul your every day essentials, or use as a travel or beach accessory as it packs flat and opens to a large tote. Spacious, roomy and intricately stitched from hand-embroidered cotton and silk textiles, with hand finished buttons and button holes on the two inner pockets. Leather straps are also attached with hand finished buttons on the outside... what’s not to love about this bag?!\r\n\r\n• Péro\r\n• Made in India\r\n• 100% cotton \r\n• Code: PJ G02\r\n• Size: 74cm wide x 32.5cm deep x 42cm high\r\n• Dry clean only\r\n• Front and back side in different fabric","options":[{"id":46470774,"name":"Default","price":277.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.5,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":7.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126346254/-/SO37PJ001.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126346254/-/SO37PJ001.jpg","width":800,"height":533},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126346272/-/SO37PJ002.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126346272/-/SO37PJ002.jpg","width":800,"height":533},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126346296/-/SO37PJ003.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126346296/-/SO37PJ003.jpg","width":800,"height":533},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126346317/-/SO37PJ004.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126346317/-/SO37PJ004.jpg","width":800,"height":533}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2170382,"name":"Bags","permalink":"bags","url":"/category/bags"}]},{"id":14046516,"name":"Clare Vivier Oversize Clutch","permalink":"clare-vivier-oversize-clutch","position":20,"price":185.0,"default_price":185.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/clare-vivier-oversize-clutch","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-08T15:01:00.000Z","description":"Like most good things, Clare Vivier began making bags in response to a need.
