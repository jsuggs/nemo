First recorded by the Mesopotamians about 5,000 years ago written on clay tablets. The belief of the evil eye has no religious boundaries as it coexists with almost every religion from Christianity to Islam. It is in fact mentioned in the Old Testament and a big part of the Jewish folklore as well. Awareness of the evil eye is strongest in the Middle East, East & West Africa, South & Central Asia, and Europe, especially the Mediterranean region. It has also spread to other areas, including northern Europe, particularly in the Celtic regions, and the Americas, where it was brought by European colonists and Middle Eastern immigrants.\r\nThe Evil Eye is a sharp glance or a negative thought believed to have the ability to harm those on whom it falls upon. The cause can be zealous admiration, envy or even malicious jealousy. It can come from anyone at any time; you can even call it upon yourself or a loved one. Excessive love, devotion, admiration are also thought to inadvertently cast the evil eye. One of the many unspoken rules of Eastern Mediterranean people, is the caution taken when praising or admiring anything, especially children. There are numerous rituals and practices that are used to counteract or defuse the risk of \"accidentally\" eliciting the eye. These rituals vary among each culture, for example the phrase \"Mashallah\" is used to invoke God's blessing on a person or possession being praised. In the Latin culture when a child or object is admired, a preventive measure of allowing the admirer to touch the child or item being admired as a way to dispel the envy. The Greeks have a ritual of spitting or rather making a vocalized noise reminiscent of spitting as a symbol of hydrating. In ancient times it was believed that the evil eye was connected with symptoms of drying, desiccation, withering, and dehydration. Example, the milk of a nursing mother drying, children becoming ill and vomiting, fruit trees withering or no longer bearing fruit, in Italy the loss of potency in men, these are all related to the \"dehydrating effects\" of the evil eye. Rituals range from serious prayers and ceremonies to silly hand gestures and actions. In conclusion, the evil eye has been a pivotal aspect in shaping many cultures in their beliefs, rituals and behavior. While there are many who insist the evil eye is nothing more than superstition, to the true believers of the evil eye its powers are nothing to be taken lightly.\"","options":[{"id":35794137,"name":"Default","price":16.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/111827622/-/il_570xN.331539719.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/111827622/-/il_570xN.331539719.jpg","width":570,"height":291}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":11364429,"name":"Inverted Cross Necklace Upside Down Cross Necklace","permalink":"inverted-cross-necklace-upside-down-cross-necklace","position":4,"price":18.5,"default_price":18.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/inverted-cross-necklace-upside-down-cross-necklace","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-24T22:52:39.000Z","description":"Upside down cross necklace.
