The projects feature gorgeous colorways and innovative variations on basic stitches. Pulished in association with Swarovski Elements, the book is filled with stylish and innovative ways to use the Swarovski product line. These truly are elegant, wearable jewelry designs. Most of the projects primarily use the easy-to-find and relatively affordable bicone crystals, along with some pearls, rounds, and a few of the fancy cuts.\r\nOne thing very strongly in this book's favor is that it is perfect for a new beader, or someone who has primarily done bead stringing, who wants to give beadweaving a try. There is a lot of great basic information at the start of the book including a lot of really helpful tips that other books assume you know. Also, each chapter has the projects sorted in increasing difficulty levels, with several very simple ones for the easily daunted beader to cut their teeth on before moving on to larger, more complex projects.\r\nDescribed and illustrated in detail, processes are easy even for beginners. Book contains also an enumeration and description of tools and materials used for each items.\r\n\r\neBook Code: AEDCB\r\nFormat: PDF file\r\nPages: 86\r\nSize: 14 mb\r\nLanguage: english\r\nShipping: FREE\r\nDelivery: within 24 hours after payment received\r\n\r\nPattern will be emailed to you as a PDF to the e-mail address you have been registrate on BigCartel or PayPal e-mail address.
