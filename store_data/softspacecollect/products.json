I will often have several journals in various sizes, uses and stages of completion. I find this a necessary practice in relation to the way I go about forming an image or set of images in my mind before I ever put ink on paper. My journals will fill with vague sketches, life drawings, absent-minded default doodles, phone numbers, failed experiments, bad poetry, forgotten appointments, possible titles, old passwords, snatches of overheard conversations, neat phrases and compositional collage. In retrospect, journals can be incredibly revealing of the time they were made, or else puzzling and cryptic. I hope you enjoy their secrets. \r\n</i>\r\n\r\n- Jonathan McBurnie August 2012\r\n<a href=\"http://www.jonathanmcburnie.com/\">jonathanmcburnie.com</a>\r\n\r\nThere are three version of the book available:\r\n\r\n<ul>\t\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://store.softspacecollect.com/product/emergency-death-pill-digital-book-by-jonathan-mcburnie/\">Digital Version</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://store.softspacecollect.com/product/emergency-death-pill-small-printed-by-jonathan-mcburnie/\">5x8\"Printed Softcover Version</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://store.softspacecollect.com/product/emergency-death-pill-book-by-jonathan-mcburnie/\">8x10\"Printed Softcover Version</a></li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nDrawings by Jonathan McBurnie.\r\nCompiled by Daniel Smith.\r\n\r\nAll images are copyright Jonathan McBurnie. \r\nBook layout & design copyright Daniel Smith & Soft Space Collect.","options":[{"id":26436237,"name":"Colour print","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":27745028,"name":"Black & white print","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/82619517/-/jonathan-mcburnie-book005.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/82619517/-/jonathan-mcburnie-book005.jpg","width":1000,"height":964}],"artists":[{"id":133873,"name":"Jonathan McBurnie","permalink":"jonathan-mcburnie","url":"/artist/jonathan-mcburnie"}],"categories":[{"id":1597511,"name":"Drawing","permalink":"drawing","url":"/category/drawing"},{"id":1607054,"name":"Book","permalink":"book","url":"/category/book"}]},{"id":6871203,"name":"Emergency Death Pill - Large - Printed book by Jonathan McBurnie","permalink":"emergency-death-pill-book-by-jonathan-mcburnie","position":10,"price":70.0,"default_price":70.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/emergency-death-pill-book-by-jonathan-mcburnie","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-08-03T17:07:44.000Z","description":"Delve into the mind of artist and cult hero Jonathan McBurnie in a book of drawings from his sketch books.
