In order to help him & his family with medical bills, Brassneck Records has teamed up with Swamp Cabbage Records in the US to release this extremely limited SQUARE lathe cut 7\" to help out.\r\n\r\nThis is a pre-order only release and we will only press the number of pre-orders received. If we sell 10, then only 10 will be pressed.  If we sell 500.... 500 will be pressed.  You get the idea.\r\n\r\nUS orders can be made from Swamp Cabbage Records and any European orders can be made here at Brassneck.  This is a one time deal with no plans for any kind of repress.  All profits go to Adam.\r\n\r\n<b>Tracklisting</b>\r\nA1 -\tThe Copyrights – School's Out (Groovie Ghoulies cover)\t\r\nA2 -\tThe Turkletons – Find Another Girl\r\nA3 -\tCaffiends – Sealab\r\nB1 -\tGrath And Kate – The Poop Song\r\nB2 -\tUp For Nothing – Wearing Thin\r\nB3 -

Little did we know though we were looking in the wrong country!  Chestnut Road (named after the Broccoli song) are from Toulouse, France but wear their inspiration from all those UK bands firmly on their chest, and taking influence from the likes of Husker Du and Taang-era Lemonheads as well, have managed to do what so many fail to in this genre – actually make a record that is class, and that is uniquely their own.

Like all of their jams it is both instantly recognisable as a Copyrights song at the same time just different enough from previous works to keep you guessing where they are going with it.  The flipside of this EP contains two demo tracks that didn't make the cut for the final recording of the new album; One a straight forward punk jam. The other a total pop ballad. A band that can nail it both ways is definitely doing something right.\r\n\r\n<b>Tracklisting</b>\r\nA1 - Crutches\r\nB1 - Current Event (Demo)\r\nB2 - Sober Shell South (Demo)\r\n\r\nlisten to \"Crutches\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq-ssYfgRt0\">here</a> ","options":[{"id":24939810,"name":"Black (1st pressing) /400","price":3.25,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":24939813,"name":"White (2nd pressing) /300","price":3.25,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":82,"name":"Christmas Island","code":"CX"}},{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":1.3,"amount_with_others":0.55,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/77599992/-/copyrights-crutches7.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/77599992/-/copyrights-crutches7.jpeg","width":600,"height":602}],"artists":[{"id":122891,"name":"The Copyrights","permalink":"the-copyrights","url":"/artist/the-copyrights"}],"categories":[{"id":1542902,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":1588309,"name":"It's Alive Records","permalink":"it-s-alive-records","url":"/category/it-s-alive-records"}]},{"id":12855162,"name":"The Criminals – Never Been Caught LP","permalink":"the-criminals-never-been-caught-lp","position":48,"price":8.75,"default_price":8.75,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-criminals-never-been-caught-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-08T18:44:40.000Z","description":"<b>Label</b>\r\nDead Broke Rekerds (dbr-088)\r\n\r\n<b>Detail</b>\r\n16 track Black vinyl LP with download code and poster.

This Portland trio are flat-out hot.  I'm talking punk-as-fuck type stuff that rocks! Raw sound and memorably vitriolic lyrics, when you hear a Piss Test song, and you know it's a Piss Test song!\r\nThese have got the attitude and the killer tunes to boot.  If you're highly distressed that punk music has become way too safe and clean-cut for your degenerate tastes, Piss Test will warm your heart with its sordid tales of chemical abuse and bad life choices.\r\n\r\nFist City are from Calgary, Canada. They recently toured the UK. Their music has been described as \"raggedly elegant … stripped down challenging punk\", \"pop songs clouded in a lo-fi basement show sheen\" ; a blend of post-punk and dark-surf, with a twinge of pop. But more than that.  Much more.

Each Limited to 250 copies.\r\n\r\nFrench Exit's first full length album Guts & Black Stuff is a twelve-track course of sing-along, post-hardcore inspired pop punk traveled by band at its absolute best. They are a band that knows exactly where they want a song to go and have the ability to lead it precisely there. Verses anchor your guts right where they need to be for the choruses to shake them loose and spill them all over the floor. Buildups scoop up that black, happy, ugly mess from beneath your feet and send them soaring overhead. Starts, stops and breakdowns keep you wondering where the fuck you are until the bridges guide you safely back home so you can loose your shit all over again.\r\n\r\nEvery track on Guts & Black Stuff has an undeniable and unavoidable hook that grabs hold and demands your participation. There is a tension created between the deeper, smoother vocals of Tim and the lighter, gravelly vocals of Bob that beg for your own voice to fuse the two together by singing and shouting along. That same tension exists between Bob's more technical lead guitar work and Anthony's stripped-down, straight-to-amp rhythm guitar crunch; and again between Tim's airy bass lines and Duke's heavy power-drumming. Air guitar shredding and phantom drum pummeling will be provided by you.\r\n\r\n<b>Tracklisting</b>\r\nA1 - Conversations Out Of Context\r\nA2 - Impossible\r\nA3 - Whoa No\r\nA4 - When There's A Fork In The Road, Take It\r\nA5 - DKE\r\nA6 - Defensive Indifference\r\nB1 - Bridges\r\nB2 - Hold Your Breath\r\nB3 - Statecheck\r\nB4 - Home, I Guess\r\nB5 - Can't Win.

Past lineups have included Jeff Burke and Mike Throneberry of The Marked Men. Welcome New Machine is a perfect synthesis of their previous 2 albums. Rocks as hard as Send A Message, while incorporating the nuances they began developing on Midnight Cashier.  A fair amount of ground is covered here, from the Marked Men's trademark choppy pop sound to straightforward punk, to darker-edged postpunk, some new-wavey bits, and an absolutely stunning Teengenerate-style garagepunk ripper sung by Mark Ryan, all capped off by Mike Wiebe's seemingly endless font of unusual, interesting lyrics.\r\n\r\n<b>Tracklisting</b>\r\nA1 -\tGet Weird\r\nA2 -\tIncorporeal\r\nA3 -\tBackbone\r\nA4 -\tTemporary Gods\r\nA5 -\tSubprime Love\r\nA6 -\tLose Your Grip (Hanging On My Every Word)\r\nB1 -\tLose Face\r\nB2 -\tThe Universal Peoples Church Of Light\r\nB3 -\tHandicapped Hearts\r\nB4 -\tDirt, Fist, Feet\r\nB5 -\tI'm Too Square, You're Too Round\r\nB6 -\tThe Secret Of The Hydrogene Bomb","options":[{"id":29694722,"name":"Default","price":8.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.75,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.75,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":82,"name":"Christmas Island","code":"CX"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.75,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.75,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.75,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/93293066/-/hightensionwires-welcomenewmachine.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/93293066/-/hightensionwires-welcomenewmachine.jpeg","width":600,"height":618}],"artists":[{"id":177158,"name":"High Tension Wires","permalink":"high-tension-wires","url":"/artist/high-tension-wires"}],"categories":[{"id":1542901,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"},{"id":2922897,"name":"Dirtnap Records","permalink":"dirtnap-records","url":"/category/dirtnap-records"}]},{"id":4941061,"name":"History Of The Hawk -

They sing about stuff that affects their lives. Important things like coal mining, Royal Weddings, the decline of modern civilisation, cutting down trees, playing squash and being in love. Their sound has been compared to Pinhead Gunpowder, The Replacements, Billy Bragg, The Clash, Rancid, Stiff Little Fingers and Social Distortion.\r\n\r\n\"1981\" comes out on April 29th 2011, the day of the Royal Wedding. The new single was recorded in Chicago with Jeff Dean (from the Bomb) in November 2010. \"1981\" is a song about how a generation struggles to emulate the feats of their parents, \"the baby boomers\". Everyone is poor these days and everyone struggles to meet the cost of living. The song is about being born into a world ruled by economics that no-one truly understands or has control of.\r\n\r\n<b>Tracklisting</b>\r\nA1 - 1981 \t\t\r\nB1 - Six Beers (Slight Return)","options":[{"id":12783638,"name":"White","price":3.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":82,"name":"Christmas Island","code":"CX"}},{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":1.3,"amount_with_others":0.55,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37312900/-/magnificent01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37312900/-/magnificent01.jpg","width":600,"height":597},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37312916/-/magnificent02.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37312916/-/magnificent02.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":123049,"name":"The Magnificent","permalink":"the-magnificent","url":"/artist/the-magnificent"}],"categories":[{"id":1542902,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"}]},{"id":3702840,"name":"Maladroit – Jerk Alert!

Not Yet! seems to be the brainchild of YouTube sensation Jose Anything. Given the chance to flesh out his songs within a band format really takes his material to a higher level. Thematically, the songs are of the “young, drunk, and in love” variety but don’t come off as cheesy or schmaltzy. Containing only four songs, this tape left me wanting more. In fact, this tape is clearly one of the best things I’ve heard this year.

Bread Line perfectly captures the spirit and feeling of what it's like to be young, broke, and overworked in 2011 America. While not one of these four songs sounds like any of the others, the band's energy and the overarching theme of economic hardship connect them all to create a perfect cohesive EP that's as strong as anything else that Traffic Street have released. It took three years and three split 7-inches for Rational Anthem to record a follow-up EP to their s/t demo, but it was absolutely worth the wait. The band's figured out who they are, how they write, and what they do best - and on Bread Line, they do it four times over. If you're through with college, have given up on the job market, and have sadly come to the realisation that you'll never have it as good as your parents, Bread Line is the record for you. Buy it now and start getting excited for their upcoming full-length.\r\n\r\n<b>Tracklisting</b>\r\nA1 - (The Weight Of The World Is) Shitting On My Shoulders\r\nA2 - Blackout Magic\r\nB1 -  Idling\r\nB2 - Customer Complaints","options":[{"id":14706749,"name":"Default","price":3.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":82,"name":"Christmas Island","code":"CX"}},{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":1.3,"amount_with_others":0.55,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43937395/-/rationalanthem0001.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43937395/-/rationalanthem0001.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43937547/-/rationalanthem0006.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43937547/-/rationalanthem0006.jpg","width":600,"height":598}],"artists":[{"id":123145,"name":"Rational Anthem","permalink":"rational-anthem","url":"/artist/rational-anthem"}],"categories":[{"id":1542902,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"}]},{"id":5147259,"name":"Rations – How Much Land Does A Man Need? 7\"","permalink":"rations-how-much-land-does-a-man-need-7","position":194,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rations-how-much-land-does-a-man-need-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-12-28T20:24:00.000Z","description":"<b>Labels</b>\r\n86'd Records And Fanzine (86D 007)\r\nSquare Of Opposition Records (SofO 038)\r\nIntense Human Victories (IHV 06)\r\nRad Girlfriend Records (RGF 003)\r\nLost Cat Records (LC8)\r\nPavones Records (PR 005)\r\nDrunken Sailor Records (DS 006)\r\nMessner Records (MES 001)\r\nJerk Store Records And Fanzine (JSR 01)\r\nEager Beaver Records (EBR 012)\r\n\r\n<b>Detail</b>\r\n5 track Black vinyl 7\"\r\n\r\nFive new songs in 10 minutes from Long Island, NY punkers.

These dudes broke up a couple of years ago shortly after the CD release of this album. But they are back together again so It's Alive teamed up with No Breaks Records to get them started back up right where they left off. New Kids On The Bong is an epic album. I don't use the word \"epic\" lightly, mind you. Sass Dragons were and are one of thee best punk rock bands of the past decade or two and NKOTB is recorded proof of that claim. These Chicagoans know how to write a tune and play the shit out of it. While most of the jams on this album are of the poppy punk variety, there is also a handful of cut-loose thrash jams, straight up tear jerker monster ballads, pro radio style talent tunes and even a goddamn ho-down hobo classic! Eclectic? Yeah, and then some. Banjo, saxaphone, acoustic guitars and keyboards all work their way into this album and it ain't no thing at all. It's like that shit was always used in punk rock and you just never noticed. Sass Dragons forever!\r\n\r\n<b>Tracklisting</b>\r\n01 - Your Turn, Cop\r\n02 - Put You Hands On Me\r\n03 - Why Don't You Fuck Her On The Ground?\r\n04 - Dear St. Anne, Please Send Me A Man\r\n05 - Give It Back\r\n06 -

Post-Pterodacdudes dudes. It’s like those close-up diagrams of, say, a hair follicle versus looking down at your own arm and looking at all the hair on it at once. Up close, White Night are chock full of tiny pop influences, but growing out of dirty, charming, lo-fi DIY punk rock. Like if FYP had influenced the Beach Boys (instead of visa versa). But on a quick glance from pretty far away, you could just easily say, “Neat band.” Both would be right. Street Eaters: John Geek (Fleshies, Triclops!) and Megan March (Neverending Party) join up as a bass and drums duo. Their songs have a Wire-y space, sparseness, and tremble that has some overlap to Northern California contemporaries Surrender. Broken and asphalty songs with broad-leafed weeds growing through them, even during a Devo cover.

The band played its first show in May of 2008, and originally featured Zach Byrne (Goodnight Loving) on guitar. The current lineup was cemented when Drew Fredrichsen (Leg Hounds, Jetty Boys) took over on guitar and backing vocals. The band released its debut single, \"Beat Beat Beat\" b/w \"Crybaby\", on Bachelor Records in 2009 and a year later issued its full-length debut Sweet Songs of the Sugar Stems on Bachelor and Dusty Medical Records. Those of us who'd been long awaiting an heir apparent to The Shivvers and Nikki and the Corvettes literally jumped for joy when we heard Sweet Songs, spending the subsequent months dancing in the streets and angrily rebuking local radio stations for failing to play \"I Gotta Know\". If you think it's a stretch to call said album a modern classic of power pop, you probably haven't heard it! The Sugar Stems returned in 2012 with a pair of incredible singles on Certified PR Records that suggested the band had somehow managed to improve upon perfection. It was perfectly appropriate, then, that the title of the band's long-awaited sophomore album would be Can't Wait. Released at the tail end of 2012 by Screaming Apple Records (Germany) and Dream On Records (Japan), Can't Wait now gets an American release on Dirtnap. This terrific LP shows \"growth\" in all the best ways. Without abandoning its signature honeyed melodies and high-spirited candy pop style, the band has made a more mature and consistent album that's definitely its best to date. The production has been stepped up another notch, and every song sounds like a hit. If you missed the singles \"Greatest Pretender\" and \"Like I Do\", they're here in all their infectious glory. But it's the more melancholy tracks that really showcase Betsy Heibler's development into one of the finest songwriters working today. Songs like \"Make Up Your Mind\" and the gorgeous \"Love You To Pieces\" are steeped in the timeless traditions of Brill Building and British Invasion pop, yet feel entirely fresh in the year 2013. Even when the songs themselves are not exactly happy, there's something about the Sugar Stems' music that just makes you feel good. No sophomore jinx here, folks. Can't Wait was totally worth the wait. Why is this band not huge?! \r\n\r\n<b>Tracklisting</b>\r\nA1 -\tGreatest Pretender\r\nA2 -\tLike I Do\r\nA3 -\tCan't Wait\r\nA4 -\tLandline Static\r\nA5 -\tMagic Act\r\nB1 -\tGet To You\r\nB2 -\tTold You So\r\nB3 -\tMake Up Your Mind\r\nB4 -\tLove You To Pieces\r\nB5 -\t6 Feet Under\r\n\r\nListen / Download <a href=\"http://dirtnaprecords.bandcamp.com/album/sugar-stems-cant-wait \">here</a> ","options":[{"id":34795872,"name":"Default","price":8.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.75,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.75,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":82,"name":"Christmas Island","code":"CX"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.75,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.75,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.75,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108782301/-/sugar_stems_can_t_wait_LP.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108782301/-/sugar_stems_can_t_wait_LP.jpg","width":958,"height":958}],"artists":[{"id":200550,"name":"The Sugar Stems","permalink":"the-sugar-stems","url":"/artist/the-sugar-stems"}],"categories":[{"id":1542901,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"},{"id":2922897,"name":"Dirtnap Records","permalink":"dirtnap-records","url":"/category/dirtnap-records"}]},{"id":9754725,"name":"Sugus - Chicken Leg 7\"","permalink":"sugus-s-t-7","position":236,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sugus-s-t-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-03-05T23:06:52.000Z","description":"<b>Label</b>\r\nTorreznetes Entertainment ‎(TER-001)\r\n\r\n<b>Detail</b>\r\n4 track Black Vinyl 7\"\r\n\r\n<b>Tracklisting</b>\r\nA1 - 5 Horas Con Pelayo\r\nA2 - Pigs Of War\r\nB1 - Fast Food\r\nB2 - Your Name Is Tattooed On My Ass\r\n\r\nListen to it <a href=\"http://sugus.bandcamp.com/album/chicken-leg\">here</a> ","options":[{"id":30522510,"name":"Default","price":3.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":82,"name":"Christmas Island","code":"CX"}},{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":1.3,"amount_with_others":0.55,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/95842296/-/sugus7inch.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/95842296/-/sugus7inch.jpeg","width":550,"height":555}],"artists":[{"id":178501,"name":"Sugus","permalink":"sugus","url":"/artist/sugus"}],"categories":[{"id":1542902,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"}]},{"id":15536697,"name":"Sunnyside - Welcome To San Diego LP (colour vinyl)","permalink":"sunnyside-welcome-to-san-diego-lp-colour-vinyl","position":237,"price":8.75,"default_price":8.75,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sunnyside-welcome-to-san-diego-lp-colour-vinyl","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-13T13:17:04.000Z","description":"<b>Labels</b>\r\nA.D.D.

It's super catchy and melodic, but totally rough around the edges. Nothing is polished. Vocals are gruff and at times totally shredded. Guitars are big and crunchy. Sunnyside has really filled out their sound on this album with the addition of a third vocalist and a bunch of trade-off and teamed up lead vocals. I guess duets can be pretty punk, too.

They play it fast, melodic, anthemic and overflowing with positivity much like the bands coming out of New York back then. But their passion and energy keep it fresh and focused on what's going on today not just in the greater New York area, but far beyond as well. Mixing the best of NY past and underground pop punk present, Up For Nothing come up with some of the catchiest and instantly memorable hooks of any band playing today. Singing along with the choruses on your first listen is a huge testament to the power of a band's hook. Up For Nothing will succeed in doing just that.\r\n\r\nIn Trance was recorded by Pete Steinkopf (Bouncing Souls), produced by Ernie Parada (Token Entry, Black Train Jack, Grey Area) and mastered by Stephen Egerton (Descendents, ALL). I don't usually make a point of listing non-band credits when introducing a new record, but with guys like these with such incredible credentials behind them, I can't resist.\r\n\r\n<b>Tracklisting</b>\r\nA1 -\tThis Moment\r\nA2 -\tSpeak Through Silence\r\nB1 -\tThe Worst Things To Say\r\nB2 -\tThe Side Of Caution\r\nB3 -\tWeightless","options":[{"id":43469406,"name":"Default","price":3.25,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":82,"name":"Christmas Island","code":"CX"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":1.3,"amount_with_others":0.55,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.25,"amount_with_others":0.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124289187/-/Up_For_Nothing_%E2%80%8E%E2%80%93_In_Trance01.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124289187/-/Up_For_Nothing_%E2%80%8E%E2%80%93_In_Trance01.jpeg","width":600,"height":599},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124289205/-/Up_For_Nothing_%E2%80%8E%E2%80%93_In_Trance02.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124289205/-/Up_For_Nothing_%E2%80%8E%E2%80%93_In_Trance02.jpeg","width":600,"height":603}],"artists":[{"id":204735,"name":"Up For Nothing","permalink":"up-for-nothing","url":"/artist/up-for-nothing"}],"categories":[{"id":1542902,"name":"7\"","permalink":"7","url":"/category/7"},{"id":1588309,"name":"It's Alive Records","permalink":"it-s-alive-records","url":"/category/it-s-alive-records"}]},{"id":7394077,"name":"Utter Failure - S/T EP 7\"","permalink":"utter-failure-s-t-ep-7","position":257,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/utter-failure-s-t-ep-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-29T15:58:15.000Z","description":"<b>Labels</b>\r\n86'd Records\r\nWaterslide Records\r\nLost Cat Records\r\nVinehell Records\r\nMessner Records\r\nCrapoulet Records\r\n\r\n<b>Detail</b>\r\n6 track Black Vinyl 7\"\r\n\r\nDebut 7\" from San Jose, CA's Utter Failure.

Recorded by Yogi Perogi, who already captured the quality sound of the White Wires and the Steve Adamyk Band and mastered by Dave Williams of The Sedatives, Steve Adamyk Band and Crusades.\r\nAnother fine display of Canadian inbred finesse with the Power and the Pop when it comes to the Punk.\r\n\r\n<b>Tracklisting</b>\r\nA1 - Lone Fish\r\nA2 - Magazine Seducer\r\nA3 - Sexbot\r\nB1 - Black Brainwave\r\nB2 - Magic Magician Man\r\nB3 - Mythic Battle Of The Cosmos","options":[{"id":15494645,"name":"Default","price":8.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.75,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.75,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":82,"name":"Christmas Island","code":"CX"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.75,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.75,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":2.8,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.75,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46409973/-/zebra.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46409973/-/zebra.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":123283,"name":"Zebrassieres","permalink":"zebrassieres","url":"/artist/zebrassieres"}],"categories":[{"id":2465473,"name":"10\"","permalink":"10","url":"/category/10"}]}]
