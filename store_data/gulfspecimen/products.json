He retraces the footsteps of famed naturalist John Muir in Cedar Key, shares little-known stories of backcountry feuds that rivaled the Hatfields and McCoys, uncovers amusing theories as to why mullet jump, and invites salty local characters to share the spotlight. \r\n\r\nSometimes poignant, often humorous, and always engaging, Waters Less Traveled is the perfect travel companion for anyone who wants a bit of adventure without leaving home.

But it seemed premature for a 21-year-old to focus on the difficulties of life when she'd hardly begun to live. Twenty-five years later, she was ready to explore the spiritual discipline that originated in Asian monasteries more than a millennium ago. Rudloe's quest is compellingly chronicled in Butterflies on a Sea Wind, which combines the rigor of formal monastic Zen practice with the challenges of integrating Zen concepts into modern daily life. Her narrative describes both the physical and mental demands of Zen retreats and how she applied what she learned there to her work as a marine biologist in Florida, as well as to the rigors of raising children and caring for an elderly grandmother. In words that intimately draw in her readers, she describes how Zen helps us look inward and use the wisdom we find there to reach out to others. Buddhism is one of the fastest growing spiritual traditions in America today. During the 1990s, the number of organized Buddhist centers in this country grew more than 40 percent, from 429 to 1,062. While there are many books about Zen on the market today, few give a clear picture of what it's like to actually sit down and begin a meditation practice and then apply it to a daily life. Likewise, few books discuss the types of issues most people face every day: raising a family and earning a living. Butterflies on a Sea Wind does all this and more","options":[{"id":48933027,"name":"Default","price":12.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.95,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128149728/-/Buterflies_on_a_sea_wind.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128149728/-/Buterflies_on_a_sea_wind.jpg","width":295,"height":420}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6758475,"name":"Jack & Anne Rudloe's Books","permalink":"jack-anne-rudloe-s-books","url":"/category/jack-anne-rudloe-s-books"}]},{"id":15070512,"name":"Priceless Florida: Natural Ecosystems and Native Species","permalink":"priceless-florida-natural-ecosystems-and-native-species","position":248,"price":29.95,"default_price":29.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/priceless-florida-natural-ecosystems-and-native-species","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-24T19:47:45.000Z","description":"Priceless Florida presents the incomparable ecological riches of this unique region in a way that will appeal to young and old, laypersons and scientists.

Out of that comes this nature based meditation on life, death, and meaning that draws upon the insights of science and religion, marine biology and Zen. Having taught marine ecology to university students for years, she now adds to the science a more experiential and meditational relationship with the sea grass meadows, long leaf pine forests and cypress lakes of the Florida wilderness which is the book?s primary setting. Vivid narrative adventure sections include several encounters with alligators, a midnight meeting with a bear, a rescue at sea, a struggle with scuba gear over rocks in breaking seas, a helicopter based eagle survey, and chasing sea turtles in the Everglades. Anne?s years of scientific research on marine animals, including electric rays, horseshoe crabs and bryozoans, takes on new and unexpectedly personal meanings. A 90 day traditional Zen retreat, with approximately equal proportions of beauty and grueling struggle, becomes a turning point in the journey, but the primary teachers remain the forest and sea throughout the narrative. Although she uses predominately Zen spiritual methods, the story is inclusive and relevant to those of other faiths or of no faith at all who find themselves in a time of personal seeking. Like her previous book, Butterflies on a Sea Wind: Beginning Zen, the story is told in an engaging style aimed at a non expert. The book provides a brief but fascinating review of the latest scientific research on consciousness as it explores what science can add to ancient religious methods for facing the Big Questions. The book is a contribution to the current dialogues between science and religion.","options":[{"id":36012621,"name":"Default","price":9.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.95,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128147370/-/11-24-2013_2-06-03_PM.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128147370/-/11-24-2013_2-06-03_PM.jpg","width":265,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6758475,"name":"Jack & Anne Rudloe's Books","permalink":"jack-anne-rudloe-s-books","url":"/category/jack-anne-rudloe-s-books"}]},{"id":11429412,"name":"Book : Chicken Wars","permalink":"chicken-wars","position":250,"price":14.95,"default_price":14.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/chicken-wars","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-28T19:05:34.000Z","description":"Superchicken, Augustus Herkissing (formerly, in a previous life - Henry Kissinger) the champion of chickens everywhere, has been sent to our present day world via a heavenly council.

These ancient myths fostered a deep respect for sea turtles that helped to assure their sustainable harvest, in contrast with the ruinous practices of today.","options":[{"id":36008427,"name":"Default","price":14.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.95,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128147940/-/11-24-2013_2-15-49_PM.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128147940/-/11-24-2013_2-15-49_PM.jpg","width":299,"height":483}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6758475,"name":"Jack & Anne Rudloe's Books","permalink":"jack-anne-rudloe-s-books","url":"/category/jack-anne-rudloe-s-books"}]},{"id":11429160,"name":"Book : The Wilderness Coast","permalink":"the-wilderness-coast","position":252,"price":14.95,"default_price":14.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-wilderness-coast","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-28T18:56:05.000Z","description":"The true adventures of a marine naturalist stalking the shorelines and shallows of Northwest Florida for swordfish, crocodiles, strange toad-fish and giant sea roaches.","options":[{"id":36008217,"name":"Default","price":14.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.95,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128148123/-/wilderness_coast.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128148123/-/wilderness_coast.jpg","width":309,"height":492}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6758475,"name":"Jack & Anne Rudloe's Books","permalink":"jack-anne-rudloe-s-books","url":"/category/jack-anne-rudloe-s-books"}]},{"id":11428980,"name":"Book : The Living Dock","permalink":"the-living-dock","position":253,"price":14.95,"default_price":14.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-living-dock","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-28T18:49:11.000Z","description":"Jack Rudloe tells about his adventures and misadventures as a professional marine specimen collector-- and about the barnacle-encrusted dock which intimately connects him with the teeming sea life of the bay, the mud flats, the grass-beds and marshlands of the Florida Gulf Coast.

It's about people who love to eat shrimp, fishermen who roam the seas catching them, and aquaculturists who raise them in ponds, selling them more cheaply than fishermen ever could. \r\n\r\nThis book is about shrimp, but it's also about the past and future and about a conflict as old as humanity itself--the conflict between hunters-gatherers and farmers.\r\n\r\nThis book is about shrimp, but it is also about the vastness and diversity of nature and humanity. You will meet shrimp powerful enough to break aquarium glass. You will travel in time, from abandoned Mayan tombs to the California Gold Rush; in space, from the heart of Cajun country to the English Channel; in environments, from battered trawlers to university laboratories.\r\n\r\nYou will learn things you never imagined-- about microbiology and real estate and about economics and ecosystems. As you meet the people around the world who've caught, sold, cooked, and loved shrimp, you might just meet your own ancestors.
