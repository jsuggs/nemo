From the classic, Townes Van Zandt inspired storytelling of Leeroy Stagger in the opening track \"Hell of A Life,\" which chronicles the life and times of the wayward troubadour, to the clear mountain stream vocals of Evan Phillips in big country inspired songs such as \"Highway 395\" or \"Walk Away,\" to the optimistic and stoned sing along \"Festival Song,\" which has all three members of the band taking turns at verses written by Tim Easton, with the three voices blending as one generation for the chorus shout out \"It feels like the world is gonna be alright.\"  This album is the  begining of a life long collaborative effort and dedication to making music and traveling the world together as Easton, Stagger, Phillips.","options":[{"id":603338,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/701272/-/onefortheditchsm.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/701272/-/onefortheditchsm.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":3833,"name":"Easton Stagger Phillips","permalink":"easton-stagger-phillips","url":"/artist/easton-stagger-phillips"}],"categories":[{"id":126484,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
