Greg is backed up by a stellar group of first-call, San Francisco musicians including Michael Zilber on Saxophones & Michael Spiro on percussion. There is the obvious love for Miles Davis as well as the 6/8 Afro-Cuban Rhythm. From the evolving melody and latin influence on Late Night Tea to the romantic Brazilian flavor on Glimmer, this is original music that remains accessible, but with a surprising level of depth. This CD can also be added to the relatively short list of CDs that use electronics (such as the EVI that Greg plays on five tracks) in a completely organic way.","options":[{"id":23190121,"name":"Default","price":12.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71890809/-/Booklet_1a_100rgb.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71890809/-/Booklet_1a_100rgb.jpg","width":450,"height":450}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3731569,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
