The second run of an edition of 24 cassettes and the precursor to 'eyeless terror'.\r\n\r\nThirty minutes of older songs reworked with sporadic improvisational bits blended throughout. All of it recorded in a chaotic flurry between a garage and a guestroom. Pleasantly rough and wildly unkempt - a sprawl of madness and hastily documented blind emotion.

'We'd rather not' doesn't necessarily pick up where its precursors left off, rather propel general madness into a new bracket of definition. A quirky offering brimmed with babelfishh's fragmented imagery and riddled with oskar's musical peculiarity. Not to mention; the always blustering voice of winterismyname helping the whole journey to fluidly follow along a foggy line of clarity. An endearing inside look at its creators, as well as a platform to exhibit their friendship with those that helped make the project possible. \r\nThe album features guest cameos from filkoe, mildew, univac, the knertz choir, scamper, com.pare, members of knertz's plus and the aforementioned winterismyname \r\n\r\nWe say that we'd rather not, but, we really think that you should.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---babelfishh & oskar ohlson - pinky swear LP\r\n\r\naside from two songs and a couple of added yelps and whistles this was recorded in a 3-4 week spert in Mainz Germany in June of 2008\r\n\r\nour first record  together is here and it features a lot of good friends! in some way or another it features..\r\nscarlett scamper....audio88..home and beastmaster(of papervehicle)........com...pare.........bleubird......winterismyname....the knertz choir..and univac\r\n\r\nwe are happy to present pinky swear!\r\nknertz 013\r\nlimited to 500 hand tilted and hand numbered LP..s\r\n\r\nwww.knertz.de","options":[{"id":1629175,"name":"we'd rather not (white)","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":24139098,"name":"we' rather not (black)","price":11.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":24139101,"name":"pinky swear 12\" ","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":24139272,"name":"12\" & 10\" (white we'd rather not)","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":24139275,"name":"12\" & 10\" (black we'd rather not)","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":9.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75074280/-/oskar_albums.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75074280/-/oskar_albums.jpg","width":505,"height":242}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":319880,"name":"vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":7282187,"name":"babelfishh - howl bender  C32","permalink":"babelfishh-howl-bender-c32","position":3,"price":5.5,"default_price":5.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/babelfishh-howl-bender-c32","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-18T13:47:54.000Z","description":"Limited to 96 copies on rust orange cassettes and chrome tape. \r\n\r\n30 or so are available here.... \r\n\r\n ","options":[{"id":23054753,"name":"Default","price":5.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":6.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71435179/-/artworks-000030272721-9wmzox-original.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71435179/-/artworks-000030272721-9wmzox-original.jpg","width":350,"height":350}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":319854,"name":"cassette","permalink":"cassette","url":"/category/cassette"}]},{"id":7282141,"name":"goatsgloom 7\" EP","permalink":"goatsgloom-7-ep","position":4,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/goatsgloom-7-ep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-18T13:37:22.000Z","description":"this 7\" is limited to 125 copies and realeased via divergent series.\r\n                            www.divergentseries.info\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nGG is:\r\n\r\nFRKSE FISHH YUCK\r\n\r\nSIDE A: HARBINGER OF THE SURLY MALAISE\r\nSIDE B: R.I.P.
