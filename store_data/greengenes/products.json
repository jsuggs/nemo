A sherpa-lined collar keeps out the cold. The 6-month PJs are footie-style to make life extra easy for new moms; larger sizes are footless for a more perfect fit and more room for quick growing kids.

The clean, sleek lines of Cheekeyes' handmade, highly stylized animals are beautiful to touch and behold, with the lovely grain of polished rubberwood enlivened by a funky dash of color. \r\n\r\nThese toys are made from sustainable and high quality wood that is collected from rubberwood plantations. A rubber tree produces a commercially valuable sap, commonly known as latex. After around 25 years, a rubber tree will start to produce less latex. These older trees are harvested so that new rubber trees can be planted-- ensuring that the manufacturing process is neither wasteful nor destructive.\r\n\r\nCheekeyes wooden figures are made large and chunky, perfect for toddler hands. We must acknowledge, however, that there is no upper age limit for Cheekeyes wooden figures-- even adults can't resist falling to the fun and charm of these unique wooden figures.\r\n\r\nAges 3+\r\n\r\nEach animal set includes five animals; playsets include five animals as well as scenery.\r\n\r\n<b>African Playset</b>\r\nThis set includes a giraffe, a hippo, a lion, a rhinoceros, and an elephant, as well as two trees (acacia and baobab).\r\n\r\n<b>Coral Reef Playset</b>\r\nThis set includes a dolphin, a fish, a shark, an octopus, and a sea turtle, as well as two pieces of coral.\r\n\r\n<b>Dinosaurs Playset</b>\r\nThis set includes a triceratops, a brontosaurus, a hypsilidon, a Tyrannosaurus rex and a velociraptor, as well as two trees.\r\n\r\n<b>Forest Playset</b>\r\nThis set includes a bear, a bison, a deer, a boar, and a wolf, as well as an oak tree and a pine tree.\r\n\r\n<b>Polar Playset</b>\r\nThis set includes a sperm whale, an orca (killer whale), a seal, a penguin, and a polar bear, as well as two icebergs.\r\n\r\n<b>Rainforest Playset</b>\r\nThis set includes an alligator, an anteater, a snake, a parrot and a black panther, as well as two palm trees.\r\n\r\n<b>Himalayan Animals Set</b>\r\nThis set includes a snow leopard, a yak, a mountain goat, a red panda, and a blue pheasant.\r\n\r\n<b>Oceania (Australia & New Zealand) Animals Set</b>\r\nThis set includes a kangaroo, a crocodile, a koala, a platypus and a kiwi.\r\n\r\n<b>Andes Animals Set</b>\r\nThis set includes a spectacled bear, a condor, a llama, an alpaca, and a puma.\r\n\r\n<b>Farm Animals Set</b>\r\nThis set includes a cow, a horse, a pig, a goat, and a sheep.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":47432424,"name":"Africa Playset","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":48235707,"name":"Coral Reef","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":48235710,"name":"Dinosaur Playset","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":48235713,"name":"Forest Playset","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":48235716,"name":"Polar Playset","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":48235719,"name":"Rainforest Playset","price":31.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48235722,"name":"Himalayan Animals Set","price":31.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48235725,"name":"Oceania Animals Set","price":31.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48235728,"name":"Andes Animals Set","price":31.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48235731,"name":"Farm Animals Set","price":31.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127656504/-/cheekeyes_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127656504/-/cheekeyes_cover.jpg","width":1889,"height":2794},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127656519/-/cheekeyes___scenery.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127656519/-/cheekeyes___scenery.jpg","width":3800,"height":2263},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127656501/-/animals_only.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127656501/-/animals_only.jpg","width":3800,"height":2263}],"artists":[{"id":246807,"name":"Cheekeyes","permalink":"cheekeyes","url":"/artist/cheekeyes"}],"categories":[{"id":4584101,"name":"Playtime","permalink":"playtime","url":"/category/playtime"}]},{"id":14980470,"name":"Nosilla Organics - Flip Foot Sleeper","permalink":"nosilla-organics-flip-foot-sleeper","position":33,"price":39.0,"default_price":39.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/nosilla-organics-flip-foot-sleeper","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-20T18:43:44.000Z","description":"Soft, warm and cozy, a sleeper is the quintessential garment for a baby.

The rib knit and merino wool’s natural elasticity make these durable and comfortable, staying on, staying up and always returning to shape. Buy them large and fold up and down the cuff for years of wear... Made from organic 100% merino wool that is super soft and seriously smart, in soft cocoa brown. They are non-scratchy, breathable and temperature regulating.\r\n\r\n<b>About Nui's organic merino wool</b>\r\nOrganic wool is free of pesticides, formaldehyde, polyester, foams, dioxins and other additives used in conventional manufacturing practices. The sheep are grazed on pesticide free land and are never sprayed or dipped as is commonly practiced in conventional wool prduction systems. Organic sheep are bred for resistance to parasites and are fed on organically certified pasture to build healthy immune systems. Mulesing (the removal of wool and skin near the sheep's rear end to prevent fly-strike) is not practiced. Land is not overstocked, causing less stress to pasture and sheep. Organic sheep are happy sheep.\r\n\r\nWool is a natural fiber and a renewable resource that is non-allergenic. Organic wool can be used extensively by those who normally suffer from chemical sensitivity when in contact with conventionally grown wool. Some 8000 chemicals are known to be used in the modern textile industry. Sometimes those who react to wool are actually displaying a reaction to the harsh scouring agents, dyes and chemicals used in conventional wool production and not the wool itself. Merino wool is naturally self-extinguishing, meaning no chemical flame retardants are added.\r\n\r\nOrganic sheep farms are committed to long-term sustainable farming practices.\r\n\r\n<b>Care</b>\r\nNui Organics merino resists soiling because of its naturally water-repellent surface. It needs far less washing than cotton and synthetics and often simply hanging your merino clothing outside on the line for a few hours is enough to refresh and renew.

They feature adjustable straps with shell buttons.  Made from organic 100% merino wool that is super soft and seriously smart. They are non-scratchy, breathable and temperature regulating.\r\n\r\n<b>About Nui's organic merino wool</b>\r\nOrganic wool is free of pesticides, formaldehyde, polyester, foams, dioxins and other additives used in conventional manufacturing practices. The sheep are grazed on pesticide free land and are never sprayed or dipped as is commonly practiced in conventional wool prduction systems. Organic sheep are bred for resistance to parasites and are fed on organically certified pasture to build healthy immune systems. Mulesing (the removal of wool and skin near the sheep's rear end to prevent fly-strike) is not practiced. Land is not overstocked, causing less stress to pasture and sheep. Organic sheep are happy sheep.\r\n\r\nWool is a natural fiber and a renewable resource that is non-allergenic. Organic wool can be used extensively by those who normally suffer from chemical sensitivity when in contact with conventionally grown wool. Some 8000 chemicals are known to be used in the modern textile industry. Sometimes those who react to wool are actually displaying a reaction to the harsh scouring agents, dyes and chemicals used in conventional wool production and not the wool itself. Merino wool is naturally self-extinguishing, meaning no chemical flame retardants are added.\r\n\r\nOrganic sheep farms are committed to long-term sustainable farming practices.\r\n\r\n<b>Care</b>\r\nNui Organics merino resists soiling because of its naturally water-repellent surface. It needs far less washing than cotton and synthetics and often simply hanging your merino clothing outside on the line for a few hours is enough to refresh and renew. When it does need to be cleaned, it can be machine washed (cold, gentle cycle). It is incredibly durable and will keep its color and shape for years. Merino wool dries fast, making it perfect for a family on the go. The merino fiber has a natural protective layer which prevents stains from being absorbed. It also picks up less dust, as it's static resistant.","options":[{"id":47796897,"name":"0-3 mo","price":62.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47796900,"name":"3-6 mo","price":62.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47796903,"name":"6-12 mo","price":62.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47796906,"name":"12-18 mo","price":62.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127333695/-/nuc051_knickers2_cocoa.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127333695/-/nuc051_knickers2_cocoa.jpg","width":490,"height":735},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127333701/-/nuc051_knickerbockers_cocoa.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127333701/-/nuc051_knickerbockers_cocoa.jpg","width":735,"height":490},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127333692/-/nuc051_knickers_cocoa.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127333692/-/nuc051_knickers_cocoa.jpg","width":490,"height":735}],"artists":[{"id":248166,"name":"Nui Organics","permalink":"nui-organics","url":"/artist/nui-organics"}],"categories":[{"id":4584107,"name":"Clothing","permalink":"clothing","url":"/category/clothing"}]},{"id":14720763,"name":"Lille Huset - Paper Dolls","permalink":"lille-huset-paper-dolls","position":53,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lille-huset-paper-dolls","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-08T23:48:31.000Z","description":"These little paper dolls are a very special group of girls who are all best friends.

Conceived of by a husband-and-wife team of a graphic designer and a teacher (with two kiddos of their own), they're also designed to interest your child differently at different stages; the pattern absorbs babies at birth, and when they're older they can point the animals out by name.\r\n\r\nPrinted on sturdy board, these cards will stand up to baby's explorations. Each 5x7\" card is beautifully finished with matte lamination and child-friendly rounded corners.\r\n\r\nWee Gallery Art Cards are printed with soy ink on 100% recycled card stock.\r\n\r\n<b>Original</b> \r\nA boxed set includes a cat, elephant, fish, giraffe, owl, and snail.\r\n\r\n<b>Farm</b>\r\nA boxed set includes a cow, horse, sheep, bee, pig and a hen. \r\n\r\n<b>Black & White</b>\r\nA boxed set includes an anteater, dalmatian, lemur, panda, penguin and skunk.\r\n\r\n<b>Woodlands</b>\r\nA boxed set includes a deer, fox, hedgehog, mouse, raccoon, and woodpecker.","options":[{"id":47535471,"name":"Original","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39919047,"name":"Farm","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40006590,"name":"Black & White","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":47535474,"name":"Woodlands","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":50913549,"name":"Jungle","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127133214/-/art_card_thumb.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127133214/-/art_card_thumb.jpg","width":1434,"height":2000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127133118/-/original.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127133118/-/original.jpg","width":1264,"height":2000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121758036/-/ac_farm.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121758036/-/ac_farm.jpg","width":1549,"height":1984},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121821585/-/ac_blackandwhite.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121821585/-/ac_blackandwhite.jpg","width":1549,"height":1984},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129618810/-/woodlands___jungle.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129618810/-/woodlands___jungle.jpg","width":2883,"height":2189}],"artists":[{"id":220914,"name":"Wee Gallery","permalink":"wee-gallery","url":"/artist/wee-gallery"}],"categories":[{"id":4584101,"name":"Playtime","permalink":"playtime","url":"/category/playtime"},{"id":4584110,"name":"Home","permalink":"home","url":"/category/home"},{"id":5384097,"name":"Paper Goods","permalink":"paper-goods","url":"/category/paper-goods"},{"id":6793809,"name":"$25 and Under","permalink":"25-and-under","url":"/category/25-and-under"}]},{"id":12557232,"name":"Kikkerland - Clip Mobile","permalink":"kikkerland-clip-mobile","position":69,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kikkerland-clip-mobile","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-24T16:37:04.000Z","description":"Turn <b><a href=\"http://www.green-genes.com/product/wee-gallery-art-cards\">Wee Gallery flash cards</a></b> into a cool mobile with the stainless steel Kikkerland mobile kit.

From 1 Ladybug Lounging to 2 Birds Nesting and 3 Chimpanzees Playing, all the animals featured are active, delightful, and easy to count.\r\n\r\nMinimal, bold, and graphic in its design and layout, the 123s is a very sweet tribute to the late, great Charley Harper and his inspiring world of animals and nature. \r\n\r\n<b>CHARLEY HARPER ABCS</b>\r\nby Gloria Fowler\r\n\r\nThe Charley Harper ABCs skinny edition is a kids' board book in a condensed format featuring many additional illustrations and a similar graphic layout. This book is perfect for reading to babies and pre-schoolers as well as challenging budding, young readers who will enjoy learning the alphabet through Charley's illustrations of the animal kingdom. It includes a brief story about Charley Harper and how he began drawing as a young boy on the farm where he grew up. Colorful images like R is for Rabbit, S is for Squirrel, and T is for Turtle, make identifying letters and animals memorable and fun.\r\n\r\n<b>CHARLEY HARPER COLORS</b>\r\nby Gloria Fowler\r\n\r\nThis lovely book helps youngsters identify colors through vivid illustrations that capture their imagination. Early readers can also recognize the written names of the colors, as each one is spelled out in its corresponding color.\r\n\r\nCharley Harper’s bold and simple illustrations will engage the young toddler’s imaginations. Featuring some of Harper’s classic birds and including other rare images, this book is a visual treat. \r\n\r\n<b>ALEXANDER GIRARD COLOR</b>\r\nby Gloria Fowler\r\n\r\nThis board book celebrates the vivid, playful, and sophisticated world of 20th century design icon Alexander Girard. Especially known for his textile designs for Herman Miller, Girard’s wide-ranging repertoire also spanned many disciplines, including interior design, graphic design, and furniture design.\r\n\r\nPre-schoolers learning to identify colors will enjoy this charming little book and its whimsical illustrations. Savvy adults will also love the vintage illustrations and sophisticated design!\r\n\r\n<b>ABC IS FOR CIRCUS</b>\r\nby Patrick Hruby\r\n\r\nABC is for Circus celebrates the colorful and festive world of the circus through each letter of the alphabet. Young children will enjoy memorizing letters and words like A is for Acrobats, B is for Big Top, and C is for Calliope in this imaginative chunky board book. \r\n\r\nAs a young boy, Patrick Hruby dreamt of running away to join the circus and become a trapeze artist. Eventually, however, he grew up to study math and physics before attending the renowned Art Center College of Design and pursuing a career as an illustrator. His interest in the geometry of nature is central to his work. Influenced by artists and designers such as Charley Harper, Paul Rand, and Mary Blair, Hruby has gone on to develop his own stunning and modern aesthetic.\r\n\r\n<b>COUNTING IN THE GARDEN</b>\r\nillustrations by Patrick Hruby, written by Emily Hruby\r\n\r\nCounting in the Garden celebrates the joy of growing flowers, fruits, and vegetables in one’s very own garden. This chunky board book is a visual feast from one to twelve. Young children will love finding and counting all of the garden treats. Every other page introduces a new plant into the mix until ultimately all twelve plants are featured together in the final, abundantly overgrown garden. COUNTING IN THE GARDEN is sure to appeal to eco-conscious parents and their “green” little kids!\r\n\r\nBrother and sister team Patrick and Emily Hruby collaborated on this charming little book. As kids growing up in a log cabin in the woods of Idaho, they were raised loving the abundant nature all around them. Emily often made up poetic stories for Patrick’s imaginative drawings. As Los Angeles transplants, they each continue to pursue their respective passions for writing and illustrating. This is their first book together.\r\n","options":[{"id":35105283,"name":"Charley Harper 123s - Skinny","price":9.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":41061669,"name":"Charley Harper ABCs - Skinny","price":9.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":41061672,"name":"Charley Harper Colors - Skinny","price":9.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35105292,"name":"Alexander Girard Colors - Chunky","price":14.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":35105295,"name":"Patrick Hruby's ABC is for Circus - Chunky","price":14.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":35105298,"name":"Patrick Hruby's Counting in the Garden - Chunky","price":14.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109710822/-/ammo_bbs.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109710822/-/ammo_bbs.jpg","width":499,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109704345/-/charper_skinnies.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109704345/-/charper_skinnies.jpg","width":1000,"height":622},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109704321/-/girard_color_coll.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109704321/-/girard_color_coll.jpg","width":1000,"height":674},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109704381/-/abc_circus_coll.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109704381/-/abc_circus_coll.jpg","width":1000,"height":674},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109704417/-/hruby_counting_coll.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109704417/-/hruby_counting_coll.jpg","width":1000,"height":674}],"artists":[{"id":201804,"name":"Ammo Books","permalink":"ammo-books","url":"/artist/ammo-books"}],"categories":[{"id":5305017,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":6793809,"name":"$25 and Under","permalink":"25-and-under","url":"/category/25-and-under"}]},{"id":11154195,"name":"Ammo Books - Modern Art Memory Games","permalink":"ammo-books-modern-art-memory-games","position":174,"price":15.95,"default_price":15.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ammo-books-modern-art-memory-games","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-14T21:03:40.000Z","description":"A delightful game for all ages featuring colorful illustrations from Charley Harper, Alexander Girard, or Patrick Hruby.
