It will leave your skin soft and clean. \r\n\r\nThe set contains 1 round bar of shaving soap made with kaolin clay, 1 bar bath soap, 1 light wood shaving dish with drain holes, and 1 deluxe shaving brush (NOTE: Our new shaving brush larger, fuller, better quality, with a cream colored handle). The set is packaged in a lovely black and white box with clear lid, satin ribbon, and white crinkle paper. The box is all one piece and can be reused. \r\n\r\nTo prevent damage during shipping, the gift set will be filled with packing peanuts that will need to be removed before giving the gift to that special someone. This will ensure that the items in the box are not jostled around in transit. \r\n\r\nHandcrafted, natural Goat’s Milk soaps enriched with Shea butter. Created in small batches, each soap is unique.
