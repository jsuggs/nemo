Protestant takes the grit and grime of early crust bands like Amebix and infuses it with the technicality and raw power of modern hardcore. The result is an intense storm of grinding riffs, raging vocals and suffocating bass lines.\r\nIf Converge had pared back their more melodic moments and focused more on a DIY aesthetic, they might have sounded something like Protestant. Its not all blood and dirt here though. There are some slower tracks like “Obituary” that centers on slithering math-rock riffs before the chugging maelstrom kicks in. Moments like these add balance to the fist-clenching madness of the affair and gives Protestant some ample room to push their sound further.\r\nLike most hardcore albums, The Hate The Hollow passes by like a flash flood, leaving you feeling abraded and disoriented in a very short period of time. It delivers intensity in spades while still balancing things out with its sophisticated compositions and doom-inspired atmosphere. For its crushing density and piercing emotions, The Hate The Hollow is one of the top hardcore albums to sneak under the radar. Keep your eyes open for these guys.","options":[{"id":9577207,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26303200/-/protes.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26303200/-/protes.gif","width":600,"height":599}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1540390,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
