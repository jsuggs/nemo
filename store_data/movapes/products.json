The Protank 2 is also 510 threaded and will work on a 510 threaded MOD without the need for an adapter.\r\n\r\nUpdated in Kanger Protank 2:\r\n\r\nStronger base\r\nPyrex tank is replaceable\r\nGlue Free: All parts are replaceable\r\nCan be fitted with 510 Drip tip\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\nReplaceable Atomizer Heads (interchangeable with Protank 1 and EVOD)\r\nBottom Coil\r\nPyrex Glass Tank\r\nAdvertised with a 2.5ml capacity\r\nUnlike other Kanger Tanks, the Protank is 510 Threaded and it will work on 510 thread MOD/APV without the need for an adapter\r\nDimensions: 1-15/16\"L x 3/4\"D (without drip tip)\r\nTips:\r\n\r\nThe metal tube in the center of this Clearomizer leads from the mouthpiece to the battery end. Avoid getting liquid in this tube when filling the Clearomizer. \r\nWhen unfastening the base (atomizer head) to refill the Clearomizer, the seals are temporarily broken and liquid will leak from the mouthpiece or escape into the center tube. Always wrap a cloth or piece of tissue around the mouthpiece when unfastening the base of the Clearomizer.\r\nGurgling noise or leaks: This is a sign that liquid has found its way into the metal tube in the center of the Clearomizer (and usually occurs after a refill). Ridding the center tube of liquid will resolve the issue. To do so without emptying the tank, remove the Clearomizer from the battery, wrap a cloth or tissue around the battery end of the Clearomizer and blow through the mouthpiece. \r\nThe atomizer head of the Protank can unfasten when unscrewing the tube or base. Always secure the atomizer head before reinstalling the base of the Protank.\r\nIt is normal to find a small amount of liquid in the battery contact area when removing the Clearomizer or any atomizer. We recommend cleaning the battery before charging it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen possible, keep the tank full and never below 1/3 full of eLiquid (\"topped off\"). This helps maintain the \"vacuum\" in the tank and prevent leaks.\r\nAtomizer heads have an average lifespan between 10 to 20 days. When the atomizer head wears down, it may begin to leak. Replace the atomizer head with a new one if available.\r\n\r\n\r\nPackage Contents:\r\n1 x Kanger Protank 2 (Pyrex tank, top cap, bottom cap and 510 base)\r\n1 x 510 Drip tip\r\n2 x Atomizer Head for Kanger Protank","options":[{"id":48578970,"name":"The Kanger Protank 2 MINI","price":14.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":48578973,"name":"The Kanger Protank 2","price":19.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127894383/-/protank2__47030.1375322935.1280.1280.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127894383/-/protank2__47030.1375322935.1280.1280.png","width":881,"height":484}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":14908113,"name":"The Game | G Box™ ( Jesus piece by The Game and Gpen)","permalink":"the-game-jesus-piece-gpen","position":3,"price":45.0,"default_price":45.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-game-jesus-piece-gpen","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-11-17T18:54:08.000Z","description":"Grenco Science™ and The Game are pleased to announce the 2nd installment in the Artist Series, The Game | G Box™.\r\n\r\nCustomized in signature red, this limited edition collaboration intricately details The Game portrayed in the likeness of Jesus, the same illustration used in his latest album release, Jesus Piece.\r\n\r\nThe only configuration to feature an Essential Oil Glass Tank™, The Game | G Box™ is beautifully accentuated with gold print artwork, gold colored internal components, while red LED lights illuminate the base and button of this fully-customized portable vaporizer.\r\n\r\nThe Game | G Box™ comes equipped with 1 rechargeable G Battery™, 1 Essential Oil Glass Tank™, 2 G Glass Containers™, 1 AC Adapter, 1 USB Charging Cord, 3 G Tips™, 1 G Pen Wireless USB Charger™, and 1 gold steel G Tool™.\r\n\r\n*Essential Oils not Included\r\n*Not intended for use with dried herbal remedies","options":[{"id":48341874,"name":"Default","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127728876/-/IMG_20131117_105158.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127728876/-/IMG_20131117_105158.jpg","width":1200,"height":1200}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6685707,"name":"Grenco Science™","permalink":"grenco-sciencetm","url":"/category/grenco-sciencetm"}]}]
