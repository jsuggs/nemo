vintage Hudson Bay Company three and a half point wool blanket.\r\n\r\nThe label has mostly come off but there's enough left to see it was an original.\r\n\r\nOrigins:\r\n\r\nFor over two centuries the Hudson's Bay Company point blanket has been a familiar item in Canada and around the world. It is enjoyed as much today as when it was first introduced into the fur trade in 1780. It is believed that M. Germain Maugenest first suggested to the Company's London Committee that \"pointed blankets\" become a regular trade item. The \"point\" system had been invented by French weavers in the mid 18th c. as a means of indicating the finished overall size (area) of a blanket, since then, as now, blankets were shrunk or felted as part of the manufacturing process. The word point derives from the French empointer meaning \"to make threaded stitches on cloth\". Pointed blankets quickly became very popular with the aboriginal peoples.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":18143079,"name":"Default","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55405571/-/P1060015.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55405571/-/P1060015.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55405555/-/P1060014.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55405555/-/P1060014.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55405291/-/P1060016.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55405291/-/P1060016.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55405299/-/P1060018.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55405299/-/P1060018.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/55405307/-/P1060019.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/55405307/-/P1060019.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[{"id":97127,"name":"Manufactured","permalink":"manufactured","url":"/artist/manufactured"}],"categories":[{"id":2751305,"name":"Objects","permalink":"objects","url":"/category/objects"}]},{"id":5715303,"name":"^ burlapped bottle","permalink":"burlapped-bottle","position":65,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/burlapped-bottle","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-03-17T10:58:35.000Z","description":"A wine bottle mummified in burlap.","options":[{"id":18355581,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/56107915/-/P1060052.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/56107915/-/P1060052.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/56107931/-/P1060053.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/56107931/-/P1060053.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/56107955/-/P1060055.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/56107955/-/P1060055.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[{"id":95825,"name":"Unknown","permalink":"unknown","url":"/artist/unknown"}],"categories":[{"id":2751305,"name":"Objects","permalink":"objects","url":"/category/objects"}]},{"id":5584371,"name":"Weird War","permalink":"copper-sculpture","position":66,"price":200.0,"default_price":200.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/copper-sculpture","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-03-01T01:06:06.000Z","description":"Jeffro Halladay\r\n\r\nWeird War \r\n2012\r\nMolded copper\r\n4\" tall\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mulenewyork.com/?tag=jeffro-halladay\" target=\"_blank\">www.mulenewyork.com/jeffro-halladay\r\n</a></p>\r\n\r\n*Note: Prices are set by artist, no commission.","options":[{"id":17971827,"name":"Default","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54826397/-/COIN1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54826397/-/COIN1.jpg","width":1000,"height":670},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54826413/-/COIN_2_copy.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54826413/-/COIN_2_copy.jpg","width":1000,"height":670}],"artists":[{"id":108663,"name":"Jeffro Halladay","permalink":"jeffro-halladay","url":"/artist/jeffro-halladay"}],"categories":[{"id":3112183,"name":"Selected Works","permalink":"selected-works","url":"/category/selected-works"}]},{"id":5520777,"name":"^ colour photo II","permalink":"colour-photo-ii","position":67,"price":250.0,"default_price":250.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/colour-photo-ii","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-22T00:32:27.000Z","description":"Jennilee Marigomen\r\n\r\n'Surprise Rainbow' \r\n2009\r\nEdition 2/8, 3/8, 4/8, 5/8, 6/8, 7/8, 8/8 \r\nPhoto:  30cm x 40cm (11 3/4\"  x 15 3/4\")\r\nFramed photo dimensions:  32cm x 42cm (12.5\" x 16.5\"\r\nWhite basic frame, framed at full bleed.
