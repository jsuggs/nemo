These parameters also afford the ability for the vase to still remain functional while retaining these custom shapes as well as a high level of manufacturing efficiency.\r\n\r\nSo, in short:\r\nEach vase is completely unique and will never be duplicated.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the vase are 18\"H x approximately 5\" Dia.\r\n\r\nThe vase is stacked plywood in a natural finish with a wax sealer. The vase has an elastomeric sealer inside so it is safe to use with water.","options":[{"id":1216080,"name":"Default","price":145.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2198200/-/SMF-Etsy-AceofVase-1000x1000-20090501.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2198200/-/SMF-Etsy-AceofVase-1000x1000-20090501.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":284319,"name":"Nesting End Tables - Natural Finish","permalink":"stacked-plywood-nesting-end-tables","position":2,"price":385.0,"default_price":385.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/stacked-plywood-nesting-end-tables","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-04-24T07:42:29.000Z","description":"This item is a stacked plywood nesting end table in a natural finish.\r\n\r\nIn the design/construction I used 3D modeling software to analyze the cutting of the material to allow for minimal material wastage.
