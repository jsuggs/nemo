It supports rapid, complete muscle recovery and is scientifically formulated to ensure an optimal, steady amino acid release into the body, without any bloating effects.  Unlike whey, which is absorbed quickly in the body, calcium caseinate is an insoluble, slow digesting, milk-derived protein. Calcium caseinate can take up to four hours to digest. This makes calcium caseinate an excellent choice of protein right before bedtime, since it offers a slow, steady synthesis of aminos, promoting muscle mass. It has also been shown to be anti-catabolic.  Aminogen is a patented, designer enzyme which breaks down protein and improves amino acid absorption. A natural, plant-derived enzyme, Aminogen is ideal for increasing lean body mass and strength and promoting deep muscle recovery. It has been shown to increase Branched Chain Amino Acid (BCAA) absorption specifically, as well as nitrogen retention.

During intense training, your muscle L-Glutamine levels drop sharply. This, in turn decreases strength, stamina and recovery. Research demonstrates that following a rigorous workout, it may take up to six days for L-Glutamine levels to return to normal without supplementation. Without adequate levels of L-Glutamine, it is impossible for protein synthesis to occur.\r\n\r\nL-Glutamine also increases cell volumization immediately. Volumized muscle cells appear larger, get a better pump and assist in protein synthesis. In fact, L-Glutamine helps muscle cells to utilize both protein and carbohydrates. L-Glutamine also acts as a powerful ammonia scavenger. Ammonia is a highly toxic substance to muscle cells.\r\n\r\nFinally, L-Glutamine increases the body's ability to secrete Human Growth Hormone (HGH). HGH assists in metabolising body fat and helps to support new muscle tissue growth. Research demonstrates that the muscles can benefit from a minimum of 2 to 5 additional grams of L-Glutamine daily.\r\n\r\nContainer Size: 200g \r\nServing Size: 1 Teaspoon (2.5g) \r\nServings Per Container: 80 \r\n\r\nContainer Size: 500g \r\nServing Size: 1 Teaspoon (2.5g) \r\nServings Per Container: 200 \r\n\r\nAmount Per Serving: \r\n\r\nL-Glutamine: 2.5g \r\n\r\nIngredients: \r\n\r\nL-Glutamine \r\n\r\nTake one serving 2-5 times daily with water.

HMB is produced in our body from the proteins in our diet and is also consumed in small amounts from the foods we eat. However, only a small amount (roughly 5%) of the Leucine you eat is converted into HMB. For the production of HMB to reach optimal gram quantities per day, you’ll need 20-50 grams of Leucine. Consequently, getting enough HMB from your diet alone is virtually impossible.\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that supplementing with 3g of HMB per day helps to slow down a process called proteolysis, the natural process of breaking down muscle tissue that occurs after intense physical activity (eg weight training) taking HMB gives the body a head start with muscle recovery by minimising the amount of muscle breakdown and protein degradation after exercise. This means that your body stays in an anabolic state for longer, allowing for more muscle growth. HMB basically enhances the effects of exercise on muscle size and strength.\r\n\r\nContainer Size: 120 Capsules \r\nServing Size: 2 Capsules \r\nServings Per Container: 60 \r\n\r\nAmount Per Serving: \r\nHMB (Calcium beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate monohydrate): 1000mg \r\nOther Ingredients: \r\n\r\nGelatin (capsule) microcrystalline cellulose, silicium dioxide, magnesium stearate\r\nAs a dietary supplement take 2 capsules 3 times daily with meals.","options":[{"id":40056282,"name":"Default","price":22.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121858125/-/cheap_4_supplements_usn_hmb.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121858125/-/cheap_4_supplements_usn_hmb.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122144553/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122144553/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5698833,"name":"BRANDS","permalink":"brands","url":"/category/brands"},{"id":5699778,"name":"BRANDS -- USN","permalink":"brands-usn","url":"/category/brands-usn"},{"id":5699784,"name":"CATEGORY","permalink":"category","url":"/category/category"},{"id":5700072,"name":"CATEGORY -- Amino Acids","permalink":"category-amino-acids","url":"/category/category-amino-acids"},{"id":5700204,"name":"GOALS","permalink":"goals","url":"/category/goals"},{"id":5700207,"name":"GOALS -- Build Muscle","permalink":"goals-build-muscle","url":"/category/goals-build-muscle"},{"id":5700261,"name":"GOALS -- Men's Health","permalink":"goals-men-s-health","url":"/category/goals-men-s-health"},{"id":5700264,"name":"GOALS -- Women's Health","permalink":"goals-women-s-health","url":"/category/goals-women-s-health"}]},{"id":12597471,"name":"Diet Fuel Ultralean 8 x 330ml","permalink":"diet-fuel-ultralean-8-x-330ml","position":26,"price":19.99,"default_price":19.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/diet-fuel-ultralean-8-x-330ml","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-26T12:27:07.000Z","description":"A high protein, reduced carbohydrate, fat free drink.

The BCAA’s, which comprise of the essential amino acids leucine, isolueucine and valine, make up approximately one third of skeletal muscle in the human body, and play an important role in protein synthesis. When adequate amounts of BCAA’s are ingested post-workout, the body is placed in a greater state of hypertrophy with a positive amount of protein synthesis. This is extremely important for athletes because it will decrease recovery time as it increases the rate at which lean body mass is gained. The anti-oxidant alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) improves the action of insulin by increasing the muscle cell’s sensitivity to this hormone, which then promotes protein synthesis to an even greater extent.\r\n\r\nContainer Size: 120 Capsules \r\nServing Size: 6 Capsules \r\nServings Per Container: 20 \r\n\r\nContainer Size: 240 Capsules \r\nServing Size: 6 Capsules \r\nServings Per Container: 40 \r\n\r\n\r\nAmount Per Serving: \r\n\r\nLeucine: 1900mg \r\nIsoleucine: 1000mg \r\nValine: 1000mg \r\nAlpha-lipoic acid: 100mg \r\nBioperine: 5mg\r\n\r\nTake 3-6 capsules 30minutes prior to your training sessions.

It is rich in branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and glutamine. But not all whey proteins are alike. Some are cleaner and purer than others. Gram for gram, these superior whey protein isolates (WPIs) have more protein, less fat and carbs, than their counterparts - whey protein concentrates (WPCs). Ultra Iso Whey from Universal Nutrition contains only premium 100% ultrafiltrated whey protein isolates with zero zero sugar, zero fat, zero lactose and only a single gram of carbs.\r\n\r\nWhile there are distinct differences between WPCs and WPIs, there are also differences between different WPI products, and some whey protein isolate products are purer than others. With Ultra Iso Whey Universal Nutrition don't add any gums, binders, fillers, and thickeners to weigh the shake down or interfere with the absorption of the protein. They also don't use any aspartame. And because they use only ultrafiltrated whey isolates, Ultra Iso Whey preserves many of the important biological fractions found in whey including immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, GMP, and BSA. With our Ultra Iso Whey, you get a full spectrum whey isolate protein shake that mixes easily with a spoon and goes down easy. Best of all, Ultra Iso Whey is so clean, you can actually taste the difference.\r\nContainer Size: 909g \r\nServing Size: 1 scoop (25g) \r\nServings Per Container: 36    \r\n\r\nAmount Per Serving: \r\n\r\nTotal Calories: 88\r\nProtein: 21g \r\nTotal Carbohydrates: 1g \r\n-Sugars: 0g \r\nFat: 0g \r\n-Saturates: 0g \r\nSodium: 57mg \r\nRiboflavin: 140mcg \r\nCalcium: 105mg \r\nPhosphorus: 58mg \r\nMagnesium: 18mg \r\nPotassium: 135mg \r\n\r\nIngredients: \r\n\r\nUltrafiltered isolated whey protein, natural and artificial flavours, citric acid, malic acid, lecithin, fruit punch flavour, sodium chloride, Allura Red (E129/FD&C Red) and sucralose.\r\n\r\nPlease Note: Nutritional facts and ingredients may vary slightly between flavours\r\nMix 1 rounded scoop with 200 – 250ml of water.

First, Universal Nutition's Advanced Soy Pro is a complete protein supplement – it contains all the necessary amino acids that an athlete needs to grow. Second, Advanced Soy Pro has the highest ratio of “critical cluster” amino acids (glutamine, all three branched-chain aminos, and arginine) found anywhere–higher than egg, milk and even whey! Third, Advanced Soy Pro is both cholesterol and lactose free, making it perfect for athletes wishing to avoid dairy. Finally, only Advanced Soy Pro contains less than one gram of carbs and less than two grams of fat per serving. Mounting evidence suggests that regular use of soy can benefit the athlete by promoting cardiovascular health, inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to estrogen, boosting the immune system, lowering cholesterol, preventing bone loss and more.\r\nContainer Size: 681g \r\nServing Size: 1 scoop (33g) \r\nServings Per Container: 21\r\n\r\nAmount Per Serving: \r\n\r\nTotal Calories: 121 \r\nProtein: 27g \r\nTotal Carbohydrates: <1g \r\n-Sugars: 0g \r\nFat: 1.4g \r\n-Saturates: 0g \r\n-Trans Fat: 0g \r\nThiamin: 57mcg \r\nRiboflavin: 31mcg \r\nFolic Acid: 64mcg \r\nBiotin: 8mcg \r\nCalcium: 60mg \r\nIron: 5mg \r\nPhosphorus: 250mg \r\nZinc: 1.2mg \r\nCopper: 440mcg \r\nSodium: 280mg \r\n\r\nIngredients: \r\n\r\nSupro Brand Isolated Soy Protein, Natural and Artificial Flavours and Acesufame Potassium \r\n\r\nPlease Note: Nutritional facts and ingredients may vary slightly between flavours \r\nMix one scoop with 350 – 500ml of your favourite beverages.

While you will probably be familiar with protein blends in general (for example Sci-MX's excellent GRS-9 Hour Protein) the plant based protein sources are fairly new to the market - what is the difference?\r\n\r\nThe main difference between plant based proteins and milk based proteins is the amino acid profile - what it is made up of. If you get a fairly balanced diet then the amino acid profile of your protein shake won't make very much difference and both have their advantages and disadvantages - Pro-VX has a lot more arginine than Sci-MX GRS 9 Hour Protein, but typically less leucine.

The unique and environmentally friendly process extracts pure European pea protein from Pisum Sativum using water and no chemicals. This provides what Reflex Nutrition believe to be the perfect instant mixing vegan protein powder that is highly digestible and directly comparable to the best animal sources of protein like whey, eggs and milk. This great tasting instant mixing product provides 74% protein that has 98% digestibility and a great amino acid score of 95%.\r\n \r\nVegan Protein contains more BCAA's, more arginine and more glutamine for the athlete\r\nThe critically important branched-chain amino acids, L-Leucine, L-Isoleucine and L-Valine, which are responsible for building, repairing and maintaining muscle tissue are contained in abundance. In fact, pea protein contains more BCAA's than the best egg white protein. Further pea protein contains up to double the amount of arginine, responsible for growth, repair and nitric oxide synthesis, when compared to whey protein. Finally pea protein contains higher amounts of Glutamine compared to whey protein and egg protein. Overall the amino acid profile of pea protein is one of the greatest for supplying sportsmen and women's most valuable amino acids.\r\n \r\nA Vegan Protein that is Soy Free, Gluten Free and GM free\r\nThere are a number of vegan based proteins available but few can claim to be soy free, gluten free, GM free and be allergen free too. Not to mention the fact that the pea protein found in Vegan Protein is one the most environmentally sound proteins in the world, with an absence of nitrogen fertilizers from the growing process. The factory in which the pea protein is processed is dedicated to these pea products.\r\n \r\nVegan Protein is Sweetened with stevia\r\nStevia is a collection of plants that have been used for hundreds of years for sweetening food and drinks. The natural sweetness of stevia is captured by steeping it in water and then purifying to provide a calorie-free sweet taste.\r\n \r\nVegan Protein contains added probiotics & digestive enzymes\r\nAnother big difference that sets Vegan Protein apart from the competition is the standard inclusion of the very special Digezyme digestive enzyme complex and LactoSpore probiotic spores. Digezyme has been extensively studied and may enhance protein digestion, whilst LactoSpore probiotic spores, similar to those found in yoghurt, may help support a healthy digestive system.\r\n \r\nImpeccably manufactured with green energy\r\nVegan protein is made in Reflex Nutrition's brand new state of the art facility in accordance with IS09001 quality control procedures - each and every batch of Vegan Protein is tested to ensure it meets labelled protein levels. You'll also be pleased to hear that Vegan Protein was manufactured using 100% deep green energy which is sourced completely from renewable sources.\r\n\r\n Suitable for vegans\r\n\r\n• Free from artificial sweeteners and colourings.\r\n\r\n• Made using Deep Green energy\r\n\r\n• Soy free formula\r\nContainer Size: 2,100g\r\nServing Size: 2 scoops (25g)\r\nServings Per Container: 84\r\n \r\nAmount Per Serving:\r\n \r\nTotal Calories: 92\r\nProtein: 18.5g\r\nTotal Carbohydrates: 1g\r\n-Sugars: 0.4g\r\n-Dietary Fibre: 0.9g\r\nFat: 1.4g\r\n-Saturates: 0.7g\r\nSodium: 0.3g\r\nDigestive Enzymes (Digezyme): 40mg\r\nProbiotics (Lactospore): 50,000,000 Spores\r\n \r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\nPea Protein (from Pisum Sativum peas), Natural Colourings (Fat Reduced Cocoa Powder (chocolate varieties only), Betanin (berry and fruit varieties only), Beta Carotene (banana, vanilla and smooth fruit varieties only)), Flavourings, Thickener (carboxymethyl cellulose), Natural Sweetener (Stevia), Digezyme Digestive Enzyme Complex (Amylase, Protease, Cellulase, Lactase, Lipase), LactoSpore Probiotic Spores (Bacillus Coagulans).\r\n \r\nPlease Note:  Nutritional facts and ingredients may vary slightly between flavours.\r\n","options":[{"id":40052400,"name":"Chocolate","price":35.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40052403,"name":"Smooth Fruits","price":35.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40052406,"name":"Strawberry","price":35.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121855863/-/cheap_4_supplements_reflex_vegan_protein.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121855863/-/cheap_4_supplements_reflex_vegan_protein.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122144913/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122144913/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5698833,"name":"BRANDS","permalink":"brands","url":"/category/brands"},{"id":5699751,"name":"BRANDS -- Reflex","permalink":"brands-reflex","url":"/category/brands-reflex"},{"id":5699784,"name":"CATEGORY","permalink":"category","url":"/category/category"},{"id":5700171,"name":"CATEGORY -- Recovery","permalink":"category-recovery","url":"/category/category-recovery"},{"id":5700174,"name":"CATEGORY -- Protein","permalink":"category-protein","url":"/category/category-protein"},{"id":5700204,"name":"GOALS","permalink":"goals","url":"/category/goals"},{"id":5700207,"name":"GOALS -- Build Muscle","permalink":"goals-build-muscle","url":"/category/goals-build-muscle"},{"id":5700261,"name":"GOALS -- Men's Health","permalink":"goals-men-s-health","url":"/category/goals-men-s-health"},{"id":5700264,"name":"GOALS -- Women's Health","permalink":"goals-women-s-health","url":"/category/goals-women-s-health"}]},{"id":12596613,"name":"Thermo Fusion 100ct","permalink":"thermo-fusion-100ct","position":65,"price":20.99,"default_price":20.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/thermo-fusion-100ct","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-26T10:44:50.000Z","description":"For years loyal Reflex Nutrition customers have been asking for a fat loss formula that contains the latest nutraceutical advances containing optimal doses and guaranteed results.

Peptide Fusion sets an unbeaten standard for a blended protein by using the very highest quality ingredients in optimised ratios.  It includes the finest preferentially selected whey protein, chosen for its superior levels of Branch Chain Amino Acids and higher levels of protein, the finest, cold processed ultra filtered milk protein providing undenatured micellar casein along with the purest egg white protein available on the market.  These are all assayed in the lab with custom manufactured flavourings, natural colourings and an absence of salt, artificial colouring and indeed anything that represents a compromise to health.\r\n\r\nPerhaps more importantly, we clearly state the ratios of the main 3 superior proteins so that you know exactly how much of each protein source has been used.  This is opposed to the secret ‘proprietary blend’ approaches that are sometimes nothing more than a low quality and low cost mix of milk, egg and cheap soy. You can nearly always tell by looking at the ingredients list.  If whey protein appears first then the majority of the protein in the tub will be whey protein because legally ingredients have to be listed in order of quantity. That is not necessarily what you want if you are buying a blend for its time release properties.  Ideally you would want to see micellar casein first on the ingredient list. Peptide Fusion contains a blend of 33:33:33 Micellar Casein, Egg White Isolate and undenatured whey protein with all protein fractions present and proven by lab assay. The formulation is finished in a base of glutamine peptides and digestive enzymes and Lactospore pro-biotics for their health focused benefits relating to gut health.\r\n\r\nContains three proteins which have their own inherent benefits and digests at a different rate offering prolonged anabolic support;\r\n\r\nMicellar casein, which is a slow digesting protein.\r\n\r\nEgg white protein isolate.

Whey Deluxe is The Best Tasting Whey Protein Available\r\nInstant Whey Deluxe is a variant of Instant Whey, probably the most highly respected whey protein in the UK today.  The Deluxe variant focuses on flavour and Reflex Nutrition are confident that you will agree that it is simply the best tasting whey protein product you can buy today. This has been achieved by using the very best and most expensive ingredients available such as real freeze dried strawberry puree for their strawberry flavour and the richest, darkest, cocoa for an amazing chocolate experience. Make no mistake, Instant Whey Deluxe is by far the best tasting whey protein shake you’ll ever experience.\r\n\r\nWhey Protein Concentrate & Isolate as the primary ingredients\r\nInstant Whey Deluxe contains whey protein concentrate & isolate as the main source of protein; arguably the most expensive and purest forms of protein available, other brands may contain inferior sources of protein like soy or pea.  Instant Whey Deluxe also contains Reflex Nutrition's totally exclusive Muscle Drive peptide complex. This complex is a precise combination of two muscle building ingredients:\r\n\r\nPeptide Bonded Glutamine\r\n\r\nHydrolysed Whey Protein\r\n\r\nAdded Pro Biotics & Digestive Enzymes\r\n\r\nPreferentially selected Whey Protein, the Best Reflex Nutrition go to great lengths to ensure that Instant Whey Deluxe contains preferentially selected batches of whey protein which are carefully chosen to meet a very strict criteria that dictate higher levels of protein, lower levels of fat and lower levels of carbs. Its all sourced from the EU and does NOT contain any hormones or heavy metals which can be found in some non EU material.\r\n\r\nInstant Whey Deluxe contains Bio-Active Fractions\r\nThe whey protein found in Insant Whey Deluxe is made using cross flow micro filtration and ultra filtration. These unique processes are carried out at low temperature to preserve many beneficial bio-active whey fractions like Glycomacropeptide, Lactoferrin, Immunoglobulin and others.\r\n\r\nContainer Size: 2250g \r\nServing Size: 2 scoops (25g) \r\nServings Per Container: 90 \r\n\r\nAmount Per Serving: \r\nTotal Calories: 87 \r\nProtein: 18g \r\nTotal Carbohydrates: 3.3g \r\n-Sugars: 1.7g \r\n-Dietary Fibre: <0.2g \r\nFat: 1.1g \r\n-Saturates: 0.5g \r\nSodium: 88mg \r\n\r\nIngredients: \r\nPreferentially selected protein blend (Whey Protein (Ultra filtered Whey Protein Concentrate, Cross Flow Micro Filtered Whey Protein Isolate), Muscle Drive (Peptide Bonded Glutamine (derived from wheat protein) Hydrolysed Whey Protein (degree of hydrolysis 30%), Milk Protein, Natural Colouring (Alkalized Cocoa Powder), Thickener (Carboxymethyl Cellulose), Emulsifier (Soya Lecithin), Flavouring, Digezyme Enzyme Complex (Amylase, Protease, Cellulase, Lactase, Lipase), Artificial Sweeteners (Acesulfame K, Sucralose), Lactospore Probiotics (Bacillus Coagulans). \r\n\r\nPlease Note:  Nutritional facts and ingredients may vary slightly between flavours. \r\n\r\nTake 2 measures (25g) and mix with 200ml water or skimmed milk in shaker or blender.

By using native whey protein isolate in the formula, it provides significant, unique, performance and health benefits.  It is unmatched within the market.\r\n \r\nNative whey provides significant additional benefits, critically containing up to 166% more bioavailable cystine (two cysteine molecules linked by a disulphide bridge) and up to 16% more L-leucine than other forms of whey protein.  L-leucine helps build and repair muscle, whilst cystine is essential in the production of the body’s master antioxidant glutathione which is vital for optimal immune function and therefore recovery after strenuous exercise.\r\n \r\nReflex partnered with one of the world’s newest, most sophisticated and environmentally sound dairies to bring you native whey protein isolate extracted directly from fresh skimmed milk.  It is this superior process that is carried out at low temperature via complex ultra and membrane filtration that captures virtually every single highly valuable biologically active protein fraction in its native form.\r\n \r\nJust like the previous formula Instant Whey is still one of the only whey protein powders in the world where every finished batch is laboratory tested to ensure that it delivers a market leading 80% level of protein.  This is done in accordance with ISO 17025 quality standards and procedures.\r\n \r\nInstant Whey contains an improved version of the Reflex renowned Muscle Drive peptide complex.  This complex is a precise combination of two muscle building ingredients:\r\n \r\nPeptide-bonded glutamine:  This is glutamine in a highly absorbable format, especially suited for use in combination with native whey protein where it is utilised more effectively by the body than standard free form L-glutamine, thus helping recovery after strenuous exercise.\r\n \r\nHydrolysed whey protein:  Newly formulated with higher levels of whey protein hydrolsate.  This is specially selected with a high degree of hydrolysis which is rich in low molecular weight peptides and amino acids.  The body can absorb peptides much faster than whole proteins, thus allowing for an almost instantaneous 'hit' of muscle building amino acids.\r\n \r\nAdded probiotics & digestive enzymes\r\nAnother big difference that has always set Instant Whey apart from the competition is the standard inclusion of the very special Digezyme digestive enzyme complex and LactoSpore probiotic spores.  Digezyme has been extensively studied and shown to enhance protein digestion, whilst LactoSpore probiotic spores, similar to those found in yoghurt, provide for a healthier gut.\r\n\r\n• Guaranteed 80% level of protein  \r\n\r\n• Native whey protein isolate is a main ingredient\r\n\r\n• Contains our exclusive Muscle Drive peptide complex\r\n\r\nContainer Size: 4.4kg\r\nServing Size: 2 scoops (25g)\r\nServings Per Container: 180\r\n\r\nAmount Per Serving:\r\n\r\nTotal Calories: 97\r\nProtein: 20g\r\nTotal Carbohydrates: 1.6g\r\n-Sugars:  1g\r\n-Dietary Fibre:  0.4g\r\nFat: 1.1g\r\n-Saturates:  0.4g\r\nSodium:  45mg\r\nDigestive enzymes (Digezyme): 40mg\r\nProbiotics (LactoSpore): 50,000,000 spores\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\nPreferentially selected protein blend (Native Whey Protein Isolate, Ultra Filtered Whey Protein Concentrate), Muscle Drive (Peptide-bonded Glutamine (derived from Wheat Protein), Hydrolysed Whey Protein (degree of hydrolysis 30%)), Flavouring, Natural Colouring (Fat Reduced Cocoa Powder (chocolate flavours only), Betanin (strawberry & raspberry flavours only), Beta Carotene (banana & vanilla flavours only)), Artificial Sweeteners (Acesulfame K, Sucralose), Digezyme Digestive Enzyme Complex (Amylase, Protease, Cellulase, Lactase, Lipase), Emulsifier (Soya Lecithin), LactoSpore Probiotic Spores (Bacillus Coagulans).\r\n\r\nPlease Note: Nutritional facts and ingredients may vary slightly between flavours","options":[{"id":39577872,"name":"Banana","price":74.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39577875,"name":"Chocolate","price":74.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39577878,"name":"Chocolate Mint","price":74.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39577881,"name":"Strawberry","price":74.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39577884,"name":"Vanilla","price":74.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121525098/-/cheap_4_supplements_reflex_instant_whey_4.4kg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121525098/-/cheap_4_supplements_reflex_instant_whey_4.4kg.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122144976/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122144976/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5698833,"name":"BRANDS","permalink":"brands","url":"/category/brands"},{"id":5699751,"name":"BRANDS -- Reflex","permalink":"brands-reflex","url":"/category/brands-reflex"},{"id":5699784,"name":"CATEGORY","permalink":"category","url":"/category/category"},{"id":5700171,"name":"CATEGORY -- Recovery","permalink":"category-recovery","url":"/category/category-recovery"},{"id":5700174,"name":"CATEGORY -- Protein","permalink":"category-protein","url":"/category/category-protein"},{"id":5700204,"name":"GOALS","permalink":"goals","url":"/category/goals"},{"id":5700207,"name":"GOALS -- Build Muscle","permalink":"goals-build-muscle","url":"/category/goals-build-muscle"},{"id":5700261,"name":"GOALS -- Men's Health","permalink":"goals-men-s-health","url":"/category/goals-men-s-health"},{"id":5700264,"name":"GOALS -- Women's Health","permalink":"goals-women-s-health","url":"/category/goals-women-s-health"}]},{"id":12460761,"name":"Instant Whey 2.2kg","permalink":"instant-whey-2-2kg","position":72,"price":47.99,"default_price":47.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/instant-whey-2-2kg","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-19T15:10:16.000Z","description":"New Instant Whey including native whey is set to change the face of sports nutrition.

It is an ultra high quality product made with a near perfect 50/50 split of protein and carbohydrate.\r\n\r\nInstant Mass is arguably the best weight gainer product you can buy on the market today for three very simple reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It contains more protein than ANY other brand.\r\n\r\n2. It contains lower GI carbs, where other brands will use maltodextrin or dextrose.\r\n\r\n3. Every batch is tested for protein, and protein is perhaps the most important aspect of gaining quality muscle mass.\r\n\r\nInstant Mass provides 54 grams of the highest quality proteins available per serving. An amazing high quality blend of undenatured ultra filtered whey protein concentrate, undenatured milk protein concentrate (80% micellar casein, 20% whey protein) and Egg White Protein Isolate. Instant Mass contains our exclusive Muscle DriveTM complex, a combination of the amino acid glutamine which has been peptide bonded so that it can pass into the blood more easily and whey protein hydrolysate which provides more easily absorbed protein chains. For added benefit we also include Digezyme® digestive enzymes and Lactospore® probiotics.\r\n\r\nThe Ultimate Lower GI Source of Carbohydrates\r\nInstant Mass was the first weight gainer in the world to use an exclusive blend of organic oats and barley. In fact, it is still one of the only weight gainers you can buy today which offers an organic whole grain source of carbohydrate. This carbohydrate source provides a low glycemic source of energy along with naturally occurring vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre.\r\n\r\nAdded Zinc, Magnesium and Antioxidants\r\nInstant Mass contains vital minerals like magnesium which is essential for muscle contractile strength and zinc which plays an important role in maintaining testosterone levels. Couple this with added antioxidants and you have a nutrient package that few can better.\r\n\r\nStuff we don't add\r\nAs with all Reflex products, Instant Mass only contains the finest quality ingredients available. More importantly, Instant Mass does not contain any added soy protein, corn syrup, dextrose, hydrogenated fats, cheap vegetable oils, added sugar or salt!\r\n\r\nCompare Instant Mass to other weight gainers\r\nPlease compare Instant Mass to the competition.

This powered up milk shake gives a big shot of protein, 13 Vitamins and Minerals and delivers sustained release energy to keep you going strong.  It’s fat free but still packs Real Nutrition’s trademark awesome taste!\r\n \r\nThe story goes...\"Real Nutrition wanted to make the most awesome shake ever! So headed down to the lab and found a cool ingredient called Isomaltulose. This special low GI carbohydrate delivers natural sweetness, and has been used in Japan for many years.  Technically a sugar, Isomaltulose digests slowly and supports the sustained release energy properties of milk.  The Real Nutrition team then beefed up the protein, ripped out the fat and loaded extra B vitamins to stack it out.  Many moons later and after countless flavour experiments (to make it taste awesome!) the supercharged, super-tasty M-Shake was born.\" \r\n\r\nContainer Size: 12 x 469ml\r\nServing Size: 1 Bottle (469ml)\r\nServings Per Container: 12\r\n \r\nAmount Per Serving:\r\n \r\nTotal Calories: 341\r\nProtein: 26.9g\r\nTotal Carbohydrates: 52.4g\r\n-Sugars: 51.2g\r\n-Dietary Fibre: 2.7g\r\nFat: 1.6g\r\n-Saturates: 1g\r\nSodium: 206mg\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\nSkimmed milk* 90%, sucrose, isomaltulose** 2.3%, milk protein* 2%, fat-reduced cocoa powder, butter milk powder*, flavourings (contain milk products), thickener: carrageenan, sweetener: sucralose, maltodextrin, nicotinamide, glucose syrup, calcium, D-pantothenate, pyridoxine hydrochloride, thiamin mononitrate, riboflavin, D-biotin, cyanocobalamin.\r\n \r\n*From milk **Isomaltulose is a source of glucose and fructose\r\n \r\nAllergens: Contains cow’s milk.\r\n\r\nPlease Note:  Nutritional facts and ingredients may vary slightly between flavours.\r\n\r\nDirections: One serving per day.","options":[{"id":40062561,"name":"Strawberry & Cream","price":29.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":40062564,"name":"Cookies & Cream","price":29.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122084463/-/M-SHAKE.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122084463/-/M-SHAKE.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122145207/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122145207/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5698833,"name":"BRANDS","permalink":"brands","url":"/category/brands"},{"id":5699748,"name":"BRANDS -- Real Nutrition","permalink":"brands-real-nutrition","url":"/category/brands-real-nutrition"},{"id":5699784,"name":"CATEGORY","permalink":"category","url":"/category/category"},{"id":5700171,"name":"CATEGORY -- Recovery","permalink":"category-recovery","url":"/category/category-recovery"},{"id":5700174,"name":"CATEGORY -- Protein","permalink":"category-protein","url":"/category/category-protein"},{"id":5855760,"name":"CATEGORY -- Ready to Drink","permalink":"category-ready-to-drink","url":"/category/category-ready-to-drink"},{"id":5700204,"name":"GOALS","permalink":"goals","url":"/category/goals"},{"id":5700207,"name":"GOALS -- Build Muscle","permalink":"goals-build-muscle","url":"/category/goals-build-muscle"},{"id":5700261,"name":"GOALS -- Men's Health","permalink":"goals-men-s-health","url":"/category/goals-men-s-health"},{"id":5700264,"name":"GOALS -- Women's Health","permalink":"goals-women-s-health","url":"/category/goals-women-s-health"}]},{"id":12459825,"name":"Diet Protein Bar x 12","permalink":"diet-protein-bar-x-12","position":89,"price":22.99,"default_price":22.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/diet-protein-bar-x-12","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-19T14:13:54.000Z","description":"28% Diet Protein bar is possibly the best tasting protein bar ever made!

L-carnitine is a naturally occurring substance found in most cells of the body, particularly the brain, neural tissue, muscle, and heart. Carnitine, whose structure is similar to choline, is widely available in animal foods (meat, poultry, fish and dairy products), whereas plants have very small amounts. PVL use a stabilized L-Carnitine-L-Tartrate as the primary source for maximum quality, efficacy and benefit.\r\n \r\nWhat does L-Carnitine do?\r\nCarnitine oxidizes fat - in living cells, it is required for the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria during the breakdown of lipids (fats) for the generation of metabolic energy. Boosting exercise performance, improving body tone, body composition and fat loss are the most dominant uses. L-carnitine is also widely used for maintaining heart health.

In a word: excellence. What else would you expect from the most proven protein brand? By hydrolyzing the protein in this premium formula we've created our fastest-acting whey protein yet. Hydrolyzing breaks larger proteins down into smaller pieces that are able to get into your system rapidly, enabling your muscles to start rebuilding quickly. For added effectiveness, we've also enhanced this revolutionary formula with digestive enzymes and micronized branched chain amino acids (BCAAs). In addition to being fast, Platinum Hydrowhey is also ultra-pure. That's because it's made entirely with hydrolyzed whey protein isolates. So there's no excess fat, cholesterol, or lactose to slow down your progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy combining the absolute finest ingredients with a series of highly specialized processing techniques Optimum Nutrition (ON) has created its most valuable muscle building protein yet. Everything about Platinum Hydrowhey was designed with an uncompromising attitude toward performance - both in the gym and your shaker cup.\r\n\r\nBefore Workouts: Platinum Hydrowhey mixed with skim milk + Micronized Creatine powder. Why? Hundreds of clinical studies support creatine monohydrate's ability to boost strength, size, and power. Combining creatine with protein and carbohydrate increases muscle uptake.\r\n\r\nAfter Workouts: Platinum Hydrowhey mixed with iced coffee + Glycomaize + Glutamine Powder. Why? At no other time throughout the day are your muscles as receptive to nutrients as they are post-workout. Fast-acting proteins, free form amino acids, and quickly digested carbohydrates provide building blocks for rebuilding and replenishment. Recent research also suggests that a shot of caffeine (in this case, from the iced coffee) may also help facilitate greater glycogen resynthesis, which means you'll be ready to go for your next workout.\r\n\r\nBefore Bed: Gold Standard 100% Casein + Instantized BCAA 5000 powder. Why? Rapid digestion is beneficial during the day while you are active. But, slower is better at night. Casein proteins and BCAAs help protect and preserve your hard earned muscle tissue throughout the night while you sleep.\r\n\r\nContainer Size: 1590g \r\nServing Size: 1 scoop (39g) \r\nServings Per Container: 40\r\n\r\nAmount Per Serving: \r\n\r\nTotal Calories: 140 \r\nProtein: 30g \r\nTotal Carbohydrates: 2g \r\n-Sugars: less than 1g \r\nFat: 1g \r\n-Saturates: 0.5g \r\nSodium: 210mg \r\n\r\nIngredients: \r\n\r\nHydrolyzed Whey Protein Isolates, Micronized Branched Chain Amino Acids (L-Leucine, L-Isoleucine, L-Valine), Cocoa (Processed With Alkali), Natural And Artificial Flavours, Lecithin, Contains 1.5% Or Less Of: Creamer( Sunflower Oil, Maltodextrin, Modified Food Starch, Dipotassium Phosphate, Tricalcium Phosphate, Tocopherols), Salt, Cellulose Gum, Potassium Chloride, Sucralose, Vanillin, Acesulfame Potassium, Enzyme Blend (Aminogen, Amylase, Protease, Cellulase, Beta-D-Galactosidase, Lipase). \r\n\r\nPlease Note: Nutritional facts and ingredients may vary slightly between flavours.\r\n","options":[{"id":39570267,"name":"Chocolate","price":62.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39570270,"name":"Strawberry","price":62.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39570273,"name":"Vanilla","price":62.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121519782/-/cheap_4_supplements_optimum_hydro_whey_1.5kg.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121519782/-/cheap_4_supplements_optimum_hydro_whey_1.5kg.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122145723/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122145723/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5698833,"name":"BRANDS","permalink":"brands","url":"/category/brands"},{"id":5699733,"name":"BRANDS -- Optimum","permalink":"brands-optimum","url":"/category/brands-optimum"},{"id":5699784,"name":"CATEGORY","permalink":"category","url":"/category/category"},{"id":5700069,"name":"CATEGORY -- All in Ones","permalink":"category-all-in-ones","url":"/category/category-all-in-ones"},{"id":5700171,"name":"CATEGORY -- Recovery","permalink":"category-recovery","url":"/category/category-recovery"},{"id":5700174,"name":"CATEGORY -- Protein","permalink":"category-protein","url":"/category/category-protein"},{"id":5700204,"name":"GOALS","permalink":"goals","url":"/category/goals"},{"id":5700207,"name":"GOALS -- Build Muscle","permalink":"goals-build-muscle","url":"/category/goals-build-muscle"},{"id":5700261,"name":"GOALS -- Men's Health","permalink":"goals-men-s-health","url":"/category/goals-men-s-health"},{"id":5700264,"name":"GOALS -- Women's Health","permalink":"goals-women-s-health","url":"/category/goals-women-s-health"}]},{"id":12458748,"name":"Platinum Hydro Builder 1kg ","permalink":"platinum-hydro-builder-1kg","position":128,"price":43.99,"default_price":43.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/platinum-hydro-builder-1kg","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-19T12:13:42.000Z","description":"What gets done in the weight room doesn't build lean mass.

Naturally low in sugar, Oats supply slow-burning complex carbohydrates and hunger-filling dietary fibre. Whey proteins are readily digested and provide considerable amounts of essential amino acids (EAAs) - especially the three branched chain amino acids (BCAAs). Optimum Nutrition’s Natural 100% Oats & Whey combines the benefits of these nutritional powerhouses in a smooth, drinkable shake that's quick to prepare and equally easy to clean up after.\r\n\r\nEach serving of Optimum Nutrition Natural Oats and Whey packs in 24 grams of all-whey protein and as much fibre as a big bowl of oatmeal. Better yet, it tastes great, and it goes down easy. As the name suggests, Natural 100% Oats & Whey is free of artificial flavours, sweeteners, and synthetic colours. So naturally, it's great for breakfast, after workouts, and any time that you're looking for an on-the-go meal.\r\n\r\nContainer Size: 1363g \r\nServing Size: 1 scoop (52g) \r\nServings Per Container: 26 \r\n\r\nAmount Per Serving: \r\n\r\nTotal Calories: 200 \r\nProtein: 24g \r\nTotal Carbohydrates: 23g \r\n-Sugars: 14.9g \r\n-Dietary Fibre: 4g \r\nFat: 1.5g \r\n-Saturates: 1g \r\nSodium: 190g \r\n\r\nIngredients: \r\n\r\nWhey Protein Isolate, Whey Protein Concentrate, Honey Powder, Evaporated Cane Juice Powder, Whole Oat Flour, Oat Fibre, Natural Cocoa Powder, Natural Flavour, Lecithin, Salt, Guar Gum. \r\n\r\nPlease Note: Nutritional facts and ingredients may vary slightly between flavours.","options":[{"id":39570084,"name":"Chocolate","price":31.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39570087,"name":"Vanilla","price":31.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121519245/-/cheap_4_supplements_optimum_oats_whey.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121519245/-/cheap_4_supplements_optimum_oats_whey.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122145783/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122145783/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5698833,"name":"BRANDS","permalink":"brands","url":"/category/brands"},{"id":5699733,"name":"BRANDS -- Optimum","permalink":"brands-optimum","url":"/category/brands-optimum"},{"id":5699784,"name":"CATEGORY","permalink":"category","url":"/category/category"},{"id":5700165,"name":"CATEGORY -- Pre Workout","permalink":"category-pre-workout","url":"/category/category-pre-workout"},{"id":5700171,"name":"CATEGORY -- Recovery","permalink":"category-recovery","url":"/category/category-recovery"},{"id":5700174,"name":"CATEGORY -- Protein","permalink":"category-protein","url":"/category/category-protein"},{"id":5700204,"name":"GOALS","permalink":"goals","url":"/category/goals"},{"id":5700207,"name":"GOALS -- Build Muscle","permalink":"goals-build-muscle","url":"/category/goals-build-muscle"},{"id":5700261,"name":"GOALS -- Men's Health","permalink":"goals-men-s-health","url":"/category/goals-men-s-health"},{"id":5700264,"name":"GOALS -- Women's Health","permalink":"goals-women-s-health","url":"/category/goals-women-s-health"}]},{"id":12458565,"name":"Micronized Creatine","permalink":"micronized-creatine","position":132,"price":11.99,"default_price":11.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/micronized-creatine","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-19T11:47:27.000Z","description":"Each serving supplies a full 5 grams (5000 mg) of 99.9% pure Micronised Creatine Monohydrate.

It is also responsible for improving performance in high-intensity exercise, increasing energy levels, and speeding up recovery rates. It's no wonder athletes who use it have such of an edge over those who do not. Soon Optimum Nutrition is confident that nearly every athlete who competes will use it (if they don't already). Creatine's ability to enhance energy reserves in muscles comes from its muscle protein synthesizing action, while minimizing protein breakdown. This occurs because creatine has the awesome effect of super-hydrating muscle cells with water. It enhances muscles' growth too, making muscle fibres bigger and stronger.\r\n \r\nGlutamine is in high demand throughout the body. It is used in the gut and immune system extensively to maintain optimal performance. 60% of free-form amino acids floating in skeletal muscles is L-glutamine. L-glutamine plays a very important role in protein metabolism, and it appears to be a very important nutrient for body builders. When supplemented, it may help bodybuilders reduce the amount of muscle deterioration that occurs because other tissues that need glutamine will not rob the glutamine stored in the muscle cells\r\n\r\nContainer Size: 600g\r\nServing Size: 2 Rounded Teaspoons (20g)\r\nServings Per Container: 30\r\n \r\nAmount Per Serving:\r\n \r\nTotal Calories: 38\r\nProtein: 0g\r\nTotal Carbohydrates: 9.4g\r\n-Sugars: 9g\r\n-Dietary Fibre: 0g\r\nFat: 0g\r\n-Saturates: 0g\r\nSodium: 0mg\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\nDextrose Monohydrate, Creatine Monohydrate, L-Glutamine, L-Taurine, Citric Acid, Flavourings, Sweetener (Acesulfame Potassium), Colour (Beta Carotene).\r\n \r\nPlease Note:  Nutritional facts and ingredients may vary slightly between flavours.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":39428868,"name":"Lemon Lime","price":21.9,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121428606/-/cheap_4_supplements_optimum_cgt_10.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121428606/-/cheap_4_supplements_optimum_cgt_10.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122145915/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122145915/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5698833,"name":"BRANDS","permalink":"brands","url":"/category/brands"},{"id":5699733,"name":"BRANDS -- Optimum","permalink":"brands-optimum","url":"/category/brands-optimum"},{"id":5699784,"name":"CATEGORY","permalink":"category","url":"/category/category"},{"id":5700072,"name":"CATEGORY -- Amino Acids","permalink":"category-amino-acids","url":"/category/category-amino-acids"},{"id":5700138,"name":"CATEGORY -- Creatine","permalink":"category-creatine","url":"/category/category-creatine"},{"id":5700195,"name":"CATEGORY -- Vitamins & Minerals","permalink":"category-vitamins-minerals","url":"/category/category-vitamins-minerals"},{"id":5700204,"name":"GOALS","permalink":"goals","url":"/category/goals"},{"id":5700231,"name":"GOALS -- Increase Enegry","permalink":"goals-increase-enegry","url":"/category/goals-increase-enegry"},{"id":5700234,"name":"GOALS -- Improve Endurance","permalink":"goals-improve-endurance","url":"/category/goals-improve-endurance"},{"id":5700237,"name":"GOALS -- Improve Sports","permalink":"goals-improve-sports","url":"/category/goals-improve-sports"},{"id":5700261,"name":"GOALS -- Men's Health","permalink":"goals-men-s-health","url":"/category/goals-men-s-health"},{"id":5700264,"name":"GOALS -- Women's Health","permalink":"goals-women-s-health","url":"/category/goals-women-s-health"}]},{"id":12422250,"name":"CLA 90ct","permalink":"cla-90ct","position":143,"price":22.99,"default_price":22.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cla-90ct","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-17T17:48:49.000Z","description":"CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid) is quickly becoming a \"must have\" for people who are looking to lose fat and gain muscle.

It undergoes no heat treatment; therefore the protein is un-denatured and retains its nutrients.\r\n\r\nContainer Size: 1000g \r\nServing Size: 2 scoops (40g) \r\nServings Per Container: 25    \r\n\r\nContainer Size: 5000g \r\nServing Size: 2 scoops (40g) \r\nServings Per Container: 125    \r\n\r\nAmount Per Serving: \r\n\r\nTotal Calories: 161 \r\nProtein: 34g \r\nTotal Carbohydrates: 2.4g \r\n-Sugars: 2.4g \r\n-Dietary Fiber: 0.9g \r\nFat: 1.9g \r\n-Saturates: 1.9g \r\nSodium: 0.04g \r\n\r\nIngredients: \r\n\r\nCross flow microlfiltered whey protein isolate (85% protein based on dry matter), flavour (nature identical), sweetener – sodium cyclamate, stabilizer - pea fibre. \r\n\r\nPlease Note: Nutritional facts and ingredients may vary slightly between flavours ","options":[{"id":39425652,"name":"Chocolate","price":22.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39425655,"name":"Strawberry","price":22.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39425658,"name":"Vanilla","price":22.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39425661,"name":"Banana","price":22.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121426197/-/cheap_4_supplements_nutrisport_whey_protein_isolate.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121426197/-/cheap_4_supplements_nutrisport_whey_protein_isolate.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122146059/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122146059/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5698833,"name":"BRANDS","permalink":"brands","url":"/category/brands"},{"id":5699730,"name":"BRANDS -- Nutrisport","permalink":"brands-nutrisport","url":"/category/brands-nutrisport"},{"id":5699784,"name":"CATEGORY","permalink":"category","url":"/category/category"},{"id":5700171,"name":"CATEGORY -- Recovery","permalink":"category-recovery","url":"/category/category-recovery"},{"id":5700174,"name":"CATEGORY -- Protein","permalink":"category-protein","url":"/category/category-protein"},{"id":5700204,"name":"GOALS","permalink":"goals","url":"/category/goals"},{"id":5700207,"name":"GOALS -- Build Muscle","permalink":"goals-build-muscle","url":"/category/goals-build-muscle"},{"id":5700261,"name":"GOALS -- Men's Health","permalink":"goals-men-s-health","url":"/category/goals-men-s-health"},{"id":5700264,"name":"GOALS -- Women's Health","permalink":"goals-women-s-health","url":"/category/goals-women-s-health"}]},{"id":12421287,"name":"Weight Gainer 5kg","permalink":"weight-gainer-5kg","position":154,"price":37.99,"default_price":37.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/weight-gainer-5kg","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-17T16:58:23.000Z","description":"To gain weight you need to increase your daily food intake with good nutrition.

So Nutrisport 90+ provides the best of both for muscle growth at any time of the day or night.\r\n\r\n• Calorie Free sweetener (aspartame free)\r\n\r\n• Low in fat and carbohydrate\r\n\r\n• Supports muscle growth/reduces muscle breakdown\r\n\r\n• High BV Whey Protein Isolate\r\n\r\n• Slow Digest Micellar Casein\r\n\r\n• Quick but prolonged release of amino acids to muscles\r\n\r\n• Highest Protein Percentage of any Protein in it's class\r\n\r\nContainer Size: 908g \r\nServing Size: 2 scoop (53g) \r\nServings Per Container: 14    \r\n\r\nContainer Size: 2.5kg \r\nServing Size: 2 scoop (53g) \r\nServings Per Container: 47    \r\n\r\nContainer Size: 5kg \r\nServing Size: 2 scoop (53g) \r\nServings Per Container: 94    \r\n\r\nAmount Per Serving: \r\n\r\nTotal Calories: 199.2 \r\nProtein: 45.58g \r\nTotal Carbohydrates: 3.6g \r\n-Sugars: 2.5g \r\n-Dietary Fiber: 1.0g \r\nFat: 1.48g \r\n-Saturates: 1.48g \r\nSodium: 0.047g \r\n\r\nIngredients: \r\n\r\nUndenatured Cross Flow Mircofiltered Whey Protein Isolate 65%, Isolated Undernatured Micellar casein 33%, stabiliser - pea fibre, sweetener – cyclamate & saccharin, natural flavour \r\n\r\nPlease Note: Nutritional facts and ingredients may vary slightly between flavours \r\n","options":[{"id":39425034,"name":"Chocolate","price":17.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39425037,"name":"Strawberry","price":17.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39425040,"name":"Vanilla","price":17.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39425043,"name":"Banana","price":17.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39425046,"name":"Raspberry","price":17.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121425378/-/cheap_4_supplements_nutrisport_90_protein_908.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121425378/-/cheap_4_supplements_nutrisport_90_protein_908.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122146107/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122146107/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5698833,"name":"BRANDS","permalink":"brands","url":"/category/brands"},{"id":5699730,"name":"BRANDS -- Nutrisport","permalink":"brands-nutrisport","url":"/category/brands-nutrisport"},{"id":5699784,"name":"CATEGORY","permalink":"category","url":"/category/category"},{"id":5700171,"name":"CATEGORY -- Recovery","permalink":"category-recovery","url":"/category/category-recovery"},{"id":5700174,"name":"CATEGORY -- Protein","permalink":"category-protein","url":"/category/category-protein"},{"id":5700204,"name":"GOALS","permalink":"goals","url":"/category/goals"},{"id":5700207,"name":"GOALS -- Build Muscle","permalink":"goals-build-muscle","url":"/category/goals-build-muscle"},{"id":5700261,"name":"GOALS -- Men's Health","permalink":"goals-men-s-health","url":"/category/goals-men-s-health"},{"id":5700264,"name":"GOALS -- Women's Health","permalink":"goals-women-s-health","url":"/category/goals-women-s-health"}]},{"id":12420852,"name":"Muscle Infusion 2.2kg","permalink":"muscle-infusion-2-2kg","position":159,"price":53.99,"default_price":53.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/muscle-infusion-2-2kg","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-17T16:35:28.000Z","description":"From the Nutrex Underground comes the meanest, most powerful, monstrous lean muscle generating protein to ever surface: Muscle Infusion Black.

Yes, whey protein helps you grow – but Mutant Whey helps you grow bigger and faster.\r\n\r\nNew Mutant Whey has been developed after 28 months of dedicated research. It is the world's first protein to use specially selected proteins, each with their own unique uptake rate.

MuscleMeds advanced hydrolyzed Beef Protein Isolate is capable of delivering rapid absorption of high concentrations of amino acids fast. Carnivor Mass provides the mass building benefits of beef “at the speed of whey,” without the lactose, allergies, fat, cholesterol and other problems associated with dairy products. MuscleMeds BPI is 350% more concentrated in amino acids than steak and more concentrated than whey. And it’s enhanced with 5 grams of creatine and additional BCAAs for even greater anabolic power!\r\n \r\nDid you know that when you drink calories rather than chew them, you skip the important first step of carbohydrate digestion and bypass carbohydrate digesting enzymes secreted into your saliva? This fact has been totally neglected by makers of conventional mass gainers. It can result in a delay in caloric absorption. iSpike addresses this problem with a natural system of amylases that slices through every carbohydrate particle in its path. iSpike enzymes act on straight chains of glucose molecules as well as at branch points. This encourages insulin release amplification that wouldn’t be possible with regular foods or garden-variety mass gainers.\r\n \r\nContainer Size: 2590g\r\nServing Size: 4 Scoops (185g)\r\nServings Per Container: 14 (Approx)\r\n \r\nAmount Per Serving:\r\n \r\nTotal Calories: 720\r\nProtein: 50g\r\nTotal Carbohydrates: 125g\r\n-Sugars: 0g\r\n-Dietary Fibre: 0g\r\nFat: 2.5g\r\n-Saturates: 1.5g\r\nSodium: 510mg\r\nVitamin A: 315.00 IU\r\nVitamin C: 99.00 mg\r\nThiamin: 0.40 mg\r\nRiboflavin: 0.80 mg         \r\nNiacin: 32.00 mg\r\nVitamin B6: 25.00 mg     \r\nVitamin B12: 400.00 mcg\r\nCalcium:  6.00 mg\r\nPhosphorus: 27.00 mg\r\nMagnesium: 5.00 mg\r\nChromium (as Chromium Dinicotinate Glycinate): 200.00 mcg\r\nPotassium: 215.00 mg\r\n \r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\niSpike Technology (Consisting of Insulin-Release-Amplifiying Reactive Carbohydrate System (Micronparticulated Maltodextrin, Micronparticulated Waxy Maize, Amylase and Gluco-Amylase) and Insulin-Signal-Amplifying System (Agaricus blazei, D-Pinitol, 4-Hydroxyisoleucine, Patent Pending Chromium 454)), Carnivore (Consisting of Hydrolyzed Beef Protein Isolate, Creatine Monohydrate, L-Glutamine, Branched Chain Amino Acids, (BCAAs: L-Leucine, L-Valine and L-Isoleucine) and Anabolic Nitrogen Retention Technology Intermediates:, GKG (Glutamine-Alpha-Ketoglutarate), OKG (Ornithine-Alpha-Ketoglutarate), AKG (Alpha-Ketoglutarate), KIC (Alpha-Ketoisocaproate)), Hydrolyzed Beef Gelatin, Cocoa, Medium-Chain Triglycerides (MCTs), Natural and Artificial Flavours, Salt, Acesulfame Potassium, Sucralose, Silicone.\r\n \r\nPlease Note: Nutritional facts and ingredients may vary slightly between flavours.\r\n","options":[{"id":39421800,"name":"Vanilla Caramel","price":46.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39421803,"name":"Chocolate Fudge","price":46.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121422723/-/cheap_4_supplements_muscle_meds_carnivor_mass.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121422723/-/cheap_4_supplements_muscle_meds_carnivor_mass.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122146257/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122146257/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5698833,"name":"BRANDS","permalink":"brands","url":"/category/brands"},{"id":5699715,"name":"BRANDS -- Muscle Meds","permalink":"brands-muscle-meds","url":"/category/brands-muscle-meds"},{"id":5699784,"name":"CATEGORY","permalink":"category","url":"/category/category"},{"id":5700171,"name":"CATEGORY -- Recovery","permalink":"category-recovery","url":"/category/category-recovery"},{"id":5700174,"name":"CATEGORY -- Protein","permalink":"category-protein","url":"/category/category-protein"},{"id":5700198,"name":"CATEGORY -- Weight Gainers","permalink":"category-weight-gainers","url":"/category/category-weight-gainers"},{"id":5700204,"name":"GOALS","permalink":"goals","url":"/category/goals"},{"id":5700207,"name":"GOALS -- Build Muscle","permalink":"goals-build-muscle","url":"/category/goals-build-muscle"},{"id":5700261,"name":"GOALS -- Men's Health","permalink":"goals-men-s-health","url":"/category/goals-men-s-health"},{"id":5700264,"name":"GOALS -- Women's Health","permalink":"goals-women-s-health","url":"/category/goals-women-s-health"}]},{"id":12420096,"name":"Carnivor 1800g","permalink":"carnivor-1800g","position":174,"price":48.99,"default_price":48.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/carnivor-1800g","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-17T15:46:35.000Z","description":"The world's first all beef protein isolate is more concentrated than whey\r\nUsing new advanced extraction, clarification, hydrolysis and isolation technologies Carnivor's Beef Protein Isolate delivers the muscle-building power of beef with higher amino acid levels than all other protein sources used in supplements including: whey, soy, milk and egg.

But not all amino acids have the same function or effect upon the body when eaten. The Branch Chain Amino Acid‘s or BCAA‘s are a group of three amino acids that punch well above their weight in terms of muscle building nutrition actually stimulating the production of new protein within the muscle cell, in effect creating more muscle by themselves. This drug-like anabolic property is not only great for gaining muscle but for recovery from intense training and for safeguarding muscle whilst training.\r\n\r\nDue to their use in medicine for muscle wasting conditions, we know this muscle protein synthesis is driven via the m-TOR pathway and of the three branch chain amino acids L-Leucine L-Valine, L-Isoleucine, the amino acid Leucine has been shown to be the major driver of this pathway.

It‘s role is to act as a carrier and of the basic unit of energy in the cell, the phosphate ion, carrying and supplying these to the cellular energy molecule ATP levels. For the bodybuilder creatine supplementation means increased performance. Simply put: more weight lifted for more reps. This extra work means more stimulation and adaptation and this means one thing more hypertrophy.\r\n\r\nAs well as working in the supply chain that provides energy for muscular contraction creatine performs other roles, research shows that it supports the production of muscle tissue and also sucks water into the muscle cell meaning greater cell hydration, important for better performance and also faster recovery as well as giving fuller look to the whole physique.\r\n\r\nWhilst creatine supplements are common it is very important to keep in mind that not all creatines and creatine supplements are the same.

As with other amino acid related substances, HMB appears to play a role in the synthesis of protein - particularly the protein that builds new muscle. Research suggests that HMB may improve the growth of lean muscle tissue.\r\n\r\nOne study involving 28 individuals undergoing a regular weight training programme found that supplementing with 3g of HMB per day compared to no supplementation, contributed to greater gains of muscle over a 7 week period. Studies also show that HMB lowers both total and LDL cholesterol (‘bad’ cholesterol) while increasing ‘good’ HDL cholesterol. These effects were noted in individuals taking no exercise, however in those taking regular exercise the effects were much greater.\r\n\r\nContainer Size: 120 Capsules \r\nServing Size: 4 Capsules \r\nServings Per Container: 30 \r\n\r\nAmount Per Serving: \r\n\r\nHMB (Calcium B-Hydroxy B-Methylbutyrate Monohydrate): 250mg \r\nPotassium Phosphate: 50mg \r\n\r\nOther Ingredients: \r\n\r\nRice Powder, Capsule Shell (Gelatin), Anti-Caking Agents (Magnesium Silicate, Silicon Dioxide, Magnesium Sterate), Potassium Phosphate\r\n\r\nFor adults, take four (4) capsules three times daily with a meal.

Grenade believe that Ration Pack provides the ideal ratios and dosages of quality vitamins, minerals, trace elements, phytonutrients, essential fatty acids and probiotics required to create the best foundation for muscle growth, repair and overall health. \r\n\r\nThe key to Grenade Ration Pack is that it is a ‘Full Spectrum’, daily nutritional supplement that contains everything you need in one convenient, ‘tear off’ strip. Anyone can put together a basic multi-vitamin/mineral supplement with decent levels of all of the basic micronutrients that the body requires but some people want more and some people require more. Let’s face it, athletes, fitness professionals and military personnel ask more of their bodies, creating muscular and oxidative stress and potentially increasing many of their nutritional requirements. Also, it is well-established that there is a lot more to ‘complete’ nutrition than just getting all of your vitamins.\r\n \r\nSo far beyond the basics and even several steps beyond sophisticated ‘multi’ products, with Grenade Ration Pack, you get a variety of research-studied nutrient constituents, along with concentrated, ‘superfood’ extracts. So if you want a truly comprehensive formula, with everything you need in one box, that is packaged in convenient tear-off strips that are perfect to carry around to the gym or even when deployed on operations, then Grenade Ration Pack is the only product that ticks all the boxes.\r\n \r\n*Based upon European Food Safety Authority approved Nutrition and Health Claims.\r\n\r\n\r\nContainer Size: 120 Caps \r\nServing Size: 4 Caps\r\nServings Per Container: 30 \r\n \r\nMultivitamin and mineral\r\n\r\nVitamin A: 400mcg RE\r\nVitamin D3: 7.5mcg (300IU)\r\nVitamin E: 20mg TE\r\nVitamin K: 60mcg\r\nVitamin C: 120mg\r\nThiamin: 10mg\r\nRiboflavin: 10mg\r\nNiacin    16mg NE\r\nVitamin B6: 10mg\r\nFolic Acid: 150mcg\r\nVitamin B12: 500mcg\r\nBiotin: 200mcg  \r\nPantothenic Acid: 40mg\r\nCalcium: 244mg\r\nIron: 7.5mg\r\nZinc: 7.5mg\r\nCopper: 1mg\r\nManganese: 2.5mg\r\nSelenium: 80mcg\r\nChromium: 100mcg\r\nMolybdenum: 75mcg\r\nIodine: 100mcg\r\nSilicon: 13mg\r\nInositol: 4mg\r\nCholine: 15mg\r\nBoron: 500mcg\r\n \r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\nBulking agent: Dicalcium phosphate.

You want something different. They've created an amino acid product that tastes great, and brings something new to the market to help you reach your goals. Utilizing only the best ingredients without added synthetic colours, we created a superior recovery and endurance BCAA superfuel. \r\n\r\nWhen you push yourself to the limit, your muscles pay the price. AminoLast with AmmoJect technology is the only product that delivers a high dose of BCAAs, powerful Leucine-enriched peptide amino acids, anti-cramping electrolytes and AmmoJect, to rid your muscles of waste products that can cause fatigue. Even better, you only need a single serving per training session instead of “megadoses” which do nothing more than burn a hole in your wallet.

The protein is from milk and high-quality whey concentrate and the carbohydrates are from fructose (as a sweetner), maltodextrin (the industry standard carb source in mass building products) and oat flour. Oat flour has a low glycaemic index and so is unlikely to cause dramatic fluctuations in insulin and blood sugar that can lead to fat gains. Oat flour is also rich in fibre, which is often just about absent in most supplements.\r\n\r\nThis formula is designed to cause a slow and sustained release of nutrients to the bloodstream which will not cause large insulin fluctuations which lead to fat storage. The time release absorption principle also means the body has more time to absorb the nutrients and get them to the parts of the body where they are required.\r\n\r\nContainer Size: 4500g \r\nServing Size: 100g \r\nServings Per Container: 45 \r\n\r\nAmount Per Serving: \r\n\r\nCalories: 388 \r\nProtein: 31.6g \r\nTotal Carbohydrates: 46.2g \r\n-Sugar: 22.5g \r\n-Fibre: 0.8g \r\nFat: 8.5g \r\n-Saturated Fat: 2.8g \r\n-Trans Fat: 0g \r\nSodium: 146mg \r\nCreatine: 3g \r\n\r\nIngredients: \r\n\r\nFat filled milk powder, whey protein concentrate, maltodextrin, fructose, soya protein isolate, oat flour, cocoa powder, creatine monohydrate, flavourings, guar gum, aspartame. \r\n\r\nPlease Note: Nutritional facts and ingredients may vary slightly between flavours\r\n\r\nTake 100g (2 x 90ml scoops) with either water or milk 2-3 times per day in between meals.","options":[{"id":39341493,"name":"Vanilla Fudge","price":56.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39341496,"name":"Strawberry Banana","price":56.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39341499,"name":"Chocolate","price":56.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121363260/-/cheap_4_supplements_en_extreme_mass.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121363260/-/cheap_4_supplements_en_extreme_mass.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122147598/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122147598/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5698833,"name":"BRANDS","permalink":"brands","url":"/category/brands"},{"id":5699679,"name":"BRANDS -- Extreme","permalink":"brands-extreme","url":"/category/brands-extreme"},{"id":5699784,"name":"CATEGORY","permalink":"category","url":"/category/category"},{"id":5700174,"name":"CATEGORY -- Protein","permalink":"category-protein","url":"/category/category-protein"},{"id":5700198,"name":"CATEGORY -- Weight Gainers","permalink":"category-weight-gainers","url":"/category/category-weight-gainers"},{"id":5700204,"name":"GOALS","permalink":"goals","url":"/category/goals"},{"id":5700207,"name":"GOALS -- Build Muscle","permalink":"goals-build-muscle","url":"/category/goals-build-muscle"},{"id":5700237,"name":"GOALS -- Improve Sports","permalink":"goals-improve-sports","url":"/category/goals-improve-sports"},{"id":5700261,"name":"GOALS -- Men's Health","permalink":"goals-men-s-health","url":"/category/goals-men-s-health"},{"id":5700264,"name":"GOALS -- Women's Health","permalink":"goals-women-s-health","url":"/category/goals-women-s-health"}]},{"id":12395730,"name":"Extreme Creatine 750g","permalink":"extreme-creatine-750g","position":256,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/extreme-creatine-750g","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-16T14:07:57.000Z","description":"Extreme Creatine is 100% Creatine monohydrate - no gimmicks, no sugars, no trace elements which have shown benefits in lab rats, just the purest creatine available at the best price too.\r\n\r\nCreatine monohydrate has more independant scientifically proven research than any other supplement ever produced.

Combining the most potent natural extracts with one of the hottest, patented, proven supplements to hit the industry in recent years, the all new Animal Test redefines the capabilities of bodybuilding supplementation.\r\n\r\nThe Pro-Androgen portion of the Animal Test formula couples dynamic herbal extracts designed to facilitate a rise in free and total testosterone with effective anti-estrogen compounds capable of maximizing the natural anabolic response. Translation? Explosive gains in strength and size. This complex includes the revered free test potentiator 3,4- divanillyl tetrahydrofuran with anabolic ketosterones extracted from Cissus Quadrangularis—another exciting bodybuilding ingredient. This is only the first facet of the powerful Test formula.\r\n\r\nThe final and perhaps the most dramatically powerful element of the new Animal Test formula is the inclusion of the highly heralded, proven and patented hypertrophic agent, Arachidonic Acid (AA). Backed by university research studies and real world testimonials, AA has taken the bodybuilding world by storm—and for good reason. Arachidonic Acid has multiple benefits for the hard training bodybuilder, the most dramatic of which are the ability for it to enhance androgen receptor sensitivity and to amplify training related muscle inflammation and in turn magnify hypertrophy. This status as an anabolic catalyst made it the perfect backbone for this new Animal formula—providing muscle building qualities by itself and augmenting the actions of the other extremely powerful ingredients that together comprise Animal Test.\r\n\r\nServing Size: 1 Pak \r\nServings Per Container: 21 \r\n\r\nAmount Per Serving: \r\nPro-Androgen Complex: (2500mg) \r\nUrtica Dioica (3.4-Divanillyl Tetrahydrofuran) \r\nCissus Quadrangularis (Ketosterone) \r\nPolygonum Cuspidatum (Trans -3,5,4'-Trihydroxystilbene (Trans Resveratrol) \r\nAgaricus Bisporus (Polysaccharides) \r\n3', 5, 7-Trihydroxy-4'-Methoxyflavone (Hesperetin) \r\n\r\nHypertrophic Response Complex: (1500mg) \r\nArachidonic Acid (40% in a Proprietary Fatty Acid/Oil Blend) \r\nGrapefruit (6, 7-Dihydroxybergamottin) \r\nBioperine \r\n\r\nOther Ingredients: \r\nPalmitic Acid, Steric Acid, Linoleic Acid, G-Linoleic Acid, Dihomo-G-Linoleic, Myristic Acid, Arachidonic Acid, Behenic Acid, Lignoceric Acid, Gelatin, Glycerine, Magnesium Stearate, Water, Caramel Colour, Carob, Titanium Dioxide, FD&C Blue #1, FD&C Red #40.","options":[{"id":39336417,"name":"Default","price":75.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121359948/-/cheap_4_supplements_aminal_test.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121359948/-/cheap_4_supplements_aminal_test.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122148357/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122148357/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5698833,"name":"BRANDS","permalink":"brands","url":"/category/brands"},{"id":5698836,"name":"BRANDS -- Animal","permalink":"brands-animal","url":"/category/brands-animal"},{"id":5699784,"name":"CATEGORY","permalink":"category","url":"/category/category"},{"id":5700072,"name":"CATEGORY -- Amino Acids","permalink":"category-amino-acids","url":"/category/category-amino-acids"},{"id":5700318,"name":"CATEGORY -- Endurance","permalink":"category-endurance","url":"/category/category-endurance"},{"id":5700165,"name":"CATEGORY -- Pre Workout","permalink":"category-pre-workout","url":"/category/category-pre-workout"},{"id":5700195,"name":"CATEGORY -- Vitamins & Minerals","permalink":"category-vitamins-minerals","url":"/category/category-vitamins-minerals"},{"id":5700201,"name":"CATEGORY -- Well Being","permalink":"category-well-being","url":"/category/category-well-being"},{"id":5700204,"name":"GOALS","permalink":"goals","url":"/category/goals"},{"id":5700207,"name":"GOALS -- Build Muscle","permalink":"goals-build-muscle","url":"/category/goals-build-muscle"},{"id":5700225,"name":"GOALS -- Health & Wellness","permalink":"goals-health-wellness","url":"/category/goals-health-wellness"},{"id":5700231,"name":"GOALS -- Increase Enegry","permalink":"goals-increase-enegry","url":"/category/goals-increase-enegry"},{"id":5700234,"name":"GOALS -- Improve Endurance","permalink":"goals-improve-endurance","url":"/category/goals-improve-endurance"},{"id":5700237,"name":"GOALS -- Improve Sports","permalink":"goals-improve-sports","url":"/category/goals-improve-sports"},{"id":5700261,"name":"GOALS -- Men's Health","permalink":"goals-men-s-health","url":"/category/goals-men-s-health"},{"id":5700264,"name":"GOALS -- Women's Health","permalink":"goals-women-s-health","url":"/category/goals-women-s-health"}]},{"id":12394242,"name":"Animal Stak 21ct","permalink":"animal-stak-21ct","position":291,"price":35.99,"default_price":35.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/animal-stak-21ct","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-16T12:08:31.000Z","description":"As a serious lifter, you want to get bigger and stronger.

Just like essential amino acids (EAAs as found in Animal Nitro), and other essential micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals, we need optimum amounts in order for the body to function properly, let alone to make gains in lean mass. Getting the proper EFAs isn't always easy, especially when they are hard to obtain with a typical diet. A typical diet consists of an overabundance of saturated fats, trans fats, and those fats from plant sources (think of common cooking oils) usually overloaded with omega 6 compounds, as they are the easiest and most economical to get your hands on. Omega 6s are important, as they are EFAs too. But it's not just the types of fats. It's also the ratios. More on that later.\r\n\r\nFor supplementation purposes there are only 2 types of fats that are needed; Omega 3's (n-3) and Omega 6's (n-6). Omega 9 is necessary, yet not essential because it can be made by the body in modest amounts. The reason why the body can't make an n-3 or n-6 fatty acid is that human metabolism can't add a double bond to a fatty acid that is more than 9 carbons away from the delta end (acid end). This is also the reason why the body can't convert an n-3 fatty acid to an n-6 fatty acid. Yeah, it sounds like science mumbo jumbo, but is important to see from a chemistry perspective why it's so hard to obtain the right EFAs from the diet.\r\n\r\nServing Size: 1 Pak \r\nServings Per Container: 30 \r\n\r\nAmount Per Serving: \r\nTotal Calories: 60 \r\nTotal Fat: 7g \r\n-Saturate Fat: 1g \r\nCholesterol: 5mg \r\nVitamin A (As Retinyl Palmitate): 2,664IU \r\nVitamin D (As Cholecalciferol): 2,000IU \r\nVitamin E (As D-Alpha Tocopherol): 10IU \r\n\r\nOmega 3 Fatty Acid (N-3 FA) Complex: 4,000mg \r\nFlaxseed Oil \r\nSalmon Oil \r\nCod Liver Oil \r\nHerring Oil \r\nAnchovy Oil \r\nMackerel Oil \r\nSardine Oil \r\n\r\nOmega 6 Fatty Acid (N-6 FA) Complex: 2500mg \r\nBorage Oil \r\nSafflower Oil \r\nEvening Primrose Oil \r\nSesamin \r\n\r\nOmega Absorption Complex: 200mg \r\nLecithin (Soy) \r\nL-Carnitine \r\nLipase Enzyme \r\n\r\nGelatin, Glycerin, Purified Water, Maltodextrin, Dicalcium Phosphate, L-Carnitine Fumarate, Silicon Dioxide, Magnesium Stearate, Chlorophyll, Titanium dioxide, Caramel Colour.

Aminos are the basic building blocks of muscle. Aminos can also trigger anabolism, the cornerstone of muscle growth. As a lifter, you need them, especially the right ones. While there are nearly two dozen different amino acids, only a select few are absolutely essential for igniting the anabolic drive, as new research has shown. Not surprisingly, these required aminos are the same ones found in human muscle protein.\r\n\r\nAnimal Nitro is the first and only supplement that contains the correct ratios of those aminos based on human muscle protein itself. This complex of aminos is appropriately called Human Muscle Protein Complex (HMPC) and they’re only in Animal Nitro. HMPC consists of special “uncoupled” aminos exclusively – those that are free of the chemical bonds that can limit maximum utilization. By using only 100% uncoupled aminos in HMPC, Animal Nitro delivers a precisely controlled dose of aminos that are “targeted” to efficiently enter systemic circulation through a novel amino transport system. Here’s how it works. Each pack consists of a measured 6,000mg dose of uncoupled aminos (HMPC). Once ingested, they form a special bolus (a protective “mass”) that allows them to efficiently bypass the liver. Now this is vital as the liver captures and catabolizes regular amino acids (like those found in protein powders such as whey and more conventional amino supplements) to urea, a waste product. Once safely past the liver, this bolus of uncoupled aminos enters systemic circulation, where they can exert their powerful pharmacological actions–vasodilation and anabolism. When combined with resistance training, Animal Nitro can actually help your body deliver more nutrients to your working muscles, recover more quickly, and build new muscle mass by enhancing protein synthesis, improving net muscle protein balance, and preventing muscle breakdown.\r\n\r\nGram for gram, nothing is as pure, as efficient, as potent, and as effective as Animal Nitro. It’s the gold standard among amino-based supplements.\r\n\r\nContainer Size: 30 Paks                   \r\nServing Size: 2 Paks                          \r\nServings Per Container: 15                \r\n \r\nContainer Size: 44 Paks\r\nServing Size: 2 Paks\r\nServings Per Container: 22\r\n\r\nAmount Per Serving: \r\nVitamin B6 (pyridoxine HCl): 500mcg \r\nNiacin (as niacinamide): 10mg \r\n\r\nHuman Muscle Protein Complex: 4995mg \r\nLeucine  \r\nLysine \r\nArginine \r\nValine \r\nIsoleucine   \r\nHistidine   \r\nThreonine \r\nMethionine \r\nPhenylalanine   \r\n\r\nPro BCAA Complex:  \r\nLeucine: 3500mg \r\nIsoleucine: 1690mg \r\nValine: 1815mg \r\n\r\nGelatin, Dicalcium Phosphate, Microcrystalline Cellulose, magnesium stearate, Stearic acid, gelatin, titanium dioxide, FD&C Red #40, FD&C Blue #1.","options":[{"id":39335280,"name":"30ct","price":32.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39335283,"name":"44ct","price":44.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121359135/-/cheap_4_supplements_aminal_nitro-44.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121359135/-/cheap_4_supplements_aminal_nitro-44.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121359156/-/cheap_4_supplements_aminal_nitro.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121359156/-/cheap_4_supplements_aminal_nitro.jpg","width":600,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122148438/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122148438/-/a_free_delivery_filler.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5698833,"name":"BRANDS","permalink":"brands","url":"/category/brands"},{"id":5698836,"name":"BRANDS -- Animal","permalink":"brands-animal","url":"/category/brands-animal"},{"id":5699784,"name":"CATEGORY","permalink":"category","url":"/category/category"},{"id":5700072,"name":"CATEGORY -- Amino Acids","permalink":"category-amino-acids","url":"/category/category-amino-acids"},{"id":5700162,"name":"CATEGORY -- Nitric Oxide","permalink":"category-nitric-oxide","url":"/category/category-nitric-oxide"},{"id":5700165,"name":"CATEGORY -- Pre Workout","permalink":"category-pre-workout","url":"/category/category-pre-workout"},{"id":5700204,"name":"GOALS","permalink":"goals","url":"/category/goals"},{"id":5700207,"name":"GOALS -- Build Muscle","permalink":"goals-build-muscle","url":"/category/goals-build-muscle"},{"id":5700225,"name":"GOALS -- Health & Wellness","permalink":"goals-health-wellness","url":"/category/goals-health-wellness"},{"id":5700231,"name":"GOALS -- Increase Enegry","permalink":"goals-increase-enegry","url":"/category/goals-increase-enegry"},{"id":5700237,"name":"GOALS -- Improve Sports","permalink":"goals-improve-sports","url":"/category/goals-improve-sports"},{"id":5700261,"name":"GOALS -- Men's Health","permalink":"goals-men-s-health","url":"/category/goals-men-s-health"},{"id":5700264,"name":"GOALS -- Women's Health","permalink":"goals-women-s-health","url":"/category/goals-women-s-health"}]},{"id":12393663,"name":"Animal M-Stak 21ct","permalink":"animal-m-stak-21ct","position":297,"price":39.99,"default_price":39.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/animal-m-stak-21ct","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-16T10:50:35.000Z","description":"Face it, you’re a classic “hardgainer”.

Now with new and even more powerful, Natural Flavone/Sterone Complex (including new Turkesterone), Anti-Catabolic Amino Complex (rich in leucine), Anabolic Adaptogen Complex (with safed musli and rosavins), Insulin Potentiating Complex (including colosolic acid and 4-hydroxyisoleucine among others), Energy Complex (as with Animal Pump, all the stims are in one red capsule for convenience and flexibility) and a new M-Factor Complex (with dihyroxybergmottin), the all-new Animal M-Stak is gonna blow the roof off the proven original.

The harder you train, the more massive amounts of weight and the numerous sets and reps performed in a typical workout, the more stress you put on your foundation. This constant pounding can take its toll, weaken it. And when a foundation crumbles, the house comes tumbling down.\r\n\r\nAnimal Flex is designed to help strengthen your body's foundation, to help protect your joints from the daily grind brought about by heavy duty weight training. Each pack of Animal Flex consists of several key joint protection complexes: (1) a potent joint construction complex to help repair connection tissue; (2) a lubrication complex to help cushion the joints from lifting; (3) a support complex to help promote rehabilitation and reduce soreness; and (4) a key vitamin/mineral support blend to help underscore optimal joint health. Animal Flex is your armor against the rigors of iron warfare.

Since 1984, more competitive bodybuilders have cut their teeth on the Animal Pak than any other bodybuilding supplement in history. Why? Simple. Animal Pak gets the job done. It works. First time. Last time. Every time.\r\n\r\nEach of the 11 tablets included in each pak has been specifically formulated to deliver the goods. By taking the Animal Pak, you prevent the formation of nutritional gaps. Why should you care? The greater your training intensity, the faster and larger these gaps grow over time. When this happens you eventually hit a plateau. You stop growing. Maybe you’ve already hit this wall. To make matters worse, if you take other supplements, these same gaps begin to render those expensive supplements useless. Many of today’s supplements rely on enzymes and other substances in your body to “activate” them. Nutrititional gaps mean these key activators may not function at all, so you may be wasting all of your hard-earned money on supplements that won’t or can’t work.\r\n\r\nContainer Size: 15 Paks
