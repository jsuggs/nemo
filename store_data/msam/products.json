Thinking of how it could achieve this status it stumbled across a magazine ad for a suit company \"Suits that Make a Man\" the slogan read. Not knowing the decieving ways of people, the cloud took this literally and decided to get it self a suit. He bought three of the most beautiful suits he could find. Unfortunatly clouds weren't thought of when suits were designed and so the cloud struggled to fit in them. It managed to squeeze into each suit but got a bit lumpy as not all of him fitted, but he was still happy, because now he was a cloud and a man and lived the best of both worlds.\r\n\r\nThis is cloud in Yellow suit. Made from material, paper mache and thread.\r\n\r\nAPPROX HIEGHT: 4 cm\r\nCOMES WITH 70cm SILVER CHAIN\r\n\r\ngo to http://www.madeit.com.au/madeit/supplierdetail.asp?rsSupplierID=11911 for more products\r\n","options":[{"id":534240,"name":"Default","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/543485/-/yellow_cloud_main.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/543485/-/yellow_cloud_main.jpg","width":450,"height":700}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":112504,"name":"Pendant","permalink":"pendant","url":"/category/pendant"}]},{"id":109418,"name":"BlueBird","permalink":"bluebird","position":2,"price":11.0,"default_price":11.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bluebird","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-05-31T14:09:26.000Z","description":"Just like you see them in the distance and draw them when you lack the skills we bring you this lovely Bird pendant that looks like its really flying!
