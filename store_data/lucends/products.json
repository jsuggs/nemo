The Stella clucth is a nod to the essentials not the clutter that finds its way into bags. Stella is Athena’s youngest daughter, who also happens to be Chace’s first crush. It should be noted that Stella and Chace are three years old.\r\n\r\nThe Stella clutch is perfect for a night on the town, to tuck into a diaper bag or my favorite, to use while traveling. The bangle that serves as a strap makes it easy to keep track of your bag.\r\n\r\nYou may choose the outside of your fabric, however the inside fabric, zipper color and bangle color will be chosen by the designer making each Stella clutch a one of a kind piece\r\n\r\nDimensions: 9.25\"x 5.5\"\r\n\r\nYou may choose from the following fabrics in picture 5 (moving left to right)\r\n1. Wild Child\r\n2. Fractured\r\n3. Precocious\r\n4. Stitched Together\r\n5. Cerebral\r\n6. Introverted (yellow)\r\n7. Wander lust (with pink)\r\n8. Introverted (pink)\r\n9. Wander lust (without pink)\r\n10. Introverted (grey)\r\n\r\nBags are made to order, please allow 7-10 days for your bag to be created with love.","options":[{"id":37870419,"name":"Introverted Pink","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39246570,"name":"Introverted Grey","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39246573,"name":"Introverted Yellow","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39246576,"name":"Stitched Together","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39246579,"name":"Fractured","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39246582,"name":"Precocious","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39246585,"name":"Cerebral","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39246588,"name":"Wild Child","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39246591,"name":"Wanderlust Pink","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39246594,"name":"Wanderlust no Pink","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.95,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121273986/-/LucEnds-June-2013-005.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121273986/-/LucEnds-June-2013-005.jpg","width":2880,"height":1920},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121273989/-/LucEnds-June-2013-055.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121273989/-/LucEnds-June-2013-055.jpg","width":2880,"height":1920},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121273992/-/LucEnds-June-2013-057.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121273992/-/LucEnds-June-2013-057.jpg","width":2880,"height":1920},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121273995/-/LucEnds-June-2013-060.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121273995/-/LucEnds-June-2013-060.jpg","width":2880,"height":1920},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/117935034/-/All_Designs_Tgthr_For_Web_View.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/117935034/-/All_Designs_Tgthr_For_Web_View.jpg","width":647,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2998177,"name":"Clutches","permalink":"clutches","url":"/category/clutches"}]},{"id":7741083,"name":"Quote Pillow \"Stop Holding Yourself Back\"","permalink":"quote-pillow","position":13,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/quote-pillow","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-30T00:18:45.000Z","description":"This embroidered quote pillow will liven up any room in your house.\r\n\r\nThe center of the pillow is hand embroidered with the following quote \"Stop holding yourself back\".
