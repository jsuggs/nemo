Each song offers something different but is still tied in; there are lots of twists and turns but the curtain falls on a happy note.The Grand Union Canal is an important thing to us, particularly the London stretch, these songs took a lot of inspiration from time spent there.\"\r\n\r\nProduced by Billy Barratt and Junk Scientist, the band also made use of an array of instruments with extremely accomplished musicians at the helm throughout the EP. B.J. Cole famed for working alongside Elton John, Bjork, Elvis Costello, Graham Coxon to name a few, adds his distinctive pedal steel to 'Young Hearts'and 'Truly', and Martin Rossiter formerly of Gene, plays Hammond on the EPs opening two tracks and electric piano on 'Young Hearts'.","options":[{"id":15505873,"name":"Default","price":4.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46455339/-/Mock_7.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46455339/-/Mock_7.jpg","width":1000,"height":555}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":303535,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":3715396,"name":"King Island Coyote (EP)","permalink":"king-island-coyote-ep","position":2,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/king-island-coyote-ep","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-05-07T18:50:14.000Z","description":"Released: 11/04/2011\r\nFormat: CD (limited run)\r\nLabel: Something Nothing Records\r\nProduced by Junk Scientist.\r\n\r\nAlso available on iTunes: http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/king-island-coyote-ep/id422593810 \r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n\r\n1) Prairie Wolves\r\n2) They Break Bones\r\n3) Trouble Never Comes Alone\r\n4) Tubes/Wires\r\n\r\nAll songs written by Billy Barratt & David Vincent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the press:\r\n\r\nShout 4 Music -  “With a strong EP, it’s obvious that 2011 could be a good year for Billy Vincent... If ‘King Island Coyote’ is anything to go by, their full-length will surely be impressive.”\r\n \r\nGet Ready To Rock -  “what you get is acoustic based storytelling, some great sing along numbers and infectious rhythms. The new Celtic soul brothers? Just possibly”\r\n \r\nIndie London -  “They Break Bones, which opens in deceptively low-key fashion before opening out into a more rock-folk affair that’s much more invigorating. It even carries a bit of a Mumford & Sons vibe, which is no bad thing… especially once you hit the minute mark and the rousing guitar work kicks in. It’s the EP’s pick”","options":[{"id":12451696,"name":"Default","price":4.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36179340/-/Front_and_Back.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36179340/-/Front_and_Back.jpg","width":1000,"height":502}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":303535,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":1636401,"name":"'The Morden Shake' EP (Limited)","permalink":"the-morden-shake-ep-pre-order","position":3,"price":5.49,"default_price":5.49,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-morden-shake-ep-pre-order","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-02-18T01:52:13.000Z","description":"'The Morden Shake' EP\r\n\r\nSOLD OUT\r\n\r\nReleased: 23/02/2010\r\nLabel: Self released \r\nRecorded and Produced by Billy Barratt.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing\r\n1) Part II\r\n2) Feathers\r\n3) Death & Grace\r\n4) Colours, for You\r\n5) The Ballad of Billy Vincent\r\n\r\nAll songs written by Billy Barratt & David Vincent\r\n","options":[{"id":5980151,"name":"Default","price":5.49,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.99,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.99,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/15574941/-/mordenshakecartel.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/15574941/-/mordenshakecartel.jpg","width":750,"height":304}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":303535,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":415024,"name":"'Stay on course, no remorse' Limited Edition (100 Copies)","permalink":"pre-order-stay-on-course-no-remorse-limited-edition-100-copies","position":4,"price":5.49,"default_price":5.49,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pre-order-stay-on-course-no-remorse-limited-edition-100-copies","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-10-02T14:21:35.000Z","description":"SOLD OUT\r\n\r\nBilly Vincent's Limited Edition (100 copies) self released album 'Stay on course, no remorse'.\r\n\r\nThis 10 track album is released in a vinyl style CD package.
