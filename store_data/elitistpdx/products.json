Venomous doom grind horror from Portland, Oregon.\r\n\r\nThe raw, blackened energy and sonic power of this band really do suggest something very special is lurking here. It kind of gives us the feral excitement that cutting edge extremists like Burning Witch and Nasum have given us in the past. Slow, fast, colossally heavy and effortlessly executed basement crust metal punk. 5 vital tracks to rip faces. You will be hearing much more from these guys. Watch out for a future Elitist / Transient split album coming out on Paradigms too.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":1447935,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/2805475/-/EP_Cover.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/2805475/-/EP_Cover.png","width":400,"height":397}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":289323,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
