Conceived as a dynamic object, moving and symbolic, this edition, 150 copies, is a collection of texts, images and music, divided into twenty-two parts. The cover is made of two hexagrams from the Book of Changes or I Ching, gives Zhuang, “Great Strength”, and Dun, the “Retreat”. Enclosed by two black pages are nineteen images and text. The CD that accompanies this book contains the soundtrack of GHÈNESI. Only one track (32 minutes), composed entirely of metallic sounds and resonances, obtained by bells, gongs and bowls made of an ancient bronze alloy. Inside the packaging there are three amulets (Bullas) for peace (chinese pawn), for luck (red cotton thread) and money (an old coin).
