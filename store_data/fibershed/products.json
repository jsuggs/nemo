naturally-colored Mohair fiber from kid Angora goats. This luxurious fiber is known for its warmth, beauty and durability. \r\n\r\nKid fiber is the most ideally suited graded Mohair for fine knits like hats, mittens, sweaters, scarves or cowls. It has a very distinct sheen, and it also blends well with wool or alpaca fiber. Mohair can stretch an average of 30% of its length and spring back into shape, which makes this fiber in garments resist wrinkling, stretching or sagging during wear.\r\n\r\nThese lovely naturally-colored locks, from <a href=\"http://www.fibershed.com/producers/directory/lisa-colorado/\" target=\"_blank\">Lisa Colorado</a>'s herd, come washed and ready to card. The small amount of vegetable matter that may be present is easily separated when working with this fiber.\r\n\r\nSold in 4 ounce increments. Choose from 3 natural colors when ordering: silver/cream (photo 1), honey/silver (photo 2), charcoal/silver (photo 3)\r\n\r\n<strong>Shipping and handling:</strong> $8.00 via USPS Priority Mail\r\n\r\n<strong>Mohair’s Principal Properties:</strong> Mohair is similar to wool, although it does possess other unique properties not found in any other type of fiber.\r\n<strong>Luster:</strong> The luster of mohair is one of the most important characteristics. Luster is the natural sheen of the fiber caused by light being reflected more directly by the larger outer scales of the fiber. This luster or sheen helps dyed mohair resist fading caused by time and the elements and makes it very hard wearing.\r\n<strong>Non-Flammability:</strong> Mohair is almost non-flammable. When placed under, or near, a naked flame, it tends to shrivel into a bead like ash. Once taken away from the flame, burning stops instantaneously. Early children’s Teddy Bears were made from mohair because of this property and because there is less allergic reaction to mohair than wool.\r\n<strong>Durability:</strong> Mohair can be twisted or bent without damaging the fiber. This is due to its structure, supporting the claim that it is the most durable of all animal fibers.\r\n<strong>Elasticity:</strong> Mohair will stretch an average 30% over its length and then will be able to spring back into shape. Due to this property, mohair garments resist wrinkling, stretching or sagging during wear.\r\n<strong>Moisture Relation:</strong> All natural fibers from animals have the ability to absorb and release atmospheric moisture. They breathe where man made fibers do not.\r\n<strong>Resistance to Soiling:</strong> This property commends its use for woven fabrics, due to the factor that dust does not come to rest on slippery fibers. Shaking and brushing can easily remove any dust remaining on woven fabrics.\r\n<strong>Dye Ability:</strong> Mohair dyes easily and brilliantly.\r\n<strong>Tensile Strength:</strong> Mohair possesses great strength. Diameter to diameter, it is stronger than steel.","options":[{"id":35224857,"name":"silver/cream","price":16.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35224860,"name":"honey/silver","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35224863,"name":"charcoal/silver","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110213961/-/paigegreenFibershed42513-039-XL.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110213961/-/paigegreenFibershed42513-039-XL.jpg","width":768,"height":768},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110213988/-/paigegreenFibershed42513-044-XL.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110213988/-/paigegreenFibershed42513-044-XL.jpg","width":768,"height":768},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110214009/-/paigegreenFibershed42513-051-XL.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110214009/-/paigegreenFibershed42513-051-XL.jpg","width":768,"height":768},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110213937/-/lisa_and_herd.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110213937/-/lisa_and_herd.jpg","width":262,"height":262}],"artists":[{"id":197799,"name":"Lisa Colorado / Sonrisa Family Farms","permalink":"lisa-colorado-sonrisa-family-farms","url":"/artist/lisa-colorado-sonrisa-family-farms"}],"categories":[{"id":5320479,"name":"MOHAIR FIBER","permalink":"mohair-fiber","url":"/category/mohair-fiber"}]},{"id":11140473,"name":"Local Colors Yarn","permalink":"local-colors-yarn","position":15,"price":43.0,"default_price":43.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/local-colors-yarn","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-14T04:55:19.000Z","description":"Get some local color for your own!

Make an amazingly soft \"baby's first gift\" or a luscious neck cowl for you!\r\n\r\nThe rabbits are shorn once their fiber reaches an ideal length. The fiber is so smooth and clean, it can be instantly spun on Allison's beautiful heirloom wheel.  \r\n\r\nThe yarn is spun directly from the raw wool, without being processed into roving first. It is never dyed or treated in any way. The skeins are spun to showcase the nature of the angora wool. Each skein has a unique character and will \"bloom\" (get the classic fuzzy angora look) as you work with it. \r\n\r\nEvery skein is 100 percent angora, worsted weight, with a recommended needle size of US 8.\r\n\r\nThese skeins are rare, and once they sell out, it takes some time to build up stock again.

All raw wool from the blanket came from the sheep of Mill Valley homesteader, Kenny Kirkland, and was salvaged from the barn rafters.  Marin produces 20,000 pounds of wool annually that is underutilized or thrown away.  Saving and processing Kenny's wool was a first step in putting this gorgeous, and once underutilized natural fiber to use.  Each blanket sold creates more incentive to put our local wool to use and support our local farmers!\r\n\r\nThe yarn was milled at our most local mill, the Yolo Wool Mill, and was then woven by Susan Hayes's Point Reyes Weaving Studio.  Hayes is a staple figure in West Marin's textile community, and has been a successful production weaver for decades.\r\n\r\nThe blanket is woven in an undulating twill pattern, and the dimensions (36\" x 70\") make it a perfect personal size throw.  \r\n\r\nIf you are part of the growing personal health movement to rid your life of synthetic fibers and colors, we recommend this blanket as your new beach towel.  This is a way to put your blanket to use! The sand just shakes right out, the wool dries quickly, and is naturally anti-microbial.","options":[{"id":20989779,"name":"Default","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64774325/-/Blanket-1-M.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64774325/-/Blanket-1-M.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64774317/-/Blanket-25-M.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64774317/-/Blanket-25-M.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64802385/-/marin_close.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64802385/-/marin_close.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64807973/-/susan.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64807973/-/susan.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64808077/-/kenny.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64808077/-/kenny.jpg","width":800,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2725247,"name":"BLANKETS AND THROWS","permalink":"blankets-and-throws","url":"/category/blankets-and-throws"}]},{"id":5108757,"name":"Harvesting Color","permalink":"harvesting-color","position":110,"price":22.0,"default_price":22.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/harvesting-color","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-12-19T11:29:25.000Z","description":"<i>Harvesting Color</i>, by Fibershed founder <a href=\"http://www.fibershed.com/resources/marketplace-directory/rebecca-burgess/\" target=\"blank\">Rebecca Burgess</a>, identifies 36 plants from across North America that will yield beautiful natural dye colors.

Its seamless structure will delight as well as flatter you. If you have ever had reservations about knitting in cotton, the yarn used in this pattern is the yarn to start with. Foxfibre® Cotton Boucle yarn has plenty of bounce and will slip onto your needles with ease.\r\n\r\nIf you are not a knitter and would like this piece constructed for you, we can team you up with a local knitter quite easily. Email us at <a href=\"mailto:fibershed@gmail.com\">fibershed@gmail.com</a> for this option.\r\n\r\nThis was the first handknit piece made for the Fibershed wardrobe. The shirt was worn on the farm, out on the town, and everywhere in between. It is an exquisite and functional garment. It was originally knit without the indigo dyed strip at the base. The blue addition (optional in the pattern) came later to highlight the collaborative work we took part in to plant the indigo fields, and to show what color-grown cotton and indigo can do when brought together. The kit includes either brown or green boucle yarn only, if you'd like to dye your own indigo strip, we have indigo seeds available on our site! \r\n\r\n<strong>The knit kit includes:</strong> 850 yards of Foxfibre® Cotton Boucle yarn.

Foxfibre® Cotton Boucle yarn has plenty of bounce and will slip onto your needles with ease.\r\n\r\nThis was the first handknit piece made for the Fibershed wardrobe. The shirt was worn on the farm, out on the town, and everywhere in between. It is an exquisite and functional garment. It was originally knit without the indigo dyed strip at the base. The blue addition (optional in the pattern) came later to highlight the collaborative work we took part in to plant the indigo fields, and to show what color grown cotton and indigo can do when brought together.\r\n\r\n<b>Pattern size:</b> Chest 31 (36, 40)\r\n\r\nYou will be emailed a printable pdf of the sweater pattern within 24 hours of purchase.\r\n\r\nSoon to be available in a knit kit as well!","options":[{"id":16012571,"name":"Default","price":7.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/48306493/-/1071466465_sT2cP-X3_cropped.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/48306493/-/1071466465_sT2cP-X3_cropped.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/48306461/-/873069036_CLQKD-M_cropped.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/48306461/-/873069036_CLQKD-M_cropped.jpg","width":400,"height":400},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/48306469/-/959492274_5pfXZ-M_cropped.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/48306469/-/959492274_5pfXZ-M_cropped.jpg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/48306637/-/sallyfox-X3_cropped.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/48306637/-/sallyfox-X3_cropped.jpg","width":846,"height":856},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/48306853/-/873068043_RiYEU-M.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/48306853/-/873068043_RiYEU-M.jpg","width":600,"height":400}],"artists":[{"id":98397,"name":"Monica Paz Soldan / hand knits and dye plants","permalink":"monica-paz-soldan-hand-knits-and-dye-plants","url":"/artist/monica-paz-soldan-hand-knits-and-dye-plants"}],"categories":[{"id":2725207,"name":"SHIRT AND TOP PATTERNS","permalink":"shirt-and-top-patterns","url":"/category/shirt-and-top-patterns"}]},{"id":4316731,"name":"Spring Sweater knitting pattern","permalink":"spring-sweater-knitting-pattern","position":123,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/spring-sweater-knitting-pattern","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-08-25T03:40:33.000Z","description":"This sweater was designed by <a href=\"http://www.fibershed.com/resources/marketplace-directory/allison-reilly/\" target=\"blank\">Allison Reilly</a> for the one-year Fibershed wardrobe.

Metal components are patinaed brass. This necklace stands alone visually as a beautiful necklace, representing a transition from darkness to light and displaying the three primary colors, but has other purposes as well. \r\n\r\nEach of the felted beads are infused with flower essences, different ones according to color. Flower essences are different than essential oils and don’t have a scent. They instead capture the energetic healing properties of particular plants and allow the user to access strengths within them that might be hiding at the time. This amulet acts as a balancing element when worn. In addition, individual elements can be drawn upon by pressing the individual beads. \r\n\r\nThe different colors assist in the following ways:\r\n\r\n-Black: for when you’re afraid of the dark or the unknown. Eases fears.\r\n\r\n-Grey: for when you’re being indecisive. Helps you access your intuition.\r\n\r\n-White: for when you’re feeling overwhelmed.

Snuggle into a lambskin on the back of the couch. Try a lambskin on your weaving bench, piano bench, folding chair or under your desk in the winter. A lambskin on your car seat will keep you warm in the winter and cooler in the summer and avoid that 'shocking' experience (static electricity) you may have when sliding out of a car seat. \r\n\r\nA lambskin makes a great gift for a new mom — luxury for her on her rocking chair or comfort for baby under the crib sheet. Elderly friends or family members will also relish the warmth and softness of a lambskin in a favorite chair or on the couch. (Some of Robin's customers swear that Jacob lambskins have medicinal qualities!) \r\n\r\nEach lambskin is unique in its pattern, but all are equally soft and beautiful.\r\n\r\nMeridian Jacobs lambskins are washable.
