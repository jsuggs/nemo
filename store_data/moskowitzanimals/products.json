This is a signed original 2008 painting by Stewart Moskowitz, creator of American Rabbit, Dinky Dinos, etc. This whimsical sailfish ship, painted on stretched canvas in the classic Moskowitz airbrush style, is similar to a popular image he first painted some years ago. Stu sometimes enjoys painting a variation on an old design or he makes one as a commissioned piece, and he's painted about five of this particular design, mostly as commissions I think. It's a pretty good guess that the last one is more finely executed than the first one in these situations, and that has been my observation. Stu's ability with color and line has never stopped improving. So this is likely the best Smooth Sailing, and also likely the last one since Stu only occasionally paints in the \"old\" style today and he is increasingly busy with other work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"width: 233px;\">This large canvas was removed from its frame by the artist who then re-stretched it on the same frame with a backing of luan board permanently under the canvas.

This loosely \"sketched\" re-rendering of a popular Moskowitz poster is a signed original 2010 painting by Stewart Moskowitz. The canvas is stretched over an old picture frame (I think it's oak) and is stapled on the sides, and since the frame has a rounded edge, the picture will look best in a frame or matte that overlaps the edge by most of an inch (2 or 3 cm). By \"rounded edge\" I mean the carved contour of the frame, which is not warped or off-square although the photo makes it look that way. Or you could leave it with no frame, but since the outer margin has some pencil markings (which barely show in the photo) I think it would look best framed.</p>\r\n<p>This whimsical small canvas is brush painted, no airbrush.
