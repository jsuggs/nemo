The foot placement is clear and easy to understand. The notations of the strings are located to the left, under the violin when in position. There are bow hand and violin hand reminders located slightly behind them so as to not be in line of sight.  \r\n\r\n<b>The Twinkle Mat</b><sup><small>TM</sup></small> is made from lightweight high-density PVC foam (the same material as most yoga mats.) It is only 2mm thick and weights less than ½ lb. It will not slip and slide while your child is standing on it and will not curl or tear.  It is also washable. \r\n\r\n<b>The Twinkle Mat</b><sup><small>TM</sup></small> comes in 3 sizes. Small, Medium and Large.  The size designation is for your child’s foot size and height. Height and correct foot placement is correlated to shoe size so please note and order accordingly.  \r\n\r\n<b>Small is for most 2.5 - 4 year olds.</b>    US Shoe sizes 6.5 – 8\r\n<b>Medium is for most 4 – 5 year olds.</b>   US Shoe sizes 8.5 -10\r\n<b>Large is for most 5- 6+ year olds.</b>   US Shoe sizes 10.5 – 13</b>\r\n\r\nIf your child is on the cusp – say a size 8 – order the medium.  They grow quickly. You can always order another mat next year as your child grows.  As long as your child falls within the size range,  the foot placement will be appropriate for them.\r\n\r\nMake practice time a treat with a cheery and bright Twinkle Mat! You will be glad you did!\r\n\r\nAll three sizes of the Twinkle Mat physically measure 18 x 30 x 1/16th inches. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://twinklemat.bigcartel.com/links-and-policies\"> For a quick note about the nomenclature used and why, please see our FAQ page or click here.</a> \r\n\r\n<i>This is product is exclusively available from TwinkleMat.com  Please feel free to contact us with any questions.</i>\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":941024,"name":"Small (3-4 yrs.)","price":17.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":941027,"name":"Medium (4-5yrs.)","price":17.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":943607,"name":"Large (5-7 yrs.)","price":17.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.49,"amount_with_others":3.75,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":9.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1508794/-/Twinkle_MAT.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1508794/-/Twinkle_MAT.jpg","width":1000,"height":597}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":192078,"name":"Twinkle Mat","permalink":"twinkle-mat","url":"/category/twinkle-mat"}]},{"id":216850,"name":"Foam-A-Lin Practice Violin","permalink":"foam-a-lin-practice-violin","position":2,"price":18.95,"default_price":18.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/foam-a-lin-practice-violin","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-01-14T06:54:36.000Z","description":"Our foam-a-lins are ideal for the pre-twinkler wanting the optimal aid with which to begin their violin adventures.
