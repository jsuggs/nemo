Since it’s origin in the early 1980’s these beliefs have spread all over the world, connected through the Punk and Hardcore music scenes.\r\n\r\nThrough interviews with musicians that directly shaped the idea of Straight Edge from its inception until today, EDGE – perspectives on drug free culture reveals that the abstinence from drugs was established as a youth counter culture rejecting a society dominated by substance abuse and hegemony.\tIan MacKaye (Minor Threat, Fugazi), Ray Cappo (Youth of Today, Shelter) and Karl Buechner (Earth Crisis, Freya) give witness to their perception of the history of Straight Edge, why it was so important to them and what it changed in their personal and professional careers. But they also address problems like violence, sexism and intolerance that emerged within Straight Edge, and how it changed the ‘scene’ as well as its public image.\r\nFurthermore, EDGE explores the lives of 9 individuals, that identify as Straight Edge. Their reasons range from negative experiences with drugs to maintaining a healthy lifestyle to political reasons. Through a very close and personal look into their daily lives, we see how their decision to live ‘poison free’ has changed the world for them.\r\n\r\nBut how do people discover Straight Edge? How do women experience Straight Edge subculture? What social backgrounds are shared by people new to the scene and what makes someone turn Straight Edge? How does mainstream culture perceive this movement?\r\n\r\nEDGE is looking for answers to these questions on a roadtrip behind and beyond the scenes of the Straight Edge subculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nGER 2009, Feature Documentary, 82 minutes, miniDV, Color, 16:9 Widescreen\r\nLanguage: English\r\nSubtitles: English, German, Belarusian, French, Hebrew, Indonesian, Italian, Korean, Latvian, Malaysian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Ukrainian\r\nScreenplay and Direction: Marc Pierschel / Michael Kirchner\r\nProduction Company: compassion|media\r\nLine Producer and Location Manager: Kelly Jameson\r\n\r\nDVD: approx. 80 Minutes of extra material (Deleted scenes: Kurt Schroeder, Kelly Jameson, Sean Muttaqi, Billy French / Extended interviews: Ian MacKaye, Ray Cappo, Ross Haenfler, Kent McClard / Making of / Audio commentary with directors / Premiere at the Helen Mills Theatre in New York City), Reversible DVD sleeve without the FSK logo, 12-page booklet, Format: PAL / NTSC, Region: 0 (All regions)","options":[{"id":17298639,"name":"Default","price":13.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/57544219/-/Edge_The_Movie.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/57544219/-/Edge_The_Movie.jpg","width":612,"height":612}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2844115,"name":"DVD","permalink":"dvd","url":"/category/dvd"}]}]
