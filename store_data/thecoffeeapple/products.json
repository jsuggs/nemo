Story stones provide a range of prompts for children to assist stimulating ideas, and put a story together, from the basic to the beautifully elaborate! \r\n\r\nEducators, parents, play therapists and counsellors find Story Stones a wonderful educational aide in their work with children, and enjoy the tactile nature of each stone.\r\n\r\nA variety of sets are available, covering a range of story elements, such as people, places, animals, food, symbols, objects etc, as well as some single stones you might like to add to a set if your little one has a particular interest you would like to include to help motivate them to get into story telling.\r\n\r\nIf you are unsure of how to use these beautiful stones, just give them to your children, they seem to instinctively start telling amazing stories (or like my 1 year old, who just sneaks them off my desk and into her pyjama pocket every night!)\r\n\r\nStory Stones are handstamped/hand-drawn, hand coloured and varnished.

This precision means that with the help of gravity, a little imagination, passion and skill you can build, boats and castles, animals and robots, cities and forests, or even a spiraling staircase to the moon.\r\n\r\nPLANKS can be used to create both simple and more complex structures; by their very nature they provide challenge and engagement for builders of all ages and abilities. For the young, and the young at heart, PLANKS are great for individual or group play allowing you to build your own architecturally designed masterpiece or work together to create the ideal city or fantasy land.\r\n\r\nPLANKS are a rare construction resource that authentically engages all ages. Safe enough for newborns to pound together and engaging enough for grownups to get involved in the experimentation and suspenseful play that these dynamic building blocks afford.\r\n\r\nPLANKS are both playful and educational, allowing children to experience and negotiate a wide range of important social skills; encouraging players to understand and explore the ideas and processes of mathematics and science in a creative way.\r\n\r\nWhy Build with PLANKS?\r\n\r\nThere are a range of reasons why people should spend time building with PLANKS, not the least of which is that it is incredibly fun and building something enormous or intricate can be very rewarding.\r\n\r\nBenefits of building include:\r\n-It develops group cooperation and improved communication skills.\r\n-Using PLANKS develops an understanding of structural design and develops innovation.\r\n-Many of the natural skills of our children, which provide self esteem are lost in the time restraints of schools or not valued by the curriculum. Here is an intuitive activity which provides countless opportunities for success.\r\n-Impressive projects need not be limited to those with well honed architects.

Chemical free so they are also gentle on sensitive skin. No need to buy fabric softener anymore as these little tumbleballs will soften everything naturally.\r\nThrow them in your dryer and forget about them. \r\n\r\nOur tumbleballs fly around the dryer separating fabrics, allowing air to pass between the layers therefore increasing the surface area that is drying. Wool has an amazing ability to absorb moisture and this is where our tumbleballs really work their magic. They draw the moist hot air into themselves and then over the course of the load \r\nreabsorb moisture back into the environment...so by the end of the load they are dry and so is everything else\r\n\r\nProudly made in Australia using an age-old wet felting process so \r\nyou can be assured your Tumblemonkey dryerballs will last.\r\nWe use local un-dyed wool and recommend using 3 to see a \r\nsignificant reduction in your drying time.\r\n\r\nNot suitable for anyone with a wool allergy or sensitivity\r\n\r\nWe invite you to visit us on facebook at\r\nwww.facebook.com/tumblemonkeyhandmade\r\n\r\nSupplier:  Tumblemonkey Handmade\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/wALbEzcccDc?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","options":[{"id":17701909,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.25,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123372711/-/Faces_Dryer_Balls.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123372711/-/Faces_Dryer_Balls.jpg","width":684,"height":684}],"artists":[{"id":76939,"name":"Tumblemonkey Handmade","permalink":"tumblemonkey-handmade","url":"/artist/tumblemonkey-handmade"}],"categories":[{"id":4313846,"name":"Baby","permalink":"baby","url":"/category/baby"},{"id":2358919,"name":"Women","permalink":"women","url":"/category/women"},{"id":3317021,"name":"Homewares / Decorations","permalink":"homewares-decorations","url":"/category/homewares-decorations"}]},{"id":13945812,"name":"Set of Four Hair Elastics - Mixed (2)","permalink":"set-of-four-hair-elastics-mixed-2","position":54,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/set-of-four-hair-elastics-mixed-2","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-03T11:04:01.000Z","description":"These are the most gorgeous collection of hair elastics, sure to delight every little and BIG GIRL :-D\r\n\r\nLarge hair elastics 28mm with snagless hair elastic, hand gathered and secured with nontoxic glue these will just last and last and last. \r\n\r\nSupplier: Appleberry Kids\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/8VrgMhCVNwA?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","options":[{"id":44828025,"name":"1.

These mobiles make such a bright, colourful feature for any room.\r\n\r\nAll parts of this mobile are made and put together by my supplier, down to the carefully hand folded paper kranes! So if you're looking for something unique to give as a gift, or to decorate your own home with, then look no further than one of these Flying Krane Mobiles! No two are the same! \r\n\r\nEach mobile has 25 paper kranes that hang gracefully from their lines. Super easy to hang, all you'll need is a screw-in or 3M hook for your ceiling. The mobile is nice and lightweight and the kranes will playfully dance in the slightest breeze. Such a great and fun focal point for your little bubba, or a nice feature in any room!\r\n\r\nMobiles all measure 25cm (9.8 inches) or under in diameter so will not look out of place even in a smaller space. (Each mobile is slightly different size as I also hand-make the wire circle that the kranes will hang from.) Each mobile hangs no longer than 1m (39 inches/1 yard) from the ceiling. \r\n\r\nSupplier : PaperKrane","options":[{"id":24235899,"name":"Yellow /

only are Baby Chilli Modern Cloth Nappies a fun and exciting way to spice up your baby’s behind, but they also reduce your footprint on the environment an SAVE YOU MONEY! They ar as simple to put on as a disposable but also have the added ‘cuteness’ factor. They are also more breathable so can assist with nappy rash and also feel more comfortable on bub. \r\n\r\nEvery year billions of disposable nappies make their way into landfill, taking hundreds of years to decompose. MCN’s are reusable and while the initial outlay for them can seem large, over the life of just one child in nappies the savings become very obvious, factor in subsequent children and the savings are HUGE. You can also say goodbye to rushing to the shops for a late night nappy pick up as you have run out. \r\n\r\nFor example: using disposables for a year for one child will cost you around $900 a year. Times that by the number of years one child is in nappies and they can cost well over $2000. \r\n\r\nTo use MCN’s full time you will need around 18-24 which is 6-8 per day with time for drying.\r\n\r\nSize Small\r\n\r\nBaby Chilli All Together Pockets come in three sizes for the following weight categories.\r\n\r\nSmall         3.5-6kgs\r\n\r\nMedium      6-11kgs\r\n\r\nLarge         9-18kgs\r\n\r\nIf unsure size up not down.  \r\n\r\nThese sizing ranges are a guide only.
