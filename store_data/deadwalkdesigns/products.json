Colour it as you like!!!\r\n\r\nDirections for use:\r\n\r\nBefore you start you might want to offer the horns up to your face and using a piece of chalk or eye liner mark any parts which overlap your face, or cover your hair line. Using scissors you can cut off these excess pieces.\r\n\r\n    1. Apply Spirit Gum adhesive (or better still, Pros-aide) to the edges of the horns, taking care around the eyes. Once dry slowly apply the horns to your face.\r\n    2. Use make-up latex or theatrical wax to blend any visible joins and stipple with a sponge.\r\n    3. Use grease face paint to colour the horns as you wish, blending your skin tone back into the base.\r\n    4. Remove the horns using spirit gum remover and wash face with soap and warm water.\r\n    5. To be able to use the horns again wipe with a cleansing wipe and store in a cool dry place back in its packaging.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This item is the unpainted latex horns ONLY.
