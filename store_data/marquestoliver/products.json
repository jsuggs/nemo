With Cultural Olympiad Endorsements and major campaigns following suit, we figured this was the perfect moment to introduce Shingai Shoniwa, lead singer, and soon to be solo artist.\r\n\r\nWe worked tirelessly with Shingai to bring you an issue truly reflective of her spectrum of inspirations and styles.  As co-curator Shingai also produced a mixtape called Tropical Metropolis AF9000 which is audible on soundcloud NOW\r\n\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/love-is-the-law-magazine/sets/litl-mixtape-4-tropical\r\n\r\nMarques Toliver joins Shingai for our cover and in some intimate New York Reportage shots from the streets outside Paloma Faith's apartment, where creativity is bubbling and music is the breath of life.\r\n\r\nDaniel Lumbini of the Rook & Raven Gallery joins us for the second Gallery curation inside the magazine, and we are proud to include a very groundbreaking interview with top British Artist, Matthew Stone.\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy\r\n\r\n'Dystopia'","options":[{"id":39924396,"name":"Marques Cover","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":39924399,"name":"Shingai

mini-festival or rare and intimate performances from the likes of Liam Bailey, Marques Toliver, Seye, Ayanna Witter-Johnson, Fiona Bevan, The Good Suns, L.A Salami, Summer Pearl, Joseph Reuben, William Carl Junior, YADi, The Venus Bushfires, plus special guests. \r\n\r\nSpread over 2 days and nights and between a beautiful church (evening concerts) and its neighbouring 'Enchanted Woodland' (daytime activities and workshops).\r\n\r\nIn a unique collaboration with the wonderful folks over at the Ventnor Fringe, we bring you this celebration of music and creativity and invite you, as readers of our unique publication, to book early to get great discounts on the tickets.\r\n\r\nThe festival are offering numerous deals on transport and accommodation, including caravans, tipis, camping and even a red bus ride from London!\r\n\r\nVentnor is beautiful in August, nothing like a field festival, the Fringe coincides with other local carnivals, and the community spirit is strong in this seaside (read cliff edge) town.\r\n\r\nWe've attending since year 1, and now, in year 3, we are proud to say we will be curating a space for the festival this year and hope to have a FANTASTIC weekend with as many of you all and our friends as possible.\r\n\r\nAs an incentive to you all, we also want to encourage early bird sales and will be offering the first 50 ticket holders a free copy of Issue#3, if you book before the end of January, 2013.\r\n\r\nStay tuned to keep up to date.\r\n\r\nShare widely and have a beautiful new year\r\n\r\nwith Love is the Law Magazine\r\n& the Ventnor
