A bouquet of pink and wine red Primroses mixed with a trellis design of yellow Oxlips on fir green background contributes to a not-so-sweet rather dark look.\r\n\r\nIn wintertime's festive season these fingerless gloves look stunning combined with metalic gold, black lace or a broquade apparel. Emphasize their lavish luxe look by always standing close to a chandelier.\r\nOnce springtime comes this ladies accessory reveals it's other twinkle-toed side: pair them with a checkered short-sleeved blouse, a Peter Pan collar or a light yellow girlish dress.\r\n\r\nI encourage you to play around with the item's length. You can either wear these arm warmers at full length.  Or slip them down beneath the elbow for a different look. This way they look great with ¾ sleeves. \r\n\r\nThe print on these fingerless gloves looks like painted, but it actually is a collage of digital images which I personally took of Primroses I planted on the balcony and Oxlips I saw in the woods. The floral contour edging is hand-cut.\r\n\r\nI digitally print my original textile designs on a soft, sophisticated knitted polyamide material which perfectly serves the modern requirements for easy wear and easy care. The cuff on the upper end is invisible and encloses the arm without tightening. \r\n\r\nI developed, designed, printed, sewed and eventually photographed this item with utmost care. As with any handmade item in limited editions my pieces may have slight inconsistencies. Their colors might appear differently in reality than on your monitor. \r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIAL\r\nMain: 100% Polyamide, Oeko Tex Standard 100 certified, fabric provides stretch\r\nHem: 100% Polyester\r\n\r\nMEASURES AND HOW TO MEASURE\r\nLength:                                   approx. 36 cm/ 15 inches\r\n\r\nWidth top (arm/ biceps):   approx. 22-36 cm/ 9-15 inches \r\n(measured around the biceps) \r\n                                                                                                               \r\nWidth bottom (hand):          max.  23 cm/ 9 inches\r\n(Don't measure the wrist.

The style goes very well with Asian or Boho influenced looks. \r\n\r\nThe print looks like painted, but it actually is a collage of digital images which I personally took in botanical and not-so-botanical gardens. \r\nThe black curved edge is hand-cut\r\n\r\nI digitally print my original textile designs on a soft, sophisticated knitted polyamide material which perfectly serves the modern requirements for easy wear and easy care. The curved hemline adds grace and vintage charm to these ladies accessories.  The cuff on the upper end is invisible and encloses the arm without tightening. \r\n\r\nYou can wear these arm warmers at full length with a short-sleeved tee, turtleneck or – very sexy  - a corset or a sleeveless garment. I encourage you to play around with the length. Slip them down beneath the elbow for a different look. This way they look great with ¾ sleeves. \r\n\r\nI developed, designed, printed, sewed and eventually photographed this item with utmost care.

Delicate feathery pin cushion flowers appear to be a Victorian lace glove buttoned up by green globular buttons. The edge is curved and scalloped featuring a neatly punched hole pattern.\r\n\r\nPair them with a white lace garment for an over-the-top romantic style.\r\nAre you the bride in pink? These are the gloves you want to wear on your wedding day.\r\nWear them with a black leather jacket (sleeves rolled up), black tank top, jeans and biker boots: leather & lace.\r\nCombine these sweet arm warmers with n edgy and puristic blouse: sugar & spice.\r\n\r\nI encourage you to play around with the item's length. You can either wear these arm warmers at full length.  Or slip them down beneath the elbow for a different look. This way they look great with ¾ sleeves. \r\n\r\nThe print on these fingerless gloves looks like painted, but it actually is a collage of digital images which I personally took in the garden. The edge is scalloped and punched by hand. \r\n\r\nI digitally print my original textile designs on a soft, sophisticated knitted polyamide material which perfectly serves the modern requirements for easy wear and easy care. The cuff on the upper end is invisible and encloses the arm without tightening. \r\n\r\nI developed, designed, printed, sewed and eventually photographed this item with utmost care.

Combine them with a sheer golden blouse with batwing sleeves to complete a dramatic look. Wear them either at full length or slip them down beneath the elbow for a different look. This way they look great with ¾ sleeves. \r\n\r\nThe print on these fingerless gloves looks like painted, but it actually is a collage of digital images which I personally took.

Long arm warmers with a large curved and scalloped edge plus a neat hole pattern.\r\n\r\nThese fingerless gloves want to be your alltime companion. They're with you in autumn giving your casual denim-and-turtleneck-outfit a girlish and colorful touch. \r\nThey cover your arms in wintertime when you're indoors at work. \r\nThey'll keep you from catching a cold in springtime when you got too excited over the first rays of sunlight and put on your summer dress. \r\nThey'll complete your lovely bridesmaid gown at your best friends wedding. \r\nThey'll even travel with you to faraway countries and warm your arms on chilly summer nights.\r\n\r\nI encourage you to play around with the item's length. You can either wear these arm warmers at full length.  Or slip them down beneath the elbow for a different look. This way they look great with ¾ sleeves. \r\n\r\nThe print on these fingerless gloves looks like painted, but it actually is a collage of digital images which I personally took in the garden. The edge is scalloped and punched by hand. \r\n\r\nI digitally print my original textile designs on a soft, sophisticated knitted polyamide material which perfectly serves the modern requirements for easy wear and easy care. The cuff on the upper end is invisible and encloses the arm without tightening. \r\n\r\nI developed, designed, printed, sewed and eventually photographed this item with utmost care. As with any handmade item in limited editions my pieces may have slight inconsistencies. Their colors might appear differently in reality than on your monitor. \r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIAL\r\nMain: 100% Polyamide, Oeko Tex Standard 100 certified, fabric provides stretch\r\nHem: 100% Polyester\r\n\r\nMEASURES AND HOW TO MEASURE\r\nLength:                                   approx. 36 cm/ 15 inches\r\n\r\nWidth top (arm/ biceps):   approx. 22-36 cm/ 9-15 inches \r\n(measured around the biceps) \r\n                                                                                                               \r\nWidth bottom (hand):          max.  23 cm/ 9 inches\r\n(Don't measure the wrist.
