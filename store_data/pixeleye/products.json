SHIPPING WITHIN EUROPE *\r\n\r\nWelcome to Hotrod Empire, Inc.!\r\nThis volume of photography at hand is a portrait of the european old-school Hot Rod & Kustom Kulture scene. Besides Hot Rods & Kustoms, rockabilly-, rockabella- and rock´n´roller lifestyle takes center stage, because the old-school Hot-Rod scene consists of more than driving an old jalopy. \r\n\r\nIt´s the rock´n´roll spirit, the kick-ass punkrock, the psychobilly, it´s about freedom and fuck-off attitude. A bow to ancient times, linked with fun and melancholia, beautiful classic pin-ups instead of modern fashion victims and fading mayflies. That is what it´s all about.\r\n\r\nAbout the people, the art and the rock´n´roll lifestyle apart from ordinary trends, which are dictated by the media. The spirit of the 50´s and 60´s, friendship, value and party. People, doing their thing, shouting out „fuck the world“! And many other things, that you can´t explain in a few lines. Therefore, less text, more photos explaining themselves. Thank you all, you know who you are!\r\n\r\n\"The combination of hot rods, kustoms, and pin up models is sure a fine winner - afteral you are holding an issue of Garage in your hands, aren´t you? Well imaging a 128 page coffee table book of nothing but page after page of photos of that subject matter and each and every one is suitable for framing. We could only imagine the volume of photos that Dirk Behlau had to omit to shrink his selection down to fit inside this book.

SHIPPING WITHIN EUROPE *\r\n\r\nDrag Racing is a down-to-earth form of motor sport that is both accessible and affordable. It fascinates an ever-growing community of fans around the world.\r\n\r\nThis has partly to do with the sport itself, but certainly also with drag racing´s very individual brand of aesthetics when it comes to cars and the people who drive, repair and admire them. Drag racing is a mix of uproariously loud, primordial displays of power and high-tech; it drivers love the sport but flirt openly with destruction and putting their lives in danger.\r\n\r\nSpreed Kings presents photographs by Dirk Behlau that skilfully capture the adrenalin-fuelled athmosphere of suspense on  and alongside the track, as well as the eroticism of the machines and the people who give their lives for a few seconds of the ultimate kick.\r\n\r\nStart your engines!\r\n\r\nSpeed Kings\r\nRacing Photography by Dirk Behlau\r\nPages: 128\r\nSize: 26x18 cm\r\nRelease: 16.
