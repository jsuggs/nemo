Here is our new Black Ice Jacket.\r\n\r\nThe outside of the jacket is made with Bonded Nylon DWR coated nylon with windproof/waterproof membrane and Micro-Fleece lining. The jackets are water repellent and still breathable, ideal for aerobic activity. Every jacket comes with zippered pockets, an attached, adjustable hood with adjustable elastic draw cord hem.\r\n\r\nWe wanted to be subtle with the Buffalo branding so we went with a black on black print. This printing is light reflective screenprint so that the logo will be seen on the road, tarmack or at your favourite watering hole. \r\n\r\nNOTE: THIS IS A JACKET AND NOT A SAFETY VEST. THE REFLECTIVE NATURE OF THE SCREENPRINT IS NOT MEANT AS SAFETY STRIPING, BUT RATHER AS A DECORATIVE ADDITION TO THE JACKET.\r\n\r\nSizing chart:\r\n\r\n           Chest                 Front zipper length           Underarm Seam \r\n\r\nXS:         19\"                             24\"                                20\"\r\nS:           21\"                             24\"                                20.5\"\r\nM: Sold Out\r\nL:           24\"                             24\"                                 22\"\r\nXL:         25\"                             27\"                                 23\"\r\n2XL:       28\"                             27\"                                 24\"\r\n\r\nWe are sure that you will love the new Black Ice Jacket \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":24578790,"name":"Xtra-Small (XS)","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23804287,"name":"Small (S)","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23804289,"name":"Medium (M)","price":95.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23804291,"name":"Large (L)","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23804293,"name":"Extra Large (XL)","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":23804295,"name":"Double Extra Large (2XL)","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":12.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":12.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":25.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125919657/-/BLK_ICE_JKT.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125919657/-/BLK_ICE_JKT.JPG","width":792,"height":1280},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73933769/-/IMG_6997.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73933769/-/IMG_6997.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125919663/-/BLK_ICE_JKT_(2).JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125919663/-/BLK_ICE_JKT_(2).JPG","width":1224,"height":1632},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125919672/-/BLK_ICE_JKT_(3).JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125919672/-/BLK_ICE_JKT_(3).JPG","width":800,"height":1280}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2644997,"name":"Jackets","permalink":"jackets","url":"/category/jackets"}]},{"id":7463481,"name":"Angel Wings Hoodie","permalink":"angel-wings-hoodie","position":40,"price":40.0,"default_price":40.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/angel-wings-hoodie","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2012-10-06T03:20:10.000Z","description":"!!!!BLOW OUT SALE!!!!
