Aragorn&#8217;s father was killed by Orcs when Aragorn was a child. He was raised by Elrond in Rivendell. Aragorn was tall, and had elven wisdom as well as foresight. He was humble and self-sacrificing, a healer, and a powerful military commander and warrior. He had impressive powers for a man partly because he was Isildur&#8217;s heir.\n\n\tWhen Sauron was defeated, Aragorn was crowned King of Arnor, the thirty-fifth King of Gondor, and the first High King of the Reunited Kingdom. Aragorn married the Elf Princess, Arwen, Elrond&#8217;s daughter, and ruled the Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor until the 120th year of the Fourth Age. He died at the age of 210. Arwen died of a broken heart.\n\n\t<span class=\"caps\">METAPHYSICAL</span> and <span class=\"caps\">ASTROLOGICAL EFFECTS</span>, and <span class=\"caps\">PERSONAL EXPERIENCES</span> with this item: A talisman or spiritual tool will choose and find its rightful owner.

Perhaps only a person like Queen Olympias could have given birth and raised a person like Alexander the Great.\n\n\tThe only surviving portrait of her is a coin of that time period.
