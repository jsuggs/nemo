Just £1 to cover postage!\r\n\r\nExtraordinary musical artwork to fanfare opening of new building for firstsite.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat happens when you bring together four totally different musical acts from Colchester? What happens when each band has to perform a track or song chosen passed to them by one of the other bands to cover? The outcome is the musical collaboration ‘Colchester Round’, commissioned to celebrate the opening of the new building for the firstsite visual arts organisation in Colchester, Essex. The project, organised for firstsite by international art stars Grennan & Sperandio, sees Colchester’s The Band of the Parachute Regiment, heavy metal outfit Sanctorum, mediaeval shawm band Colchester Waits and world music ensemble Quire perform a stunning combination of 14 songs in their own musical style, resulting in a new set of versions that take an unexpected direction.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n‘Colchester Round’ brings to light the extraordinarily rich and diverse music scene in Colchester, with a project that makes unlikely bedfellows of musicians with strikingly different approaches to their art.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSimon Grennan describes the result: “Inspired by the most famous musical mash-up: Run DMC and Aerosmith’s ‘Walk This Way’, with ‘Colchester Round’ we’ve produced a genre-jumping project on a grand scale. As soon as we are acclimatised to the musical world of one set of musicians, we are propelled into the world of another. We feel what is shared and what is relative or distinct – and a musical portrait of Colchester emerges.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSanctorum vocalist Aaron Sly said: “Colchester Round is the perfect challenge to put ourselves outside of our comfort zone and really push us to create something great from music that is completely alien to what we usually do. It's been really interesting to hear and experience how the other artists have interpreted what we do and it's cool to see it in a totally new light.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfessor Bill Tamblyn, founder and music director of Quire, enjoyed the chance to hear other bands reinterpret Quire’s music and also the challenge of reinterpreting theirs. “I enjoyed writing the arrangements but rather than just arrange I ended up actually composing new pieces based on the ideas of the music of the other bands. I think that way the composer enters more into the spirit.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nfirstsite’s Director Katherine Wood added: “This fascinating project proves that Colchester is not just a hub for creative talent in the visual arts, but a thriving centre for music, too. Bringing together musical groups of vastly different styles, it strengthens firstsite's aim to forge links between Colchester communities. The beautiful commemorative CD pack will leave a lasting legacy that celebrates this historic moment in our town’s rich history.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n‘Colchester Round’ will be debuted live on the evening of Sunday 25 September 2011 – the first day of firstsite’s opening. A limited number of free tickets for the performance will be released by firstsite on a first come, first served basis on Thursday 1 September. Contact 01206 577067 or email info@firstsite.uk.netAfter the performance, 10,000 Colchester Round CDs, accompanied by a special commemorative booklet, will be distributed to households in Colchester.\r\n\r\nWe ship all purchased items as standard delivery as soon as possible.
