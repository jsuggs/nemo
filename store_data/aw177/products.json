Going live on February 14, 2012 (Valentine's Day), the show will feature over 30 artists customizing 3\"-5\" plastic apples that were picked up at a local craft shop.\r\n\r\nMy custom concept came from the idea of \"sticking\" good into something bad, or \"throwing\" some good into bad - I don't really have a direct explanation for my piece, it's pretty much what you make of it. I wanted to try something new and different, something metaphoric: the apple is rotten and bad and the shuriken is gold and good.\r\n\r\nThe shuriken has the Chinese character of \"good\" on it (both sides) and the apple has the word \"bad\" on it (both sides, hard to see).\r\n\r\nThe apple was pretty light (made of plastic/Styrofoam), I decided to weigh it down by cutting it in half and filling it w/ a little Super Sculpey. The shuriken was made from Super Sculpey as well. Spray paint was used for color.","options":[{"id":19243199,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59065963/-/AW177_Bad_Applez_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59065963/-/AW177_Bad_Applez_1.jpg","width":864,"height":648}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1681375,"name":"Artwork","permalink":"artwork","url":"/category/artwork"}]},{"id":4870145,"name":"AW177 \"Circuit Death\" Sticker","permalink":"aw177-circuit-death-sticker","position":4,"price":1.0,"default_price":1.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/aw177-circuit-death-sticker","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-17T14:05:11.000Z","description":"\"Circuit Death\" high-quality, silkscreen stickers (price is for one sticker and this includes shipping, PayPal fees, etc).\r\n\r\nThe backing paper can also be saved and used as art!","options":[{"id":15871565,"name":"Default","price":1.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47786421/-/AW177_Circuit_Death_Stickers.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47786421/-/AW177_Circuit_Death_Stickers.jpg","width":864,"height":648}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1681375,"name":"Artwork","permalink":"artwork","url":"/category/artwork"}]},{"id":4006489,"name":"AW177 \"Circuit Death\" Limited Edition T-Shirt","permalink":"aw177-circuit-death-limited-edition-t-shirt","position":5,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/aw177-circuit-death-limited-edition-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-06-29T13:33:55.000Z","description":"Self-produced limited edition (50 pcs) t-shirt.
