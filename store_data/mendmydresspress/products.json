Shotgun Seamstress is for those that understand the necessity of making a refracted reality available to the kids, especially in an era where it seems possible to unearth everything, where there lies no mystery, a barrage of images and icons displayed on computer screens for five seconds until the next thing appears…This is something to hold onto and reread over and over. A six zine blast that manages to blow apart the apathy and restore faith in the idea of punk rock as a strategy for resistance! Creating a separate currency for those that are not interested in replicating boring ideals in underground existences, Shotgun Seamstress is like the best mix tape anyone has ever made, where radical politics are never sidelined for an easier ride, where good times are never in doubt and where subsumed experiences are revealed as real… The Gories and Void, Nasty Facts and X-Ray Spex, Brontez, Vaginal Davis, punk rock.

There are few dialogs in radical communities about grief, death and dying. The subject of death causes most people, even radicals who see themselves as great communicators, to freeze up, or nervously change the subject. \"The Worst\" is attempting to change that, by helping people start a dialog about loss, so that no one has to suffer silently. There are so many different stories in here, about mothers, fathers, partners, and pets, who've died and left a hole in the lives of others. All these different authors have really come up with something that although sad, helps the grieving feel a little less alone.\r\n\r\nScreen printed cover, B&W inside. Half legal size, 84 pages. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>THE WORST #2:</b>\r\nFeatures art and writing from 16 contributors (one of them Miss C. Bean, one half of Mend My Dress Press) about their experiences with death and grief. \r\n\r\nThemes range from loss of parents, partners, grandparents, and children to friends and community members, and the zine includes a resource list and silk-screened patch with an awesome Audre Lorde quote on it. \r\n\r\nEach cover is hand printed.

Written as a lteer/ stories/ advice to offspring, Cheer the Eff up makes me regret devouring an issue so fast because there's no more to read after the last page. \r\n\r\nReading Cheer The Eff Up is like getting to know a warm and inviting friend, and makes you just want to send Jonas a letter and become penpals. (Which, PS, is totally plausible).\r\n\r\nCHEER THE EFF UP #1\r\nWhat part of Cheer The Eff Up is fiction? What isn't? In the end, it doesn't even seem to matter. Issue #1 starts with a letter to an unborn daughter and takes us traveling through Jonas' life. Going to college, making friends, losing friends; supporting friends. Most of the zine is about what happened to all of Jonas' friends after college, and stories about family, peppered with little wisdoms for aforementioned unborn daughter, including \"cheer the eff up.\" There is a  also bittersweet story that ends with a passive aggressive message on a cake. And that's amaze-balls. \r\n\r\nHalf-size legal, B&W. And, as Jonas says: \"a bunch of pages.\"\r\n\r\nCHEER THE EFF UP #2\r\nAgain, Jonas blends truth and fiction, heartbreak and hope into his well written zine. And this time it's a split with his friend Nikki. This issue covers topics like sexual assault, the reasoning behind the \"boring-ass\" cover design of Cheer The Eff Up (which turns into a surprisingly interesting discussion on generic food and product labeling), people getting old (and I don't mean turning 30. 30 is not old.), communal living, and sending mail to yourself. There is a raw piece on reasons to live, right next to an article about \"planking\" with ridiculous photos, and then some shit about donuts that I skimmed (for some reason, no one at this press wants to read anything about donuts, but that's another story for another day). At the end of the zine, I was thoroughly cheered the eff up. Well played, Jonas! \r\n\r\nHalf-size legal, B&W. And, as Jonas says: \"a bunch of pages.\"\r\n\r\nCHEER THE EFF UP #3\r\nJonas writes about protests and protesting (like the Occupy Movement and NATO protests), and becoming part of a group of friends. He writes about growing older and going to shows. There are scary, sad parts. There and endearing parts. There are funny parts too, but most of the funny parts turn out to be truly frightening, like discussing how Kennedy, the VJ from MTV, turned out to be a creepy conservative. This is my favorite issue so far, but I think my cat disagreed, because she puked on it right after I finished reading it. Trust me, I'm right, and the cat is just wrong. It's a damn good zine. \r\n\r\nHalf-size legal, B&W. And, as Jonas says: \"a bunch of pages.\"\r\n\r\nCHEER THE EFF UP #4\r\nJonas writes about depression, anxiety, suicide, fading friendships and new friendships, office jobs and growing older. It's a heavy issue, yet Jonas has infused with humor (for example, when he writes about what he would really like to say at a job interview given the chance...)\r\n\r\n(Note: Miss C.
