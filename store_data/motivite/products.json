Vitamin B-12 is one of the most important daily nutrients, yet most people don't get enough. Some try to get B-12 in a form that's hard for the human body to use, like the inexpensive and common Cyanocobalamin (found in those Couple-Hour Energy shots along with other unnecessary ingredients and sugars), which has to pass through the liver before being converted to Methylcobalamin and then rerouted through the body for absorption. Motivite's B-12 Spray is in Methylcobalamin form and readily available for immediate cellular absorption. A spray a day will keep you moving thanks to our easy-to-absorb, no-filler, no-sugar-added B-12 Spray. And that's why we say, \"You.

Better.\"\r\n\r\nLet's cut to the chase: The number of whey proteins available on the market is in the triple digits, but Motivite's Whey Protein is simply the best. Our low-fat and low-carbohydrate formula helps you build muscle without unnecessary physical gains, and there are none of those dreaded artificial or synthetic ingredients. This product is a superior source of whey protein and milk protein isolates (casein), giving you multi-functional time-released proteins that provide an optimal ratio of essential and non-essential amino acids that reduce recovery time. Motivite Whey Protein is better than whey protein alone, because whey rapidly increases protein synthesis and casein blocks protein breakdown, giving you sustained amino acid availability. After consuming whey protein alone, levels of blood amino acids peak for approximately one hour, then drop dramatically. After consuming casein, blood amino acids peak from one to two hours and remain elevated for up to seven hours without loss. You'll benefit from both effects with Motivite Whey Protein, plus this formula's source of Biological Milk Compounds called Microlactin have been clinically proven to promote healthy joint function and accelerate recover time (it may also decrease joint pain and stiffness wand improve mobility and range of motion.) \r\n\r\nMotivite Whey Protein is super-duper soluble, which means it easily mixes without the need of a blender. We use only natural flavors and all-natural SweetLeaf™ Stevia to make both your taste buds and your body happy with a great-tasting, naturally delicious formula. Motivite Whey Protein also offers three grams of fiber per serving to support a healthy digestive system and help keep cholesterol levels in check.\r\n\r\nMotivite Whey Protein is a great source of protein for low-carbohydrate dieters, athletes, children or anyone who needs to add additional protein to their diet. Since it can be mixed with a spoon or shaker cup, the benefits of Motivite Whey Protein can be enjoyed almost anywhere. Motivite Whey Protein can also be added to foods such as fruit smoothies, pancakes, muffins, oatmeal, cereal, yogurt or pudding. Motivite Whey Protein is better than the rest and ready to help you be your best, and that's why we say, \"You. Better.\"\r\n\r\nNote: These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
