Two infectiously catchy and equally deranged slices of noisy experimental garage punk that could only come from the one and only RED MASS. Electronic and live drums, fuzzed out guitars, sound effects with hook drenched choruses to tie it all together into a manic odditorium of psychedelic weirdness. Touring extensively with a constantly rotating lineup of likeminded artists, musicians and fellow weirdos, RED MASS will shortly be taking over your shitty town, and soon the world.","options":[{"id":8536501,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/22980051/-/red_mass-copy-small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/22980051/-/red_mass-copy-small.jpg","width":354,"height":354}],"artists":[{"id":41301,"name":"Red Mass","permalink":"red-mass","url":"/artist/red-mass"}],"categories":[{"id":278734,"name":"Wallride Releases","permalink":"wallride-releases","url":"/category/wallride-releases"}]},{"id":2384071,"name":"Head Home - Outside My Window 12\"","permalink":"head-home-outside-my-window-12","position":3,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/head-home-outside-my-window-12","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-04-16T21:46:06.000Z","description":"Head Home’s debut EP is 6 songs of fast catchy indie rock sounding like if SUPERCHUNK had recorded “HERE’S WHERE THE STRINGS COME IN” with J Mascis and Kevin Shields.
