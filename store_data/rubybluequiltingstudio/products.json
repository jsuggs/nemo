When I returned home I looked at the batik wall at my LQS and saw all the colors from the places I had been and decided to make this quilt! However if you look through the photos I also made a flannel version which toned down the pattern quite a bit. I just love how they are both the same pattern and quilting design, yet look completely different!\r\n\r\nThis quilt is super simple to make using just Fat Quarters for the center. The blocks finish at a large size which also makes construction of this quilt super fast. There are three different sizes included in the pattern. This quilt works well with any colors or style making it great for guys or teens, plus it's scrappy looking!
