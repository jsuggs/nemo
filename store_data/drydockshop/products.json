Copyright 1925. Property of Miss Carol Cummings of Whitefish, Montana. Compromised of 50 lesson handouts hand bound in a hard cover. \r\n\r\nInterspersed throughout the book are personal letters to the student from her instructors laying out helpful hints, course notes, and a general overview of the next chapter. There's also a sealed envelope containing examination questions with instructions \"DO NOT OPEN UNTIL LESSON IS MASTERED AND PUT AWAY\". \r\n\r\nI'm always attracted to items like this - with a personal history you can track. Whatever happened to Miss Cummings? Did she graduate? Did she enjoy her career as a nurse? Did she find love? Travel? Did she live a good life? I'll probably never know. But this chance encounter makes me smile. \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":10915003,"name":"Nursing Manual","price":18.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/56087965/-/ChicagoSchool2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/56087965/-/ChicagoSchool2.jpg","width":774,"height":774}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1581023,"name":"ART","permalink":"art","url":"/category/art"},{"id":1581024,"name":"ITEMS","permalink":"items","url":"/category/items"},{"id":3011813,"name":"BOOKS","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":5713919,"name":"A BOOK OF AMERICANS","permalink":"a-book-of-americans","position":2,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/a-book-of-americans","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-03-17T05:30:06.000Z","description":"Aptly titled poetry book by Rosemary and Stephen Vincent. Really cool illustrations by Charles Child.  Each poem highlights a different character from American history. Pocahontas, John Adams, Lewis and Clark, Crazy Horse, even the USA itself. \r\n\r\nThe book opens with the apology:\r\n\r\n\"We couldn't put in all the great\r\nOr even all the small, \r\nAnd many names with sterling claims\r\nWe haven't used at all.\r\n\r\nBut here's a rather varied lot, \r\nAs anyone can see,\r\nAnd all and each by deed and speech \r\nAdorned our History.\r\n\r\nSome got the medals and the plums, \r\nSome got their fingers burnt, \r\nBut every one's a native son, \r\nExcept for those who weren't. \r\n\r\nSo praise and blame judiciously\r\nTheir foibles and their worth.\r\nThe skies they knew were our skies, too, \r\nThe earth they found, our earth.\"\r\n\r\nOriginal copyright 1933.
