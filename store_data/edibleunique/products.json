Naga Jolokia) was officially measured at over one million Scoville Heat Units (SHU) in 2006 and replaces the Red Savina Habanero (557,000 SHU, measured in 1994) as the current record holder.\r\n\r\nThese chillies are very, very, very hot.\r\nWe recommend taking precautions when handling them: wear gloves at all times when handling and wear a dust/vapour mask if you are grinding (particularly if you use a pestle and mortar) or rehydrating and reducing to a paste. See our Chilli Handling kit. In case of contact with eyes, rinse immediately with water and seek medical advice.\r\n\r\nHeat: 10/10 \r\n\r\nBeing three times hotter than an Orange Habanero, our suggestion for cooking with these chillies is to use a small amount, very finely ground (dry or rehydrated and reduced to a paste). As a rough guide, try ¼ of a pod per person for a hot dish. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- AddThis Button BEGIN -->\r\n<a class=\"addthis_button\" href=\"http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&amp;username=xa-4bf65c7a3f4516c4\"><img src=\"http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/v2/lg-share-en.gif\" width=\"125\" height=\"16\" alt=\"Bookmark and Share\" style=\"border:0\"/></a><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=xa-4bf65c7a3f4516c4\"></script>\r\n<!-- AddThis Button END -->\r\n","options":[{"id":6056941,"name":"Default","price":4.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.99,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":9.99,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/15821441/-/bhut_web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/15821441/-/bhut_web.jpg","width":244,"height":343}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1028771,"name":"UNIQUE EDIBLES","permalink":"unique-edibles","url":"/category/unique-edibles"},{"id":1740549,"name":"UNIQUE EDIBLES - Dinner Dares & Treats","permalink":"unique-edibles-dinner-dares-treats","url":"/category/unique-edibles-dinner-dares-treats"},{"id":1028721,"name":"CHILLI","permalink":"chilli","url":"/category/chilli"},{"id":2789435,"name":"GIFTS","permalink":"gifts","url":"/category/gifts"},{"id":1683609,"name":"GIFTS - Under £5!","permalink":"gifts-under-5","url":"/category/gifts-under-5"}]},{"id":2771415,"name":"Chilli HOT!

The food is placed in a vacuum chamber and frozen until the water crystalizes. The air pressure is lowered, creating a vacuum, forcing air out of the chamber; next heat is applied, vapourising the ice; finally a freezing coil traps the vaporized water. This process continues for hours, resulting in a perfect freeze-dried Astronaut Food. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCookies and Cream \r\n\r\nChocolate Chip Ice Cream\r\n\r\nMint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream\r\n\r\nAstronaut Cinnamon Apple Wedges\r\n\r\nAstronaut Bananas\r\n\r\nAstronaut Peaches\r\n\r\nAstronaut Strawberries\r\n\r\nAstronaut Ice Cream \r\n\r\nAstronaut Ice Cream Sandwich\r\n\r\nHow does it Look and Taste?\r\nFreeze-drying is like suspended animation because it keeps the ice cream sandwich totally intact, but without the water.

The food is placed in a vacuum chamber and frozen until the water crystalizes. The air pressure is lowered, creating a vacuum, forcing air out of the chamber; next heat is applied, vapourising the ice; finally a freezing coil traps the vaporized water. This process continues for hours, resulting in a perfect freeze-dried Astronaut Food. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>How does it Look and Taste? </b>\r\nFreeze-drying is like suspended animation because it keeps the ice cream sandwich totally intact, but without the water. As you eat the sandwich, your mouth rehydrates the ice cream, restoring it to its original state. Amazingly the ice cream sandwich looks and tastes just like the original.\r\n\r\nFreeze-dried ice cream sandwiches can be stored for many years without refrigeration as long as you keep them in an airtight, sealed container.\r\n\r\n\r\nMade in the USA\r\n\r\n<!-- AddThis Button BEGIN -->\r\n<a class=\"addthis_button\" href=\"http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&amp;username=xa-4bf65c7a3f4516c4\"><img src=\"http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/v2/lg-share-en.gif\" width=\"125\" height=\"16\" alt=\"Bookmark and Share\" style=\"border:0\"/></a><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=xa-4bf65c7a3f4516c4\"></script>\r\n<!-- AddThis Button END -->\r\n","options":[{"id":6085651,"name":"Default","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.99,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":9.99,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/15890321/-/offer.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/15890321/-/offer.jpg","width":924,"height":244},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108052029/-/cookies_cream_hr_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108052029/-/cookies_cream_hr_1.jpg","width":505,"height":505},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108052065/-/ice_cream.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108052065/-/ice_cream.png","width":720,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108052077/-/cookies_cream_open.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108052077/-/cookies_cream_open.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108052149/-/bananas_hr_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108052149/-/bananas_hr_1.jpg","width":1000,"height":727}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1028741,"name":"UNIQUE EDIBLES - Astronaut Space Food","permalink":"unique-edibles-astronaut-space-food","url":"/category/unique-edibles-astronaut-space-food"},{"id":2789435,"name":"GIFTS","permalink":"gifts","url":"/category/gifts"}]},{"id":1668591,"name":"Bug KeyRing SCORPION","permalink":"bug-keyring-scorpion","position":95,"price":4.99,"default_price":4.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bug-keyring-scorpion","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-02-20T13:35:25.000Z","description":"100% Natural!\r\n\r\nAll insects are farmed in Thailand, and are raised in a manner, which helps support local economies and ensures the preservation of the natural habitat for these beautiful insects.\r\n\r\nCrystal clear insect amber made with pure resin \r\nGreat special gift for yourself, your kid or your special one \r\nVery unique, hard to find elsewhere! \r\n\r\nAcrylic insect key chains are trendy gift items.
