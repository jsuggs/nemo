Bona China 'Diamond' Rings.\r\nThe range comprises seven ring designs made from bone china with a clear glazed finish. \r\nEach ring has been designed around a detailed study of diamond and it’s rigid lattice structure. \r\nThe ring designs range from the archetypal cut diamond shape to the more abstract formations of diamond’s internal structure. \r\nDiamond’s unparalleled hardness and durability makes it the most popular and valuable gem stone in the world. \r\nCombining this with a simple material such as bone china, creates a completely new yet beautiful product that is precious in its own right. \r\nMaterial: Glazed Bone China Ceramic \r\nHand made in London, England by me!\r\n\r\nCheck your ring size

is a simple, slip-cast ceramic stool. Somewhere between a three-legged stool and a china ornament, Ceramiko blurs the boundaries between furniture and decoration.\r\n \r\nThe stool is produced in Stoke-on-Trent, which has been the centre of British ceramic production since the 17th century. The tradition of ceramic production and consequently, ceramic collecting, is deeply ingrained in the British psyche. Ornaments are proudly displayed, polished, cherished and passed down through generations.\r\n\r\nIn a world where furniture is becoming an increasingly disposable commodity, Ceramiko takes its influence from the great British ornament and the sentimental value it holds. It aims to bring a little love back to the items we take for granted on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nMaterial: Glazed earthenware ceramic\r\nDimensions: Approx. W 295x D 295x H 395mm\r\nMade in: Stoke-on-Trent, England ","options":[{"id":18453093,"name":"Default","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72068149/-/guy_on_ceramiko.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72068149/-/guy_on_ceramiko.jpg","width":700,"height":700},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72068161/-/2standing_grey.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72068161/-/2standing_grey.jpg","width":700,"height":700},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72068221/-/ceramiko_bottom_angle.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72068221/-/ceramiko_bottom_angle.jpg","width":700,"height":700}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3027969,"name":"Furniture","permalink":"furniture","url":"/category/furniture"}]},{"id":10913259,"name":"Delivery upgrade","permalink":"international-fast-delivery","position":12,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/international-fast-delivery","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-02T18:29:23.000Z","description":"The Royal mail signed for delivery to EU and rest of the world could take up to 10 days. \r\n\r\nUp grade to the UPS service.
