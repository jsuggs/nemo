Kinfolk magazine grew out of a love of a collaborative way of advocating the natural approach to entertaining. It's published in USA and comes out quarterly. It's a very beautiful publication.\r\n\r\nThis winter edition of Kinfolk—The Aged Issue—is dedicated to all things that get better with time: loved ones, food, family traditions and a good bottle of wine.\r\n\r\nThe Kinfolk team explores how the older folks in our lives can teach us how to live more fully and how to embrace each new candle on our cake with style and grace. As some anonymous old chap once said, “Age is an issue of mind over matter. If you don’t mind, it doesn’t matter.” While many magazines pressure readers to hang on to youth, Kinfolk investigates how our lives are enriched by the people, meals and traditions of things past. One writer considers the inevitable day you realize you’re turning into your mother, while another reflects on the way life—like fruit—is about picking that perfectly ripe moment. Chefs share family recipes they’ve perfected over time, classic recipes updated for the modern era and a holiday menu that’s easy to chew. There are gray hairs and salt-and-pepper beards, napping tips and ancient culinary tools. The connection? Everything in this issue gets better, or tastier, with age.\r\n\r\n140 pages\r\n21.5 x 27.5 cm\r\nfull colour","options":[{"id":50384925,"name":"Default","price":12.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.7,"amount_with_others":2.2,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":7.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129221487/-/kinfolk1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129221487/-/kinfolk1.jpg","width":900,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129221493/-/kinfolk2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129221493/-/kinfolk2.jpg","width":921,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129221502/-/kinfolk3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129221502/-/kinfolk3.jpg","width":900,"height":811},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129221511/-/kinfolk4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129221511/-/kinfolk4.jpg","width":900,"height":677},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129221514/-/kinkfolk5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129221514/-/kinkfolk5.jpg","width":900,"height":797}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":156164,"name":"MAGAZINES","permalink":"magazines","url":"/category/magazines"}]},{"id":15272808,"name":"Gather - issue 4","permalink":"gather-issue-4","position":14,"price":12.99,"default_price":12.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/gather-issue-4","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-02T17:03:26.000Z","description":"Gather Journal is a biannual recipe-driven food magazine based in Brooklyn, NY.

It began as an experiment first launched at the Royal College of Art graduate show in 2009. It remains, a labour of love; a bit of fun; a challenge inspired by a contemporary art scene that tends to put too much weight on a name. Some might say Monika’s premise is annoying, some find it refreshing.\r\n\r\nCurated around the theme ‘Wildlife’, Monika 3 explores how creative people have been inspired by the wild to do, or depict, the strangest things. It comprises an assortment of short fiction, essays, interviews, artists’ projects and uniquely commissioned illustration, presented as a full colour magazine that makes the most of what print has to offer.\r\n\r\nMonika 3 highlights include behind-the-scenes photographs of Vienna’s Museum of Natural History and discussions with performance artists working atop mountains and across deserts. We hear how a gorilla inspired a cinematographer and a crew of beatnik journalists; we learn about the extraordinary life of botanist Maria Sybilla Merian and we wonder what the other human species may have thought of us.\r\n\r\n138 pages\r\n16.5 x 24 cm\r\nfull colour\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":49731486,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.7,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128731782/-/monika1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128731782/-/monika1.jpg","width":900,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128731791/-/monika2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128731791/-/monika2.jpg","width":900,"height":776},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128731797/-/Monika3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128731797/-/Monika3.jpg","width":900,"height":855},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128731806/-/Monika4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128731806/-/Monika4.jpg","width":900,"height":896},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128731812/-/Monika5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128731812/-/Monika5.jpg","width":900,"height":723}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":156164,"name":"MAGAZINES","permalink":"magazines","url":"/category/magazines"}]},{"id":14340066,"name":"In The City by Nigel Peake","permalink":"in-the-city-by-nigel-peake","position":21,"price":13.99,"default_price":13.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/in-the-city-by-nigel-peake","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-22T16:27:31.000Z","description":"Re-stocking, available again soon\r\n\r\n'In The City' is the companion book to Nigel's much-loved 'In The Wilds' out around 2 years ago. \r\n\r\nHis beautiful follow up swaps the Irish countryside, where he grew up, for the bustling sidewalks of the city.

And there’s lots more, from beautifully-framed editorials to articles which explore everything from the unexpected dark side of children’s author Beverley Nichols, to the renaissance of the (not so) humble cup of tea.\r\n\r\n116 pges\r\n21 x 25.5 cm\r\nfull colour","options":[{"id":49819311,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":6.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128796756/-/article1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128796756/-/article1.jpg","width":900,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128796759/-/article2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128796759/-/article2.jpg","width":2092,"height":1380},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128796762/-/article3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128796762/-/article3.jpg","width":900,"height":562},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128796765/-/article4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128796765/-/article4.jpg","width":900,"height":681},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128796771/-/article5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128796771/-/article5.jpg","width":900,"height":810}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":156164,"name":"MAGAZINES","permalink":"magazines","url":"/category/magazines"}]},{"id":14983017,"name":"Makeshift issue 7","permalink":"makeshift-issue-7","position":25,"price":6.5,"default_price":6.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/makeshift-issue-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-20T20:31:19.000Z","description":"Makeshift is a magazine about creativity in informal economies, from the favelas of Rio to the Internet underworld.

Makeshift is about people, the things they make, and the places where they make them. Published in USA.\r\n\r\nThis issue looks at crowds - we’re drawn to crowds, but we also need creative ways to deal with them. Let’s face it: when we come together, we’re bothersome, causing long waits in line and looting in the streets. But we’re also powerful, mobilizing survivors of domestic abuse and taking down governments.\r\n\r\nJonathan Arp reports on Crowdring, which used missed calls to influence policy in Kenya. Maria Gallucci follows herds of amateur scientists tracking migratory herds. Daniele Volpe documents Guatemala's Neighborhood Guardians on patrol.

In the space of two weeks she spent a total of twelve days onboard, mingling with her fellow travellers and watching the Russian landscape unfold itself from her carriage window.\r\n\r\nBorn in Volgograd of Russian-Belorussian descent, Yanina was motivated to unearth what 'Russianess' meant and whether it existed as a single entity from one end of the motherland to the other. What she encountered and discovered about Russia, and thus about herself, is documented in her book of writings and photography 'Crossing Over'.\r\n\r\nAbout the Artist:\r\n\r\nYanina Shevchenko is a Russian-born photographer. She has worked in New York, Moscow and Buenos Aires and recently graduated from Goldsmiths University of London, MA in Photography and Urban Cultures. Her interests in photography are human identity, personal stories, urban and rural landscape.\r\n\r\nPublished by The Velvet Cell, 2013\r\n\r\n24 pages1\r\n6.5 x 24 cm\r\nSaddle-Stitch\r\nColour Offset\r\nLimited Edition of 300\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-908889-16-4\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":46978167,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126720744/-/crossing1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126720744/-/crossing1.jpg","width":900,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126720750/-/crossing2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126720750/-/crossing2.jpg","width":900,"height":849},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126720756/-/crossing3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126720756/-/crossing3.jpg","width":900,"height":682},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126720759/-/crossing4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126720759/-/crossing4.jpg","width":500,"height":439},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126720765/-/crossing5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126720765/-/crossing5.jpg","width":900,"height":675}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":114991,"name":"BOOKS","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":14407254,"name":"The Travel Almanac - issue 6","permalink":"the-travel-almanac-issue-6","position":34,"price":9.0,"default_price":9.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-travel-almanac-issue-6","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-25T15:31:04.000Z","description":"'The Travel Almanac explores the topics of traveling and temporary habitation from the personal perspectives of innovative figures in the fashion, music, art, and film worlds'.\r\n\r\nThis issue features contributions by and conversations with:\r\n\r\n- Matthew Barney\r\n- Linder Sterling\r\n- Juergen Teller\r\n- Ian Schrager\r\n- Shintaro Sakamoto\r\n- Angelika Taschen\r\n- Riley Keough\r\n \r\n+ Hurtigruten Cruises, Backpacks in the Fjords, Jogging with Beda Achermann\r\n \r\n146 pages\r\n16.5 x 21.5 cm\r\nfull colour\r\n","options":[{"id":46618857,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126458127/-/trav1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126458127/-/trav1.jpg","width":900,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126458130/-/trav2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126458130/-/trav2.jpg","width":900,"height":747},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126458133/-/trav3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126458133/-/trav3.jpg","width":900,"height":695},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126458142/-/trav4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126458142/-/trav4.jpg","width":900,"height":836}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":156164,"name":"MAGAZINES","permalink":"magazines","url":"/category/magazines"}]},{"id":14508738,"name":"Of The Afternoon - issue 3","permalink":"of-the-afternoon-issue-3","position":35,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/of-the-afternoon-issue-3","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-30T14:15:37.000Z","description":"Since 2011, Of The Afternoon has published contemporary international photography both online and in print to an international audience.

Working with the support from the university’s school of art history and the library special collections, the magazine is produced annually with an accompanying exhibition. Each issue explores a particular theme and features articles as well as photographs.\r\n\r\nThis issue is dedicated to that which falls into the cracks between the milestone events. The everyday is what holds the bigger picture together. Out of an abundance of submissions comes a selection of student portfolios and articles that speaks to the fluidity of the everyday as a theme. These include images by Renata Grasso, Lukas Nagel, Miranda Stuart and Leopold Thun, each of whom renders the mundane distinctly fascinating. Both Sophie Lealan and Angus West yield textual counterparts to their equally striking photographs, while Charlotte Adlard and Jennifer Russell examine the everyday within a more academic context in their respective articles.\r\n\r\nFrom the University’s Special Collections is included a selection of photographs by two architects, Peter Willis and William Murray Jack, whose images offer a unique insight into our everyday, physical environment. Carolyn Scott’s social documentary of Newcastle serves as a visually stunning reminder of the power of the image.\r\n\r\n114 pages\r\n15 x 21 cm\r\nfull colour","options":[{"id":46969278,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":4.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126716613/-/stereo1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126716613/-/stereo1.jpg","width":900,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126716625/-/stereo2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126716625/-/stereo2.jpg","width":900,"height":853},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126716631/-/stereo3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126716631/-/stereo3.jpg","width":900,"height":816},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126716637/-/stereo4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126716637/-/stereo4.jpg","width":900,"height":757},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126716643/-/stereo5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126716643/-/stereo5.jpg","width":900,"height":868}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":156164,"name":"MAGAZINES","permalink":"magazines","url":"/category/magazines"}]},{"id":14507310,"name":"Flow Magazine Interntional - issue 3","permalink":"flow-magazine-interntional-issue-3","position":37,"price":9.95,"default_price":9.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/flow-magazine-interntional-issue-3","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-30T12:49:35.000Z","description":"Flow Magazine International is a magazine from The Netherlands, for paper lovers.

It’s the overdue response to the unending clichés that surround gay lifestyle publications and the representation of gay men in media. It’s relevant material for a group of discerning individuals with an evolved range of interests. A chronicle of everyday life, and the narratives which define it.\r\n\r\nIn issue 2, the cover story is a conversation with Grizzly Bear's Ed Droste about travel, instagram, and breaking away from distractions to find creative clarity and inspiration. We also hear stories of ex-loves or ex-could-have-beens and how their absence helps us reflect on where that leaves us now, and we are reassured that the mistakes we make/made in our 20s are/were just character-building exercises on the road to adulthood.

Frank Laws tells us why social housing in London is such a major inspiration behind his work; and Jina Park explains how she zooms in on the mysterious processes of daily life through her paintings.

It is, as it's forerunner, the product of Rindal's experiments with film, texture, exposure and light. The obvious playfulness in the technique Rindal has chosen for his particular subjects points to a school of photography, where the end result is about exploring a glance, and pushing the boundaries of its terms. Rindal explores the fugitive, the mysterious and invisible in his imagery.\r\n\r\nBlindness brings the viewer further in to Rindal's world of imagery and is includes recent images from his home town in Norway. Ola Rindal was born in Norway and now lives and works in Paris.\r\nArt Direction by Madoka Rindal\r\n\r\nPublished by Cornerkiosk Press, 2013\r\n\r\n32 Pages\r\n20 x 29 cm\r\n4 Colour Offset\r\nSaddle Stitched\r\nSoftcover\r\nEdition of 400\r\n\r\nISBN: 9788299864022","options":[{"id":42656223,"name":"Default","price":17.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.7,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123726981/-/ola1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123726981/-/ola1.jpg","width":900,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123726984/-/ola2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123726984/-/ola2.jpg","width":900,"height":660},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123726987/-/ola3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123726987/-/ola3.jpg","width":900,"height":985},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123726993/-/ola4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123726993/-/ola4.jpg","width":900,"height":672},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123726996/-/ola5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123726996/-/ola5.jpg","width":900,"height":672}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":114991,"name":"BOOKS","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":13378410,"name":"Animated Review issue 1","permalink":"animated-review-issue-1","position":70,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/animated-review-issue-1","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-05T14:53:55.000Z","description":"Animated Review asked a selection of artists to reinterpret, in the own style, their favourite childhood cartoon character.

They’ll be actual size 3D sketching, somehow, you know, instead of drawing on a piece of paper.\r\nå: Sounds great. Do it in 100 days then.\r\n\r\n'I didn’t make one hundred chairs just for myself or even in an effort to rescue a few hundred unwanted chairs from the streets. The motivation was the methodology: the process of making, of producing and absolutely not striving for the perfect one. This kind of making was very much about restrictions rather than freedom. The restrictions were key: the material, the style or the design of the found chairs and the time available — just a 100 days. Each new chair had to be unique, that’s what kept me working toward the elusive one-hundredth chair.

TOO MUCH is for them.\r\n\r\nIn this issue: Vito Acconci, Jeff Burch, Maiko Haruki, Keith Ng, David d'Heilly, Hiroshi Sugimoto, Ernesto Neto, Anders Edstrom, Naoki Ishikawa, Hanayo, Victoria Henshaw, Kate McLean, Martin Holtkamp, Monnik, Taro Hirano, Constant Nieuwenhuys, Yoshikazu Nango, Takashi Homma, Koki Tanaka\r\n\r\nPublished by Editions OK Fred, 2013\r\n\r\n192 pages\r\n25.5 x18 cm\r\nSoftcover\r\nColour Offset\r\n","options":[{"id":41784678,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.2,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":6.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123100629/-/TooMuch1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123100629/-/TooMuch1.jpg","width":900,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123100638/-/TooMuch2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123100638/-/TooMuch2.jpg","width":900,"height":853},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123100647/-/TooMuch3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123100647/-/TooMuch3.jpg","width":900,"height":814},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123100653/-/TooMuch4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123100653/-/TooMuch4.jpg","width":900,"height":827},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123100665/-/TooMuch5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123100665/-/TooMuch5.jpg","width":900,"height":736}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":156164,"name":"MAGAZINES","permalink":"magazines","url":"/category/magazines"}]},{"id":13263870,"name":"Oh Comely - issue 17","permalink":"oh-comely-issue-17","position":86,"price":4.0,"default_price":4.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/oh-comely-issue-17","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-30T14:54:57.000Z","description":"Oh Comely is a magazine that makes people smile, full of quiet moments and stories.

The magazine contains no text; each picture springs from an idea, often simple, and through a complex orchestration of people it becomes the materialization of the artists’ mental outbursts. \r\n\r\nSince the first issue, in June 2010, Toilet Paper has created a world that displays ambiguous narratives and a troubling imagination. It combines the vernacular of commercial photography with twisted narrative tableaux and surrealistic imagery. The result is a publication that is itself a work of art which, through its accessible form as a magazine, and through its wide distribution, challenges the limits of the contemporary art economy.\r\n\r\n40 pages\r\n22.5 x 29 cm\r\nfull colour\r\nsoft cover","options":[{"id":42165447,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.2,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123381327/-/TOILET1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123381327/-/TOILET1.jpg","width":900,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123381333/-/TOILET2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123381333/-/TOILET2.jpg","width":900,"height":634},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123381345/-/TOILET3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123381345/-/TOILET3.jpg","width":900,"height":615},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123381351/-/TOILET4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123381351/-/TOILET4.jpg","width":900,"height":735},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123381357/-/TOILET5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123381357/-/TOILET5.jpg","width":900,"height":620}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":156164,"name":"MAGAZINES","permalink":"magazines","url":"/category/magazines"}]},{"id":13220484,"name":"IdN - Music Graphic Issue, vol 20 no 3","permalink":"idn-music-graphic-issue-vol-20-no-3","position":90,"price":12.5,"default_price":12.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/idn-music-graphic-issue-vol-20-no-3","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-28T14:40:35.000Z","description":"International designers Network is a bi-monthly magazine for the design community published in Hong Kong, each issues takes a different theme or topic.\r\n\r\nThis issue looks at graphics in music. 'When the music has to stop — or does it?'\r\nRecorded music has always been packaged, from the very earliest days when wax cylinders came in cardboard tubes, and has therefore always involved designers. In the palmy days of vinyl LPs with sometimes stunning cover art and often erudite liner notes, the presentation was almost as important as the product.\r\n\r\nBut with the industry morphing so rapidly into the field of digital-download delivery, where do the graphics come in now?

From rickshaw politics to open-source cargo bikes, from racing with missing limbs to riding in search of the simple life - there's poetry, strangeness and inspiration in equal measure. As ever, there is the work of some wonderful illustrators, photographers and writers from around the world to bring all these bicycle stories to life. \r\n\r\n60 pages\r\n17 x 24 cm\r\nfull colour","options":[{"id":39273840,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121317114/-/boneshaker1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121317114/-/boneshaker1.jpg","width":900,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121317120/-/boneshaker2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121317120/-/boneshaker2.jpg","width":900,"height":713},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121317129/-/boneshaker3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121317129/-/boneshaker3.jpg","width":900,"height":788},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121317135/-/boneshaker4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121317135/-/boneshaker4.jpg","width":900,"height":662},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/121317138/-/boneshaker5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/121317138/-/boneshaker5.jpg","width":900,"height":685}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":156164,"name":"MAGAZINES","permalink":"magazines","url":"/category/magazines"}]},{"id":12002004,"name":"33 Bottles of Beer by Dave Seldon","permalink":"33-bottles-of-beer-by-dave-seldon","position":107,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/33-bottles-of-beer-by-dave-seldon","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-06-25T11:28:00.000Z","description":"Born from attending a few too many beer festivals, this beer journal was developed by Dave Selden, co-founder of BS Brewing, a Portland, Oregon homebrewing and extreme food collective. \r\n\r\n33 Beers is a beer journal that provides an easy way to record beer tasting notes in a small, convenient notebook format.

This simple act held special significance in numerous utopian communities that emerged in nineteenth-century America, and was given physical presence in the form of a variety of styles of wooden benches. Fascinated by these expressions of harmony and equality, renowned British artist Francis Cape sought out and made measured drawings of remaining examples. \r\n\r\nWe Sit Together presents twenty-five of Cape s beautifully reconstructed benches drawn from twenty utopian sects, active from 1732 to the present, ranging from well-known communities like the Shakers to more obscure groups like the Separatists of Zoar. Introduced by noted curator Richard Torchia, and featuring crisp photographs and lovingly handmade drawings of the benches, along with installation photographs by Aaron Igler, this is a rarely seen slice of Americana. \r\n\r\nPublished by Princeton Architectural Press\r\n\r\n112 pages\r\n16.5 x 21.5 cm\r\nsoft cover\r\nfull colour\r\n\r\nISBN 9781616891596 \r\n","options":[{"id":37664667,"name":"Default","price":15.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/117277398/-/benches1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/117277398/-/benches1.jpg","width":900,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/117277434/-/benches2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/117277434/-/benches2.jpg","width":900,"height":643},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/117277446/-/benches3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/117277446/-/benches3.jpg","width":900,"height":637},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/117277458/-/benches4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/117277458/-/benches4.jpg","width":900,"height":792},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/117277470/-/benches5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/117277470/-/benches5.jpg","width":896,"height":900}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":114991,"name":"BOOKS","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":12553260,"name":"Feather print by The Lindström Effect","permalink":"feather-print-by-the-lindstrom-effect","position":113,"price":28.0,"default_price":28.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/feather-print-by-the-lindstrom-effect","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-07-24T12:17:58.000Z","description":"This is a beautiful Giclee print from an original watercolour  illustration.

This time he paces his immediate surroundings in the city he grew up in. The dreamlike stroll through Zurich follows observations of construction and destruction and traces the reactions and remnants of its inhabitants. Accompanied by drizzle and rain this ordinary walk provokes a sort of cleansing in the city with its two rivers, which is famous not only for its high living standard but also for its cleanliness.\r\n \r\nThe drawings were made with felt pen in small notebooks.

I install them in front of me, building a little ‘set’, and then I paint them. The most recent paintings represent things I have constructed, so they look a bit different because people don’t know what the objects are and the paintings look less like ‘still life’ paintings even though they are.\" Nathalie Du Pasquier\r\n \r\nNathalie Du Pasquier was born in Bordeaux (France) in 1957, she lives in Milan (Italy) since 1979.

Photography tips came from like-minded fellow photographers employed in the surfing press rather than from school, and art history was a matter of osmosis, not academia. In the mid-1990s, Campbell moved to New York and immersed himself in the scene around Alleged Gallery, where he quickly befriended and exhibited among the generation of artists who would star in the landmark 2004 exhibition Beautiful Losers. Campbell began documenting surfing culture in the late 1990s through both photography and film. His first feature-length film, The Seedling, came out in 1999, followed by Sprout in 2004 and The Present in 2009. Campbell’s surfing photography has long been admired among by fellow surfers for its lack of gloss finish; unlike most, he eschews the familiar fish-eye shots or tightly cropped land angles. The first of five projected volumes in Um Yeah Press’ surf photo- book series, Slide Your Brains Out compiles work from the past 15 years. Often lo-fi and gritty, other times lush and saturated, Campbell’s compositions—which include portraits and action shots of some of the best surfers in the world—are always surprising and full of emotion, from melancholy to exultation. \r\n\r\nForeword by Scott Hulet.

He has a great use of flatness and pattern in his painting that makes them both intimate and disorientating at the same time.

It is created in Athens, Greece, by an international team and published twice a year, spanning fashion, culture and philosophy through striking photography and thoughtful texts. \r\n\r\nIn issue 7, the legendary couturier Romeo Gigli emerges from self-imposed exile to share an intimate history of his roller-coaster career; the photographer Harry Peccinotti revisits the heady days around the founding of the iconic 1960s magazine Nova; Angelo Flaccavento peeks inside the personal archive of the pioneering tailoring and textiles master Nino Cerruti; and the Brazilian designer Paula Gerbase explores a utopian future with her new label 1205. We also open our ears to the abrasive, transcendent sounds of Michael Gira’s venerable art-porn-noise collective Swans and Scott Soriano’s underground punk and archival releases as S.S. Records; and our eyes to the existential angst of Aristomenis Theodoropoulos’ acrylics and the glacial beauty of Henning Bock’s landscapes.\r\n\r\n128 pages\r\n23 x 30 cm\r\nb/w ","options":[{"id":33132100,"name":"Default","price":4.75,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103966084/-/dapper1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103966084/-/dapper1.jpg","width":900,"height":876},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103966102/-/dapper2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103966102/-/dapper2.jpg","width":900,"height":671},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103966132/-/dapper3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103966132/-/dapper3.jpg","width":900,"height":710},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103966144/-/dapper4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103966144/-/dapper4.jpg","width":900,"height":707},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103966168/-/dapper5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103966168/-/dapper5.jpg","width":900,"height":638}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":156164,"name":"MAGAZINES","permalink":"magazines","url":"/category/magazines"}]},{"id":10281916,"name":"February by Eleni Kalorkoti","permalink":"february-by-eleni-kalorkoti","position":150,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/february-by-eleni-kalorkoti","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-01T15:35:22.000Z","description":"2013 is going to be a splendid year, if only for the fact that Eleni promises to release a new zine every month.

Bold and graphic, this illustrated book presents a dark but colourful view of a modern world gone topsy-turvy.\r\n\r\nIn the Dieselbrugg Apocalypse, Halpern manages to move between pilgrimage and the misery of refugees with the sure-footedness of a somnambulist. \"You can‘t really be as dozy as that\" he seems to be muttering. \"Come into my yurt In here you will hear peace bells ringing, you‘ll see bathing towels fluttering.

I was working on images of buildings for another series and found these plants and trees in the course of that work and shot them for my own pleasure.'\r\n\r\nPublished by The Velvet Cell, 2012\r\n\r\n52 pages\r\n23 x 28 cm\r\nPerfect Bound with Dust Jacket\r\nColour Offset\r\nLimited Edition of 500\r\n\r\nISBN 9781908889003","options":[{"id":23329569,"name":"Default","price":18.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72356451/-/bot1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72356451/-/bot1.jpg","width":700,"height":857},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72356459/-/bot2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72356459/-/bot2.jpg","width":900,"height":843},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72356491/-/bot3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72356491/-/bot3.jpg","width":900,"height":714},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72356499/-/bot4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72356499/-/bot4.jpg","width":900,"height":838},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72356531/-/bot5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72356531/-/bot5.jpg","width":900,"height":809}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":114991,"name":"BOOKS","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":9467939,"name":"Limner Journal Issue 2","permalink":"limner-journal-issue-2","position":163,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/limner-journal-issue-2","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-13T14:48:59.000Z","description":"Limner is a new critical journal of illustration, aiming to provide a platform for the exploration, critique and contextualisation of contemporary illustration, to promote interesting and intelligent illustration and initiate a discourse into wider issues related to the industry, education and social impact (or lack thereof).\r\n\r\nIssue 2 features work and words from Jordan Chatwin, Blaise Larmee, Colin David Stewart, Peter Willis, Penny Klein, Murray O'Grady, Stine Belden Røed, Grace Helmer, Jay Cover, Holly Mills, Reena Makwana, Kai Nodland, Reuben Mwaura & Joe Kessler, Liv Taylor, Eric Timothy Carlson, Charlotte Mei, Umberto Eco, Ella McLean, Florence Shaw, Hayley English, Nick White, Alice Lindsay, Matthew Walkerdine & Jessica Higgins, Joakim Ojanen, Mike Redmond & Jon Pilkington, Chie Miyazaki, Lisa Wilkens, Rose Blake, Megan Woof, Dan Shapiro, Isabella Toledo\r\n\r\n168 pages\r\n12cm x 17cm\r\nfull colour\r\nopen-sewn book","options":[{"id":29603723,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.7,"amount_with_others":1.2,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/93035738/-/limner1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/93035738/-/limner1.jpg","width":900,"height":898},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/93035762/-/limner2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/93035762/-/limner2.jpg","width":900,"height":885},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/93035798/-/limner3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/93035798/-/limner3.jpg","width":900,"height":898},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/93035846/-/limner4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/93035846/-/limner4.jpg","width":900,"height":934},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/93035858/-/limner5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/93035858/-/limner5.jpg","width":900,"height":897}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":156164,"name":"MAGAZINES","permalink":"magazines","url":"/category/magazines"}]},{"id":6690231,"name":"Indoor Living by Ryan Stewart Nault","permalink":"indoor-living-by-ryan-stewart-nault","position":164,"price":8.5,"default_price":8.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/indoor-living-by-ryan-stewart-nault","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-13T17:08:20.000Z","description":"'Indoor Living PART ONE: GETTING ACQUAINTED'\r\n\r\nRyan Stewart Nault is an artist currently based in Chicago but originally from Michigan.

Part Two is a celebration of British eccentricity, rooted in ancient traditions. These traditions are a powerful cohesive force for the communities that keep them alive.\r\n\r\nThe second book concentrates on the Pearly Kings and Queens of London, the Cornish ‘Obby ‘Oss and Lewes Bonfire night.\r\n\r\nThe Pearly Kings and Queens are arguably the most visually compelling of London’s folk traditions. This section of the book focuses on the larger-than-life personalities that uphold this tradition. The surreal, intensely rooted ‘Obby ‘Oss festival is fiercely guarded by the local residents of Padstow. This provides a rare glimpse into this event. The last section of the book captures the local characters who form one of the original Lewes bonfire night societies. These societies create and stage this anarchic, theatrical spectacle.\r\n\r\nJames Pearson Howes is a free-lance photographer based in the London, who uses a strong reportage style of portraiture. \r\n\r\nSelf published, 2012\r\n\r\n40 pages\r\n15 x 20 cm\r\nfull colour\r\nSigned copies\r\nEdition of 250\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":24804003,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/77177184/-/britfolk1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/77177184/-/britfolk1.jpg","width":700,"height":886},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/77177232/-/britfolk2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/77177232/-/britfolk2.jpg","width":882,"height":848},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/77177280/-/britfolk3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/77177280/-/britfolk3.jpg","width":700,"height":799},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/77177292/-/britfolk4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/77177292/-/britfolk4.jpg","width":900,"height":862},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/77177316/-/britfolk5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/77177316/-/britfolk5.jpg","width":900,"height":916}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":114991,"name":"BOOKS","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":8405373,"name":"Hate Mail by Mr Bingo","permalink":"hate-mail-by-mr-bingo","position":166,"price":9.99,"default_price":9.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/hate-mail-by-mr-bingo","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-06T16:47:53.000Z","description":"Mr Bingo loves post but was worried that people don't get enough 'fun' post these days.

Each issue is named after a different man and therefore takes on an altered persona. His predecessor was the more delicate Sebastian, the two are not to be mistaken as allies. \r\n\r\nHector is an erudite activist concerned with arts, politics, and parity.  This publication bares itself with a defaced poster, a documentation of the French presidential campaign by artist Pascal Fellonnea.\r\n\r\nBetween the pages Hector journeys just outside Rome, to meet Maurizo Amadei from atelier design house ma+. Then to Prizendorf castle, Northern Austria, where Hermann Nitsch communicates his fixation with controlled violence.\r\n\r\nFor visual stimulation Blommers/Schumm entertain with physiological illusions. And artist Koen Hauser collaborates with collage artist Ruth van Beek, which results in a clandestine fashion shoot. Photographer David Moore captures delicate images of various ‘apparatus of the state’. Should this not suffice the Chapman Brothers’ dominant critic-Julian Stallabrass remains scathing of the YBA art movement, and the remarkably private worlds of London’s members clubs are exposed.\r\n\r\n112 pages\r\n24 x 30 cm\r\nfull colour","options":[{"id":23256543,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72122635/-/hect1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72122635/-/hect1.jpg","width":700,"height":881},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72122653/-/hect2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72122653/-/hect2.jpg","width":900,"height":788},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72122661/-/hect3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72122661/-/hect3.jpg","width":900,"height":821},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72122673/-/hect4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72122673/-/hect4.jpg","width":900,"height":695},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/72122685/-/hect5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/72122685/-/hect5.jpg","width":900,"height":603}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":156164,"name":"MAGAZINES","permalink":"magazines","url":"/category/magazines"}]},{"id":7215407,"name":"The Colour Chart of Deep Thought by The Lindström Effect","permalink":"the-colour-chart-of-deep-thought-by-the-lindstrom-effect","position":189,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-colour-chart-of-deep-thought-by-the-lindstrom-effect","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-11T17:31:41.000Z","description":"Another excellent publication from The Lindström Effect - The Colour Chart of Deep Thought features some of our greatest thinkers represented in colour. \r\n\r\n'Painting your Living Room? why not not try Jean Paul Satre's Being Autumn, Existential bathrooms, Absurdism bedrooms.

Together with words by Elena Harrington, Steven’s series of Totem drawings started merely as pencil sketches that he began doing during his down time at his home in LA. Playing with the idea of the Linear, both vertical and horizontal, he recognized that his \"balance drawings\" and the objects that they were comprised of revealed a merge between his personal and professional life, that these Totem Poles, similar to what they have historically done for centuries, told a story. Here Steven’s first release for Nieves also functions as a catalogue of sorts for his first solo artshow August 2012 in Los Angeles California.\r\n \r\nCited as leading a contemporary Californian psychedelic-pop aesthetic, the Los Angeles-based artist and designer Steven Harrington is best known for his hazy hued, iconic style that encourages a two way conversation between the artist and viewer. \r\n\r\nElena Harrington, former Editor for DASH Literary Journal and creative writer, finds depth of words and their meaning in the clear and concise. Elena resides in Long Beach, California, where she seeks inspiration in the eclectic lifestyle creating wire wrapped, antique, and asymmetrical designed Jewelry.\r\n\r\nPublished by Nieves, 2012\r\n\r\n36 Pages \r\n19.5 x 25.5 cm \r\nSoftcover\r\nFirst Edition\r\n \r\nISBN 978-3-905999-07-5","options":[{"id":20923613,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64665933/-/harrington1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64665933/-/harrington1.jpg","width":700,"height":863},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64665949/-/harrington2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64665949/-/harrington2.jpg","width":900,"height":631},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64665957/-/harrington3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64665957/-/harrington3.jpg","width":900,"height":931},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64665965/-/harrington4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64665965/-/harrington4.jpg","width":900,"height":837},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64665989/-/harrington5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64665989/-/harrington5.jpg","width":900,"height":637}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":114991,"name":"BOOKS","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"},{"id":114994,"name":"ZINES","permalink":"zines","url":"/category/zines"}]},{"id":6596367,"name":"Kerim in the Sky with Seiler by Kerim Seiler","permalink":"kerim-in-the-sky-with-seiler-by-kerim-seiler","position":196,"price":43.0,"default_price":43.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kerim-in-the-sky-with-seiler-by-kerim-seiler","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-07-02T17:02:03.000Z","description":"From the Nieves website:\r\n\r\n'In the mid-nineties, Kerim Seiler paints Zurich city furnishings on found pieces of fiberboard. Chosen workaday design serves as ready-to-paint object and is protocoled in pictograms. Seiler's paintings dissolve into single elements turning three-dimensional. His work becomes walkable and can be viewed from behind. One stands within the picture, \"inside of the outside\", so to speak. Perspicuity and practicability lend Seiler's work the claim of social sculpture, without depending on fundamental contentions. Through flexibility and humor, the sculptures emit an integrative quality. The work of Kerim Seiler is always on the road and sometimes the guest of nice people'\r\nA.C.

By 1968 he moved to New York. First working as a draftsman in an architectural firm, he started a career as an illustrator at the age of 30. His work has been published in major american publications such as the New York Times, Time magazine and The New Yorker among others. In the late 90's he shifted gradually from commissioned work to his own original production which he is now showing in galleries worldwide. \r\n\r\nWeisbecker's art consists of depicting elements of our daily life untouched by the sometime devastating effects of fashion's changing mood. These range from tools to appliances, industrial buildings to public housing and, greenhouses. Greenhouses were created for the purpose of preserving an inner world from the outside world. They haven't changed much over time. Their purpose created their form. There lies their eternal beauty. It is this beauty that Weisbecker invites us to share with him through his Greenhouses study book. \r\n\r\nPublished by Nieves, 2012\r\n\r\n32 Pages\r\n16 x 22.5 cm\r\nColour Offset\r\nFirst Edition\r\n","options":[{"id":19824451,"name":"Default","price":13.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61006855/-/green1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61006855/-/green1.jpg","width":700,"height":910},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61006881/-/green2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61006881/-/green2.jpg","width":501,"height":379},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61006903/-/green3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61006903/-/green3.jpg","width":503,"height":379},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61006935/-/green4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61006935/-/green4.jpg","width":509,"height":378},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61006951/-/green5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61006951/-/green5.jpg","width":519,"height":383}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":114991,"name":"BOOKS","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":6274773,"name":"Le Rose, La Couleur Des Hippies by Hayan Kam Nakache & Josse Bailly","permalink":"le-rose-la-couleur-des-hippies-hayan-kam-nakache-josse-bailly","position":205,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/le-rose-la-couleur-des-hippies-hayan-kam-nakache-josse-bailly","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-05-24T19:33:57.000Z","description":"Hayan and Josse are two big nosed, big footed artists from Geneva.

The book’s concept is essentially a field guide to a spirit world beyond our reality. Its melancholic narrative shows spirits that are lost in the city, lonely and seeking escape. As a result they move to the countryside but find they are still lost, so consequently decide to leave the planet, which in turn is but another creature continually searching for something it cannot find.\r\n\r\nKeaton’s inspiration is born from old Scandinavian folklore and Japanese Kwaidan (ghost stories) from the Edo period, to the more contemporary Miyasaki Spirited Away films.\r\n\r\nKeaton's music is pretty sweet too, look him up here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZPnlMfMOzY\r\n\r\nPublished by Pocko, 2012\r\n\r\n112 pages\r\n21 x 15 cm\r\nHardcover\r\nb/w

very excited by Tom's new book, he really is a master at storytelling. His apparently simple drawings manage to convey atmosphere, tension and humour to perfection. Here he reworks the story of David and Goliath. \r\n\r\nGoliath of Gath isn’t much of a fighter. Given half a choice, he’d pick admin work over patrolling in a heartbeat, to say nothing of his distaste for engaging in combat. Nonetheless, at the behest of the king, he finds himself issuing a twice-daily challenge to the Israelites: \"Choose a man. Let him come to me that we may fight. If he be able to kill me, then we shall be your servants. But if I kill him, then you shall be our servants.\" \r\n\r\nPublished by Drawn and Quarterly\r\n\r\n96 pages\r\n25 x 17.5 cm\r\nHard cover\r\nTwo colour\r\n\r\nISBN: 9781770460652 \r\n","options":[{"id":17808759,"name":"Default","price":14.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54258509/-/goliath1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54258509/-/goliath1.jpg","width":700,"height":926},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54258521/-/goliath2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54258521/-/goliath2.jpg","width":900,"height":807},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54258537/-/goliath3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54258537/-/goliath3.jpg","width":700,"height":777},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54258561/-/goliath4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54258561/-/goliath4.jpg","width":700,"height":914},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54258585/-/goliath5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54258585/-/goliath5.jpg","width":900,"height":672}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":114991,"name":"BOOKS","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":3547782,"name":"In The Wilds: Drawings by Nigel Peake","permalink":"in-the-wilds-drawings-by-nigel-peake","position":214,"price":14.99,"default_price":14.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/in-the-wilds-drawings-by-nigel-peake","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-04-05T21:03:27.000Z","description":"A beautiful hardback book from the most excellent Mr Nigel Peake. \r\n\r\nFeaturing almost 100 original drawings, a charming collection of Nigels handdrawn observations of rural life.

This book might be considered a departure from Jarvis' previous projects; here, he has constructed a personal narrative with artwork that combines his interest in medieval woodcuts and Dutch De Stjil.\r\n\r\n64 pages\r\n21 x 28.5 cm\r\nFull colour\r\nHardcover","options":[{"id":17518489,"name":"Default","price":14.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53296211/-/jarvis1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53296211/-/jarvis1.jpg","width":700,"height":879},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53296099/-/jarvis2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53296099/-/jarvis2.jpg","width":900,"height":725},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53296127/-/jarvis3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53296127/-/jarvis3.jpg","width":900,"height":916},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53296155/-/jarvis4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53296155/-/jarvis4.jpg","width":900,"height":731},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53296171/-/jarvis5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53296171/-/jarvis5.jpg","width":900,"height":904}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":114991,"name":"BOOKS","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":4782117,"name":"Quality of Life - Brian W.

Many of them were first shared on his popular blog The Blue Hour, and neatly encapsulate what he has said sums up the nature of his work: a desire to document the small and often seemingly unexceptional moments of day to day life, capturing these quietly beautiful details and making visual diary entries, allowing us to dwell on them with him.\r\n\r\nFirst Edition of 500 copies\r\n167x215mm / 48 pages / 37 colour images\r\nSoft cover, perfect bound\r\nISBN 978-0-9570378-0-9","options":[{"id":15626957,"name":"Default","price":13.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46901001/-/ferry1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46901001/-/ferry1.jpg","width":298,"height":298},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46901009/-/ferry2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46901009/-/ferry2.jpg","width":450,"height":298},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46901025/-/ferry3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46901025/-/ferry3.jpg","width":450,"height":298},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46901033/-/ferry4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46901033/-/ferry4.jpg","width":450,"height":298},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46901041/-/ferry5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46901041/-/ferry5.jpg","width":450,"height":298}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":114991,"name":"BOOKS","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":5368191,"name":"Ein Magazin über Orte # 9","permalink":"ein-magazin-uber-orte-9","position":218,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ein-magazin-uber-orte-9","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-01-31T18:24:34.000Z","description":"Ein Magazin über Orte (A Magazine about Places) is published twice a year.

From train rides facing backwards, to crammed bus rides in tiny hill-top towns, to bike rides through the backyards of Europe. Records of the vast, unyielding concrete miles of Shanghai, to the paths between mountains and forests in late night French countryside to the old paint splattered wooden floor in London that I sleep on from time to time. In addition to this there are also some imaginings of possible places - cities built from train tunnels and underground arches to invisible concrete cities.\r\n\r\nSome of the maps are drawn a couple of months after the occasion and others begin as a scribble in thin card-covered sketchbooks in desolate airports on overnight waits.

Tom took photographs of the few people and buildings there, both seeming weathered hard by the constant wind and standing like tombstones, still, serious and sparse for Tom's camera.\r\n\r\nHe stopped them all; middle-aged bartenders, tourists, punk-rockers, hippies, very old and very young, me, my mom, my daughter, my wife, my son, all of us got stopped in time by Tom’s camera, a kind of living graveyard.” \r\n\r\nThis record of their journey is divided into States, with watercolour chapter pages by Jerwood Drawing Prize nominated artist Aaron Sewards.\r\n\r\nPublished by Betty and Dupree, 2011\r\n\r\n\r\n72 pages\r\n24 x 17 cm\r\nPerfect bound, soft cover, \r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":15875729,"name":"Default","price":14.99,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47802101/-/tomcops1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47802101/-/tomcops1.jpg","width":900,"height":687},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47802117/-/tomcops2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47802117/-/tomcops2.jpg","width":900,"height":742},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47802125/-/tomcops3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47802125/-/tomcops3.jpg","width":900,"height":720},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47802149/-/tomcops4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47802149/-/tomcops4.jpg","width":900,"height":869},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/47802165/-/tomcops5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/47802165/-/tomcops5.jpg","width":900,"height":861}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":114991,"name":"BOOKS","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":4818931,"name":"Yule Bringer: Sledding In The Cosmic Neighbourhood","permalink":"yule-bringer-sledding-in-the-cosmic-neighbourhood","position":232,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/yule-bringer-sledding-in-the-cosmic-neighbourhood","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-10T17:28:18.000Z","description":"A 6 Track CDr by everybodys favourite wizard, Yule Bringer/Adam Higton, accompanied by a set of 6 lino prints, each by a different artist and based on a track from the album.\r\n\r\n1.

I was invited to exhbit my work and conduct a workshop organized by the artist-run Alexandria Contemporary Arts Forum (ACAF). This paperback is a selection of the many drawings that transpired on this amazing journey.\r\n\r\nNot all my drawings are of a scene that catches my eye. Often it starts with coming across a really comfortable spot where I can sit undisturbed for some time amongst the hustle and rumble of a busy city. This, for me, can be quite meditative. Later, I scan the drawings to upload onto my website and other applications.\r\n\r\nThis time round, I also experimented with the drawings and hope to present this book as my personal development or work in progress. I wish to share the overwhelming experience of drawing the ocean and have tried to capture the simultaneous static second and fluid element of the water by flushing the drawings through a scanner and allowing them to distort as they wish to flow, much like the city, much like life itself.\"\r\n\r\nIngo Giezendanner alias GRRRR, July 2011\r\n\r\nSince 1998, Ingo Giezendanner documents his surroundings with pen on paper.

It was designed to take a romantic and fantastic vision of a skateboard company and make it ‘real’. Michael Leon was inspired by the naïve wonder he experienced as a young skateboarder, which he juxtaposes with an elegant, yet dry, catalogue sales format. The result is a carefree and poetic narrative carried by a range of imagined products.\r\n\r\nMichael Leon was raised in late 80's, early 90's skateboard culture. His work lives in a unique place between the worlds of art and art direction. He often uses the language of graphic design to create meaning through sculpture, paintings, videos, and editions. While still in high school, Michael designed his first pro model skateboard for New Deal Skateboards. 19 years later, he continues to design for his skateboard company Stacks, as well as creating artwork and art directing collaborative projects. \r\n\r\nPublished by Nieves\r\n\r\n28 Pages\r\n19.5 x 25.5 cm\r\nColour Offset\r\nFirst Edition 2010\r\n","options":[{"id":12808952,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37403026/-/leon1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37403026/-/leon1.jpg","width":700,"height":925},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37403034/-/michaelleon1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37403034/-/michaelleon1.jpg","width":595,"height":425},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37403042/-/michaelleon3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37403042/-/michaelleon3.jpg","width":595,"height":425},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37403050/-/michaelleon4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37403050/-/michaelleon4.jpg","width":595,"height":425},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/37403066/-/michaelleon5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/37403066/-/michaelleon5.jpg","width":595,"height":425}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":114991,"name":"BOOKS","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":3755164,"name":"More With Less - Stephen Smith, Neasden Control Centre","permalink":"more-with-less-stephen-smith-neasden-control-centre","position":245,"price":16.95,"default_price":16.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/more-with-less-stephen-smith-neasden-control-centre","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-05-15T17:45:49.000Z","description":"Under the motto 'More with Less', a playful variation on the well-known modernistic principle of 'less is more', Steven Smith created an overwhelming visual world by which he aims to examine and lay bare the essence of our fully automated communication.\r\n\r\nPublished by MU\r\n\r\n32 pages\r\n19.5 x 25.5 cm\r\nfull colour \r\nsoftcover\r\n1st Edition\r\n\r\nISBN 978-90-79423-06-4\r\n \r\n ","options":[{"id":12568792,"name":"Default","price":16.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.75}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36581724/-/DSC03878.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36581724/-/DSC03878.JPG","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36581740/-/DSC03879.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36581740/-/DSC03879.JPG","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36581764/-/DSC03880.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36581764/-/DSC03880.JPG","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36581780/-/DSC03881.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36581780/-/DSC03881.JPG","width":600,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36581804/-/DSC03882.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36581804/-/DSC03882.JPG","width":600,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":114991,"name":"BOOKS","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":3754896,"name":"Everything Flowers - Clare Rojas","permalink":"everything-flowers-clare-rojas","position":246,"price":14.0,"default_price":14.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/everything-flowers-clare-rojas","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-05-15T15:45:10.000Z","description":"Collected here for the first time are the beautiful and exotic paintings of Clare Rojas.

When Okamoto slips behind one of his human-sized puppets to animate it, a confused game began between the master, the puppet and the photographer. \r\n\r\nEstelle Hanania is a Paris-based photographer with a background in graphic design, art direction and fine art. She graduated in 2006 from the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts de Paris and, in the same year, won the ‘best photographer’ prize at the highly prestigious Hyeres Festival in Southern France. \r\nHer photography has been exhibited in several galleries and her work, both commissioned and personal, has appeared in magazines including Another, 032c, Vice,Capricious and more.\r\n\r\nAs usual with Estelle Hanania’s work, Dondoro leads the spectator into a world where human figures constantly appear and disappear, in the magical world of a magical storyteller.\r\n\r\nPublished by Kaugummi, February 2011\r\n\r\n \r\n48 pages\r\nfull colour offset printed\r\nperfect bound / soft cover\r\n16.5 x 22 cm\r\nFrench/English language\r\nFirst edition 1of 1000\r\n\r\nISBN 978235862024\r\n","options":[{"id":12410026,"name":"Default","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":0.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36020406/-/dondoro.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36020406/-/dondoro.jpg","width":700,"height":899},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36020430/-/dondoro2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36020430/-/dondoro2.jpg","width":900,"height":702},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36020444/-/dondoro3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36020444/-/dondoro3.jpg","width":800,"height":757},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36020454/-/dondoro4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36020454/-/dondoro4.jpg","width":800,"height":691},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/36020462/-/dondoro5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/36020462/-/dondoro5.jpg","width":800,"height":614}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":114991,"name":"BOOKS","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":3511502,"name":"Entomology Study C by The Lindstrom Effect ","permalink":"entomology-study-c-by-the-lindstrom-effect","position":250,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/entomology-study-c-by-the-lindstrom-effect","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-03-30T17:59:29.000Z","description":"A series of prints from an original illustration entitled \"Entomological Studies\" by the very excellent talent that is The Lindstrom Effect.

McGee synthesizes a wide range of resources, including the Mexican muralists, anonymous street art and San Francisco Beat poetry, all of which are notably characterized by a sense of public address that McGee never neglects to convey in his own work. His paintings, drawings and installations spill over with graphic energy and political anger, and direct exhortations to his audience to respond to the life around them. \r\n\r\nBarry McGee was born in San Francisco in 1968 and studied at the San Francisco Art Institute. He continues to live and work in that city. He has had solo exhibitions at Brandeis University's Rose Art Museum in Waltham, Massachusetts, Deitch Projects in New York and the Prada Foundation in Milan amongst others.\r\n\r\n204

Each print is editioned by us by hand and individually approved by the artist. We hope we can work with artists at all stages of their career and from all corners of the globe.'\r\n\r\nEarly Griffin donates 10% of the profits of each edition to a charity of the artist's choice.\r\n\r\nAbout French\r\nFrench's `Boar Tree' seems to take inspiration from mediaeval woodcuts and manages to be beautiful and twisted at the same time. It's warm green and brown are set off perfectly by the amazingly detailed black line work.\r\n\r\nFrench hails from Aldershot, a part of the UK known for its Army Base - a good place to start an interest in torn body parts. An obsession with Metal music informs his work that literally draws the line between the magnificent and the repulsive.
