He studied the art and history of photography at Mass College of Art in the late ‘70s and moved to Chicago in the late 1980s. He first became known for his evocative “in the pit” photographs which documented the burgeoning Boston punk and hardcore scenes in the early-to-mid ‘80s, but his work encompasses a wide range of “man-on-the-street” and portrait photography approaches. He is still active today behind the lens.\r\n\r\nFind Phil at:\r\nhttp://PhilinPhlash.Blogspot.com\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/philinphlash\r\n\r\n\r\nQ&A WITH PHILIN PHLASH\r\n\r\nGood Road Goods: What do you remember about the photo being used on this shirt?\r\n\r\nPhilin Phlash: It was taken at Streets in Allston, in 1980. I remember that I was getting kicked in the head a lot! [laughs]. I was right on the edge of the stage, which was a good place to photograph. But the room just erupted, all of a sudden, behind me. That pile you see in the photo came from behind me, in the pit, and traveled over me to get there on the stage [laughs].\r\n\r\nGRG: Who was performing when that erupted?\r\n\r\nPhlash: It might have been SSD, but it was probably Gang Green. Either way, Springa [lead singer of SSD and Phil’s younger brother] is in the middle there. If you follow the microphone cord you can see just a little bit of his face and the microphone. SSD was either on-stage at the time, or Gang Green was performing and Springa jumped on-stage and was singing with them.\r\n\r\nGRG: What was your favorite club to shoot in back in the early ‘80s?\r\n\r\nPhlash: Each place was different, honestly. Getting to the right spot in the club to shoot was always half the battle. It was a sonar type of thing for me, figuring out where I needed to be.\r\n\r\nGRG: What rules did you follow when it came to being where you needed to be, then?\r\n\r\nPhlash: Get to where you need to get to, and shoot without getting killed [laughs]. Once you’re there, take as many shots as you can before it got too crazy. I broke a lot of flashes and flash bulbs being in those situations, but thankfully never my camera. I didn’t want to be an observer, I wanted to be a participant. You needed to be in the middle of everything to get the best shots.\r\n\r\nGRG: What do you like most about this shot?\r\n\r\nPhlash: I like it because I was close to the action, but not too close. You get the texture and the tones, with the jeans and the boots and the faces. It was like shooting from the inside out. I was close enough to feel it, but not so close that what was going on in front of me got lost.\r\n\r\nGRG: Did you ever jump into any of those pig-piles?\r\n\r\nPhlash: It would have been fun, because those were just like the pig-piles when you were a kid. But I had a camera, so I couldn’t do it. I still felt like I was part of it, though. That kind of stuff, pig-piles and stage-diving, it was exhilaration. It was risky, it was a thrill. In the early days when it was going on, it was great. It didn’t get ugly until later.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":49158921,"name":"S","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49158924,"name":"M","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49158927,"name":"L","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49158930,"name":"XL","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49158933,"name":"XXL","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49158936,"name":"3XL","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128313660/-/Boston_1980_On_Model_HiRez_EXTRA_CROP.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128313660/-/Boston_1980_On_Model_HiRez_EXTRA_CROP.jpg","width":3240,"height":2709},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128313708/-/Boston_1980_(Philin_Phlash)_by_Good_Road_Goods_HIREZ_FINAL.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128313708/-/Boston_1980_(Philin_Phlash)_by_Good_Road_Goods_HIREZ_FINAL.jpg","width":3600,"height":2850},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128313759/-/Mens_Black_Shirt_Back_On_Model_CROPPED.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128313759/-/Mens_Black_Shirt_Back_On_Model_CROPPED.jpg","width":2718,"height":2426}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5321787,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":11268921,"name":"Roller Derby “Uniondale, New York, 1974” WOMEN'S shirt (Grey)","permalink":"uniondale-new-york-1974-roller-derby-women-s-shirt-grey","position":2,"price":28.0,"default_price":28.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/uniondale-new-york-1974-roller-derby-women-s-shirt-grey","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-20T17:21:03.000Z","description":"** ALSO AVAILABLE IN MEN'S (SEE SEPARATE PAGE) **\r\n\r\n\r\n100% SUPER-SOFT COTTON\r\n\r\nPremium screen-print: thin, durable and “breathable”\r\n\r\n[Screen printing by One Off Apparel]\r\n\r\nWOMEN’S FIT: Fitted crew-neck.\r\n\r\n\r\nA percentage of profits from sales of this shirt will be donated to the following charities: \r\n\r\nThe Julian Center (Indianapolis).

A graduate of Ohio University, he has previously worked at the Los Angeles Times, the Arizona Daily Star and the Darien News.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ&A WITH PHOTOGRAPHER JOE VTTI:\r\n\r\nGood Road Goods: I know it was almost 40 years ago, but what do you remember about taking this photo we’re using. \r\n\r\nJoe Vitti: I didn’t remember the exact date, but after doing some research, it was Easter Sunday, 1974. New York Chiefs vs. Latin Liberators at the Nassau Coliseum in Long Island. I had never covered Roller Derby before, and I haven’t shot roller derby since then, at least not like that. I was a sports writer and photographer for the Darien News [Connecticut] at the time. A friend of mine was a video camera operator and he was shooting the match, so I tagged along. I wasn’t on assignment, it just sounded like I might be able to get some good pictures. I think I shot five rolls of film that day.\r\n\r\nGRG: What do you remember about the venue and what was going on?\r\n\r\nJV: It was a decent crowd, I remember thinking that they were pretty far back from the rink, actually. The people in the audience were pretty scary [laughs]. People were really into it. They were screaming and yelling the whole time. I thought the Roller Derby match was entertaining, but a lot of people took it more seriously. This was before big media coverage at most sporting events, I think there was probably only one other photographer there besides me. It was a lot more physical than I expected, definitely more so than roller derby you see today. Today they scale back the fights and violence. Back in those days it was also on a banked track, so that increased the speed. \r\n\r\nGRG: Did anything surprise you?\r\n\r\nJV: I guess I was surprised at how melodramatic everything was, especially the women’s roller derby teams [laughs]. It was over-the-top, similar to wrestling matches today. \r\n\r\nGRG: Technically were there any difficult aspects to shooting there that day?\r\n\r\nJV: Well, those were the days before auto-focus, of course. I might not have even had a motor drive on the camera. The only real rule was “Be Ready” [laughs].\r\n","options":[{"id":35469201,"name":"XL","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35469204,"name":"Large","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35469207,"name":"Medium","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112271286/-/Roller_Derby_WOMENS_Grey_On_Model_CROPPED.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112271286/-/Roller_Derby_WOMENS_Grey_On_Model_CROPPED.jpg","width":952,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112271226/-/ROLLER_DERBY_front_GREY_Slightly_Lower_Rez.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112271226/-/ROLLER_DERBY_front_GREY_Slightly_Lower_Rez.jpg","width":957,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5321787,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":13594575,"name":"Schoolly-D & DJ Code Money \"Parkside 1986\" (photo by Linn Stevens) [BLACK]","permalink":"schoolly-d-and-dj-code-money-parkside-1986-shirt","position":3,"price":28.0,"default_price":28.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/schoolly-d-and-dj-code-money-parkside-1986-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-16T13:32:57.000Z","description":"Men’s only.

It was hot enough to wear a tank top, but obviously not too hot ‘cause Code [Money, Schoolly’s DJ] is wearing a sweater. If I remember correctly, we were about to head down to Miami. And I asked Code, “What the f*ck are you doing wearing that?” [laughs]\r\n\r\nGRG: Were you taking photos for the hell of it, or was this shoot specifically for “Saturday Night: The Album” [it was eventually used on the back cover]? \r\n\r\nSchoolly: It was for the back of the album and also for my 8 x 10s [promo / press photos]. Before that was taken, people were complaining because I would just draw my 8 x 10s [laughs]. Nobody really knew what I looked like. Sometimes people would even show up at gigs and pretend to be me. So, letting people know what I actually looked like was another reason.\r\n\r\nGRG: Tell me about Linn “Disco Len” Stevens, who took the photo…\r\n\r\nSchoolly: He was the photographer for the neighborhood [Parkside Avenue and 52ndStreet, in West Philadephia]. He was a little bit older than us, he was like our uncle. He took photos at all the weddings, and stuff like that. He was also in our P.S.K. [Park Side Killers] crew, he was really the leader. Everyone listened to him. He didn’t rhyme, but he taught people how to DJ because he was the first real DJ in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nGRG: Tell me about the pose you guys have in that shot.\r\n\r\nSchoolly: There were other poses we did, but I just wanted to keep things simple. I didn’t want us to look cartoonish, because a lot of the photos we saw coming out of New York seemed so crazy, like the first time we saw with Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five’s picture. We didn’t represent what they represented.\r\n\t\r\nGRG: When that photo was taken in the spring of 1986, do you think you had any idea you’d still be making music and touring the world almost three decades later? The look on your face certainly seems to give that impression…\r\n\r\nSchoolly: Yeah! It doesn’t surprise me. I don’t want it to sound arrogant, but it’s how I was raised. You pick something and you grow with it. I picked music and art. I just knew, from the age of about seven. And I’m still going strong today.\r\n","options":[{"id":43589085,"name":"XXL","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43589325,"name":"XL","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43589328,"name":"Large","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43589331,"name":"Medium","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":43589334,"name":"3XL","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124380720/-/Schoolly_Shirt_On_Model_HIREZ.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124380720/-/Schoolly_Shirt_On_Model_HIREZ.jpg","width":3205,"height":2911},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124380750/-/SCHOOLLY-D_front_11_HIREZ.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124380750/-/SCHOOLLY-D_front_11_HIREZ.jpg","width":3600,"height":2850},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124380741/-/Schoolly_wearing_shirt_Aug_2013.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124380741/-/Schoolly_wearing_shirt_Aug_2013.jpg","width":640,"height":481}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5321787,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":11268108,"name":"B+ \"Los Angeles 1996\" MEN'S Shirt (BLACK)","permalink":"b-los-angeles-1996-men-s-shirt-black","position":4,"price":28.0,"default_price":28.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/b-los-angeles-1996-men-s-shirt-black","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-20T16:40:30.000Z","description":"100% SUPER-SOFT COTTON\r\n\r\nPremium screen-print: thin, durable and “breathable”\r\n\r\n[Screen printing by One Off Apparel]\r\n\r\nFIT: These are “fashion” fit, so if you are in-between sizes, go up a size instead of down.\r\n\r\n\r\nA percentage of profits from sales of this shirt will be donated to the following charity:\r\n\r\nCiné Institute, based in Jacmel, provides Haitian youth with film education and edutainment, technical training, and media-related micro enterprise opportunities.

At a club now called the Avalon, but back then it was called The Palace. Right in Hollywood. It was packed to the gills and I was on the side of the stage. In-between acts, before Meth came on, a massive fight broke out in the middle of the crowd. After security cleared the fight out, there was a huge space in the middle of the room. All of a sudden, an instrumental came on, everyone turned around to look at the stage, and he jumped right into the middle of the void. He jumped off the stage, which was about four-feet tall, over the kids who were in the front row. The crowd folded in around him. It was incredible, a fearless act of seizing the moment.\r\n\r\nGRG: Obviously not every performer can pull off something like that, to “seize the moment” as you put it.\r\n\r\nB+: I’ve seen it with Damien Marley too. Sometimes peoples’ creativity and intellectual strength allows them to carry moments and transform them. It’s a special thing, it doesn’t happen often. But it happened that night.\r\n\r\nGRG: You couldn’t have been expecting him to jump off the stage like that. With that in mind, how do you prepare for that, as a photographer taking live shots?\r\n\r\nB+: You can’t prepare, really. I’m just lucky to have been there to capture it. I think the photo is definitely a reminder about what’s possible in a live environment.  You have to be ready. There are 18 other pictures taken in about 15 seconds, and that is definitely the best one. In a lot of the other ones, Meth is completely lost, or you can’t tell what’s going on, or it’s just a blur. Then in one of them you can see him really well, but the action isn’t as great.\r\n\r\nGRG: From a technical standpoint, were you trying to make it blurry like that, to show the action?\r\n\r\nB+: I wasn’t trying to do that, no. It was a result of the action and then a combination of the flash and ambient light. \r\n\r\nGRG: When you look back on that image, what strikes you most?\r\n\r\nB+: I remember getting the film back and being floored. Thinking to myself, “That’s what this is about.” A shot like that can keep you inspired for the next 100 rolls full of good and not-so-good photos. That photo made the 40 previous nights’ shooting worth it, all those nights when I’d wait for the pictures to be developed and not have anything particularly great on there.\r\n\r\nGRG: Aside from the cover of [Brian Coleman’s] Check the Technique, where else was that photo used?\r\n\r\nB+: It may have been used for a contents page in Rap Pages or maybe an ad for the magazine back in the ‘90s, but not for anything major. It was just one of those shots that can slip through the cracks, even as much as you love it.\r\n\r\nGRG: Final thoughts or comments?\r\n\r\nB+: I believe there are a few members of the LA hip-hop underground in the frame of that shot, blurred. Tre from the Pharcyde, Lady of Rage, and maybe 1-2 more. That was one hell of a show and an incredible night.\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":35465484,"name":"XXL","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35467146,"name":"XL","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35467149,"name":"Large","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35467152,"name":"Medium","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112272522/-/BPLUS_Black_On_Model_CROPPED.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112272522/-/BPLUS_Black_On_Model_CROPPED.jpg","width":993,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112272462/-/METHOD_MAN_front_BLACK.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112272462/-/METHOD_MAN_front_BLACK.jpg","width":1000,"height":773},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112272558/-/Mens_Black_Shirt_Back_On_Model_CROPPED.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112272558/-/Mens_Black_Shirt_Back_On_Model_CROPPED.jpg","width":1000,"height":893}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5321787,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":11268768,"name":"Roller Derby “Uniondale, New York, 1974” MEN'S shirt (Black)","permalink":"uniondale-new-york-1974-roller-derby-men-s-shirt-black","position":5,"price":28.0,"default_price":28.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/uniondale-new-york-1974-roller-derby-men-s-shirt-black","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-20T17:13:01.000Z","description":"** ALSO AVAILABLE IN WOMEN'S (SEE SEPARATE PAGE) **\r\n\r\n\r\n100% SUPER-SOFT COTTON\r\n\r\nPremium screen-print: thin, durable and “breathable”\r\n\r\n[Screen printing by One Off Apparel]\r\n\r\nFIT: These are “fashion” fit, so if you are in-between sizes, go up a size instead of down.\r\n\r\n\r\nA percentage of profits from sales of this shirt will be donated to the following charities: \r\n\r\nThe Julian Center (Indianapolis).

I was a sports writer and photographer for the Darien News [Connecticut] at the time. A friend of mine was a video camera operator and he was shooting the match, so I tagged along. I wasn’t on assignment, it just sounded like I might be able to get some good pictures. I think I shot five rolls of film that day.\r\n\r\nGRG: What do you remember about the venue and what was going on?\r\n\r\nJV: It was a decent crowd, I remember thinking that they were pretty far back from the rink, actually. The people in the audience were pretty scary [laughs]. People were really into it. They were screaming and yelling the whole time. I thought the Roller Derby match was entertaining, but a lot of people took it more seriously. This was before big media coverage at most sporting events, I think there was probably only one other photographer there besides me. It was a lot more physical than I expected, definitely more so than roller derby you see today. Today they scale back the fights and violence. Back in those days it was also on a banked track, so that increased the speed. \r\n\r\nGRG: Did anything surprise you?\r\n\r\nJV: I guess I was surprised at how melodramatic everything was, especially the women’s roller derby teams [laughs]. It was over-the-top, similar to wrestling matches today. \r\n\r\nGRG: Technically were there any difficult aspects to shooting there that day?\r\n\r\nJV: Well, those were the days before auto-focus, of course. I might not have even had a motor drive on the camera. The only real rule was “Be Ready” [laughs].\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":35467833,"name":"XL","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35467836,"name":"Large","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35467839,"name":"Medium","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112271634/-/Roller_Derby_MENS_Black_On_Model_CROPPED.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112271634/-/Roller_Derby_MENS_Black_On_Model_CROPPED.jpg","width":914,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112271583/-/ROLLER_DERBY_front_BLACK.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112271583/-/ROLLER_DERBY_front_BLACK.jpg","width":957,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112271670/-/Mens_Black_Shirt_Back_On_Model_CROPPED.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112271670/-/Mens_Black_Shirt_Back_On_Model_CROPPED.jpg","width":1000,"height":893}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5321787,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":11268636,"name":"\"San Diego 1994\" [Antioch Arrow] MEN'S Shirt (Black)","permalink":"cameron-campbell-san-diego-1994-antioch-arrow-men-s-shirt-black","position":6,"price":28.0,"default_price":28.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cameron-campbell-san-diego-1994-antioch-arrow-men-s-shirt-black","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-20T17:06:44.000Z","description":"100% SUPER-SOFT COTTON\r\n\r\nPremium screen-print: thin, durable and “breathable”\r\n\r\n[Screen printing by One Off Apparel]\r\n\r\nFIT: These are “fashion” fit, so if you are in-between sizes, go up a size instead of down.\r\n\r\n\r\nA percentage of profits from sales of this shirt will be donated as a gift to Antioch Arrow guitarist Jeff Winterberg, who is currently based in Brooklyn, NY and is battling medulloblastoma, a rare form of brain cancer.\r\n\r\nFor more information on Jeff and his fight, visit: \r\n\r\nwww.facebook.com/PictureJeffCancerFree\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ&A WITH PHOTOGRAPHER CAMERON CAMPBELL:\r\n\r\nGood Road Goods: So, give us some memories you have about taking this photo. \r\n\r\nCameron Campbell: Originally I thought it was at a place called Café Mesopotamia, but I don't that's right. I'm not sure if the spot even had a name. It was on E Street. In San Diego in the early and mid-‘90s there weren’t a lot of venues to play in, so there were a bunch of smaller places like that. They never lasted too long, they’d fold and then bands would go somewhere else. It was the first time I had been there. I remember walking in and it was only about 15 feet wide, so it was a pretty tight space.\r\n\r\nGRG: The first time I saw this photo was in Anthony Pappalardo’s and Nathan Nedorostek’s \"Radio Silence\" book and aside from the image itself, I was intrigued by the photo credit: “Photo by Cameron Campbell, using Jeff Winterberg’s camera.” What was the deal with that?\r\n\r\nCC: That night my camera wasn’t working, I had this little Pentax ME Super. So Jeff said, “Just use mine.” He was the guitarist in the band so it’s not like he was going to be using it while they were playing.\r\n\r\nGRG: I know you don’t consider yourself a professional photographer, but how seriously were you about it back then?\r\n\r\nCC: I was treating it pretty seriously back then, actually. Jeff and I took photography classes at Palomar Community College, mostly just to use their darkroom. We’d go to shows and skate and shoot like 7 or 8 rolls a night.\r\n\r\nGRG: Jeff went on to do a lot of photography work [for more info, check out his excellent photography book \"Rat A Tat Tat Birds\"], what did you like about his style?\r\n\r\nCC: He had a different style than I did, and eventually I gravitated towards his way of shooting. He was all about saturation. Lots of contrast. I loved that. Crisp images, lots of detail. I always had the impression that Jeff listened to music through his camera lens. He always knew when to get a great shot because he was so in-tune with what the music was saying.\r\n\r\nGRG: So how did you get that particular shot of Antioch Arrow? It seems like you were up higher.\r\n\r\nCC: At those shows, they were really crowded and you’d get pushed around. Which is fine, unless you were taking pictures. The last thing you wanted is to get pushed from behind when you were shooting. And Antioch Arrow always went crazy when they played, plus they never just stood there and faced forward, they were always in motion. So I knew I didn’t want to be right in front of where they were playing. There was a ledge in the venue that was up higher, I guess during the day it would hold speakers or pieces of art or whatever. There were 3 or 4 other people up there, so I would lean over and extend my arm and just shoot. Two weeks later I developed the film and saw what I had.\r\n\r\nGRG: For those who aren’t familiar with Antioch, what would you say about them?\r\n\r\nCC: In the early ‘90s there were slower bands like 3 Mile Pilot and Sleep and then higher-energy groups like Nation of Ulysses, Born Against and Antioch Arrow. Antioch was very high-energy. You’d be so pumped up after a show that you’d just go and skate all night, until 2 or 3 AM. 30 or 40 minutes was all you needed from those guys, it was an insane experience and it always amped you up.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":35467395,"name":"XXL","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35467398,"name":"XL","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35467401,"name":"Large","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":35467404,"name":"Medium","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112272054/-/Antioch_Black_On_Model_CROPPED.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112272054/-/Antioch_Black_On_Model_CROPPED.jpg","width":827,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112271922/-/ANTIOCH_ARROW_front_BLACK.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112271922/-/ANTIOCH_ARROW_front_BLACK.jpg","width":1000,"height":773},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/112272162/-/Mens_Black_Shirt_Back_On_Model_CROPPED.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/112272162/-/Mens_Black_Shirt_Back_On_Model_CROPPED.jpg","width":1000,"height":893}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5321787,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":11268990,"name":"Roller Derby “Uniondale, New York, 1974” WOMEN'S shirt (Black)","permalink":"uniondale-new-york-1974-roller-derby-women-s-shirt-black","position":7,"price":28.0,"default_price":28.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/uniondale-new-york-1974-roller-derby-women-s-shirt-black","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-20T17:24:17.000Z","description":"** ALSO AVAILABLE IN MEN'S (SEE SEPARATE PAGE) **\r\n\r\n\r\n100% SUPER-SOFT COTTON\r\n\r\nPremium screen-print: thin, durable and “breathable”\r\n\r\n[Screen printing by One Off Apparel]\r\n\r\nWOMEN’S FIT: Fitted crew-neck.\r\n\r\n\r\nA percentage of profits from sales of this shirt will be donated to the following charities: \r\n\r\nThe Julian Center (Indianapolis).
