Larger sized bottles are available upon request - just ask us!\r\n\r\nHere is a useful list of just some of the things you can do with Essential Lavender Oil:\r\n\r\nAching Muscles\r\nIf youâve spent a back-breaking afternoon in the garden, jump into a lavender bath to soothe aches & pains away. Apply Epsom salts & a few drops of Lavender Oil to the bath and soak away the tension.\r\n\r\nAcne\r\nLavender is one of the most valuable oils for the treatment of acne, according to aromatherapists. âIt inhibits the bacteria that cause the skin infection, helps to re-balance the over-secretion of sebum, which the bacteria thrive on, and reduce scarringâ. Add a few drops of lavender oil to a plain cream sold by chemists and use as a moisturizer or cleanser.\r\n\r\nBugs & Bacteria\r\nFrench laboratory studies in the early 20th century showed that lavender is a powerful antibacterial in dilutions of 5 per cent or less it is lethal to bacteria that cause typhoid, TB & diphtheria. Combined with Lemon Balm, for its clinically tested anti-viral properties.\r\n\r\nBurns (minor)\r\nAfter you have cooled the area by immersing it in running cold water for 5 minutes, gently stroke on neat lavender oil. Pain relief is almost immediate, and burn usually heals without scarring.\r\n\r\nCuts & Wounds\r\nApply lavender oil to sooth pain, prevent bacterial infection and aid scar-free healing. Apply neat.\r\n\r\nEarache\r\nWarm a bottle of lavender oil in hot water for a minute or two, then gently massage a few drops into the skin around the ears and throat. For babies & small children, add 2-3 drops of the warmed oil to a little olive oil and massage in the same way.\r\n\r\nEczema\r\nStroke infused lavender oil (a few drops of lavender oil & carrier oil) into dry, itchy skinâsmall children will find this especially comforting or add a few drops of lavender oil to calamine lotion, shake before use.\r\n\r\nFatigue\r\nAdd 5 drops of lavender oil to a hot foot bath and relax while your feet soak in it. The soles of the feet are particularly porous, so lavender reaches your bloodstream very quickly, exerting its stimulating and soothing effects on various systems of your body.\r\n\r\nFevers\r\nFor babies or small children, sponge them down very gently with tepid water to which you have added a drop of lavender oil. Take care not to let them get chilled. This works for adults too.\r\n\r\nGiddy Spells, Faintness or Palpitations\r\nMake your own smelling saltsâsea salt , lavender oil, peppermint oil & basil oil.\r\n\r\nHeadache\r\nThe distilled water of Lavender (Hydrosol) Mist around your head, is refreshing and soothing. Alternatively, make a compress of a piece of cause or muslin soaked in icy cold water then sprinkled with a few drops of lavender oil and apply to the forehead, or massage a few drops into the forehead, temples and nape of the neck.\r\n\r\nInsomnia\r\nIn a number of small studies, elderly psychiatric patients have been shown to sleep better and be more alert during the day when their sleep medication is replaced with lavender oil either dropped on their pillows, or placed in a diffuser on the ward. To help to induce sleep, put 3 or 4 drops of lavender oil on your pillow. For babies, add 1 drop of lavender oil & geranium oil in carrier oil and massage into a babies back or a few drops in their bedtime bath.\r\n","options":[{"id":27916532,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87492782/-/IMG_3824.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87492782/-/IMG_3824.JPG","width":1000,"height":747}],"artists":[{"id":165656,"name":"The Lucky Zen Dog Organic Line","permalink":"the-lucky-zen-dog-organic-line","url":"/artist/the-lucky-zen-dog-organic-line"},{"id":225963,"name":"Heart and Soul","permalink":"heart-and-soul","url":"/artist/heart-and-soul"}],"categories":[{"id":4360781,"name":"Certified Organic Products","permalink":"certified-organic-products","url":"/category/certified-organic-products"},{"id":4359365,"name":"Essential Oils 100% Organic","permalink":"essential-oils-100-organic","url":"/category/essential-oils-100-organic"}]},{"id":8893676,"name":" Koala Bee Natural Soap by Australian Scent","permalink":"koala-bee-natural-soap-by-australian-scent","position":10,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/koala-bee-natural-soap-by-australian-scent","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-11T15:14:41.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":27905351,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87449318/-/koalabee-soap-australian-scent.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87449318/-/koalabee-soap-australian-scent.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87449342/-/australian-scent-soap_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87449342/-/australian-scent-soap_1.jpg","width":400,"height":260}],"artists":[{"id":118163,"name":"Australian Scent","permalink":"australian-scent","url":"/artist/australian-scent"}],"categories":[{"id":3154867,"name":"Body & Skin Products","permalink":"body-skin-products","url":"/category/body-skin-products"}]},{"id":8893592,"name":"Exfoliating Soap Pouches by Australian Scent","permalink":"exfoliating-soap-pouches-by-australian-scent","position":11,"price":14.0,"default_price":14.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/exfoliating-soap-pouches-by-australian-scent","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-11T15:08:53.000Z","description":"These amazing exfoliating bags are filled with slices and chips of all of the Australian Soaps - perfect in exfoliating your skin while moisturizing your skin simultaneously!","options":[{"id":27905192,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[],"artists":[{"id":118163,"name":"Australian Scent","permalink":"australian-scent","url":"/artist/australian-scent"}],"categories":[{"id":3154867,"name":"Body & Skin Products","permalink":"body-skin-products","url":"/category/body-skin-products"}]},{"id":8893526,"name":"Smooth Move Shaving Oil by Australian Scent","permalink":"smooth-move-shaving-oil-by-australian-scent","position":12,"price":24.0,"default_price":24.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/smooth-move-shaving-oil-by-australian-scent","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-11T15:04:09.000Z","description":"Use instead of shaving cream.

The gentle, soothing, and healing oil is perfect for cradle cap, diaper rash, chapped or chafed skin, bruises, and sore or inflamed muscles. The oil can be used alone, or incorporated into salves, massage oils, lip balms, ointments, creams, and lotions.\r\n\r\nOrganic Olive oil\r\nOrganic Calendula flowers\r\n\r\n1. Place Calendula flowers in a clean, dry glass jar. If using fresh Calendula, wilt for 12 hours to remove most of the moisture (too much moisture will cause the oil to go rancid) before adding to the jar. Pour olive oil into the jar, making sure to cover the flowers by at least 1â of oil so they will have space to expand. Stir well and cap the jar tightly.\r\n2. Place the jar in a warm, sunny windowsill and shake once or more per day.\r\n3. After 4-6 weeks, strain the herbs out using cheesecloth. Pour the infused oil into glass bottles and store in a cool dark place. \r\n\r\nHeat Method: I prefer to infuse oils utilizing the solar or folk method described above, but heat can be applied if you need the oil quickly. To prepare, follow step 1 from above, but place the Olive oil and Calendula flowers in an uncovered container. Warm over low heat at approximately 100 degrees F for at least 3-5 hours, the longer the better. A yogurt maker, double boiler, or inside the oven with a pilot light on are all effective ways to heat the oil, just make sure to check the temperature occasionally to ensure that the oil isnât getting too warm. Once the oil has infused, strain out the herbs using cheesecloth and package the infused oil into glass bottles.

Other tribes who used white sage include the Arapaho, Comanche, Gros Ventre, Creek, Navaho, Tewa, and Ute (Nickerson 1966, Carlson and Jones 1939, Hart 1976, Thwaites 1905, Denig 1855, Elmore 1944, Robbins et al. 1916, Chamberlin 1909).\r\n\r\nThe Dakota and other tribes used white sage tea for stomach troubles and many other ailments (Gilmore 1977). The Cheyenne used the crushed leaves as snuff for sinus attacks, nosebleeds, and headaches (Hart 1976). The Crow made a salve for use on sores by mixing white sage with neck-muscle fat (probably from buffalo) (Hart 1976). They used a strong tea as an astringent for eczema and as a deodorant and an antiperspirant for underarms and feet. The Kiowa made a bitter drink from white sage, which they used to reduce phlegm and to relieve a variety of lung and stomach complaints (Vestal and Shultes 1939). Usually, they chewed the stem and leaves and swallowed the juice.","options":[{"id":27771038,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86998301/-/IMG_3740.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86998301/-/IMG_3740.jpg","width":747,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86998385/-/IMG_3737.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86998385/-/IMG_3737.jpg","width":747,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86998577/-/IMG_3736.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86998577/-/IMG_3736.jpg","width":747,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86998625/-/IMG_3738.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86998625/-/IMG_3738.jpg","width":747,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/86998169/-/Salvia_apiana-2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/86998169/-/Salvia_apiana-2.jpg","width":700,"height":525}],"artists":[{"id":165656,"name":"The Lucky Zen Dog Organic Line","permalink":"the-lucky-zen-dog-organic-line","url":"/artist/the-lucky-zen-dog-organic-line"}],"categories":[{"id":4360781,"name":"Certified Organic Products","permalink":"certified-organic-products","url":"/category/certified-organic-products"},{"id":4359305,"name":"Herbs & Spice Blends - 100% Organic","permalink":"herbs-spice-blends-100-organic","url":"/category/herbs-spice-blends-100-organic"},{"id":2679653,"name":"Incense","permalink":"incense","url":"/category/incense"}]},{"id":6028265,"name":"Organic Bug Spray - Bugger Off by Australian Scent","permalink":"organic-bug-spray-bugger-off-by-australian-scent","position":28,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/organic-bug-spray-bugger-off-by-australian-scent","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-25T20:19:09.000Z","description":"We at Australian Scent are very proud to offer to you an all natural insect repellent that really works.
