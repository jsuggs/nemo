Approximate Tuesday is touching, soulful and genuine.\r\n\r\nShannon Lynette, author of Lady on a Wire and editor at Lady Chaos Press\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSusie has a special way of writing with lovely, delicate language while maintaining power, strength, and meaning in each poem. Approximate Tuesday is filled with wisdom, growth, an appreciation for life and the earth, and a wide array of feelings of the human experience. Her poems are honest, intimate, and delivered with a unique voice.\r\n\r\nHeather Minette, author of Rooftops and Other Poems\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSusan's poems radiate with the beauty of the natural world. She captures and honors our harmonies and disharmonies--the sense of wonderment of a life lived in perpetual discovery, the sense of reverence in the understanding that we are subject to the caprices of some much larger force of which the natural world is only a shroud through which the viewer can access the sacred. Her poems are composed with the seeming ease and loquacity of a Walt Whitman poem, yet like a Jane Kenyon poem they are content to rest in the silence of open spaces, where they contemplate (and struggle to accept) the fact of our impermanence.\r\n \r\nBrian Le Lay\r\nWriter and Editor at Electric Windmill Press\r\n\r\nSample Poems\r\n\r\nBack to its source\r\n\r\nThe coyotes all begin at once\r\nas if they hear some sort of\r\ninternal, animalistic call to prayer.\r\n\r\nIn this place the \r\nrain and sun have \r\nboth done their work,\r\ndrying out and \r\nmaking wet again.\r\n\r\nBut being washed does not \r\nalways make a thing clean,\r\nand anyway I don’t think\r\nI want to sit here anymore\r\n\r\nlearning to live with  \r\nless and less water\r\nwhile others seem \r\nto drink their fill.\r\n\r\nIn the kitchen my mother hands me\r\na stack of my grandfather’s poems \r\nand I wish not only my 10 year \r\nold self had known him.\r\n\r\nBut the reading \r\nbrings understanding\r\n\r\nand I know that even \r\nwith our irregular trajectory\r\neach drop will eventually \r\nlead us back to its source.\r\n\r\nWinter days \r\n\r\nDarkness comes so early lately\r\nI don’t know what to make \r\nof nights and days.\r\nTime passes oddly.\r\nSlowly and then suddenly.\r\n\r\nI write in bed\r\nunder soft lamplight\r\ninstead of repotting\r\nthe plants in my \r\nbarefeet.\r\n\r\nI sit beside a lamp \r\nat my work table,\r\nsawing over ink and copper\r\nwith a color so warm\r\nI can almost warm \r\nmy hands by it.\r\n\r\nYesterday I paid a man \r\nto stick needles in me.\r\nI suppose we all have to \r\nbelieve in something.\r\n\r\nBrains are private places,\r\ngenerally,\r\nbut sometimes \r\nI like to invite \r\nsomeone \r\ninto mine.\r\n\r\nThe Optimist\r\n\r\nThe light on \r\nthe back porch \r\nis flickering \r\nwhen we \r\ncome in \r\nfrom our walk.\r\n\r\nThe cat looks up \r\nlazily from his \r\ntower.\r\n\r\nI am humbled \r\nby the sky and \r\nthe moon and \r\npossibilities of my \r\nown body. \r\n\r\nThere is magic \r\nin the things \r\nthey can do.\r\n\r\nA woman is\r\nbuilt to grow \r\na child, so what \r\nis she to do if \r\nthat part of her \r\nis broken?\r\n\r\nI am fragmented.\r\n\r\nThe optimist in me \r\nmay be just as \r\nwrong  as the  \r\npessimist, but \r\nthe optimist\r\nhalf is happier.\r\n\f\r\n","options":[{"id":45273075,"name":"Copy Signed by Writer","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":45282573,"name":"Unsigned Copy","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125500902/-/AT.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125500902/-/AT.JPG","width":1440,"height":1440}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5619372,"name":"Book","permalink":"book","url":"/category/book"},{"id":5619393,"name":"Blue Hour Press","permalink":"blue-hour-press","url":"/category/blue-hour-press"},{"id":5619696,"name":"Single Author Collection","permalink":"single-author-collection","url":"/category/single-author-collection"}]},{"id":13113594,"name":"Rooftops and Other Poems by Heather Minette","permalink":"rooftops-and-other-poems-by-heather-minette","position":2,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rooftops-and-other-poems-by-heather-minette","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-08-22T17:29:53.000Z","description":"Please Contact Blue Hour Press to request a copy signed by Heather Minette\r\n<a href=\"http://bluehourpressbookstore.bigcartel.com/contact/\">Contact Us</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRooftops and Other Poems by Heather Minette is a poetry collection honestly written to discover a deeper understanding of her life experience traveling, and finally finding a loving home.

It is a 158 page book of stories in the form of poems that are based on real life experience. Philip was born in South Africa and spent time in Scotland and England. During his travels, he encountered various people from the underdog transient begging on the corner to a sexy young woman in a high class grocery store. He tells their stories in a deserving tone of love or loathing. In this series, you will read how the Author finally finds true love after years of ambling aimlessly. He has now found love and believes in something once again. This book is a lifetime of stories by a lost man who has finally been found. Beware, his writing is highly addictive.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\n\r\nPhilip Vermaas was born to an actor and stage manager who were touring a play through the otherwise artistically barren towns of the Orange Free State in early 1970s South Africa. \r\n\r\nFor the first months of his life he lived in a cardboard box among misfit actors and similarly afflicted crew. They called him King Fred. He later despised school and, when finished, refused to participate in any formal tertiary education. Instead he sought education through trial and error. \r\n\r\nHe's worked as an actor, waiter, hotel night manager, gym instructor, bouncer, bodyguard, \r\nconstruction worker, dish washer, barman, club manager, medical guinea pig, photographer, graphic designer, screenwriter, copywriter, editor and other things too forgettable to be recalled. \r\n\r\nHe has traveled a bit and spent years in Scotland and a couple in England. Now, through twists of fate, he's holed up in a cottage in semi-rural Johannesburg with his true love while he thinks, writes, smokes and holds her close.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the book:\r\n\r\nThe narrative style of Philip Vermass’ collection, ‘Better Cigarettes’, is the perfect form for the range of his experiences and encounters, some of them almost amounting to stories. They contain the fresh, transient intimacies of an itinerant together with the enduring loves and attachments of a life lived. \r\n\r\nHis poems capture a sense of what it is like to be born alone in the world, to reach out, to embrace the flaws of experiences and relationships which ultimately result in the realization of their beauty. Some of his poems are truly touching (‘I Cried Like a Man’) and some seemingly quite desolate (‘My Head of Cork’) but the signature poem, ‘Better Cigarettes’, offers a pervading hope in spite of all this. \r\n\r\nPhilip Vermass has produced a captivating and downright addictive collection of poems which include some of the best cat poems I have read. In his poem, ‘Between Free and Freer’, he chooses life and this book amounts to the manuscript of his reasoning. He has lived. You should read.\r\n\r\nGillian Prew, author of \"The Idea of Wings\"\r\n\r\nThe book itself measures approx 6x8 and is perfect bound with a paper back cover. \r\nIt has high quality internal paper and was professionally printed LOCALLY.\r\nIt boasts 157 pages of Philips fantastic poetry.\r\n\r\nThis is a Blue Hour Press publication and was edited and designed by Moriah LaChapell and Susan Sweetland Garay","options":[{"id":49770117,"name":"Default","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/120890754/-/BCOP.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/120890754/-/BCOP.jpg","width":612,"height":612}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5619372,"name":"Book","permalink":"book","url":"/category/book"},{"id":5619393,"name":"Blue Hour Press","permalink":"blue-hour-press","url":"/category/blue-hour-press"},{"id":5619696,"name":"Single Author Collection","permalink":"single-author-collection","url":"/category/single-author-collection"}]},{"id":11987379,"name":"The Blue Hour Anthology Volume One","permalink":"the-blue-hour-anthology-volume-one","position":5,"price":13.0,"default_price":13.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-blue-hour-anthology-volume-one","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-06-24T19:27:15.000Z","description":"The Blue Hour Anthology is 155 pages of poetry, prose, photographs, painting, and sculpture.
