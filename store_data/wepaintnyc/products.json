This phrase means to be aware of the dangers & risks that come with this lifestyle. Graffiti may result in arrest, conviction, & even time in prison. Late nights put you in risks of the dangers of the street. You must always have an eye open & be aware of your surroundings. You never know who is watching. Who will try to hurt you. Everything from law enforcement, thugs, business owners, & canary pedestrians can result in immediate restraint.

The more art you create the more you are just feeding this monster that will constantly need to be fed. You always have to keep relevance & creation in effect. The monster symbolizes the City of New York. The cactuses symbolize the hardness of the law, & if you cut through it you will be able to quench your thirst. The desert symbolises the wide range of canvas you have to use in this city. Other depiction's as the \"Chanel\" print read \"CG\" on the bandana which stands for CowGirl & Cupcake Girl.
