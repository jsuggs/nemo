We publicize Indigenous Peoples' issues through our award-winning publications; we mount letter-writing campaigns and other advocacy efforts to stop environmental destruction and abuses of Native Peoples' rights; and we work on the ground in Indigenous communities, always at their invitation. Our board of directors includes some of the world's preeminent Indigenous leaders, and our staff, headed by Navajo/Santa Clara Tewa environmental expert Suzanne Benally, includes both Indigenous and non-Indigenous members. Our headquarters is in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and we have satellite offices in Guatemala and Colorado. Cultural Survival has consultative status with the United Nations.\r\n\r\nThe most important member of our team is you. None of our work would be possible without our members.
