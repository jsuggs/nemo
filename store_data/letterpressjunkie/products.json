Do you love to stare at the alphabet all day long? Do you find the slight imperfections of the letterpress printing process truly satisfying? With these fun colored alphabet notecards, you can surprise three friends with tangible typography and say \"Hi\" at the same time.\r\n\r\nPlease note that you will not find perfection here. These cards were printed using vintage moveable type. The type has been dinged and chipped through the course of time, and those slight imperfections show in the prints. If that's your cup of tea, then these cards are for you. =)\r\n\r\nThis is a set of 3 letterpress notecards.\r\n\r\nI currently have more in stock than may be listed.
