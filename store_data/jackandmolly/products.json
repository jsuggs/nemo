Art mediums are implemented like india ink, watercolor, charcoal or built digitally. \r\n\r\n<b>How does the process for a pre-made logo work?</b>\r\n\r\n1. After the purchase is made, simply <a href=\"mailto:hello@jackandmollycreative.com\">email us</a> and write out exactly how you want your company name to appear. You may also change the <a href=\"http://www.jack-and-molly.com/file_hosting/color_palette.jpg\" TARGET=\"_blank\">color palette</a> if you so choose.\r\n\r\n(Changing the typography to a different font style is not included in a standard purchase but is available as an <a href=\"http://www.jackandmollycreative.com/product/pre-made-logo-font-change\" TARGET=\"_blank\"> add-on</a>.)\r\n\r\n2. The design will be customized and a proof will be emailed to you for approval.\r\n\r\nYou have the choice of making 3 rounds of revisions (a \"round\" means a list of changes.) What happens if 3 revisions are applied and the design still needs a few tweaks? No problem. Each additional revision for pre-made logos is a flat rate of $20.\r\n\r\n3. Once the design receives client approval, all of the final files will be submitted to you via email with an instruction sheet explaining each file type.\r\n\r\nTo read more about what the creative process involves, the turnaround time for the project and more, please read over the <a href=\"http://www.jack-and-molly.com/file_hosting/faqs.pdf\">J+M FAQs</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jack-and-molly.com/file_hosting/polices.pdf\">Policies</a>.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like other business collateral pieces designed, check out our <a href=\"http://www.jack-and-molly.com/file_hosting/addon_pricing.pdf\"  TARGET=\"_blank\"\">Add-On Pricing</a>.\r\n\r\n<b>What next?</b>\r\nIn one swift glance, your logo should be recognizable, create a lasting impression and attract customers.
