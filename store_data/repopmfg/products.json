Rings weigh 1.3 oz. \r\nAvailable In S ( US 8 ) M ( 9.5 ) L ( 11 ) \r\nplease ask about custom sizing\r\n \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\nThe history of these rings: After the Mexican Civil War the peso was devalued. So craftsmen started melting down the worthless pesos and making them into big solid rings that were never meant to be high fashion jewelry.\r\n \r\nThen as the American Motorcycle \"Clubs\" in the 40's & 50's traveled down to Mexican border towns, such as Juarez, Mexicali, Tecate and Tijuana, they discovered these souvenir rings for about five dollars.
