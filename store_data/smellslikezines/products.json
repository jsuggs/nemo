Emily 'that Smelly Kid' has just returned to Australia from a year long travel adventure in the Phillipines, and restocked her infamous and hugely popular Gutterslug #1 \r\n\r\n! Write to her, meet up on her adventures around Oz and buy this girl a beer, to here a story you won't soon forget.\r\n\r\nRewind back a few years and read Gutterslug #1. From Microcosm \"Gutterslug is a perzine about Emily's time living as a teenage punk, in both youth and adult shelters in Australia. Her experiences range from inspirational talks with other women in the shelter, to violent confrontations in the hallways. Emily tells of being sick in the shelter, and of the moment she realised the staff on duty might not care what happened to them. She also gets free tickets from a fellow zine-writer and attends and reviews a Good Charlotte show. The review, although critical, is pretty sweet and generous. The saddest piece of writing is Emily's story of another girl's attempt at suicide. It's hard to read parts of this zine, since it deals with some heavy topics, but Emily conveys her experiences honestly and earnestly. \" \r\n\r\nIssue #2 continues the adventures around Australia in a massive way.
