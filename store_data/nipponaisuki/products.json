Inari had also become the patron of blacksmiths and the protector of warriors. She is also believed to be the patron of fox spirits who act as her messengers.\r\nThe calligraphy created exclusively for the artwork is a collaboration with the skillful calligrapher Hiroko Fukuda of art project Wakoshi, who creates her own style of kawaii kanji.\r\n\r\nThe main Kanji message within translation limits reads\r\n\"Inari\" \r\n\"Good things from heaven\r\nGood things from earth\r\nPeople's easiness\"\r\n\r\nThis is a unique artwork piece with very deep and spiritual undertones.\r\n\r\nThe original piece is created using mix media on canvas, that uses special iridescent
