They are a 3D shape and remind me of a scroll like chandelier. The metal used is copper that has been darkened to black. The copper does peek through in some very small areas, it gives the overall piece a very urban chic look. Your earrings will be made to order just as pictured. Please allow 1 business day for me to make yours especially for you. They may vary very slighty than pictured, not by much. I have made a few of these and can recreate them easily. \r\n\r\nThey are so light weight and will not stretch your earlobes.\r\n\r\nThe finished earrings hang on darkened kidney wires and measure 2 1/4\" long by 1 1/8\" wide and 3/16\" deep. To give you a better idea of sizing. The swirl is larger than a US quarter.\r\n\r\nAs with all my items, yours will come in its own hand embellished keepsake container. All ready for gift giving, even if that gift is for yourself.\r\n\r\nThank you.

These particular ones are in the shade of white. I have added a very light dusting of a opalescent pink pigment. The result is a subtle shimmer which coordinates well with the pale pink pearl in the center. It give the earring and overall cohesiveness. I have also added a linen texture to the flower petals for a more organic feel. The petals are sculpted around a pale pink freshwater pearl. They hang from handmade copper earwires. I do have longer kidney wires if you would prefer a more dramatic drop earring, just let me know (brass or copper). I can easily swap them out for you. Simply make a note of it in your message to seller.\r\n\r\nThe finished earrings measure just under 1 1/2\" long by 1/2\" wide. The small flowers measure 1/2\" long by 1/2\" wide.

Another way of saying death is inevitable. The necklace features an enameled high gloss black Swallow or Sparrow bird, filigree findings, a petite vintage watch face, midnight blue metallic swarovski crystals, a sterling silver connector and sterling silver chain. The whole look of the necklace is asymeterical and aged. There is a decayed or melancholy feel to piece.\r\n\r\nThe finished necklace measures just over 21\".

I can't get enough of them. I recently was at my local supply shop and found this centerpiece. I HAD to HAVE IT! It looks like an antique chandelier. This necklace is very big and bold. It is not for the faint of heart. \r\n\r\nI have added about 3 feet of aged brass chain to drape from different points on the centerpiece. The whole piece is stationery so that you do not have to worry about fiddling with the necklace after you put it on. The chain is a large enough link (5mm) that you can attach the brass lobster clasp at any point to create the desired length up to 16\" neck. The centerpiece measures 4\" to include the chain drapes. I have tried this beauty on with a plunging neckline dress and I was instantly in lust with it! Luckily I have the supplies to make a few more! I will have to have one for myself!\r\n\r\nThere is a microfaceted black Onyx briolette suspended from the bottom of the Chandelier nestled between the draping brass chains.\r\n\r\nAs with all my creations. Your lovely item will be packaged in a custom package.
