Taking influence from bands such as Life Long Tragedy, MLIW and American Nightmare, Some Mistakes continues pushing the boundaries on heart-wrenching hardcore with their first effort on Heart In Hand Records.\"\r\n\r\nTracks:\r\nA Side\r\n1)\r\n2)\r\nB Side\r\n3)\r\n4)\r\n\r\nHIH008","options":[{"id":11831024,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/34254498/-/HIHEPFRONT2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/34254498/-/HIHEPFRONT2.jpg","width":735,"height":735}],"artists":[{"id":50509,"name":"Some Mistakes","permalink":"some-mistakes","url":"/artist/some-mistakes"}],"categories":[{"id":161164,"name":"7\" Vinyl","permalink":"7-vinyl","url":"/category/7-vinyl"}]},{"id":2579502,"name":"FEDUP.

When i first looked at it from a quick glance it was not all to appealing, the name did not really stick and i wasn’t to into the artwork. So after a while of it just sitting on my desk i finally put this record on and was shocked when the first song “Pulling Teeth” came in. The bass at the beginning sounds solid and the ending of the song was very catchy. The vocals are at a more mid range style and sound great with the feel of the entire band. Again like most bands from Cali, these guys are very fast and aggressive but with a melodic sound to them. The guitar parts as well as the tone are unique and were very appealing to my ears. My favorite tracks off this record would be “Lovers”, “Pulling Teeth” and “Ghost Town”. The first riff in “Ghost Town” almost sounds to me like a blues lick but played by a punk kid. I guess you should never judge a book by its cover, this is a very good debut EP, i hope this band sticks around long enough to write some more material, stay away from the trends, create your own style.\r\n\r\nhttp://newnoisezine.wordpress.com/\r\n","options":[{"id":873202,"name":"Orange(200)","price":3.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":909644,"name":"black(150)","price":3.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1444977/-/UYHS_7in_FRONTCOVER_FINAL.pdf-2.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1444977/-/UYHS_7in_FRONTCOVER_FINAL.pdf-2.png","width":613,"height":592}],"artists":[{"id":5085,"name":"Until Your Heart Stops","permalink":"until-your-heart-stops","url":"/artist/until-your-heart-stops"}],"categories":[{"id":270787,"name":"On Sale","permalink":"on-sale","url":"/category/on-sale"},{"id":311170,"name":"Monthly SALE","permalink":"monthly-sale","url":"/category/monthly-sale"},{"id":161164,"name":"7\" Vinyl","permalink":"7-vinyl","url":"/category/7-vinyl"}]},{"id":224314,"name":"At Our Heels-S/T 7\" + Digital Download","permalink":"at-our-heels-s-t-7-digital-download","position":5,"price":3.0,"default_price":3.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/at-our-heels-s-t-7-digital-download","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2009-01-27T06:08:43.000Z","description":"At Our Heels-S/T 7\"\r\ncomes with a Digital Download \r\n\r\n\r\nTrack List\r\n1985\r\nMorning\r\nBlack Out\r\nCuffin Stiffers\r\nCold Season\r\nEpithaph\r\n\r\nHIH003\r\nAt Our Heels is yet another in the ever growing list of bands to emerge from the Bay Area's excellent hardcore scene. Alex Pulisci began piecing together what would come to be At Our Heels following the breakup of Love, Hope and Fear. Musically the group treads similar water, fast-paced hardcore with a rock swagger.\r\n\r\nPulisci, who enlists the drumming of Ben Murray of Light this City/Heartsounds to help write the material, has put six tracks of frantic and blistering hardcore to wax on this debut 7” release (which comes with a digital copy too). Opener “1985” is a scorching display of modern hardcore. “Coffin Stuffers” boasts a bit more of a retro hardcore sound compared to the rest of the material. “Epitaph” is easily the best work on the 7” - the guitar riffs are awesome and the breakdown seals the deal. Not only is the music stellar, the artwork rules too - props to the Wolf Brothers for their work.\r\n\r\nIf you're a fan of American Nightmare, The Suicide File, or This is Hell you should enjoy what At Our Heels are doing. Now if we can get a full-time lineup and get them touring, they'd be huge in no time.","options":[{"id":973506,"name":"Black","price":3.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":973534,"name":"Blue/Green Swirl","price":3.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.5,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/1584825/-/PRINT_READY_7inch_LAYOUT-2.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/1584825/-/PRINT_READY_7inch_LAYOUT-2.JPG","width":456,"height":449}],"artists":[{"id":5808,"name":"At Our Heels","permalink":"at-our-heels","url":"/artist/at-our-heels"}],"categories":[{"id":270787,"name":"On Sale","permalink":"on-sale","url":"/category/on-sale"},{"id":311170,"name":"Monthly SALE","permalink":"monthly-sale","url":"/category/monthly-sale"},{"id":161164,"name":"7\" Vinyl","permalink":"7-vinyl","url":"/category/7-vinyl"}]}]
