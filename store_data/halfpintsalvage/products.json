Relive the days of miraculous car jumps over houses and creeks or pretend you're being chased by Roscoe P. Coltrane!\r\n\r\nFeatures x3 General E. Lees (the '69 Dodge Charger driven by Bo and Luke), x2 Hazzard County police cruisers, Daisy Duke's Jeep and Boss Hogg's Cadillac. 7 cars total.\r\n\r\nAll cars are in decent shape with normal wear and tear throughout. Some have a bit more wear than their counterparts. No missing wheels or broken parts though. One of the Dodge Chargers is in better shape than the others, as the Confederate flag graphics are clearer. Same goes with one of the police cruisers.\r\n\r\nDaisy Duke's Jeep and Boss Hogg's Caddy are both in great shape with normal wear and tear around the front and back fenders. The logo on the Jeep is still quite nice. And the animal horns on the hood of Boss Hogg's Caddy are still attached!\r\n\r\nThe bottom of each car is marked \"Ertl Company, Dyersville IA, Made in Hong Kong\". Each car is from 1980-81.\r\n\r\n**This item is only available through our Big Cartel store.**\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for more Hot Wheels, Matchbox or other vintage diecast cars and accessories, be sure to check out my <a href=\"http://halfpintsalvage.etsy.com\" target=\"blank\">Etsy shop</a>!","options":[{"id":29817231,"name":"Default","price":27.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/108251115/-/DOH2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/108251115/-/DOH2.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4661351,"name":"Hot Wheels, Matchbox & Other Diecast Cars","permalink":"hot-wheels-matchbox-other-diecast-cars","url":"/category/hot-wheels-matchbox-other-diecast-cars"}]},{"id":9354218,"name":"Pop Culture / 80s, Set of Books - Michael Jackson, Mr. T, Garfield, Gremlins & more","permalink":"pop-culture-80s-set-of-books-michael-jackson-mr-t-garfield-gremlins-more","position":5,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/pop-culture-80s-set-of-books-michael-jackson-mr-t-garfield-gremlins-more","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-02-06T22:31:05.000Z","description":"Totally rad set of 1980s books...it's like a Trivial Pursuit booty of awesomeness!
