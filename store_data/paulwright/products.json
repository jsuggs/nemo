There's nothing more refreshing than the coloristic lifestyle that varies and defines the city and beaches. Paul Wright's music is no different. With his catchy hooks and renaissance-esque guitar style, you will soon find yourself singing along to his songs. More than that, these particular songs are tales depicted from a book that P. Wright is writing called \"Diego's Diary\".
