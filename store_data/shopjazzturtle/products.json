It's one of my most favorite pieces!!\r\n\r\nThe shawl measures at 17\" wide and 6 ft 6\" with fringe-\r\n6 ft 6\" without fringe. \r\n\r\nThe warp is HABU stainless steel/silk yarn- it's very thin, but very strong. It perfectly holds the art yarn.  \r\n\r\nThe weft is 5 different handspun art yarns, utilizing 3 different spinning techiniques- chain ply, singles and corespun.  All the yarns have a black alpaca base with pops of rainbow bits and bobs of color and lots of sparkle.  I wove very lightly, so there's lots of space within the weft. As I wove, I added tufts of sari silk waste, tangles of sari silk threads and banana silk threads, and lengths of batik cotton and sari silk ribbon.\r\n\r\nFor more photos see my flickr site-\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/jazzturtle/\r\n\r\nThis shawl is very soft and has amazing drape. It will certainly be the statement piece of your season. It will look amazing with a gray or black coat, or wrapped around your shoulders with a tshirt and jeans.\r\n\r\n***************************\r\nI try to accurately describe the colors and texture of the yarn, but please be aware that computer monitors vary in color display.\r\n\r\nHand Wash Only / Lay flat to dry\r\nSmoke Free, kitty friendly home\r\n\r\nIf this is a gift, and it's going to an address OTHER than what's provided by paypal, please include the address you'd like me to use, along with a note to the recipient.

It's really amazing!! I wove it on my Ashford loom, from yarn I corespun myself.\r\n\r\nThe shawl measures at 17\" wide and 7 ft 6\" with fringe-\r\n6 ft 6\" without fringe. The warp is a soft silk/bamboo yarn, in black. The weft is handspun corespun yarn that I spun from some soft and sparkly roving in shades of black and turquoise. The fibers include alpaca, silk, bamboo, merino and loads of sparkle, I spun 2 different yarns.. one smoother and super sparkly, and one that has a shiny turquoise lurex wrap. I then wove sections of the yarn in random lengths for a wonderful subtle striping effect.\r\n\r\nThis shawl is very soft and has amazing drape. It will certainly be the statement piece of your season. It will look amazing with a gray or black coat, or wrapped around your shoulders with a tshirt and jeans.\r\n\r\n***************************\r\nI try to accurately describe the colors and texture of the yarn, but please be aware that computer monitors vary in color display.\r\n\r\nHand Wash Only / Lay flat to dry\r\nSmoke Free, kitty friendly home\r\n\r\nIf this is a gift, and it's going to an address OTHER than what's provided by paypal, please include the address you'd like me to use, along with a note to the recipient.
