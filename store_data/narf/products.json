Ever since we first trekked out to the Pixel Palace (RIP) and had our skulls redefined, the 92501 crew have struck us as maybe the truest keepers of the So-Cal house party bombing freak-wave flame. The scene&#8217;s since changed of course, but these two bands were/are the kings of old-school Inland Empire radicalism. Quem Quaeritis are no more, sadly, but the trio&#8217;s jams here show beyond a shadow of a doubt why they fucking ruled. Jesus-bent weird-hop, Laker boat free-jazz, and post-political tent spiritualism mesh into a holy trinity of lunatic Americana. No genres, no rules, spring break freedom turned inside out. Child Pornography have been rocking/annoying west coasters since nearly 9/11, and their game still ain&#8217;t up. Nine spazzy rants of Suicide-on-pixie-sticks Casio-babble, dumb-wave guitar shred, and helium-keyed stream of consciousness word barf. Enough outsider vibes and confusing nonsense to irritate even the stone-chillest board-short bro.

All my experimental bands have a message,&#8221; Child Pornography responded, &#8220;Our message is, Buy Our Albums.&#8221; The Beatles, Child Pornography&#8217;s second album will inevitably make people ask, &#8220;Why does their album art look just like the Beatles&#8217; white album?&#8221; and there is no answer. At least that we are giving. So, to those strong enough to surmount these ancient riddles of cosmic meaning, we present Child Pornography&#8217;s 2nd album &#8211; another barage of blown out casio punk, whiny vocals, and dissonant toy-like guitars. Opening for bands like the Moving Units with an &#8220;I guess this is a good match&#8221; attitude, meanwhile being considered a noise act by noise musicians themselves, Child Pornography don&#8217;t baffle the Rolling Stones who know that CP are their long lost children. You know, the same &#8211; but different. Unlike those Jet Stroke bands which are The Same, yet The Same. For in your face excitement on the dance floor, there is only one band aimed at both your hips and your face, the Beatles.\n\n","options":[{"id":16242,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/9101/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/9101/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":8736,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"}]},{"id":4914,"name":"CP+SEW W/GIRLS 7\"","permalink":"cp-sew-w-girls-7","position":4,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cp-sew-w-girls-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2006-09-21T07:54:03.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":16243,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/9102/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/9102/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":8735,"name":"VINYL","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]},{"id":4915,"name":"CP+PLEASEYPLEASE 7\"","permalink":"cp-pleaseyplease-7","position":5,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cp-pleaseyplease-7","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2006-09-21T07:56:32.000Z","description":"Songs:\nFuck the Reverb1&#38;2\nReleased on Silencio Recordings.\n\n","options":[{"id":16244,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/9103/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/9103/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":8735,"name":"VINYL","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"}]}]
