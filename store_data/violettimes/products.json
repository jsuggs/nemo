This fine new album on Hairy Spider Legs is further proof and we're ecstatic to help distribute copies far and wide.  Great stuff, kinda like if the Shaggs grew up to make an LSD Jesus LP on ESP-Disk while in Amsterdam, like a funhouse mirror version of a Folkways surf group.","options":[{"id":47020104,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":21.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126752433/-/the_cherry_blossoms-live_in_amsterdam-500x.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126752433/-/the_cherry_blossoms-live_in_amsterdam-500x.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[{"id":245169,"name":"The Cherry Blossoms","permalink":"the-cherry-blossoms","url":"/artist/the-cherry-blossoms"}],"categories":[{"id":5989227,"name":"Records","permalink":"records","url":"/category/records"}]},{"id":13751772,"name":"The Blimp - Not Beer 12\" EP","permalink":"the-blimp-not-beer-12-ep","position":2,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-blimp-not-beer-12-ep","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-09-24T05:10:17.000Z","description":"12\" vinyl only EP w/ pro-printed cover and inner sleeve, recorded by Justin Higgins at Old Standard Sound in Portland, Oregon. 4 songs on a one-sided record.\r\n\r\nRIYL: Mirrors, Captain Beefheart and His Magic Band, The Hunches, good music\r\n\r\nThe Blimp soars beyond mere caveman crunch evident in passing, ferociously ripping thru the past and any kind of perceived influences, providing the mass ear w/ a clatterist cacophony of sound/s for now times and beyond.
