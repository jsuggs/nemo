I’ve simplified the classic technique for Tunisian crochet, and added dozens of photos to this booklet to take you step-by-step through the process. Making Tunisian entrelac is quite addicting! Once you start you won’t want to stop.\r\n\r\nWith my methods, you can make afghans or other projects of any width without a long starting chain. Entrelac is also great for scrap projects with any yarn.\r\n\r\nThis booklet includes instructions and step-by-step photos for three variations of Tunisian entrelac. All versions are worked from the front; work is not turned.\r\n\r\nPlum Perfect Afghan is made with whole entrelac blocks resulting in zig-zag edges. Fancy Pillow is made in the same manner as the afghan, except it is finished with fill-in triangles on all the edges to create straight edges. Beautiful Baby Afghan is made with end triangles worked as a part of every other row, creating straight sides. Fill-in triangles on ends of afghan are added last.\r\n\r\nAlthough the projects in this book were designed to be made with large Tunisian hooks (Size L-P), the technique will work as beautifully with any size Tunisian hook. Indeed, since there are only a few loops of your work on the shaft of your hook at any given time, Tunisian entrelac can be worked with regular crochet hooks. This booklet is a fabulous primer guide to Tunisian entrelac, no matter what yarn or hook you prefer to use.\r\n\r\n**NOTE** this is a crochet pattern, not the finished articles","options":[{"id":44262576,"name":"Default","price":7.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124870668/-/CB14100_Cover-Entrelac_4075_v8_web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124870668/-/CB14100_Cover-Entrelac_4075_v8_web.jpg","width":1200,"height":1029},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124871148/-/2262534966_a88fb35c48_z.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124871148/-/2262534966_a88fb35c48_z.jpg","width":331,"height":240},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124871232/-/2261764627_30c6e22118_z.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124871232/-/2261764627_30c6e22118_z.jpg","width":312,"height":228},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124871247/-/2261764805_096069eb78_z.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124871247/-/2261764805_096069eb78_z.jpg","width":245,"height":245}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6269544,"name":"Tunisian Crochet and Entrelac","permalink":"tunisian-crochet-and-entrelac","url":"/category/tunisian-crochet-and-entrelac"}]},{"id":13990503,"name":"Kimberli Jacket pdf","permalink":"kimberli-jacket-pdf","position":12,"price":7.99,"default_price":7.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kimberli-jacket-pdf","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-05T16:19:38.000Z","description":"This lovely jacket has many options! Designed with a beautiful, yet understated and uncomplicated stitch pattern, Kimberli can be crocheted with any yarn and appropriate hook size, with straight or swing shaping. Choose from several trim styles—two options of lace trim around all edges, or either of the lace trim options around only the bottom and sleeves with a very narrow plain edge along fronts and neck edge.\r\n\r\nClassic, versatile design\r\n\r\nAny combination of options adds up to fun stitching and easy-fitting results. This classic garment is one you may want to make several times—depending on your choice of yarn and options chosen, Kimberli is equally beautiful for dressy, professional and casual outfits. It's a really versatile pattern that works up into a beautiful garment that anyone, even those who don't prefer busier crocheted lace patterns, will love to wear.\r\n\r\nTop-down construction\r\n\r\nKimberli is worked from the top down. You choose your trim option in advance, then crochet from the outset to accommodate your chosen edging for perfect fit and coverage. Top down construction means no seams to sew—when you're finished crocheting, just weave in the ends, add one or more buttons if you wish, and you're done!\r\n\r\nSpecific instructions and schematics are given to make garments for sizes S-4X; however, this design really shines when used as a fit-as-you-go design and can be custom fitted to ANY size literally from baby to super-plus adult. This is especially well-suited for making pretty little sweaters for any size tween girls—just use bust size in the chart below to help you estimate yarn amounts needed, and custom fit as you crochet, either trying the garment on or using a few measurements from a good-fitting existing garment.\r\n\r\nSkill level\r\n\r\nIntermediate\r\n\r\nMaterials needed\r\n\r\nKimberli can be made with any yarn and appropriate hook size. Jackets shown are size S and are made with the following:\r\n\r\nGreen jacket-straight shaping, lace edging #1; made with Caron Spa weight category 3 (light worsted/DK weight) bamboo/acrylic blend, #0004 Green Sheen, 1025 yds and size I hook\r\n\r\nCobalt blue jacket-swing shaping, lace edging #2; made with Omega Sinfonia weight category 2 (sport weight) mercerized cotton, Azul Bey, 1100 yds and size H hook\r\n\r\nOrchid jacket-straight shaping, lace edging #1; made with Lion Brand Cupcake weight category 4 (thick worsted weight) crinkly acrylic/nylon blend, 675 yds and size J hook\r\n\r\nEggplant fuzzy jacket-- straight shaping, lace edging #1 at bottom and sleeves only; made with Lion Brand Moonlight Mohair weight category 5 (bulky) mohair blend, 675 yds and size L hook\r\n\r\nYarn amounts are in yards and are approximate—-yarn amounts may vary somewhat depending on custom fitting, length and options. Garment is custom-fitted and can be made to fit any size, but these sizes are given for making garments for gift-giving and as a guideline for estimating yarn amounts.","options":[{"id":45041409,"name":"Default","price":7.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125386062/-/GC77109_00a_0782_web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125386062/-/GC77109_00a_0782_web.jpg","width":503,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125386077/-/GC77109_03_0557_web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125386077/-/GC77109_03_0557_web.jpg","width":597,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125386080/-/GC77109_05_0599_web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125386080/-/GC77109_05_0599_web.jpg","width":602,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125386083/-/GC77109_06_0612_web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125386083/-/GC77109_06_0612_web.jpg","width":642,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125386170/-/GC77109_07_0643_web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125386170/-/GC77109_07_0643_web.jpg","width":582,"height":900}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6269733,"name":"Wearables","permalink":"wearables","url":"/category/wearables"}]},{"id":13993665,"name":"Elfin Baby Sets pdf","permalink":"elfin-baby-sets-pdf","position":13,"price":7.99,"default_price":7.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/elfin-baby-sets-pdf","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-05T19:19:09.000Z","description":"Your little baby elf will be so sweet in these darling cap and bootie sets.

I've always felt such a sense of empowerment and happiness creating unusual dolls and I hope you will feel the same. Make her for a special friend, a daughter, a mother, or just for yourself!\r\n\r\nNote: Entrelac is an essentially Tunisian crochet technique that can be done with a regular crochet hook because there are only a few loops at a time on the hook.

Because it was designed in this manner, you have more control over the length of the finished skirt. You make the pineapple border first so you know exactly how much length the border adds to the finished skirt. Then, setting the border aside, you start at the waist and make the skirt body to your desired length. You then attach the skirt to the border.\r\n\r\nThis design is a slim-fitting skirt with a flared, slightly ruffled border. Pattern is written with instructions for fitting any size using any yarn or thread.\r\n\r\nThis elegant skirt is to be worn over a lightweight soft skirt. Skirt can be worn at waistline or low on hips as desired.\r\n\r\nSize\r\n\r\nPattern is written with instructions for fitting any size using any yarn or thread.\r\n\r\nMaterials\r\n\r\nTo make this skirt, I recommend Royale Fashion Crochet size 3, Aunt Lydia’s Fashion Crochet size 3, Royale Luna Fashion, or Aunt Lydia’s Shimmer Fashion, all by J&P Coats. Luster Sheen by Coats and Clark is also a very good choice. Other possible threads of about the same weight are Patons Grace, Speed-Cro-Sheen, various brands of cabled cotton thread, DMC Senso size 3, and a doubled strand of size 10 crochet cotton thread.","options":[{"id":44172762,"name":"Default","price":7.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124797429/-/GC21106_Cover_Olivia-Pineapple-Skirt_01_web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124797429/-/GC21106_Cover_Olivia-Pineapple-Skirt_01_web.jpg","width":987,"height":1200}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6269733,"name":"Wearables","permalink":"wearables","url":"/category/wearables"}]},{"id":13760646,"name":"Cupcake Tree  pdf","permalink":"cupcake-tree-pdf","position":27,"price":7.99,"default_price":7.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/cupcake-tree-pdf","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-24T16:33:42.000Z","description":"Have fun crocheting this collection of fanciful frosted cupcakes!

Made with 100% cotton worsted-weight yarn, these handy helpers are as practical as they are pretty—potholders are made with a doubled strand of yarn for thick protection for your hands. Decorations, details and dishcloths are made with single strand. These make wonderful housewarming and shower gifts.\r\n\r\nSize\r\n\r\n6-9” across\r\n\r\nSkill level\r\n\r\nIntermediate\r\n\r\nMaterials\r\n\r\nWhen making potholders, consider yarn choices carefully for safety. The safest potholders are made from 100% cotton with stitches close enough together so there are no holes through which to burn fingers. Acrylic yarn, which can melt under high heat, is theoretically fine for potholders that will be hung on the wall or otherwise displayed, or for potholders that will be used as hot mats instead of for removing hot pans from an oven. However, as potholders get passed along for years after they are made (at least in our family), you can never be sure that a potholder you make for display will not be used at some point in the future. To be safe, I recommend 100% cotton yarn.\r\n\r\nWhen designing these potholders, I decided to go for double thickness and double safety. I used a doubled strand of 100% cotton yarn for the base of each potholder. The yarn I chose is CottonTots by Bernat, which comes in a lot of cheery colors and is traditionally used for making items for babies and children. I love its softness, loft and wavy texture. Each 100g/3.5 oz ball has about 156m/176 yds.\r\n\r\nAny of these designs can be made with any 100% cotton worsted-weight yarn, since CottonTots is actually a weight-category 4 yarn, the same size as worsted-weight. Gauge is not critical.\r\n\r\nCottonTots colors used:\r\n\r\n#90005 Wonder White\r\n\r\n#90421 Strawberry\r\n\r\n#90420 Pretty n Pink\r\n\r\n#90230 Sweet Green\r\n\r\n**NOTE** this is a crochet pattern, not the finished items","options":[{"id":44031402,"name":"Default","price":7.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124697577/-/pink_potholders_no_text.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124697577/-/pink_potholders_no_text.jpg","width":800,"height":1017}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6269838,"name":"Home Sweet Home","permalink":"home-sweet-home","url":"/category/home-sweet-home"}]},{"id":13724331,"name":"Lilliana Pineapple Jacket pdf","permalink":"lilliana-pineapple-jacket-pdf","position":39,"price":7.99,"default_price":7.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/lilliana-pineapple-jacket-pdf","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-22T21:12:16.000Z","description":"Add a dramatic flourish to your outfit for any occasion with this lovely crocheted shrug-style jacket bordered with a generous pineapple edging. \r\n\r\nWear Lilliana open down the front or pinned at center front.
