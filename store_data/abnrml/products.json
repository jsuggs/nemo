Only 50 of these were printed and only a handful are available here!\r\n\r\nAt some point in every man’s life, he looks in the mirror and is surprised by what he sees. His hair is a bit more gray, his skin a bit more wrinkled, his eyes are paler than he remembered them being the day before. He begins to wonder: What is my life’s work? Where am I headed? What is truly important to me? For Tom Hamilton that day is today and the questions are being asked on Knives & Teeth, the powerful new album he’s recorded with his band, American Babies. Over the course of 10 songs that range from uplifting to heartbreaking, Hamilton considers the secrets of childhood, the impending doubts of adulthood and the weight of strained friendships, all set to a soundtrack with the brashness of The Replacements, the sonic intensity of David Bowie and the acoustic majesty of Led Zeppelin.\r\n“When you’re in your 20s you focus on things that don’t seem to maintain their importance as you get older: Chicks, partying, making lots of money. Then you grow up and you realize none of it actually matters, so you dig deeper. I spent a lot of time with some activist friends and the Occupy movement. That pushed some buttons, but I keep digging. Then I had a couple of close friends pass away within a few months of each other and that made me really dig in. I started to think about my own mortality. Reconsidering what was really important to me,” muses Hamilton. “It’s like: when you’re born, the Grim Reaper is far away and all has to throw at you is a pebble, but as you get older, the pebble becomes a rock; then it becomes a gun; then it becomes a gun with a scope. Eventually, he’ll get close enough and his weapon will be sharp enough to hit you. Knives & Teeth is about what happens between now and that day.”\r\nHamilton is best known as one of the founding members of the highly successful electro-rock band, Brothers Past, an endeavor that infused the song structures of The Grateful Dead into the experimental music of Aphex Twin and Squarepusher (a sort of “Pink Floyd with laptops,” as Hamilton calls it). When the strictures of band life became creatively stifling, Hamilton decided in 2007 to form American Babies, a loosely-organized operation wherein Hamilton is the sole constant member. Prior to Knives & Teeth, American Babies have released three sets over the course of six years: their self-titled debut, which won them numerous festival appearances as well supporting gigs with Sheryl Crow, Derek Trucks and The National; a 2010 EP called Weight of the World; and, in 2011, their second long player, Flawed Logic.","options":[{"id":45757089,"name":"Default","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1535846,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"},{"id":2408545,"name":"American Babies","permalink":"american-babies","url":"/category/american-babies"}]},{"id":14169192,"name":"American Babies 'Knives and Teeth' T-Shirt","permalink":"american-babies-knives-and-teeth-t-shirt","position":2,"price":19.99,"default_price":19.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/american-babies-knives-and-teeth-t-shirt","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-14T15:59:24.000Z","description":"Super soft Next Level Apparel with a 7-color print!

Kings of Leon abruptly canceled their tour and several key shows were filled by other bands in and effort to pitch in and help out. Philadelphia music fans were treated to a surprise performance by Band of Horses in place of Kings of Leon. The show sold out very quickly and Live Nation wanted to give the band a very special gift. ABNRML turned immediately to our poster cohorts T-Bone & Aljax to whip up a quick print. With lightening speed they churned out this wonderful 12.5\"X19\" 3-color design. It was printed with metallic silver ink and was not available to the public.

The brick red version featured to the left and the deep forest green pictured below.

We are looking forward to more collaborations with Brothers Past in 2010 as they take off with their upcoming album.\r\n","options":[{"id":9863498,"name":"Default","price":19.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27305549/-/PA252275.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27305549/-/PA252275.jpg","width":650,"height":366},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27324330/-/PA262447.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27324330/-/PA262447.JPG","width":650,"height":366},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27324350/-/PA262448.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27324350/-/PA262448.JPG","width":650,"height":366},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27324354/-/PA262449.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27324354/-/PA262449.JPG","width":650,"height":366}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1535846,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"},{"id":2520053,"name":"Brothers Past","permalink":"brothers-past","url":"/category/brothers-past"}]}]
