Suspended on round leather cord in the World Traveler Style; leather tied with sliding knots to adjust the length.  The deer antler has been shaped and sealed, topped on one side with a natural holey stone and super special fossils.  This necklace is full of Mojo.  Not for the faint of heart. Copper chains hang from one side, suspending the earthly elements of turquoise, fossil and shell.  Total length of the leather cord is about 26 inches, 13 inches on each side of the 3 inch long well balanced pendant.  With the sliding knots, it can be adjusted to a much shorter length.  This is one of my one of a kind necklaces made with found objects.  Never to be repeated.  Be ready for lots of interest when you wear this piece.\r\nAttractively gift boxed and ships priority.","options":[{"id":44488404,"name":"Default","price":163.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125036067/-/DSCN7067.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125036067/-/DSCN7067.JPG","width":3158,"height":2432}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6310788,"name":"jewelry","permalink":"jewelry","url":"/category/jewelry"},{"id":6315384,"name":"pendant","permalink":"pendant","url":"/category/pendant"},{"id":6315396,"name":"hand made","permalink":"hand-made","url":"/category/hand-made"},{"id":6315558,"name":"assemblage","permalink":"assemblage","url":"/category/assemblage"},{"id":6315570,"name":"mixed media","permalink":"mixed-media","url":"/category/mixed-media"},{"id":6315576,"name":"found object art","permalink":"found-object-art","url":"/category/found-object-art"},{"id":6316071,"name":"gift for men","permalink":"gift-for-men","url":"/category/gift-for-men"}]},{"id":13852158,"name":"Meditation Wheel, Spirit Wheel, Little She Bear Ursula","permalink":"meditation-wheel-spirit-wheel-little-she-bear-ursula","position":2,"price":175.0,"default_price":175.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/meditation-wheel-spirit-wheel-little-she-bear-ursula","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-28T23:41:15.000Z","description":"Hoop Beaded and encased in long brown fur, a bumpy, hand lamp worked glass bead sits in the middle of a box woven sinew web.
