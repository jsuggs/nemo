We know that is a big call, but.....\r\n\r\nThis is an analogue clock with no hands. We came up with this after setting a challenge to make a clock different, but still functional.\r\n\r\nWhat we came up with is something that is beautiful and following the modern tradition of simple lines. It is almost more of an art-piece than a clock.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which.  Have a look at it. Can you work out how it keeps time?\r\n\r\nThe answer is below if you really want it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trick to this clock is that it has no minute hand. The hour is represented by the cut-out, and floats around the clock face. When it is above the 12, you know its 12. If it is halfway between the two and three, you know its 2:30. \r\n\r\nAfter a short while you get to the point where you judge the time down to five minutes.","options":[{"id":17486597,"name":"Default","price":85.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":25.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":45.0,"amount_with_others":45.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53189387/-/-4535.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53189387/-/-4535.jpg","width":1000,"height":669}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2868897,"name":"Homewares","permalink":"homewares","url":"/category/homewares"},{"id":2868903,"name":"Home made","permalink":"home-made","url":"/category/home-made"},{"id":2875471,"name":"Clock","permalink":"clock","url":"/category/clock"}]},{"id":5415597,"name":"You Are Here - Tea towel","permalink":"you-are-here-tea-towel","position":3,"price":6.0,"default_price":6.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/you-are-here-tea-towel","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-07T08:08:51.000Z","description":"Drying dishes sucks.
