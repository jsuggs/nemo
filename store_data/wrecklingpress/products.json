Perfect for oily or somewhat oily faces and it is flavored with orange essential oils. It's a favorite by a friend in the professional makeup field for being water resistant and having a pleasant smell (a needed relief for mineral gum adhered fake upper-lip-appendages).\r\n\r\nThis may last a well endowed lip sweater for about a couple of months or more.  Should you feel you'd like a different formulation in your arsenal of fine facial tools feel free to contact me as I may make an experimental batch from time to time.
