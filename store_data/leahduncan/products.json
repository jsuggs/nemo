It can be used in multiple ways, for bundling or gift-wrapping all sorts of things – from lunch boxes or books, to watermelons and bottles of wine. You could even tie it into a handbag or use it as a scarf, a baby blanket or even a wall hanging. One simple and beautiful piece of cloth and the list is endless. Tie it and see!\r\n\r\n-Designers words-\r\nInspired by the angles and shapes of Japanese origami techniques, the elements of this design weave around the fabric to create a bold geometric pattern that reflects my roots, mimicking elements of the traditional tapestry designs found in the southwestern United States.\r\n\r\n2 colour printing. \r\n\r\n-Printing process-\r\nEach of our products has been hand printed in Japan, using traditional printing techniques. We are working with a great printing company called Chiffonez in Tokyo, who specialize in the printing of furoshiki. To make sure we get the best results possible, we keep a close dialogue with the printers, retaining a good balance between our ideas and their invaluable knowledge.\r\n\r\nFactory Interview here: \r\nhttp://www.spoon-tamago.com/2012/07/02/link-furoshiki-interview-factory-shoot/?shareadraft=baba15741_4ff06032a600b\r\n\r\n-About LINK-\r\nLINK is a unique and challenging project conducted long-distance, entirely via the internet, by busy women with a world-wide vision.

This is a pre-order and will begin shipping at the end of April. We have 10 available in Leah's shop and the rest will be sold through The Link Collective. Carry straps can be ordered directly from the link collective: https://www.etsy.com/shop/thelinkcollective.\r\n\r\nSize: 900 x 900 mm (35.4 x 35.4\")\r\nMaterial : 100% cotton satin (lighter weight, smooth cotton)\r\nHandmade in Japan, using Japanese traditional printing techniques. \r\n\r\n-About Furoshiki-\r\nFuroshiki (風呂敷, fu-rosh-ki) is a type of traditional Japanese wrapping cloth. It can be used in multiple ways, for bundling or gift-wrapping all sorts of things. We think this particular lighter-weight furoshiki works well for more delicate wrapping and perfectly as a scarf, and it softens up the more you wear and wash it. One simple and beautiful piece of cloth and the list is endless. Tie it and see!\r\n\r\n\r\n-Designers words-\r\nThis design was inspired by the famous cherry blossom mountain view in Japan at sunrise. The elements are subtle, which creates a delicate and abstract pattern when the furoshiki is wrapped, folded, and worn.\r\n\r\n3 colour printing. \r\n\r\n-Printing process-\r\nEach of our products has been hand printed in Japan, using traditional printing techniques. We are working with a great printing company called Chiffonez in Tokyo, who specialize in the printing of furoshiki. To make sure we get the best results possible, we keep a close dialogue with the printers, retaining a good balance between our ideas and their invaluable knowledge.\r\n\r\nFactory Interview here: \r\nhttp://www.spoon-tamago.com/2012/07/02/link-furoshiki-interview-factory-shoot/?shareadraft=baba15741_4ff06032a600b\r\n\r\n-About LINK-\r\nLINK is a unique and challenging project conducted long-distance, entirely via the internet, by busy women with a world-wide vision.
