It can be used in multiple ways, for bundling or gift-wrapping all sorts of things â from lunch boxes or books, to watermelons and bottles of wine. You could even tie it into a handbag or use it as a scarf, a baby blanket or even a wall hanging. One simple and beautiful piece of cloth and the list is endless. Tie it and see!\r\n\r\n-Designers words-\r\nInspired by the angles and shapes of Japanese origami techniques, the elements of this design weave around the fabric to create a bold geometric pattern that reflects my roots, mimicking elements of the traditional tapestry designs found in the southwestern United States.\r\n\r\n2 colour printing. \r\n\r\n-Printing process-\r\nEach of our products has been hand printed in Japan, using traditional printing techniques. We are working with a great printing company called Chiffonez in Tokyo, who specialize in the printing of furoshiki. To make sure we get the best results possible, we keep a close dialogue with the printers, retaining a good balance between our ideas and their invaluable knowledge.\r\n\r\nFactory Interview here: \r\nhttp://www.spoon-tamago.com/2012/07/02/link-furoshiki-interview-factory-shoot/?shareadraft=baba15741_4ff06032a600b\r\n\r\n-About LINK-\r\nLINK is a unique and challenging project conducted long-distance, entirely via the internet, by busy women with a world-wide vision.

It can be used in multiple ways, for bundling or gift-wrapping all sorts of things. We think this particular lighter-weight furoshiki works well for more delicate wrapping and perfectly as a scarf, and it softens up the more you wear and wash it. One simple and beautiful piece of cloth and the list is endless. Tie it and see!\r\n\r\n\r\n-Designers words-\r\nThis design was inspired by the famous cherry blossom mountain view in Japan at sunrise. The elements are subtle, which creates a delicate and abstract pattern when the furoshiki is wrapped, folded, and worn.\r\n\r\n3 colour printing. \r\n\r\n-Printing process-\r\nEach of our products has been hand printed in Japan, using traditional printing techniques. We are working with a great printing company called Chiffonez in Tokyo, who specialize in the printing of furoshiki. To make sure we get the best results possible, we keep a close dialogue with the printers, retaining a good balance between our ideas and their invaluable knowledge.\r\n\r\nFactory Interview here: \r\nhttp://www.spoon-tamago.com/2012/07/02/link-furoshiki-interview-factory-shoot/?shareadraft=baba15741_4ff06032a600b\r\n\r\n-About LINK-\r\nLINK is a unique and challenging project conducted long-distance, entirely via the internet, by busy women with a world-wide vision.
