His work best represents that of a circus sideshow cemetery. Final pieces are often brought to life by translating random shapes and colors into signs of torment and absurdity. By juxtaposing these two conflicting moods, Alex makes his works more personal to his viewers, forcing them to project their own feelings and emotions onto each character in his twisted universe.\r\nIn the past five years he has continued to release books like The Secrets of Hollywood and the popular Bunnywith series. The comics have spawned an entire plush line, calendars, and art exhibitions. Alex Pardee’s devotion to his art has gained the attention of Warner Bros., Reprise Records, Freeze Management, Hurley International, Kidrobot, Twenty Twenty Skateboards, and more. In 2004 he was tapped by the gold-selling rock group The Used to design the artwork for their album, In Love and Death. Alex’s designs were not only applied to record, but also the band’s merchandise, Website, marketing campaign, and the music video for the single “All That I’ve Got.” More recently, Alex Has been working with Def Jux recording artist CAGE, as well as STREET DRUM CORPS, TOP-R, EL-P, and high-fashion designer Dr. Romanelli. In addition to demeaning celebrities, Alex continues to use his art as a means of self-medication, creating emotionally charged images on canvases, sketchbooks, and any other surfaces he can cover with his bizarre characters.

A high school drop out and Cal Arts reject, she moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in traditional animation eventually finding her way to stop motion animation as a designer and sculptor, working on stylized projects for shows like The Simpsons and the feature film Elf. The challenge of mastering new tools and techniques in this medium taught her to be able to visualize her own style. She has been exhibiting her paintings and sculptures internationally since 2005 including Disneyland USA and has created a thriving world of characters as designer toys.\r\nShe is half of Switcheroo, a design jamboree she runs with Michelle Valigura. She has never won an award.","options":[{"id":14687863,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43889511/-/amandaset.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43889511/-/amandaset.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43882463/-/amandaflash1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43882463/-/amandaflash1.jpg","width":500,"height":393},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43882479/-/amandaflash2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43882479/-/amandaflash2.jpg","width":500,"height":393},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43882495/-/AmandaCert.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43882495/-/AmandaCert.png","width":505,"height":290}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1188761,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":4481775,"name":"Brandt Peters - Giclee Print for \"Quick & Painful\"","permalink":"brandt-peters-giclee-print-quick-and-painful","position":66,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/brandt-peters-giclee-print-quick-and-painful","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-09-21T20:07:40.000Z","description":"LIMITED TO 30 PRINTS WORLDWIDE\r\n\r\nThe “Quick and Painful” Series of Giclee Prints are 11\" x 14\" and printed on beautiful 300 gram cold press watercolor paper with archival pigment inks.

Growing up she was more often doodling sexy damsels and dragons on her textbooks than reading them. In 1998 when Camilla first attended her first San Diego Comic Con she realized that a 9–5 day job would kill her and this was what she wanted to do. Thanks to her relentless energy, dedication, and just enough sleep deprivation, she has followed her dream of working creatively for a living.\r\nCamilla’s unique style continues to be in demand and her client list includes Dark Horse Comics, Image Comics, Random House, Tokyopop, Hasbro, Disney, Sanrio, Neil Gaiman and she also works with video game and movie companies on character development. Her own characters and properties, Tanpopo and Helmetgirls, are loved by fans and followers and now inspire Cosplay costumes. She has successfully merchandised and licensed her beautiful artwork across a variety of categories: clothing, stationery and gift, accessories, art prints, etc. and continues to expand her licensing program. Her emotive and eloquent paintings have propelled her to the top of the ranks of the New Contemporary art movement, and she is represented by Opera Gallery of New York.\r\nCamilla can’t live without Holbein’s “DUO” water-soluble oils, green tea lattes, Hello Kitty merchandise, and her daily fix of manga and anime.","options":[{"id":14687979,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43883019/-/camillaflash.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43883019/-/camillaflash.jpg","width":500,"height":393},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43883047/-/CamillaCert.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43883047/-/CamillaCert.png","width":518,"height":347}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1188761,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":4481891,"name":"Devilrobots - Set of 2 Giclee Prints for \"Quick and Painful\"","permalink":"devilrobots-set-of-2-giclee-prints-for-quick-and-painful","position":68,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/devilrobots-set-of-2-giclee-prints-for-quick-and-painful","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-09-21T20:21:23.000Z","description":"LIMITED TO 20 PRINT SETS WORLDWIDE\r\n\r\nThe “Quick and Painful” Series of Giclee Prints are 11\" x 14\" and printed on beautiful 300 gram cold press watercolor paper with archival pigment inks.

Credited with single-handedly reviving the “lost” art of the concert poster, Kozik’s art career emerged from his connection to Austin’s cultural explosion in the mid 80′s. Starting with band flyers that he posted on telephone poles, Kozik quickly garnered a solid fan-base who dug his graphically compelling and culturally relevant work. To date, Kozik has designed over 1000 concert posters and album covers for artists as diverse as The Sex Pistols and Nirvana; founded Man’s Ruin Records; directed music videos for Soundgarden; staged over 60 gallery shows worldwide; created artwork for some of world’s biggest companies; and published several volumes of his work. Since 2000, Kozik’s main artistic focus has been in the design and production of vinyl art toys. The icon of Kozik’s toy empire is his Smorkin’ Labbit character, but he is also the guy behind Chumps, Mongers and pretty much everything else that smorks.","options":[{"id":14688173,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43883975/-/KozikFlash.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43883975/-/KozikFlash.jpg","width":500,"height":393},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43883999/-/KozikCert.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43883999/-/KozikCert.png","width":526,"height":365}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1188761,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":4481941,"name":"Joe Ledbetter - Set of 3 Giclee Prints for \"Quick and Painful\"","permalink":"joe-ledbetter-set-of-3-giclee-prints-for-quick-and-painful","position":70,"price":30.0,"default_price":30.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/joe-ledbetter-set-of-3-giclee-prints-for-quick-and-painful","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-09-21T20:25:10.000Z","description":"LIMITED TO 50 PRINT SETS WORLDWIDE\r\n\r\nThe “Quick and Painful” Series of Giclee Prints are 11\" x 14\" and printed on beautiful 300 gram cold press watercolor paper with archival pigment inks.

Light-hearted in its approach, he often combines cute and cuddly creatures with unfortunate — albeit humorous — situations. With a lean on the subversive and absurd, these scenarios are all too familiar, questioning our tendency of taking life (and ourselves) too seriously.\r\nWhile working as a graphic apparel artist for three years, Ledbetter got involved in the Los Angeles underground art scene, beginning with group shows like Cannibal Flower. By the summer of 2004, he had honed his trademark visual style of emblematic line-work, vibrant colors, and endearing characters to the point of quitting his day job. With international appeal, he has had numerous solo exhibitions in Los Angeles, Tokyo, London, Paris, Rome, Toronto, Taipei, Istanbul, and Amsterdam. His incredible cast of creatures have since been emblazoned on over 100 designer vinyl toys, as well as apparel and lifestyle brands, the world over.","options":[{"id":14688257,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43889607/-/joeledbetterset.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43889607/-/joeledbetterset.jpg","width":500,"height":500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43884247/-/ledbetter_tattoo_1b.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43884247/-/ledbetter_tattoo_1b.jpg","width":500,"height":393},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43884263/-/ledbetter_tattoo_2b.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43884263/-/ledbetter_tattoo_2b.jpg","width":500,"height":393},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43884283/-/ledbetter_tattoo_3b.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43884283/-/ledbetter_tattoo_3b.jpg","width":500,"height":393},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43884327/-/JLedCert.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43884327/-/JLedCert.png","width":526,"height":359}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1188761,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":4481789,"name":"Kathie Olivas - Giclee Print for \"Quick & Painful\"","permalink":"kathie-olivas-giclee-print-for-quick-painful","position":71,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kathie-olivas-giclee-print-for-quick-painful","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-09-21T20:10:15.000Z","description":"LIMITED TO 30 PRINTS WORLDWIDE\r\n\r\nThe “Quick and Painful” Series of Giclee Prints are 11\" x 14\" and printed on beautiful 300 gram cold press watercolor paper with archival pigment inks.

In 1995, he moved to San Francisco seeking life as working artist and the Bohemian lifestyle of the Bay Area. Like most teens of the late 80′s and early 90′s, Sam was involved in street cultures of skateboarding and graffiti writing. From 1995-1998, these roots in urban expression helped him land freelance gigs doing graphics for Adrenalin skateboards and Civilian clothing. He’s shown at Virgin 69, 5024, and Hotel Biron galleries, as well as traveling shows to New York, Canada, Singapore, Tokyo and throughout Europe.\r\nHis focal medium is paint on maps, blue prints and canvas. These paintings touch classic themes of “natural beauty,” which is in obvious contrast to his life in the urban landscape. He credits Michael Parkes and Derek Hess as influences. The rich flora of his recent work can be compared to the nouveau stylings of Alphonse Mucha. His figures tend to be somewhat anonymous, even masked in some instances, yet still full of personality and emotion.\r\nHe effortlessly combines broad fields of color and finely rendered detail, creating paintings that are engaged on many levels. This palette tends to lean toward earth tones, perhaps an homage to the colors of his youth in New Mexico.","options":[{"id":14688381,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43885059/-/samfloresflash.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43885059/-/samfloresflash.jpg","width":500,"height":393},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/43885127/-/SamCert.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/43885127/-/SamCert.png","width":493,"height":307}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1188761,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]},{"id":4482027,"name":"TADO - Giclee Print for \"Quick and Painful\"","permalink":"tado-giclee-print-for-quick-and-painful","position":74,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tado-giclee-print-for-quick-and-painful","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-09-21T20:33:40.000Z","description":"LIMITED TO 20 PRINTS WORLDWIDE\r\n\r\nThe “Quick and Painful” Series of Giclee Prints are 11\" x 14\" and printed on beautiful 300 gram cold press watercolor paper with archival pigment inks.
