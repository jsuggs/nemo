Whilst looking at the pleats, folds and repetition in couture garments, I became fascinated with forms that were interactive, non permanent and enabled movement. Taking the concept of expansion and contraction, my 'To Cherish' pieces reveal a snakelike motion, only conceivable through touch and wear.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nOur couture collar (we feel) is one of my most exciting creation to date. It is the largest piece of jewellery designed and made so far and contains almost 250 individually closed rivets in its making. We would make any excuse to wear this with a smile because we love it, this would also be fabulous with the right wedding dress!\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDimension/Size\r\n\r\nApproximate dimensions: W 18cm x H 6.5cm.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAll jewellery is made by hand in England and comes beautifully packaged in our Saloukee branded packaging. We also include a care label with each piece to explain the unique nature of the product.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMaterial Used\r\n\r\nHand folded, embossed, paper, rivets, satin ribbon.","options":[{"id":46632162,"name":"Vintage Cream","price":350.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46632165,"name":"Dark Grey","price":350.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.25,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":9.25,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126470229/-/sarahk-11_square_1000x1000_b_w.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126470229/-/sarahk-11_square_1000x1000_b_w.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126470250/-/Obverse_Collar_1000px.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126470250/-/Obverse_Collar_1000px.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126470277/-/Obverse_Collar__grey_1000px.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126470277/-/Obverse_Collar__grey_1000px.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2463353,"name":"Gifts for her","permalink":"gifts-for-her","url":"/category/gifts-for-her"},{"id":2463367,"name":"Gifts for Anniversaries","permalink":"gifts-for-anniversaries","url":"/category/gifts-for-anniversaries"},{"id":2480825,"name":"Gifts for weddings","permalink":"gifts-for-weddings","url":"/category/gifts-for-weddings"},{"id":1617023,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]},{"id":7012097,"name":"Loops hand woven yarn necklace - Neons","permalink":"loops-hand-woven-yarn-necklace-neon","position":2,"price":45.0,"default_price":45.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/loops-hand-woven-yarn-necklace-neon","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-20T15:08:50.000Z","description":"Description:\r\n\r\nLoops is a durable and perfectly on-trend statement necklace designed with an emphasis on simplicity and fastened with a hand thread bound toggle.\r\n\r\nLoops is also available in neutral, pastel pink, pastel blue and pastel grey.
