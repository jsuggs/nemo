Though little known until recently, Carl W. Peters embodied the essence of American Scene painting throughout his extremely productive life. His works are considered here within the broad panorama of cultural and intellectual history during these exciting decades, when modernism and indigenous American realism were in constant conflict.

Love sets the scene during the golden age of American impressionism in Chicago and Giverny, the village in which American expatriate painters were in the orbit of Claude Monet. Like many, Ritman established his own style by the time the French aesthetic had become an international movement. Ritman was well prepared to meet the task of satisfying art patrons in the Midwest who had developed a high degree of sophistication in their tastes and demands for progressive art. As always, the author provides a rich cultural setting, presenting a wealth of significant events and influences. The book is richly illustrated with paintings, photos of personalities, places, maps and diagrams related to the text.

He ended up in Giverny and became one of the few Americans who worked directly under Claude Monet’s influence. But by going beyond Monet’s broken color technique to seek out more avant-garde developments, Butler escaped from Monet’s shadow. In fact, he achieved his own striking form of post-impressionism, which forecast the shocking colorism of the Nabis who entered the scene a decade later. Moreover, he exhibited his works at the most progressive venues, including those of Le Barc de Boutteville and Ambroise Vollard. In this scholarly monograph we follow the stimulating story of this dynamic Midwestern painter, set within a chronological presentation of the complex cultural movements that characterize the volatile decades of early modernism.

Early on, Barber came under the influence of Jules Pascin, who was a friend of the family, then he studied at the National Academy of Design. Barber became involved with the Ash Can group as well as with The Masses and was in fact the youngest contributing artist to this controversial journal. In 1922 Barber went to Paris and entered the studio of André Lhote, who has been called an academic cubist. Other influences include Cézanne, Giotto and Piero della Francesca and Barber was open to a variety of aesthetic stimuli presented to him during his many travels.  By the late 1920s his own personal style had matured. A typical work by Barber is an everyday genre theme with figures in a massive architectural setting of classical simplicity. His well-modeled figures – collective people rather than portraits –  demonstrate convincing movement but are abstracted to a degree, within an overall, unified web of texture and muted color.  The book includes numerous illustrations of Barber’s works of art and the people and places that were significant in his development.
