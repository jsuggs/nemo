Of course, the discerning modern-day record buyer has every right to approach such efforts with a degree of suspicion; all too often, resurrected old punks are prone to returning with either pale imitations of their previous work, or to (understandably) changing dramatically over the intervening decades but (less justifiably) continuing to trade on the same name. That Arson have handily avoided both potential pitfalls is perhaps not entirely surprising-- never a generic three-chord punk band to begin with, Arson always reflected a healthy diet of such respectable pre/proto-punk influences as MC5/Stooges-style Detroit rock and Bowie/T Rex UK glam-- but the strength of this record is still remarkable. There's an impressive diversity at work across the eleven tracks here, but the flow is entirely natural and never feels forced, even as the band evoke the Psychedelic Furs and the New York Dolls, '80s new wave and classic '70s hard rock. That said, no one familiar with my own tastes will be surprised when I say that the title track is my favourite, a high-power Detroit-damaged punk ripper that comes charging out of the starting gate before coughing up the catchiest chorus of a record with no shortage of catchy choruses, then whips out some of the most incendiary lead guitar (and harp!) of the entire set. This one is destined to wind up on a lot of mixes; in 1980, it would have been a hit single that both CFNY and Q107 would be happily playing still.\r\n\r\nThe production is excellent, with the strong, expressive vocals out front occasionally surrendering the spotlight to some seriously tasty lead guitar, and the rhythm section rock solid throughout....but don't just take my word for it, go buy your own copy!

While there are several great tracks on the LP, it's long been my opinion that Oh! Those Sweet Bananas was criminally over-looked and should really have been a 45 from the start. One of the great lost songs of the period, it's a quick, catchy and instantly addictive burst of NYC garage punk pop at the dawn of the '70s. The flip is a beautiful and memorable slow-burner, and a different take to that on the LP. A slight change of pace for Ugly Pop, but a long-time favourite that anyone with good taste will appreciate.
