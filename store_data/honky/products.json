The Race Card Game is a fun, fast-paced, trick-taking card game where the four suits have been replaced with the races of the world: White, Black, \u0003Brown and Yellow. Collect both halves \u0003of a racial slur, yell it out and that race becomes superior! But beware the special cards like the interfering Media or the \u0003PC Brigade that makes you swap hands with another player so you can \u0003“see things from their perspective”.\r\n\r\nFor 2-4 players. Pack comes in a hard plastic case and includes 54 cards and rules.\r\n\r\nPrices are in New Zealand Dollars. Shipping will be calculated once you add to cart.\r\n\r\nSee www.honky.co.nz for more information.","options":[{"id":13125634,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/39217859/-/Honky1_01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/39217859/-/Honky1_01.jpg","width":519,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
