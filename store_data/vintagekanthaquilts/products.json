Kantha originated from the way in which Bengali housewives mended old clothes by taking out a strand of thread from the colorful border of their saris and making simple designs with them.","options":[{"id":31223023,"name":"Default","price":99.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98083831/-/DSC04770.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98083831/-/DSC04770.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98083975/-/DSC04771.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98083975/-/DSC04771.JPG","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98084155/-/DSC04773.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98084155/-/DSC04773.JPG","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/98084503/-/DSC04775.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/98084503/-/DSC04775.JPG","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[{"id":144101,"name":"santosh rathi","permalink":"santosh-rathi","url":"/artist/santosh-rathi"}],"categories":[{"id":3788325,"name":"kantha bedcovers","permalink":"kantha-bedcovers","url":"/category/kantha-bedcovers"}]},{"id":9824362,"name":"paksitani saami quilts by snake charmers lassi quilts ","permalink":"paksitani-saami-quilts-by-snake-charmers-lassi-quilts","position":102,"price":299.0,"default_price":299.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/paksitani-saami-quilts-by-snake-charmers-lassi-quilts","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-03-09T11:41:06.000Z","description":"Vintage quilts with nostalgic retro feel.

printing is a type of block printing done in Kutch and the neighboring community of Sindh, Pakistan. Rather than printing with dyes like other types of block printing, they print with resists and then do an immersion dye, meaning that once it is dipped in dye the area that was block printed will remain white. This is a much more labor-intensive method of block printing, but the results are incredible, with such deep colors and intricate designs.\r\n\r\nAjrak is traditionally done with natural dyes, meaning there is a limited color palette of blue, red, purple, black, yellow and green. The photos above are of a few antique printing blocks I bought in Kutch.

textiles.\r\n\r\nAjrakh printing is a type of block printing done in Kutch and the neighboring community of Sindh, Pakistan. Rather than printing with dyes like other types of block printing, they print with resists and then do an immersion dye, meaning that once it is dipped in dye the area that was block printed will remain white. This is a much more labor-intensive method of block printing, but the results are incredible, with such deep colors and intricate designs.\r\n\r\nAjrak is traditionally done with natural dyes, meaning there is a limited color palette of blue, red, purple, black, yellow and green. The photos above are of a few antique printing blocks I bought in Kutch. The square geometric designs are the traditional Ajrakh patterns, and the rectangular floral block could have come from a different area or been influenced by outside designs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf
