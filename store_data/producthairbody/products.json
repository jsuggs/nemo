This means Product lotion contains more of the ingredients that your skin needs. Product lotion absorbs into your skin quickly and hydrates deeper so you won’t have to constantly reapply. Product does not contain cheap mineral oil or petrolatum which are made from petroleum and can leave a greasy residue feeling. Product’s ingredients are gentler for everyday use even on the most sensitive skin.\r\n\r\nThe light tropical fruit scent will stimulate your senses. Your skin will look healthier, smell sweeter, and become softer to touch. You need to experience it for yourself.\r\n\r\nRecommended use: rub a small amount to skin and enjoy.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":9268979,"name":"8 .oz","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25224283/-/8_Oz_white.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25224283/-/8_Oz_white.jpg","width":658,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1567741,"name":"Body Care","permalink":"body-care","url":"/category/body-care"}]},{"id":2618130,"name":"Hair Serum with Argan Oil","permalink":"serum","position":3,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/serum","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-06-16T22:15:31.000Z","description":"Hair can become damaged by the everyday effects of our environment. Product beautifies and protects hair with long lasting silkiness and shine that people will notice. While shampoo cleanses hair of dirt and oil, it can also wash out the good qualities that keep hair shiny and soft. Product serum protects hair from that “washed out” feeling. Product is not diluted with alcohol like many serums…. this gives Product a thicker texture allowing you to use less and still keep your hair looking its best.\r\n\r\nCheaper serums contain ingredients that are not recommended or approved for both hair and skin. Product serum is made up of an extensive recipe of ingredients which are approved for both your skin as well as your hair.\r\n\r\nRecommended use: 1-2 squirts on hands. Start with less than you would think is needed. Apply to middle and ends of damp hair. Blow dry and style hair as usual. Product is long lasting - general use every 2-3 days.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":9269072,"name":"2.7 .oz","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25224419/-/27_Oz_white.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25224419/-/27_Oz_white.jpg","width":659,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1567741,"name":"Body Care","permalink":"body-care","url":"/category/body-care"}]},{"id":2618132,"name":"Skin Balm with Argan oil","permalink":"skin-balm","position":4,"price":18.5,"default_price":18.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/skin-balm","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-06-16T22:17:09.000Z","description":"Soft skin needs to be protected and moisturized as well as dry skin. Product balm is perfect for everyday use. Product skin balm is at its best at night but can be used any time to help soften and revitalize skin.
