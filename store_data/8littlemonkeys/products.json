This shirt is a reminder that the journey through autism may be challenging, but overall it is rewarding.\r\n\r\nIn my search for answers, I stumbled across a great resource - OCALI, (Ohio Center for Autism and Low Incidence). This organization has been instrumental in supporting families throughout Ohio. A portion of the proceeds from sales of this t-shirt will go to OCALI, Ohio Center for Autism and Low Incidence to help fund their lending library or fund scholarships for their upcoming conference.\r\n\r\nGive back to a great organization while showing your support for the epidemic of Autism in this high quality 100% cotton t - shirt.
