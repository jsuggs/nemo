Doing so also helps reduce the appearance of varicose veins and helps treat athlete’s foot and other fungal ailments commonly afflicting the feet.\r\nAs a facial scrub:our salts are fine, so can be used as an effective agent in cleaning and exfoliating the face. Exfoliating the face is\r\nnecessary because it sloughs away the layers of dead skin cells from the face and allows newer, healthier cells to emerge. This is easy to do; all that needs to be done is to mix a pinch of bath salt with the facial scrub and massage it onto the face. Afterwards, rinse it off.\r\nAs a body scrub: Just like the skin on the face, the skin on the body also needs to be exfoliated. But other than that, massaging our salts all over the body can also promote better blood circulation, soften the rough parts and help in making the skin tone look more even. Just rub our salts on your skin and rinse.\r\n\r\nThese are just some of the uses bath salts has that can help promote bodily health.\r\nHaving some bath salts at home is always handy.\r\n","options":[{"id":18724467,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/57927857/-/blossom_bath_salts_001.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/57927857/-/blossom_bath_salts_001.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/57927881/-/Create-Your-Own-Bath-Salt.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/57927881/-/Create-Your-Own-Bath-Salt.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2125932,"name":"Skin Care","permalink":"skin-care","url":"/category/skin-care"},{"id":2125934,"name":"Body","permalink":"body","url":"/category/body"},{"id":2128268,"name":"Hand + Feet","permalink":"hand-feet","url":"/category/hand-feet"},{"id":3067445,"name":"Bath Salts & Essence","permalink":"bath-salts-essence","url":"/category/bath-salts-essence"}]},{"id":4765891,"name":"Meditation Soy Candle","permalink":"meditation-soy-candle","position":9,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/meditation-soy-candle","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-11-03T08:22:32.000Z","description":"Using the wisdom of nature and the art of aromatherapy, we have created a range of therapeutic candles to help combat the stress and issues of modern day living.\r\nA beautiful natural soy wax candle in a frosted glass container. \r\nOur meditation candle is a unique blend of ancient spiritual 100% essential oils to help aid you with meditation and reaching that quite spot.
