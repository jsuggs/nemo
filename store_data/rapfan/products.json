They brought us one of the greatest collectives in the history of Hip-Hop, the Dungeon Family. They produced the entirety of Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik and Soul Food, not to mention platinum hits for TLC and En Vogue, and even completed songs with Curtis Mayfield, but all too often Organized Noize seem to be an afterthought when considering the all-time greatest producers. In 80 minutes, Out of the Darkness lays out a compelling case for their inclusion when Hip-Hop fans are speaking of the royal family of production. Big Rube narrates the disc, helping guide listeners through two decades of classic dirty south production.\"\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n1.Big Rube – Intro\r\n2.Goodie MoB featuring Big Boi – Dirty South\r\n3.Outkast – Benz Or Beamer\r\n4.Parental Advisory – The Boom\r\n5.OutKast – Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik\r\n6.Goodie Mob – Cell Therapy\r\n7.Outkast – Git Up Git Out\r\n8.Outkast – Elevators (ONP 86 Mix)\r\n9.Outkast – West Savannah\r\n10.TLC – Waterfalls\r\n11.Society Of Soul – Changes\r\n12.Goodie Mob – Thought Process\r\n13.Goodie Mob – Soul Food\r\n14.Outkast – 2 Dope Boyz In A Cadillac\r\n15.Outkast – Hootie Hoo\r\n16.Outkast – Jazzy Belle\r\n17.Outkast – Player’s Ball\r\n18.Killer Mike – Mama Said\r\n19.Cool Breeze – Cre-A-Tine\r\n20.Roscoe – Head To Toe\r\n21.Bubba Sparxxx – Claremont Lounge\r\n22.Outkast – So Fresh So Clean\r\n23.Bubba Sparxxx – Like It Or Not\r\n24.Goodie Mob – Hold On\r\n25.Killer Mike – Speak Lord\r\n26.Witchdoctor – 7th Floor Serengeti\r\n27.Cee-Lo – Scrap Metal\r\n28.OutKast – Skew It On The Bar-B\r\n29.Ludacris – Saturday (Oooh!

Plus, there’s Wikipedia to break down all of his work since 1982. His founding of Def Jam alongside Russell Simmons might be the most recognizable feather in his cap but he wasn’t just an exec. He was an instrumental force and sound behind nascent recordings by the Beastie Boys, LL Cool J and Run-DMC, all of which were early education for budding rap nerds like Trackstar.\r\n\r\nBut Rubin’s works didn’t end when he left Def Jam, his own label, Def American, or the head job at Columbia Records. Rick has HITS under his belt (so many, his production credits have a Wiki of their page own) and they span across multiple genres and decades.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s why this tape was billed as “some of” the key cuts and affectionately “ruined by” Trackstar. As much as Track wanted to, there’s no way to pack a perfect collection of Rubin’s work into one mix. That task would take volumes. Even boiling it down to one genre was daunting, so Track decided to mix and match. There’s some Red Hot Chili Peppers here, a little Kanye there and a dab of System Of A Down. Of course, Run-DMC’s included, but they’re followed by Queen and freakin’ Johnny Cash? The names read like strange bedfellows alongside each other.\r\n\r\nBut every single cut shares a common denominator and that’s Rick Rubin.","options":[{"id":47281683,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126942780/-/Richard_Rubin_Mixed_Tape_Trackstar_front_cover_tiny.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126942780/-/Richard_Rubin_Mixed_Tape_Trackstar_front_cover_tiny.jpg","width":1500,"height":1500},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126942831/-/King_of_Rock_Rick_Rubin_Trackstar_back_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126942831/-/King_of_Rock_Rick_Rubin_Trackstar_back_cover.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1568338,"name":"Mixtapes","permalink":"mixtapes","url":"/category/mixtapes"}]},{"id":12748884,"name":"RAP FAN shirt - royal blue","permalink":"rap-fan-shirt-royal-blue","position":15,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rap-fan-shirt-royal-blue","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-08-03T01:57:56.000Z","description":"ALL SIZES EXCEPT XL SHIP IN JANUARY.
