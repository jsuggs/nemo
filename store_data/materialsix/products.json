While attending the Art Institute of Illinois in Chicago for graphic design, Orly began his first tattoo apprenticeship with Mike Cruz in 1996 and later moved to Hawaii where he met his teachers Po’oino Yrondi and Aisea Toetu’u that taught him the roots of Polynesian and South Pacific tattooing. Known for his intricate tribal tattoos, Orly wanted to express his art through tee designs as well, and launched Cukui in 2008 - a clothing brand with sub-cultural influences in South Pacific tattoos, Chicano lifestyle, graffiti, and photography.
