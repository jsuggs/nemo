Rather, each year I tend to gravitate towards that song that I listen to again, and again.... and again. In 2012 it was The Lumineers, \"Stubborn Love.\" The violin cuts deep and captivates your emotion; the assertive guitar raises it's head and catches your attention. Then he starts singing, and you sink back in your chair and realize that he is talking about you; the wildly independent brunette who is easy to fall in love with, but hard to live with. \r\n\r\nThis song is about compromise, tolerance and forgiveness—the kind of reaction driven by gravity, not by choice. Most of the time, you don't know if the heart is being torn apart or put back together. Either way, at the end of the day—the stubborn love is still there.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>*Printed with enthusiasm by <a href=\"http://swashpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SWASH</a>*</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://swashpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://www.pixology.is/wind-images/swash.jpg\" alt=\"SWASH\" border=\"0\" /></a>","options":[{"id":27872816,"name":"Default","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":6.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87345710/-/Stubborn-Love.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87345710/-/Stubborn-Love.jpg","width":720,"height":720}],"artists":[{"id":160827,"name":"Shanda Foisy","permalink":"shanda-foisy","url":"/artist/shanda-foisy"}],"categories":[{"id":4113864,"name":"Letterpress Prints","permalink":"letterpress-prints","url":"/category/letterpress-prints"}]},{"id":8883110,"name":"Jolene","permalink":"jolene","position":2,"price":38.0,"default_price":38.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/jolene","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-10T21:33:24.000Z","description":"10\" x 10\" Letterpress Print\r\nNumbered + limited edition (50 quantity)\r\nPrinted on Crane's Lettra, 110lb Pearl White paper\r\nPart of <a href=\"http://www.womenindesign.co/collection-one\">Collection One</a>\r\n\r\nDesigned by <strong>Char Davidson</strong>\r\nSmall & Mighty Creative\r\n<a href=\"http://www.smallandmighty.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.smallandmighty.com</a>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.pixologyrules.com/wind-images/char-davidson.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n\"One of my favorite songs is Jolene by Dolly Parton. Since this challenge involves a group of talented women, I thought choosing a song by a female singer was appropriate. In listening to the song again and again, one thing that stood out to me was the way Dolly sings \"Jolene\" throughout the song. She starts on a low note and her voice raises every time she croons \"Jolene\". This repetitive chorus throughout the song inspired me to construct a pattern with highs and lows. Because the origins of the song are country, I also wanted the pattern to be reminiscent of a quilt.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>*Printed with enthusiasm by <a href=\"http://swashpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SWASH</a>*</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://swashpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://www.pixology.is/wind-images/swash.jpg\" alt=\"SWASH\" border=\"0\" /></a>","options":[{"id":27872879,"name":"Default","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":6.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/87345782/-/Jolene.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/87345782/-/Jolene.jpg","width":720,"height":720}],"artists":[{"id":166187,"name":"Char Davidson","permalink":"char-davidson","url":"/artist/char-davidson"}],"categories":[{"id":4113864,"name":"Letterpress Prints","permalink":"letterpress-prints","url":"/category/letterpress-prints"}]},{"id":9014015,"name":"Where is the Love?","permalink":"where-is-the-love","position":3,"price":38.0,"default_price":38.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/where-is-the-love","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-18T20:16:47.000Z","description":"10\" x 10\" Letterpress Print\r\nNumbered + limited edition (50)\r\nPrinted on Crane's Lettra, 110lb Pearl White paper\r\nPart of <a href=\"http://www.womenindesign.co/collection-one\">Collection One</a>\r\n\r\nDesigned by <strong>Deborah Brown</strong>\r\nGood Luck Place\r\n<a href=\"http://www.goodluckplace.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.goodluckplace.com</a>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.pixologyrules.com/wind-images/deborah-brown.jpg\" />\r\n\"I consider the song I chose both brutal and beautiful. It's a rap by The Black Eyed Peas and it decries the state of the chaotic and cold post-9/11 world, pleading with us to make it better. It cuts right through me emotionally, but also gets me up dancing, which is a great combination.\r\n\r\nI wanted to try to capture the duality, of something rough, dark and ominous against something light and elegant and airy. I depicted love playing peekaboo behind the thick black letters – hidden, but always there.\r\n\r\nI love language: words, type, calligraphy and graffiti, and tried to portray a kind of rawness and power that I feel in the music. I typically work with more color and with painting and collage, so this minimal palette and the medium of letterpress were new challenges. \r\n\r\nThe fonts I used for this composition are Rockwell Extra Bold, originally produced in 1910 as Litho Antique by the Inland type foundry, and later, with new weights added, by the Monotype Corporation in 1934. and Dorchester Script, also from Monotype, released in 1939.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>*Printed with enthusiasm by <a href=\"http://swashpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SWASH</a>*</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://swashpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://www.pixology.is/wind-images/swash.jpg\" alt=\"SWASH\" border=\"0\" /></a>","options":[{"id":28262531,"name":"Default","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":6.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/90257222/-/where-is-the-love.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/90257222/-/where-is-the-love.jpg","width":720,"height":720}],"artists":[{"id":166379,"name":"Deborah Brown","permalink":"deborah-brown","url":"/artist/deborah-brown"}],"categories":[{"id":4113864,"name":"Letterpress Prints","permalink":"letterpress-prints","url":"/category/letterpress-prints"}]},{"id":9140684,"name":"Aeolus","permalink":"aeolus","position":4,"price":38.0,"default_price":38.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/aeolus","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-01-25T22:55:47.000Z","description":"10\" x 10\" Letterpress Print\r\nNumbered + limited edition (50)\r\nPrinted on Crane's Lettra, 110lb Pearl White paper\r\nPart of <a href=\"http://www.womenindesign.co/collection-one\">Collection One</a>\r\n\r\nDesigned by <strong>Cristy Bittencourt</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.cristybdesign.com.br/en\" target=\"_blank\">www.cristybdesign.com.br</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/CristyBDesign\" target=\"_blank\">@CristyBDesign</a>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.pixologyrules.com/wind-images/cristy-bittencourt.jpg\" />\r\n\"I came across the song <em>Aeolus</em> by Freelance Whales on Youtube and it just felt so magical.
