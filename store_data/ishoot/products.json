This video is small, but the actual workshop is 1280x720 HD.\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/47809015\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/47809015\">Preview - Photoshop Workshop</a> \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in this product, please read ALL the information below!\r\n\r\n<i>Intro to Photoshop</i> is an online video workshop!  Learn at your own pace, from the comfort of your own home, anywhere around the world.  Heck, you could even be in your PJs watching the workshop at 11pm!  This is 3 hours of instruction, but it will take approximately 6 hours to complete the workshop because you will need to pause and practice using Photoshop on your computer throughout the video.  You can choose the day you would like to do the workshop, so register whenever is good for you!\r\n\r\nDo you have Photoshop but are so overwhelmed with all the buttons and tools that you don’t know where to start?  Or, does the idea of using Photoshop to enhance your images intrigue you, but you’ve never taken the leap to try it out? Either way, this workshop is for you!  General computer knowledge is necessary, but no knowledge about using Photoshop is required.\r\n\r\nSome of the topics covered:  menus, tools, layers and masks, adjusting colors and converting to black & white, creating composite images and more.  Participants should have Photoshop (CS3/CS4/CS5/CS6) installed and working prior to the workshop.  You can download a 30 day trial for free at www.adobe.com (You may want to wait until shortly before you register for the workshop to download the trial so you will still have time to practice what you’ve learned after the workshop, before the trial expires).  CS5 will be used to demonstrate, but things will be very similar in other versions.  If you have Photoshop Elements, you will be able to transfer your new knowledge to using that program as well, but the layout and buttons will be slightly different.  Since you can pause and playback the workshop, you'll have time to find corresponding menus and tools in the version of the program you have and then re-watch sections of the workshop to clarify.\r\n\r\nYou will receive a link to the HD video, and a password to gain access to view it.  Your password is valid for 1 day, during which time you can watch the workshop as many times as you'd like.  \r\n\r\nThe regular workshop registration is $59.  For only $1 more you get a $50 credit to <i> I Shoot </i> to use towards a purchase!  Or, you can think of it as purchasing a $50 credit to <i>I Shoot</i> and getting access to the workshop for only $10.  Either way, it's a great deal! \r\n\r\nAfter you register by paying the registration fee below, please email me using the contact form on the website to schedule the day you would like to do the workshop - please specify 2 days that will work for you, in case one day is not available for some reason.  Please register at least 2 days before the day you would like to gain access, to allow enough time for us to arrange your viewing.  You will receive an email with the workshop information, link and password late the night before the day you register for.  You will receive the $50 credit code in the email with your password;  it will be valid for 1 month and can be used towards any purchase greater than $50.\r\n\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of this workshop, there are no refunds or password extensions for any reason, including program or technical difficulties (for example, you get error messages with your version of Photoshop, or your computer crashes), a change in your schedule, or unforeseen circumstances.  This is industry standard for digital products.  Thank you for understanding. \r\nWhen you purchase access to the Intro to Photoshop workshop you are purchasing a non-transferable, non-exclusive right to access the video. You may not publish or share the video or your password with anyone else.  All advice is provided \"as is\" with no warranties or indemnities as to its appropriateness for your particular situation.  I am not able to provide technical support/assistance.  \r\nBy registering, you are agreeing to the payment terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":24150120,"name":"Default","price":60.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/75314196/-/Preview_image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/75314196/-/Preview_image.jpg","width":515,"height":286}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2694741,"name":"Other","permalink":"other","url":"/category/other"}]},{"id":5041037,"name":"Wristband - I Shoot RAW","permalink":"wristbands","position":22,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wristbands","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-12-09T03:38:36.000Z","description":"Adult size (8”), 100% high quality silicone.
