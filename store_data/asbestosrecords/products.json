Their latest EP,\r\nsimply entitled “Maker”, is a testament to their hard\r\nwork and dedication as songwriters and musicians.\r\n\r\nThe “Maker” EP is being released on November 13th\r\nthrough Engineer records in the UK/Europe and will\r\nbe distributed in the U.S.A by Asbestos Records. This 5\r\nsong EP showcases the maturity they have been striving\r\nto hit ever since they started Maker in a Massachusetts\r\nbasement some few years ago.\r\n\r\n“Maker” is the follow up to last years critically\r\nacclaimed full length “Mirrors”, which was released\r\non CD/Digital on 6131 records and on vinyl via Animal\r\nStyle records, respectively. They recorded this new\r\nEP at Zing Studios in Westfield, MA with the help of\r\nproducer/engineer Eric Arena (A Day To Remember,\r\nFarewell To Freeway, The Modern Day Saint) and Jim\r\nFogarty (The Devil Wears Prada, All That Remains,\r\nArrows Over Athens). They recently shot a video for\r\ntheir first single “Shadows” with director Rob Soucy\r\n(Make Do And Mend, Defeater, A Loss For Words) and\r\njust finished up a UK tour with platinum recording\r\nartist Hawthorne Heights. From November 16th-\r\nDecember 23rd they are heading out on a full US tour\r\nwith Major League (No Sleep Records) and Turnover\r\n(Run For Cover Records).\r\n\r\nMaker has been known for their relentless touring\r\nprowess and is poised to finally create their own niche\r\nof Indie infused pop-punk and become a staple in the\r\nmusic scene.

The band along with Eric Sanderson of the Brooklyn based band Pela, spent the next few months working in the studio perfecting each song. The plan was to release an album that would allow the listener to experience a story from start to finish, whatever their interpretation would be. The Unmistakable Man delivers immense and precisec orchestration, and is reflective of their energetic live show, this music will stand the test of time. \r\n\r\n\"Though from the Jersey Shore, River City Extension boasts a welcome worldly sound. Hints of the classic \"Jersey Shore sound\" (pioneered by Bruce Springsteen and Southside Johnny And The Asbury Jukes) color their songs, yet the band borrows liberally from Americana, mariachi, blues and calypso to create a compellingly distinct hybrid all their own.\"\r\n- Alternative Press \r\n\r\n“Think of it like this: if Beck, The Avett Brothers, and the Sex Pistols got caught in a toxic ooze, mutating them into a single musical entity, you’d be left with River City Extension.” \r\n- Eastern Surf Magazine\r\n\r\n\"River City Extension sing about all the timeless things: religion, love and death, with just as much forlornness. As Joe Michelini dons his Christopher-Nolan’s-Joker-sings-Bright-Eyes voice and the rest of the 8 member troupe take up everything from trumpets to cellos, the group faces intense pressure to produce something emotional, something witty - something good.\"\r\n- AbsolutePunk.net\r\n\r\n\"Singer, songwriter and de facto bandleader Joe Michelini conveys both the deeply personal and universal equally well in whispers and shrieks. Although he would likely shy away from the comparison, not since Springsteen's \"The Wild, The Innocent and The E Street Shuffle\" has a New Jersey songwriter written such a thrilling testimonial to youthful idealism-- victorious, romantic and majestic.\"\r\n- Asbury Park Press\r\n\r\n1st pressing\r\nBlack Viny l-  limited to 100 copies (mailorder only!)\r\nWhite Vinyl - Limited to 400 copies\r\n\r\n2nd pressing\r\nClear Vinyl with Black Smoke - limited to 100 copies\r\nWhite w/Blue Smoke & Blue w/Black Smoke - limited to 400 copies\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":9752859,"name":"Black Vinyl (1st press)","price":16.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":9752860,"name":"White Vinyl (1st press)","price":16.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":11607978,"name":"Clear w/ Black Smoke (2nd press)","price":16.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":11607980,"name":"White/Blue & Blue/Black (2nd Press)","price":16.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":10.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26932561/-/rivercityextension.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26932561/-/rivercityextension.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":46523,"name":"River City Extension","permalink":"river-city-extension","url":"/artist/river-city-extension"}],"categories":[{"id":433941,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"},{"id":434011,"name":"Asbestos Records","permalink":"asbestos-records","url":"/category/asbestos-records"}]},{"id":5924661,"name":"River City Extension - Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Go Down on Your Anger 2xLP","permalink":"river-city-extension-don-t-let-the-sun-go-down-on-your-anger-2xlp","position":31,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/river-city-extension-don-t-let-the-sun-go-down-on-your-anger-2xlp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-13T07:07:33.000Z","description":"Something happens when these eight people come together. Put them on a stage, and something larger than even this relatively large band blossoms, ecstatic and cathartic and inspiring. And like the songs on River City Extension's second album, Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Your Anger, it may not hit you over the head from the first moment; rather, it's a journey. It sneaks up on you as these songs breathe and grow and change -- as apt a microcosm of life as any you'll find in music. \r\n\r\n\"Half of this record is love songs, and the other half is 'I'm sorry that I fucked up' songs,\" says singer/songwriter/guitarist Joe Michelini. Such compellingly forthright new tunes as \"If You Need Me Back In Brooklyn,\" \"Slander,\" \"Down, Down, Down\" and \"Point of Surrender\" confront thorny issues of personal and spiritual struggle in a manner that's both intimate and illuminating, while the band drives home Michelini's hard-won lyrical insights with evocative arrangements that make inventive use of a wide range of instruments and sonic textures. \r\n\r\nThis beautiful 2XLP comes in a gatefold jacket complete with poster insert! \r\n\r\nPressing info:\r\nBlack 2xLP  /100\r\nClear 2xLP /400","options":[{"id":18967837,"name":"Black Vinyl","price":20.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19423381,"name":"Clear Vinyl","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19423383,"name":"Both Colors!","price":38.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":8.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":12.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58168903/-/river-city-extension-cover2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58168903/-/river-city-extension-cover2.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":46523,"name":"River City Extension","permalink":"river-city-extension","url":"/artist/river-city-extension"}],"categories":[{"id":433941,"name":"Vinyl","permalink":"vinyl","url":"/category/vinyl"},{"id":434011,"name":"Asbestos Records","permalink":"asbestos-records","url":"/category/asbestos-records"}]},{"id":5172341,"name":"Infamous Jake & The Pinstripe Mafia - This is the Beginning of the End LP","permalink":"infamous-jake-the-pinstripe-mafia-this-is-the-beginning-of-the-end-lp","position":33,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/infamous-jake-the-pinstripe-mafia-this-is-the-beginning-of-the-end-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-01-03T02:28:09.000Z","description":"From 2000-2003, Infamous Jake & The Pinstripe Mafia dominated the Western Mass scene.

The two bands were attached at the hip, touring together and even sharing members. Infamous Jake borrowed Joe Watts on trombone and TFT abducted Dan and Matt on trumpet and drums (respectively). Later Andy and Ethan of TFT would join forces with Dan and Matt to create Kill Normal Records which would release CDs for both bands as well as many others.

Santa Ana, California’s Suburban Legends took this to a whole new level in the years surrounding this release. Ridiculously complicated choreographed stage performances, and managing to play over 1000 sets in a single calendar year (performing over 960 shows: multiple sets a day at Disneyland, aside from their own rigorous touring schedule) is one hell of a way to show your dedication. If you've ever see them live, they get the crowd dancing just as hard as they are, and very few bands can even come close to their energy level.

This was absolutely not the case with NYC's Pilfers. Featuring ex-Toasters Coolie Ranx (who also managed to perform guest vox on seemingly every 3rd wave bands album in the late 90’s), Bim Skala Bim's Vinny Nobile on co-lead vocals and trombone, the rythm section from NYC's Skinnerbox: Anna Milat-Meyer, on bass & drummer James Blanck, and guitarist Nick Bacon from The Erratics. This band pioneered a reggae/ska/punk hybrid unlike anything that had come before. Their self released album is simply a masterpiece which stands as one of the brightest moments of the 90's Ska Revival, and the combination of two of the genre's most enigmatic frontmen made their live show unbelievable.

The Rudiments were light years ahead of anyone else musically and hadn’t even yet reached their fullest potential; and the Suicide Machines were on the cusp of reaching their breakthrough moment leading to their now legendary status as well. The stars were lining up for both bands and this small document has been a beloved release for both labels involved and we wanted to wrestle this back from the brink of obscurity, shine it up and re-release it to the world. So we’re finally making that happen. It’s been mastered by Dave Eck at Lucky Lacquers and the cover art got a bit of remixing as well by the ever talented Todd S.
