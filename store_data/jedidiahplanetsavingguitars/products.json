Built with a Lutz spruce soundboard, Norwegian Maple back and sides it has a crisp and focused sound with astonishingly quick response. It is evenly balanced up and down the neck with soul-centering bass tones and bell like trebles. It’s strong voice will project sufficiently to fill up an auditorium, yet is so responsive that it will sing at the lightest touch.\r\n\r\nFor more images: http://jedidiah.ca\r\n\r\nSpecs: Scale Length 650mm <br>Body Length 502mm <br>Lower bout: 385mm <br>Upper bout: 292mm <br>Body Depth at lower bout: 100mm <br>Overall length: 102cm</br>","options":[{"id":10366589,"name":"\"OM\" Orchestra Model Guitar","price":3500.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29193247/-/p7305779.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29193247/-/p7305779.jpg","width":800,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1757891,"name":"Guitars","permalink":"guitars","url":"/category/guitars"},{"id":1757981,"name":"Acoustic Guitar","permalink":"acoustic-guitar","url":"/category/acoustic-guitar"},{"id":1757983,"name":"Environmental","permalink":"environmental","url":"/category/environmental"},{"id":1757985,"name":"Eco-Friendly","permalink":"eco-friendly","url":"/category/eco-friendly"},{"id":1757987,"name":"Sustainable","permalink":"sustainable","url":"/category/sustainable"}]},{"id":3012239,"name":"\"OM\" Cutaway Fanned Fret Guitar","permalink":"om-cutaway-fanned-fret-guitar","position":2,"price":3800.0,"default_price":3800.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/om-cutaway-fanned-fret-guitar","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-12-11T08:12:19.000Z","description":"If you play in Drop D or other altered tunings then my multi-scale or “Fan-Fret” OM guitar is for you! The longer bass side takes ordinary guitar design and opens up infinite possibilities for rich, powerful bass. Shorter treble strings allow the production of high tones so sweet you can taste them. As with all my guitars this guitar is responsive and perfectly balanced from string to string. Although this guitar is designed to astonish the crowds with finger-style playing it is extremely versatile and lends its uncompromising palate to any style of music.\r\nBuilt to order.\r\n\r\nFor more images, visit: http://jedidiah.ca\r\n\r\nSpecs:\r\nScale Length: 650mm \r\nBody Length: 502mm \r\nBody width: Lower bout: 385mm \r\nBody width: Upper bout: 292mm \r\nBody Depth at lower bout: 100mm \r\nOverall length: 103cm","options":[{"id":10368487,"name":"\"OM\" Cutaway Fanned Fret Guitar","price":3800.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29199351/-/p7305743.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29199351/-/p7305743.jpg","width":450,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1757891,"name":"Guitars","permalink":"guitars","url":"/category/guitars"},{"id":1757981,"name":"Acoustic Guitar","permalink":"acoustic-guitar","url":"/category/acoustic-guitar"},{"id":1757983,"name":"Environmental","permalink":"environmental","url":"/category/environmental"},{"id":1757985,"name":"Eco-Friendly","permalink":"eco-friendly","url":"/category/eco-friendly"},{"id":1757987,"name":"Sustainable","permalink":"sustainable","url":"/category/sustainable"}]},{"id":3012231,"name":"Audaices Classical Guitar","permalink":"audaices-classical-guitar","position":3,"price":3500.0,"default_price":3500.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/audaices-classical-guitar","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-12-11T08:07:07.000Z","description":"This guitar contains classical bracing but encompasses several generations of guitar modifications.
