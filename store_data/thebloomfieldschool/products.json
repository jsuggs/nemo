We will have your rings cast into the metal of your choice for the second class, and you will do some metal working to clean up and finish the surface of your creations.\r\n\r\nThe course fee includes all materials except the cost of casting which will be on a ring-by-ring basis.

Techniques may include stones setting, riveting, incorporating found materials, chain making, hollow construction, casting, plating, surface finishing, and more. If you have bits and pieces that you’ve always wanted to make into something special, or a design in mind that you’ve never been able to find, bring those ideas along!\r\n\r\nIn this class, all tools and supplies for learning basic techniques such as soldering and wax working are provided.
