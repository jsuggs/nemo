The design is gender-neutral and may be worn by both girl and boy babies. Soft padded and very comfortable, have no exposed seams inside for baby footie comfort and easy to put, yet not so easy to kick off.\r\n\r\nMaterials:\r\nInside fabric 100% cotton\r\nOutside fabric 100% cotton\r\n\r\nFinished Sizes:\r\nSize 1 (0-3 months) 4.0 inches\r\nSize 2 (3-6 months) 4.25 inches\r\nSize 3 (6-9 months) 4.5 inches\r\nSize 4 (9-12 months) 4.75 inches (black or white Non-Slip gripping bottoms)\r\nSize 5 (12-18 months) 5.0 inches (black or white Non-Slip gripping bottoms)\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also choose custom order to pick the prefect color match for your little one.\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/170284902/baby-sneakers-custom-order-colorful?\r\n\r\nNeed a different size? Just ask! I would love to make shoes exactly right for your little one.\r\n\r\nYour ordered shoes will be ready to ship in 3-5 business days.\r\nProducts come from a smoke & pet free home.\r\n\r\nThese sizes are the average length of babies’ feet. Your baby’s feet may be longer or shorter than average. If you are able, be sure to measure your baby’s feet before you choose the size to make. Measure the foot from the tip of the big toe to the end of the heel. If your baby’s foot is in between two sizes, make the larger size.\r\n\r\nBecause these shoes will be sewn by me and not in a factory, the actual finished sized may be a slightly different.\r\n\r\nIf you are unsure of the size of the feet of the baby that you are ordering the shoes for (if they are a gift), you may want to order one size larger. This will ensure that the shoes will definitely fit the baby now... or for sure a little later.\r\n\r\nThese shoes are intended for indoor use or for keeping your baby a little warmer and fashionable when in their stroller. The shoes are not intended for outdoor use, as they would get worn out very quickly.\r\n\r\nCONTINUE LOOKING AT MY SHOP:\r\nhttp://www.etsy.com/shop/ricebabyshop","options":[{"id":48814344,"name":"Size 1 (0-3 months) 4.0 inches","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48814347,"name":"Size 2 (3-6 months) 4.25 inches","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48814350,"name":"Size 3 (6-9 months) 4.5 inches","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48814353,"name":"Size 4 (9-12 months) 4.75 inches","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":48814356,"name":"Size 5 (12-18 months) 5.0 inches","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":18,"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HK"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128057652/-/03.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128057652/-/03.jpg","width":1500,"height":1155}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6624768,"name":"Baby Shoes","permalink":"baby-shoes","url":"/category/baby-shoes"},{"id":6728658,"name":"Colorful World","permalink":"colorful-world","url":"/category/colorful-world"}]},{"id":14735043,"name":"Handmade Baby Shoes - Black and White Strips - Baby Booties","permalink":"handmade-baby-shoes-black-and-white-strips-baby-booties","position":2,"price":24.99,"default_price":24.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/handmade-baby-shoes-black-and-white-strips-baby-booties","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-11-09T20:15:46.000Z","description":"Handmade Baby Shoes - Black and White Strips - 100% Handmade by me\r\n\r\nThis beautiful Baby Shoes is made of high quality cotton fabric with elastic at the heel to keep baby from kicking them off.
