Done in shades of blue and white I wanted a healing energy to come through in this bag. I used labradorite, lapis, and moonstone in the neck strap and hematite and labradorite in the fringe. This is a very soothing bag that will provide a lot of healing to the wearer. It measures 14 inches exact from the clasp to the end of the fringe. Any questions? Just ask!!!","options":[{"id":49918398,"name":"Default","price":55.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128865201/-/IMG_0499.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128865201/-/IMG_0499.JPG","width":553,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6829122,"name":"Amulet Bags","permalink":"amulet-bags","url":"/category/amulet-bags"}]},{"id":15350199,"name":"Tiger's Eye and Blood Stone Mala","permalink":"tiger-s-eye-and-blood-stone-mala","position":2,"price":68.0,"default_price":68.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/tiger-s-eye-and-blood-stone-mala","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-05T13:56:54.000Z","description":"This is a blood stone and tiger's eye mala done in the traditional 108 count style.
