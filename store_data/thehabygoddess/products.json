You can raid your stash or buy new— try to have about 6 different fabrics (fat quarters) for the houses. Use smaller scraps for chimneys, doors, etc. You will need several shades of green (these strips need to be 6” x 30” long to span the length of the pillow.) Have any fabrics with bold bird prints or crazy flowers you’ve been saving? They make great appliqués. Maybe you want to use earth-tones or pastels? Go with your gut! \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you will need:\r\n\r\n• 1/2 yard of fabric for the sky background \r\n• 1/2 yard each of two bold prints to create the envelope pillow back (choose either quilting cotton or home dec weight.) \r\n• 1/2 yard of muslin to create the quilt sandwich \r\n• 1 yard of cotton batting \r\n• Your favorite green thread and assorted other colors \r\n• Tracing paper
