Greer mixes anachronistic pseudo-history and unserious/serious digressions into pop culture, pop physics, pop philosophy and pop music (see: the title), to arrive at something both universal in scope and intensely personal, twisting language(s) into sometimes-strange shapes to devise new ways of looking at familiar things. \r\n\r\nEverything Flows also features the art of Guided by Voices front man Robert Pollard.  Besides being known as one of today's most prolific song-writers, Mr. Pollard's irrespressible creativity has been an inspiration to many.  His stunning color collages make a fantastic compliment to Mr. Greer's writing\r\n\r\n\"James Greer writes within the grand tradition of American postmodern, pessimistic, philosophic geniuses. Like William Gass or Guy Davenport, he unites sly humor, erudition, and a certain classical cast of mind, as aware of Heraclitus as he is of Teenage Fanclub. These stories are remarkable. They’re also a total freaking blast.\" -- Mathew Specktor, author, American Dream Machine, senior editor, Los Angeles Review of Books\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Greer is the author of the novels Artificial Light (LHotB/Akashic 2006) and The Failure (Akashic 2010), and the non-fiction book Guided By Voices: A Brief History (Grove Press), a biography of a band for which he played bass guitar. He’s written or co-written movies for Lindsay Lohan, Jackie Chan, and Steven Soderbergh, among others. He is a Contributing Editor for the Los Angeles Review of Books, and plays guitar and sings in a new band called Détective after the Godard film of that name.\r\n\r\nRead more about the book <a href=\"http://www.curbsidesplendor.com/curbside/books/everything-flows\">here</a>\r\n\r\nPre-order now and receive free shipping to locations in the U.S.","options":[{"id":20825481,"name":"Default","price":14.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64344241/-/EverythingFlows_Cover_v3-3_-_Blue_WEB_v2.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64344241/-/EverythingFlows_Cover_v3-3_-_Blue_WEB_v2.JPG","width":725,"height":931},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64344283/-/James_Greer.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64344283/-/James_Greer.jpg","width":642,"height":637},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/73124933/-/Robert_Pollard_-_Everything_Flows.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/73124933/-/Robert_Pollard_-_Everything_Flows.JPG","width":465,"height":649}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1636693,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":10491358,"name":"ACM Issue 51","permalink":"acm-issue-51","position":14,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/acm-issue-51","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-04-11T20:38:29.000Z","description":"POETRY / FICTION / NON-FICTION BY:  JEFFREY ALLEN, KAREN AN-HWEI LEE, MELISSA BARRETT, LORI BRACK, JOHN COLBURN, ELIZABETH J.
