Gorgeous black onyx stones were added to complete the modern, geometric look. These natural onyx stones have a great triangular shape and an earthy matte finish.\r\n\r\nThey measure 2-1/2” in length and 1-1/4” in width (at the widest point), and will hang for a total length of approx. 2-7/8\" from the top of the yellow bronze ear wires. The earrings are signed on the back with my initials.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":44700561,"name":"Default","price":45.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.95,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125314113/-/ear_2_flip_CROP.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125314113/-/ear_2_flip_CROP.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125195640/-/ear_4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125195640/-/ear_4.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125314203/-/ear_1-a.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125314203/-/ear_1-a.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6338292,"name":"Earrings","permalink":"earrings","url":"/category/earrings"}]}]
