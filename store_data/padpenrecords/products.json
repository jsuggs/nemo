Having been busy trying to \r\nmake a name for himself with his two previous releases, Friis is now \r\nback with his third LP The Road To Nashville. Where his PIAS released \r\ndebut Mutineer had been a debutants attempt at making a modern country \r\nrecord performed and delivered with tight arrangements, Friis' second \r\nLP Tennessee Theft saw a more traditional approach to record making. \r\nRecorded live in the studio Tennessee Theft had a more animated and \r\nlively sound, something Friis was to develop further on his next \r\neffort. In January 2010 he went to Varispeed Studios in southern \r\nSweden to record TRTN. Recorded in just two days, the album showcases \r\na more soulful and more playful Friis. Along with his usual gang of \r\nmusicians he also introduces the addition of a trumpet, most evident \r\non the title track. The track, among the strongest on the album, \r\nreminisces Mexican Mariachi with it's tight horn riffs. \r\nIt might be fair to say that his first two releases were Alt \r\nCountry albums, but this time around Friis crosses the bounderies of \r\ngenre and reveals a new take on American Music. One that, despite the \r\ntitle, drips with nordic mournfulness.\r\n\r\nTrackliste: \r\n01 - I Tried To Tell You Why \r\n02 - The Road To Nashville \r\n03 - Time Changes Everything \r\n04 - Rolling Seas \r\n05 - Everything's Ruined \r\n06 - Birdy Blues \r\n07 - Lions \r\n08 - A Smiling Face \r\n09 - Paper Moon \r\n10 - These Two Hands","options":[{"id":16658407,"name":"cd","price":120.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":35.0,"amount_with_others":15.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50406313/-/Emil_cover_web.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50406313/-/Emil_cover_web.jpg","width":590,"height":588}],"artists":[{"id":97825,"name":"Emil Friis","permalink":"emil-friis","url":"/artist/emil-friis"}],"categories":[{"id":2714175,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
