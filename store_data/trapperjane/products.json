Made-to-order in sizes 2-14(US). 5 Pockets jeans, Zipper fly, 5 buttons, single needle construction, hand sewn button holes. Can be hemmed to your desired length. Please note that apart from hemming, these jeans are not custom tailored. I am however available for a fitting consultation should you be unsure as to your size.\r\n\r\nWho will these jeans fit? Bodies with a 10\" to 11\" difference between their true waist and hip measurements. True waist is measured at base of rib cage, hip measurement is taken horizontally across the hip crease (where legs meet torso) and around base of bum. If your torso were to be shaped like a pear, measure at the bottom of the pear. If these jeans are to fit, this tape placement should yield your largest measurement. More suited for women with wider, broad hips than larger backsides.\r\n\r\nThe fit is for a 'misses' size range.","options":[{"id":17845453,"name":"Size 2, 8 oz.
