We will be taking them on Breakfast TV tomorrow morning (Wednesday December 18th), and will be photographing and listing them in the late afternoon on Wednesday. \r\n\r\nWe have long loved the look of vintage pewter goblets, but cannot <i>really</i> imagine drinking wine out of them...so we decided to turn them into objets that can be used in another way and actually enjoyed as part of our (and your) decor.\r\n\r\nOur new soy candles look gorgeous in vintage pewter/silver/brass goblets, and are richly scented with an organic essential oil mix. These have a beautiful tarnished vintage patina, and a few are even engraved from previous owners (we think that makes them even better).\r\n\r\nWe love soy candles as much for their gentle glow and creamy color as for the fact that soy is sustainable, while paraffin candles are derived from non-renewable petroleum resources.\r\n\r\nSoy wax is also water soluble, so once you have burned the candle down you can wash the container with hot water and use it once again. If you would prefer a refill, get in touch with us via the contact page and we will pour you a new candle for a lower fee.\r\n\r\nAlso see our smaller vintage goblet soy candles, and glass goblet candles, for more beauties...\r\n\r\nScents and containers available (keep coming back - as these ones sell, new ones will be uploaded so the listing should always be current):\r\n\r\n1. basil, bergamot, sweet orange, rose blend in brass goblet - 5\" high/3\" diameter (1 only)\r\n2. lavender, rose, rose geranium blend in brass goblet - 7\" high/3\" diameter (1 only)\r\n3. basil, bergamot, sweet orange, rose blend in brass goblet - 5 3/4\" high/3\" diameter (1 only)\r\n4. lavender, rose, rose geranium blend in brass goblet - 7\" high/3\" diameter (3 available)\r\n5. lavender, rose, rose geranium blend in brass goblet - 6\" high/3\" diameter (2 available)\r\n\r\n<b>SHIPPING NOTE</b> -- At this time we are unable to tailor shipping fees per province or state, and just have a Canada-wide and USA-wide fee.

Something else we'd put our money on? These toothpicks from Daneson are the most satisfying way to get the job done.\r\n\r\nA recipe with barrel aged Islay single malt scotch from a 200 year old distillery is what makes the Single Malt Nº16 special.  Unhurried, it imbues a subtle boozy peaty flavour when warmed in the mouth after several minutes.  To be clear, if you're not a scotch drinker you will likely not pick up on the subtlety of a Nº 16 because it is literally soaked with premium single malt then kiln dried leaving behind flavors deep in the wood of the toothpick.\r\n\r\nDaneson founder Peter Smith puts it best: <i> \"A toothpick is more than just a toothpick.

Each bottle has a minimum of 12 toothpicks but you might get a bonus one or two as well. \r\n\r\nFlavors available:\r\n\r\n<b>Mint Nº 9</b> is a blend of natural oils from several mint varieties along with peppermint, and a touch of wintergreen with sweet fennel.  \r\n\r\n<b>CinnaMint Nº 7</b> combine the traditional flavor of cinnamon with a subtle hint of raw mint, creating a sweet sensation that blends nicely with the warming heat of cinnamon. \r\n \r\n<b>Lemon Nº 11</b> California lemon essential oil meets a mix of other herbs, and the result is Amalfi, gin and tonic and lemonade blended as one.\r\n  ","options":[{"id":46124145,"name":"Mint Nº 9","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46124148,"name":"CinnaMint Nº 7","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":46124151,"name":"Lemon Nº 11","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126093138/-/No_9_Daneson.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126093138/-/No_9_Daneson.jpg","width":2400,"height":3600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126093171/-/No_7_Daneson.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126093171/-/No_7_Daneson.jpg","width":2400,"height":3600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126093423/-/No_11_Daneson.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126093423/-/No_11_Daneson.jpg","width":2400,"height":3600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126093543/-/Screen_shot_2013-10-18_at_2.49.25_PM.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126093543/-/Screen_shot_2013-10-18_at_2.49.25_PM.png","width":296,"height":182},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126093885/-/Screen_shot_2013-10-18_at_2.56.08_PM.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126093885/-/Screen_shot_2013-10-18_at_2.56.08_PM.png","width":367,"height":158}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6853557,"name":"CHRISTMAS FOR HIM","permalink":"christmas-for-him","url":"/category/christmas-for-him"},{"id":6853566,"name":"CHRISTMAS STOCKING STUFFERS","permalink":"christmas-stocking-stuffers","url":"/category/christmas-stocking-stuffers"},{"id":3808951,"name":"Helpful & handy","permalink":"helpful-handy","url":"/category/helpful-handy"},{"id":5103775,"name":"Personal care","permalink":"personal-care","url":"/category/personal-care"}]},{"id":15291786,"name":"Vintage milk glass Irish Coffee mugs ","permalink":"vintage-milk-glass-irish-coffee-mugs","position":15,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/vintage-milk-glass-irish-coffee-mugs","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-03T06:12:56.000Z","description":"We have a feeling that it will be very difficult to let go of some of the awesome vintage items that we or our extended team of hunters have come across. \r\n\r\nThis is 100% true with this, our first offering in our new DGS Vintage section.

We drink Chamomile tea for its calming effects, and this soap has much the same effect on the skin. It softens, calms and conditions.

Enjoy the tightening effect of the egg whites, knowing that the chamomile tea is soothing and softening your skin at the same time. Rinse. Glow!\r\n\r\n1.85oz\r\n\r\nSOLD OUT!

And we do NOT want to know how that happened!\r\n\r\nNo chemical detergents to bother your skin, system and the ecosystem - Buncha Farmers All Natural Stain Remover is real soap. It’s made with all-natural, biodegradable ingredients, and enhanced with borax to soften the water and aid the cleaning process. There are no artificial dyes or perfumes, just the fresh, clean scent of natural eucalyptus and the deodorizing power of litsea. It will not discolour clothes or fabrics. \r\n\r\nNOTE: If you encounter a very stubborn stain like blueberry or a baked in stain, you might have to apply the stain remover a couple of times or work at it by hand. It should start to fade and fade until you get it out.\r\n\r\nTIPS: \r\n*Cut or scrape off a little of the bar and throw in with your regular wash, it will energize your laundry load. \r\n*Works Great with Soap Nuts! \r\n*Clean your shoes or remove ink off your leather jacket or purse. \r\n*Melt a little bit in hot water (usually when you do this just use about ¼ to ½ inch of the bar and melt in a pail a quarter full of hot water) and use it to scrub your granite or countertop.      \r\n*The hot water solution is also good for cleaning tiles, bath tubs, toilet bowls, sinks, even your tile or linoleum floors.\r\n*Removes mold from surfaces, especially in your fridge. \r\n*IT IS ALWAYS BEST TO USE HOT WATER WHEN USING BY HAND OR PREPPING FOR THE WASH!","options":[{"id":33123151,"name":"Default","price":4.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":3.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/103934488/-/Screen_shot_2013-04-15_at_9.47.32_PM.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/103934488/-/Screen_shot_2013-04-15_at_9.47.32_PM.png","width":371,"height":142}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6853566,"name":"CHRISTMAS STOCKING STUFFERS","permalink":"christmas-stocking-stuffers","url":"/category/christmas-stocking-stuffers"},{"id":3808951,"name":"Helpful & handy","permalink":"helpful-handy","url":"/category/helpful-handy"},{"id":5078716,"name":"Laundry","permalink":"laundry","url":"/category/laundry"}]},{"id":7515511,"name":"Albatros bookmark","permalink":"albatros-bookmark","position":32,"price":12.5,"default_price":12.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/albatros-bookmark","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-11T08:26:47.000Z","description":"Book lovers unite! iPads, Kindles and e-readers of all kinds may be all the rage today but we are firm believers in the power of print (funny as that may sound, coming from the creators of the born-on-the-interwebs online Delish Magazine). \r\n\r\nIf you are like us and enjoy the smell and texture of a page in your fingers and the heft of a book in your hand (to say nothing of how handsome it looks on your bedside table or bookshelf), then this brand new product is for you.  \r\n\r\nThe Albatros bookmark lets you get lost in the pages of your favorite book...without getting lost in the pages of your favorite book.

Now, make no mistake -- the growlette has half the capacity of its big brother the Growler, but it's no slouch.\r\n\r\nDesigned and manufactured in Portland, OR the growlers are slip cast by hand with the necks carefully trimmed on the potters’ wheel for the tightest of lid fit. They’re cast thick to hold in the cold. \r\n\r\nThe wide mouth ceramic flip top lid with rubber gasket will seal in carbonation keeping your liquids (whatever they may be) cold and crisp for days. \r\n\r\nBeer lovers, bring your growler to a local craft brewery and you can get it filled for under $10.

Lid fits regular size mason jar.\r\n\r\nThe Mason Shaker® is a unique Mason Jar cocktail shaker created by W&P Design, a design and manufacturing firm founded by two best friends raised in the south. The concept for the Mason Shaker® was developed from an obsession with vintage kitchenware (Josh) and an uncanny ability to fashion impromptu drinking tools at a moment’s notice (Eric). After one too many mint juleps poured from a poorly-modified Mason Jar one summer, the idea for a better (and cooler) cocktail shaker hit us like a double shot of bourbon. The Mason Shaker® was born.\r\n\r\nW&P Design\r\nBased out of Brooklyn, NY, W & P Design creates products inspired by combined passions for vintage Americana, southern sensibility, and New York industrialism. From our workshop to your countertop, we strive to bring you unique goods that pay tribute to both bygone American eras and modern usability, while staying true to our Southern roots.","options":[{"id":36676116,"name":"Default","price":36.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":7.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United

As part of The American Heritage Collection celebrating the 100-year anniversary of the first Mason jar developed by the Ball Brothers, Ball has released a limited number of their classic pint-sized Blue jars. Delish General Store is proud to bring them to you!\r\n\r\nWhy blue? From Wikipedia: \r\n\"Most antique jars that are not colorless are a shade of aqua known as \"Ball blue,\" named for the prevalent jar maker. Colored jars were considered better for canning use, as they block some light from reaching the food, which helps to retain flavor and nutritional value longer. \"\r\n\r\nIn addition to canning, these jars also are great for drinks, food and general storage (pantry, office supplies, etc.).
