Often featuring prayers and stories, unique rings were worn as a symbol of status and wealth.\r\n\r\nDavid Loepp and Yutaka Nagai inscribe the verse on each ring as done so by the original artist.  Each ring is sterling silver with a matte finish enhancing the incised black patina and is presented with a parchment copy of the original manuscript.\r\n\r\nAs one of the foremost figures of 20th century literature, Yeats was fascinated with the pagan Irish legends of faeries (fairies).
