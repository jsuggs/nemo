This runner 11\" by 59\" and made of hand-dyed and as-is wools on a linen foundation. It's made of left-over wools with some kind of coordination of colors that seems to just happen. This one is about diamonds, while other runners have triangles or varied shapes as their themes.\r\n\r\n<html xmlns:fb=\"http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml\">\r\n<!-- AddThis Button BEGIN -->\r\n<div class=\"addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style \">\r\n<a class=\"addthis_button_facebook_like\" fb:like:layout=\"button_count\"></a>\r\n</div>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-4e4d60d7077a6573\"></script>\r\n<!-- AddThis Button END -->","options":[{"id":13489593,"name":"Default","price":700.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/39765885/-/waterblue_diamonds_72x600.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/39765885/-/waterblue_diamonds_72x600.jpg","width":600,"height":141},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41979823/-/waterblue_diamonds_detailB72x600.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41979823/-/waterblue_diamonds_detailB72x600.jpg","width":600,"height":211},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41979855/-/waterblue_diamonds_detailA72x600.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41979855/-/waterblue_diamonds_detailA72x600.jpg","width":600,"height":302}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2227423,"name":"Chair Pads & Runners","permalink":"chair-pads-runners","url":"/category/chair-pads-runners"}]},{"id":4052397,"name":"Festive Geometrics","permalink":"festive-geometrics","position":48,"price":600.0,"default_price":600.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/festive-geometrics","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-07-08T04:28:50.000Z","description":"This was the first \"Right to Left\" runner that I made. My original intention was to make a lot of little mats, but I was urged to resist cutting them apart, and make a long runner of somewhat disparate shapes instead and see what happened. This runner measures 13\" high by 44\" wide. It's made of hand-dyed and as-is wools on linen. All of my runners are great on the floor in a hall or at the foot of a bed, but can also be displayed on the wall (using a dowel in a muslin sleeve), hung either vertically or horizontally, as you please.\r\n\r\n<html xmlns:fb=\"http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml\">\r\n<!-- AddThis Button BEGIN -->\r\n<div class=\"addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style \">\r\n<a class=\"addthis_button_facebook_like\" fb:like:layout=\"button_count\"></a>\r\n</div>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-4e4d60d7077a6573\"></script>\r\n<!-- AddThis Button END -->","options":[{"id":13427261,"name":"Default","price":600.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/39537899/-/festive_geometrics_72x600.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/39537899/-/festive_geometrics_72x600.jpg","width":600,"height":200},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41979063/-/festive_geometrics_detailA72x600.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41979063/-/festive_geometrics_detailA72x600.jpg","width":600,"height":450}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2227423,"name":"Chair Pads & Runners","permalink":"chair-pads-runners","url":"/category/chair-pads-runners"}]},{"id":4052403,"name":"Crystals","permalink":"crystals","position":49,"price":625.0,"default_price":625.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/crystals","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-07-08T04:29:32.000Z","description":"Crystals is a long runner (12\" high by 43\" long) that is perfect for the floor in a hallway, or at the foot of the bed. I often hang mine on the wall. I call these rugs (there are four so far) \"Right to Lefts\" because I just start at one end and hook to the other. I do them in order to not think or plan, but to let things happen. I find myself making new shapes and new color combinations that are very spontaneous. I can carry these discoveries back to more planned out rugs, making them more exciting as well.\r\n\r\n<html xmlns:fb=\"http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml\">\r\n<!-- AddThis Button BEGIN -->\r\n<div class=\"addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style \">\r\n<a class=\"addthis_button_facebook_like\" fb:like:layout=\"button_count\"></a>\r\n</div>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-4e4d60d7077a6573\"></script>\r\n<!-- AddThis Button END -->","options":[{"id":13427273,"name":"Default","price":625.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/39537947/-/crystals_72x600.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/39537947/-/crystals_72x600.jpg","width":600,"height":182},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41978919/-/crystals_detailA72x600.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41978919/-/crystals_detailA72x600.jpg","width":600,"height":450},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/41978927/-/crystals_detailB72x600.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/41978927/-/crystals_detailB72x600.jpg","width":600,"height":450}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2227423,"name":"Chair Pads & Runners","permalink":"chair-pads-runners","url":"/category/chair-pads-runners"}]}]
