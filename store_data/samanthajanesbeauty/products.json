Proto-col's pure collagen capsules protect, nourish and firm skin and stimulate the skin's natural production of collagen to help plump fine lines and wrinkles, without the prolonged facial paralysis that is botox.\r\n \r\nCollagen is the natural protein that is made up of amino acids - the natural building blocks of our skin. It is the most abundant structural protein in the body, making up 75% of the total protein of the body, and is found in skin, muscle, tendon and bone.\r\n \r\nAs your natural supply of collagen start to deplete from the age of around 25, taking a collagen supplement can help maintain a youthful complexion and optimum well-being. proto-col collagen capsules stimulate the skin's natural production of collagen and boost skin elasticity. When taken regulary, skin becomes noticeably firmer and fine lines and wrinkles and significantly reduced, and it is believed nail and hair follicles are strengthened by up to 36%. Proto-col is the only collagen supplement available that we are aware of which combines Type I and Type II collagen. This means proto-col collagen capsules benefit skin, hair and nails as well as aiding muscular and joint regeneration, collectively working to release essential amino acids and proteins that work to rebuild skin cells and stimulate the body's collagen production. Clinical studies have proven that taking pre, hydrolysed collagen can have a positive effect for sufferers of arthritis.\r\n\r\nIngredients -\r\nCollagen Hydrolysate, Type I and Type II.\r\nOther ingredients: Hard Gelatine Capsule.\r\nLactose free, gluten free, dairy free.\r\nNot suitable for vegetarians and vegans. \r\nWe do not recommend you take any supplements when pregnant.\r\n \r\nDirections for use: Take three capsules every night, just before going to sleep, as it is during the first 90 minutes of sleep that your body's regeneration process is at its peak.","options":[{"id":30045797,"name":"Default","price":59.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.95,"amount_with_others":1.95,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94359875/-/image.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94359875/-/image.jpg","width":401,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":4622264,"name":"Skin Care","permalink":"skin-care","url":"/category/skin-care"},{"id":4703409,"name":"Proto-col Advanced Skincare","permalink":"proto-col-advanced-skincare","url":"/category/proto-col-advanced-skincare"}]}]
