Loofah Sponges are the dried fruit of a subtropical plant, Luffa aegyptiaca.  They're completely natural, biodegradable and compostable.\r\n\r\nUse in the shower or bath with some hand made soap for a great exfoliating wash.  Wet your Loofah thoroughly to make it soft and pilable, and then work it over your body in gentle, circular motions.  Exfoliating regularly will remove dead surface skin and promote the regeneration of new skin cells.\r\n\r\nYour Loofah comes with a handy looped cord attached so that you can easily hang them up to dry after each use.  Keeping it dry between uses prevents bacteria growth, and keeps it healthy for you to use.\r\n\r\nThese Loofah measure approximately 17cm in length.\r\n\r\nI would recommend that if you're using your Loofah wet in the shower that you replace it after 3 months of use.  As it is biodegradable be sure to throw it into the compost when you're done!\r\n\r\n**  The skin on your face is quite delicate, therefore I recommend you use the Loofah for body exfoliation only.  **","options":[{"id":11090563,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81099957/-/004.2.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81099957/-/004.2.jpeg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/81099921/-/002.2.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/81099921/-/002.2.jpeg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1389221,"name":"Accessories","permalink":"accessories","url":"/category/accessories"}]},{"id":5407397,"name":"Loofah Slices","permalink":"loofah-slices","position":34,"price":1.0,"default_price":1.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/loofah-slices","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-02-06T06:52:12.000Z","description":"Our environmentally friendly, non-toxic loofah are great for a myriad of uses in the home.
