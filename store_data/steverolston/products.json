Watch Emi go from dull, suburban babysitter to eclectic urban art star compliments of one crazy summer.\r\n\r\n\"<i>Author Tamaki and artist Rolston offer a light but charming fantasy for awkward girls everywhere. Emiko, a half-Japanese, half-Caucasian Canadian, is a self-described geek facing a summer of babysitting and isolation. Things change when she stumbles upon an underground performing art scene inspired by Andy Warhols Factory. She eventually takes to the stage, dressed in her grandmothers mod outfits from the 60s, and achieves minor celebrity. Soon, though, Emiko must face the troubling complexities in the lives of her new friends and the consequences of her own questionable actions. \r\n\r\n\"The book offers many of the hallmarks of female coming-of-age tales, including a sensitive romantic interest, betrayal, concern about popularity and the difficult recognition that adult life is not as black and white as one may hope. Unique and modern touches, however, help set the book apart, such as the references to Warhol, ruminations on the nature of art and a lesbian subplot. Rolstons playful, vibrant b&w illustrations bring the characters to life; in particular, Emikos sweet, expressive face conveys her wild swings of emotions as the story progresses.</i>\" -- Publisher's Weekly\r\n\r\nWinner of the 2008 Cybils Award for Best Young Adult Graphic Novel\r\nNominated for the 2009 Joe Shuster Award for Outstanding Artist and the Joe Shuster Comics for Kids Award\r\n\r\nIllustrated by Steve Rolston and written by Mariko Tamaki\r\n176 pages (146 story pages)\r\nBlack and white interior\r\n© 2008\r\n\r\nBook comes autographed by artist Steve Rolston\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://steverolston.com/emiko/emiko_035.jpg\">click for a sneak peek</a>","options":[{"id":9581779,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":7.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/26317706/-/emiko_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/26317706/-/emiko_cover.jpg","width":394,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1624445,"name":"Graphic Novels","permalink":"graphic-novels","url":"/category/graphic-novels"}]},{"id":2726463,"name":"One Bad Day","permalink":"one-bad-day","position":2,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/one-bad-day","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-08-31T10:00:22.000Z","description":"Marie's had bad days before.
