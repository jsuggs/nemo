debut 2008 release from All in the Golden Afternoon...\r\n\r\nthis cd ep is an explosive debut by the texas duo that proves they are a band you are going to want to watch out for in the future. down the rabbit hole we go... picture flying saucer attack, mazzy star, pram and seefeel all getting together for a jam session and you might be close. all in the golden afternoon's fuzzy laid back guitar driven songs are a breath of fresh air and have a way of making you want to take the day off of work to just float away. this wonderful debut ep features 6 songs that flow together seamlessly and leave you begging for more. welcome to wonderland alice! Ltd to 1000 copies. only 600 copies to be distributed. \r\n\r\nreviews:\r\n\"It's been a busy year for Rachel Staggs. Back in February, she released Third Transmission: Meet Me on Echo Echo Terrace with Experimental Aircraft, and the group is reportedly back in the studio recording a new EP. As a member of The Static Silence, she released Found in May. She has a solo project under the name of Rachel Goldstar, which she claims will have some sort of release by the end of the year, as is psychedelic rock band, The Tunnels, whom she plays bass guitar for. And, finally Staggs also has All in the Golden Afternoon. A collaboration with husband Carlos Jackson (also a member of The Tunnels), the duo released a self-titled EP in February and has a full-length LP planned for later in the year.\r\n\r\nGiven that each of these projects all follow the same droning, spacey sound, Rachel's works are all the more impressive. Though the quality level differs between each project, they all have their own merits, and Staggs shows no signs of fatigue or redundancy. All in the Golden Afternoon, yes a reference to the Lewis Caroll poem of the same name, perhaps best exemplifies the range of Staggs' works blurring the lines between the shoegaze of Experimental Aircraft and The Static Silence with the psychedelic rock of The Tunnels.\r\n\r\nA mere twelve minutes in length, All in the Golden Afternoon is a very breezy, delicate record. Opener \"Garden of Live Flowers\" and closer \"The Lion and the Unicorn\" are testament enough to this. Neither track exceeds a minute in length, and seems more interludes than structured songs. Regardless, both pieces are decidedly content, and establish the EP's warm atmosphere rather well. The downcast title track darkens the mood slightly, with ominous guitar jangles and spacey reverb making up the centrepiece of the song. Staggs' breathy, almost nonchalant vocal style contrasts nicely with the instrumentation, producing All in the Golden Afternoon's most foreboding, yet strangely appealing moment. But from \"Anymore Anyway\" on, All in the Golden Afternoon brightens tremendously. A light buzz resonates through the track in conjunction with loud guitars and subtle organ-work. Again, the intimacy of Staggs' vocal work is the most endearing aspect of the song, but the way Staggs and Jackson play off each other's performance is especially impressive. \"Sunshine is Fine\" takes the duo off on a different tangent; the song is a delightful journey through guitar/organ-centric dream-pop. Even without the Staggs' stellar vocal work, the song retains the serene qualities that make All in the Golden Afternoon such a treat to listen to.\r\n\r\nThough All in the Golden Afternoon has its similarities to some of the duo's other projects, that isn't to say that it's a carbon copy. The EP isn't nearly as dense as that of Experimental Aircraft, The Tunnels, or even The Black Angels (whom Staggs played with in 2004), but at the same time, it doesn't quite have the same pop sensibilities as Rachel Goldstar. More or less, it's a simple, relaxing little composition that flows seamlessly from start to finish. In a way, you could consider it a bit of a summer record I suppose (ignoring the fact that it was released in February), but really, All in the Golden Afternoon is more or less just a great album to sit back and chill out to.\" - sputnik.com\r\n\r\n\"The name comes from a hallucinogenic Lewis Carroll poem, but the newly married Rachel Staggs (Experimental Aircraft) and Carlos Jackson (the Shells) have infused their local debut as All in the Golden Afternoon with more looking glass, less rabbit hole. The title track is a reverb cruise through shoegaze's heyday and Ex Air's waves of sound, while the drum-free drone of \"Anymore Anyway\" echoes the Spacemen 3's \"Ecstasy Symphony,\" both marbled down by Staggs' breathy purr. \"Sunshine Is Fine\" is instrumental dream-pop bliss, organ and guitar mirroring each other's feedback, and \"Future Faster Now\" revels in a Stereolab-ish space-pop polish. Bookended by a short intro and outro, \"Garden of Live Flowers\" and \"The Lion and the Unicorn,\" All in the Golden Afternoon's six short songs never quite get to ask Alice, but they're nice aural Xanax in the meantime.\" - austin chronicle\r\n\r\n$10 includes shipping in the United States and Canada\r\n\r\nfor international shipping to countries not listed, please send an email to:\r\nrachelgoldstar -at- yahoo.com","options":[{"id":6587821,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":89,"name":"Croatia (Hrvatska)","code":"HR"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29257241/-/EP_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29257241/-/EP_cover.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1120521,"name":"cds","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":1811701,"name":"all in the golden afternoon 1\" badge","permalink":"all-in-the-golden-afternoon-button-badge","position":3,"price":1.0,"default_price":1.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/all-in-the-golden-afternoon-button-badge","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-03-03T07:50:31.000Z","description":"1 inch black button with white lettering \"all in the golden afternoon\" logo (designed by christian bland)\r\n\r\n$1 includes shipping in the United States and Canada\r\n\r\nfor international shipping to countries not listed, please send an email to:\r\nrachelgoldstar -at- yahoo.com","options":[{"id":6589451,"name":"Default","price":1.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/17326601/-/golden_afternoon_button.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/17326601/-/golden_afternoon_button.jpg","width":800,"height":777}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1120511,"name":"buttons/badges","permalink":"buttons-badges","url":"/category/buttons-badges"}]}]
