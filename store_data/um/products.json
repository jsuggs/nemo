Packaged with black & white artwork, lyrics printed on inverse, in a slim-dvd case.  The addition of the 'bonus' track is an attempt to demonstrate the dynamic of context, progressively, on an even more retrospective level. The point being that the music created under the Unrepentant name resists definition and convention.  I stand by this recording as proof that perseverance transcends time.

In my opinion, they sound like basically Darkthrone if they were French.  Pure evil, raging, cult minimalism, right to the fucking point.  It's all about SATAN and HATE.  I have absolutely no idea what they are screaming/vomiting on these recordings, but its painfully obvious they mean it.  The following is quoted from cd insert and is a better explanation:\r\n\"Thirteen months ago (12/07) I received a very brief letter, postmarked from France, stating that its author was interested in releasing a recording of “hateful blackmetal art” on my Unrepentant Music DIY Label.  Intrigued that such a foreign artist would even know of this obscure label, no less consider it worthy to produce  and release their music, a request was sent for more information about what this mysterious band had in mind, as well as for some audio samples.  Approximately one month later this recording arrived, along with some crude artwork, design instructions, and a “Letter Of Intent” from the band.  I can tell you nothing more about this project other than that it was recorded “during the darkest days of winter 2005 anno satanas on analog devices and left to rot, forgotten” ...damned to obscurity until now.  This is the only “ritual” that I know of to exist, but “several more vile raptures are forthcoming”.  -U.M.(01/09)\"\r\n\r\n“Notus Inlatinus creates anti-christian satanic art exclusively.  No thanks to anyone, to hell with all.  Do not contact us, we are deaf to your words.  Infernal Hails to Unrepentant Music for conspiring with us to spew our inextricable  hate for life and religion into this sick world”  -L.N.&G.P.","options":[{"id":1968171,"name":"Default","price":3.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/4306521/-/UM-005.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/4306521/-/UM-005.jpg","width":150,"height":150}],"artists":[{"id":10701,"name":"Notus Inlatinus","permalink":"notus-inlatinus","url":"/artist/notus-inlatinus"}],"categories":[{"id":69370,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
