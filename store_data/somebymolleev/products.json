I love to personalize and cut up tee's.....so I made this one a little more So.ME! It's a perfect summer tee, yet something fashionable with a pop of blue. I cut softer look into the neckline, and cut the sleeves and the bottom for a vintage look. Once washed, it will have more of a distressed and tattered look-LOVE mine. I put some holes in some areas on mine...if you want these or don't want them on yours...let me know in the NOTES SECTION!\r\n\r\n\"How great is the love, the Father has lavished on us; that we should be called, CHILDREN OF GOD, & that is what we are!\" -1 John 3:1\r\n\r\nSo, I recently spent 2 months in India (January-March)...for mission work. It gave me a LOT of inspiration....from a Biblical standpoint & reflecting on my own walk with the Lord, as well as the people, colors, & culture. Head to the BLOG section and read about my time there! My friend and I spoke to thousands of kids, traveling to different cities and going into schools. We spoke to them about an identity that will never change; our identity in God. \r\n\r\nYou may have the coolest job, be a billionaire, be the most popular chick, or star athlete....but think about it, that identity and label you have that people give you, will change over time & it doesn't last. Often times we seek to find our identity in other people, things, jobs, status, wealth (the list goes on & it is different for us all) to fully satisfy us. An identity that WILL last forever & is eternal, whether you are 5 or 80 years old...is our Identity in God. God views & VALUES you as one of His CHILDREN. Our identity and security must be found in Him! \r\n\r\nWill you rep one of these? 1 John 3:1 \r\n\r\nSIZE CHART IS THE LAST PHOTO ON THIS LISTING. \r\n\r\nBella Unisex Jersey (thinner material) Tee in ROYAL BLUE!

It gave me a LOT of inspiration....from a Biblical standpoint & reflecting on my own walk with the Lord, as well as the people, colors, & culture. Head to the BLOG section and read about my time there! My friend and I spoke to thousands of kids, traveling to different cities and going into schools. We spoke to them about an identity that will never change; our identity in God. \r\n\r\nYou may have the coolest job, be a billionaire, be the most popular chick, or star athlete....but think about it, that identity and label you have that people give you, will change over time & it doesn't last. Often times we seek to find our identity in other people, things, jobs, status, wealth (the list goes on & it is different for us all) to fully satisfy us. An identity that WILL last forever & is eternal, whether you are 5 or 80 years old...is our Identity in God. God views & VALUES you as one of His CHILDREN. Our identity and security must be found in Him! \r\n\r\nWill you rep one of these? 1 John 3:1 \r\n\r\nSIZE CHART IS THE LAST PHOTO ON THIS LISTING. \r\n\r\nBella Unisex Jersey (thinner material) Tee in ROYAL BLUE!

I remember the old school bracelets...the ones where I would beg my parents to buy me one in every color! Well, I thought it would be even more cool to sport a tank! Something that will stand out.\r\n\r\nAs worn by Manwell and Blanca...members of the Christian hip hop/pop band-Group 1 Crew as well as Emily Maynard from The Bachelor sports one of these WWJD tanks!\r\n\r\nSo, these are simple, yet makes the statement I was going for. These once again are on American Apparel..so great quality and very comfy. They are Unisex Tri-Blend Black Tanks. They are a bit oversized seeing MEN & WOMEN can sport them. I love the oversized look, but some like them more fitted. To me, tanks are a year round piece of clothing. Whether you live in Cali and always have warm weather or live in cold weather, you can throw a cardigan over it and you're good to go. Not to mention, you are probably always finding some excuse to vacation to warm weather and you'll definitely need tanks!\r\n\r\nI'd suggest you all buy one and sport it around campus or around town. Don't be afraid to show your faith! \r\n\r\nL or XL left.\r\n**Remember, these are unisex sizes, so they are usually 1 size bigger than normal!\r\n**The mediums really fit no different than the smalls, but are a tad  longer. A lot of people who usually wear size small wanted the small but I was sold out. I had them try the medium and they loved the fit. A little oversized, but not too big, yet just the right length. Really depends on how you like your clothing to fit!

This is unique & one of a kind. It looks great if you layered it with a few other bracelets you may have!\r\n\r\nATTN: This leather is NOT waterproof. It softens as you wear it. The snaps are heavy duty & lead free. All leather cuffs were provided by Tafuri Tough™ Design Studios. I, myself, personalized and added rivets and detail to the plain leather pieces they provided me.","options":[{"id":16572305,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50159463/-/So.CHELSEA.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50159463/-/So.CHELSEA.jpg","width":600,"height":400},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50159487/-/So.CHELSEA3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50159487/-/So.CHELSEA3.jpg","width":600,"height":400},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50159479/-/So.CHELSEA2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50159479/-/So.CHELSEA2.jpg","width":600,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3790555,"name":"JEWELRY","permalink":"jewelry","url":"/category/jewelry"},{"id":6682848,"name":"JEWELRY - ARMCANDY","permalink":"jewelry-armcandy","url":"/category/jewelry-armcandy"}]},{"id":5807637,"name":"So.RETRO.wwjd","permalink":"wwjd-retro","position":72,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/wwjd-retro","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-03-29T03:42:05.000Z","description":"$18 SALE PROMO ENDS DECEMBER 8, 2012 at 7PM\r\n\r\nThe fabulous Kacie B from Ben's season of The Bachelor...was sweet enough to send a photo of her reppin' her So.ME tank!! \r\n\r\nNEW So.ME by MolleeV \"WWJD\" tank just in! Retro and great for the beach or the gym....just might strike up a convo with someone with what it means too! Black American Apparel tri-blend tank with teal ink....perfect for summer. \r\n\r\nSometimes we really need to take a step back or away from the crowd and ask ourselves What Would Jesus Do? I remember the old school bracelets...the ones where I would beg my parents to buy me one in every color! Well, I thought it would be even more cool to sport a tank! Something that will stand out.\r\n\r\nThese once again are on American Apparel..so great quality and very comfy. They are Unisex Tri-Blend Black Tanks. They are a bit oversized seeing MEN & WOMEN can sport them. I love the oversized look, but some like them more fitted.\r\n\r\n**Remember, these are unisex sizes, so they are usually 1 size bigger than normal! Head to my other WWJD style tanks and click on the size chart photo under that listing. \r\n**The mediums really fit no different than the smalls, but are a tad  longer. Some who usually wear a small-LOVED the size medium for an oversized fit. Really depends on how you like your clothing to fit!\r\n\r\nPlease don't hesitate to e-mail me if you have questions about sizing.
