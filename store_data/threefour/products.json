The tracks are not marked out because here, even silence is vital. It doesn’t soothe the tensions, but amplifies the feeling of oddness of the music. Dark ambient, syncopated drumming, dissonant chords… Maninkari use all the sonority spectrum, mixing aggressive high-pitched violin with deep and voluptuous bass sounds.\r\n\r\nPlaying on the thin border between dreaming and awakening, Phantasmes is a mental and physical record; seductive, disturbing and lustful.\r\n\r\nIncludes a download code for a free download of the album.

Although they were playing separate sets, that gave them the opportunity to share their respect for each other’s work. Striving for new experiences, they booked a studio to see what they could get out of this, without any preconceived idea in mind.\r\n\r\nThis session was strikingly fruitful. By the end of it, an album was conceived. The two musicians immediately wanted to release this on vinyl, and with their endless productivity, a double LP was rapidly considered. Almost nothing was changed apart from the rerecording of Aaron’s voice on Absolute Divorce and I Swan You. Actually, the only difficulty was to cut a few bits so that it all fitted on two sides of a vinyl.\r\n\r\nThe variety of the instruments and the musical richness of those 74 minutes give you a hard time to put this record into any category. Alternately noisy, melodic, rock or ambient, Today Is Yesterday’s Tomorrow is an experimental record in the literal and figurative sense.\r\n\r\nToday Is Yesterday’s Tomorrow is available in double LP with insert and a unique download coupon to get the mp3 version.","options":[{"id":22998595,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":105,"name":"France, Metropolitan","code":"FX"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":19,"name":"Iceland","code":"IS"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":4.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/71253763/-/TFR018_big.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/71253763/-/TFR018_big.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96549691/-/IMG_2064.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96549691/-/IMG_2064.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96549703/-/IMG_2066.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96549703/-/IMG_2066.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[{"id":140361,"name":"Aaron Moore/Thierry Müller","permalink":"aaron-moore-thierry-muller","url":"/artist/aaron-moore-thierry-muller"}],"categories":[{"id":2765231,"name":"LPs","permalink":"lps","url":"/category/lps"},{"id":2765293,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"},{"id":2766287,"name":"album","permalink":"album","url":"/category/album"}]},{"id":7093765,"name":"Ruth featuring Mushy - Far from Paradise (LP 12\")","permalink":"ruth-featuring-mushy-far-from-paradise-lp-12","position":7,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ruth-featuring-mushy-far-from-paradise-lp-12","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-29T12:27:56.000Z","description":"<b>27 years after the first Ruth's album Polaroïd/Roman/Photo, three:four records presents the new Ruth album: Ruth featuring Mushy - Far from Paradise</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Catalog number</b>: TFR016\r\n<b>Format</b>: LP 12\",  with insert and mp3 DL\r\n<b>Release date</b>: september 2012\r\n\r\n<object height=\"18\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2405933&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=tiny&amp;font=Arial&amp;color=ff7700\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed wmode=\"transparent\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"18\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2405933&amp;auto_play=false&amp;player_type=tiny&amp;font=Arial&amp;color=ff7700\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>   \r\n\r\n<b>tracklist</b>\r\n<b>A1.</b> Is nonsense a nonsense?

Intrigued by the combination of their universe, they spent three days improvising with Luciano Lamanna.\r\nWith nine hours of recordings at his disposal, Thierry wrote the Far From Paradise story. Editing was a long and tedious process in order to keep the spontaneity of the sessions. A few re-recordings and instruments were added to the framework (drums, percussions, cello) to finalize the 12 tracks that made it onto Far From Paradise.\r\n\r\nThe spirit and colour that come out of it lead Thierry Müller to revive the Ruth concept.

Intrigued by the combination of their universe, they spent three days improvising with Luciano Lamanna.\r\nWith nine hours of recordings at his disposal, Thierry wrote the Far From Paradise story. Editing was a long and tedious process in order to keep the spontaneity of the sessions. A few re-recordings and instruments were added to the framework (drums, percussions, cello) to finalize the 12 tracks that made it onto Far From Paradise.\r\n\r\nThe spirit and colour that come out of it lead Thierry Müller to revive the Ruth concept. Dark and wistful atmospheres with a hint of eroticism melt with more electric and spontaneous moments. Even though some tracks could be considered as electropop, cold wave or synthetic krautrock, the consistency lies in the cold tension and minimalism present all through the record.\r\n\r\nFar From Paradise is available on LP with insert and download coupon, or in gatefold CD.

Needless to say that sharing two records with members from those bands we love is a huge honor!\r\n \r\nJeremy Lemos is a real sound artist. He works on many projects as a sound engineer and contributed more recently with Disappears. The 10 minutes epic Out with the Old is a striking proof of modular drones and loop making. As always with Jeremy, heavy and stormy atmospheres meet bright sparks. Matt Jencik is also offering some drone moments. After an introductory piece (Conservative Fucks), Hollow Bodies’ floating glows seem more in peace than those of Jeremy Lemos, but equally ambient. The ideal soundtrack for daydreaming; if only there was a way to activate the “repeat” function on your turntable!\r\n\r\nThe record comes again in an artwork from Rachel Bloch, in a hand-numbered edition limited to 300 copies, with a download coupon.","options":[{"id":20445663,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":105,"name":"France, Metropolitan","code":"FX"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":19,"name":"Iceland","code":"IS"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":4.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68973219/-/TFR015_800.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68973219/-/TFR015_800.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63841461/-/IMG_1217.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63841461/-/IMG_1217.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/63841497/-/IMG_1218.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/63841497/-/IMG_1218.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[{"id":125825,"name":"Jeremy Lemos","permalink":"jeremy-lemos","url":"/artist/jeremy-lemos"},{"id":125827,"name":"Matt Jencik","permalink":"matt-jencik","url":"/artist/matt-jencik"}],"categories":[{"id":2765231,"name":"LPs","permalink":"lps","url":"/category/lps"},{"id":2765283,"name":"10\"","permalink":"10","url":"/category/10"},{"id":2766291,"name":"three:four split series","permalink":"three-four-split-series","url":"/category/three-four-split-series"}]},{"id":6419651,"name":"Matthew Hale Clark/Ken Camden - three:four split series vol. 4 (10\")","permalink":"matthew-hale-clark-ken-camden-three-four-split-series-vol-4","position":10,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/matthew-hale-clark-ken-camden-three-four-split-series-vol-4","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-11T13:51:33.000Z","description":"<b>Catalog number</b>: TFR014\r\n<b>Format</b>: 10\"\r\n<b>Edition</b>: 300 hand-numbered copies.

While in the studio working on his first solo album, Matthew Hale Clark recorded additional tracks for that matter. The first collaboration with three:four records through the :take: & white/lichens split was a success, so it’s only natural that this new record takes part in our split series... to our greatest delight.\r\n \r\nMatthew Hale Clark and Ken Camden are especially known for their commitment in white/light and Implodes. Here, Matthew Hale Clark gave up stratospheric drones and opted for an acoustic piece. Directly inspired by primitive American folk, SLC Suite is an acoustic guitar track with finger-picking that develops towards more contemporary and cosmic atmospheres, with Jeremy Lemos’ contribution on pedal-steel guitar and shruti-box and, Frank Rosaly on drums. This was beautifully recorded at Soma studios.\r\n \r\nOn the other side, Ken Camden’s tracks have nothing in common with the A side.

The LP comes with a bonus 7’’ containing two exclusive tracks recorded during the same sessions as the album\r\n\r\n<b><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/three-four-records/sets/silencio-when-im-gone\">Listen</a></b>","options":[{"id":17617195,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":18,"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HK"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":19,"name":"Iceland","code":"IS"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":190,"name":"Russian Federation","code":"RU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":8,"name":"Chile","code":"CL"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":105,"name":"France, Metropolitan","code":"FX"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68972939/-/TFR012_big.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68972939/-/TFR012_big.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53653949/-/TFR012--1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53653949/-/TFR012--1.jpg","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/53653957/-/TFR012--2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/53653957/-/TFR012--2.jpg","width":1000,"height":750}],"artists":[{"id":105921,"name":"Silencio","permalink":"silencio","url":"/artist/silencio"}],"categories":[{"id":2765229,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":2766287,"name":"album","permalink":"album","url":"/category/album"}]},{"id":5192717,"name":"Larkian & Yellow6 -

He invited Jon to release a 7\" single on the label and this, 'Grey' was released early 2002. There were some discussions about a split release at the time but this never came about. Forward to 2009 and Cyril and Jon get back in contact via individual releases on the same labels (October Man, Cathedral Transmissions). Cyril sends a track for Jon to contribute to and the collaboration that has become 'Offtempo' began. After around a year of file exchange, composition and recordings, the first common collaborative effort by Yellow6 and Larkian was ready to find a home.\r\n\r\nNeither Larkian or Yellow6 are easily categorised, but both differ from each other. The mixing of the two styles creates something all its own whilst retaining the individual. By using an impressive range of effects and ways to play guitar 'Offtempo' offers various sound textures and landscapes, from shoegaze inspired reverb to atmospheric ambiences or epic post-rock melodies. At times, it is hard to say who played what, which is a good thing, showing it is not just a superposition of two different styles. The music tends towards the melancholy but maintains an air of optimism.","options":[{"id":16840465,"name":"Default","price":9.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":190,"name":"Russian Federation","code":"RU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":8,"name":"Chile","code":"CL"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":18,"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HK"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":19,"name":"Iceland","code":"IS"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":105,"name":"France, Metropolitan","code":"FX"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68972243/-/TFR011_800.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68972243/-/TFR011_800.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50992537/-/TFR011_1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50992537/-/TFR011_1.jpg","width":800,"height":690}],"artists":[{"id":99695,"name":"Larkian & Yellow6","permalink":"larkian-yellow6","url":"/artist/larkian-yellow6"}],"categories":[{"id":2765229,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":2766287,"name":"album","permalink":"album","url":"/category/album"}]},{"id":5192673,"name":"Maninkari -

After three albums taken from the same studio sessions, they are back with more direct and refined tracks. As usual, Maninkari uses a great deal of instruments in many styles (cimbalom, cello, viola, synthesizers, percussion instruments), which is quite genre-breaking, without taking the easy way out. Although dark in the atmospheres, the band is constantly looking to reach the mystical white light. The wide range of textures (abrasive or mellow, electronic or acoustic) is amazing and shapes the entire album, highlighting both the introspective and epic moments. Whether there is a rhythm section or not, tension is overwhelming. With the addition of rich atmospheres and a subtle production, this tension transcends the creation of an eerie beauty.\r\n\r\n<b><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/three-four-records/sets/maninkari-the-half-forgotten/\">Listen</a></b>","options":[{"id":16840367,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":190,"name":"Russian Federation","code":"RU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":8,"name":"Chile","code":"CL"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":18,"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HK"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":19,"name":"Iceland","code":"IS"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":105,"name":"France, Metropolitan","code":"FX"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68972891/-/TFR010_big.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68972891/-/TFR010_big.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/51313141/-/IMG_8805.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/51313141/-/IMG_8805.jpg","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/51313287/-/IMG_8802.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/51313287/-/IMG_8802.jpg","width":1000,"height":866}],"artists":[{"id":99691,"name":"Maninkari","permalink":"maninkari","url":"/artist/maninkari"}],"categories":[{"id":2765229,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":2766287,"name":"album","permalink":"album","url":"/category/album"}]},{"id":5192621,"name":"absent without leave - 'neath the tumbling stars (12\")","permalink":"absent-without-leave-neath-the-tumbling-stars-12","position":17,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/absent-without-leave-neath-the-tumbling-stars-12","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-01-06T01:56:52.000Z","description":"<b>Catalog number</b>: TFR009\r\n<b>Format</b>: 12\" including free mp3 download of the album\r\n<b>Edition</b>: 454 hand numbered copies.

At a junction between post-rock and ambient, absent without leave builds each track one step at a time. Crystal clear melodies are repeating themselves, intertwining in either quiet or stormy atmospheres ('neath the tumbling stars). A more meditative piece, as the leaves fall from trees is equal to its title. The tearing smoothness and fascination for the slow movement of the leave coming off the tree, flying in the air, before delicately landing on the soft ground are transcribed within those four minutes of introspective guitars. Finally, calm of the sea lights up the end of the record. Ghostly and colourful, those crystal clear guitar parts shine like dusk. While reminding some of the highest pieces from Labradford, Yellow6 or Stars of The Lid, 'neath the tumbling stars EP will surely become a classic.\r\n\r\n<b><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/three-four-records/sets/absent-without-leave-ep/\">Listen</a></b>","options":[{"id":16840235,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":105,"name":"France, Metropolitan","code":"FX"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":19,"name":"Iceland","code":"IS"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":4.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68972859/-/TFR009_big.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68972859/-/TFR009_big.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/51312935/-/IMG_8616.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/51312935/-/IMG_8616.jpg","width":989,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/51312951/-/IMG_8618.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/51312951/-/IMG_8618.jpg","width":1000,"height":889}],"artists":[{"id":99689,"name":"absent without leave","permalink":"absent-without-leave","url":"/artist/absent-without-leave"}],"categories":[{"id":2765293,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"},{"id":2766289,"name":"EP","permalink":"ep","url":"/category/ep"}]},{"id":5192605,"name":"Annelies Monseré & Richard Youngs - three:four split series volume 3 (10\")","permalink":"annelies-monsere-richard-youngs-three-four-split-series-volume-3-10","position":18,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/annelies-monsere-richard-youngs-three-four-split-series-volume-3-10","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-01-06T01:53:30.000Z","description":"<b>Catalog number</b>: TFR008\r\n<b>Format</b>: 10\" including free mp3 download of the entire album\r\n<b>Edition </b>: 522 hand numbered copies.

For this release she did not chose. (Though this is not completely true - there are still more versions of the song - including an acapella version) She was interested in how different arrangements, tempo's, melodies and structures changed the expressive and aesthetic qualities of the song, convinced that no version is more 'essential' or 'authentic' than the other.\r\n\r\nOn the B-side, Richard Youngs offers a unique 9 minutes piece. With only guitars and vocals, \"Be brave, this world\" focuses on endless loops and a very specific rhythm that gives a fascinating, almost psychedelic feel. All through the track, the filtered guitar sways like a backwash, pounds a pulsatile rhythm, alternately sharp and oppressive or more of a thud, giving an impression of overwhelming and unpredictable swirl. Almost mantra vocals invariably support its fluctuations in a monotone, just like useless incentives in a dying world.

Although half of the label is based in Lausanne, we haven’t had the opportunity to work with local bands before. Consider it done with this new record that gathers the cream of the scene from Romandy. Their discographies are proof enough of the vast musical universe they evolve into, with a tendency for all experimentations.\r\nBio + Larkian + Les Poissons Autistes’s record is the result of a remote collaboration that occurred through the exchange of files between those three Swiss bands from the experimental and electroacoustic scene. Within seven tracks, the musicians explore and mix up their various backgrounds, going from folk to electro, through jazz, post-rock, metal, country-western, classical music and even Mongolian traditional folklore, with a lot of noise in the midst. All that could be summed up by the fifth track: \"Vous faites vraiment trop chier\" (which translates roughly as: « You fuckers »).\r\nMastered by Julien Grandjean at Jetlag Studio in Vevey, this release is a 500 CD edition that comes in recycled cardboard digifile format, printed by Stumptown Printers. The cover was made by Didier Oberson and the result is just astounding.\r\n\r\n<b><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/three-four-records/sets/bio-larkian-les-poissons-autistes/\">Listen</a></b>","options":[{"id":16840121,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":190,"name":"Russian Federation","code":"RU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":6,"name":"Brazil","code":"BR"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":8,"name":"Chile","code":"CL"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":18,"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HK"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":19,"name":"Iceland","code":"IS"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":105,"name":"France, Metropolitan","code":"FX"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68972811/-/TFR007_big.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68972811/-/TFR007_big.jpg","width":800,"height":800}],"artists":[{"id":99679,"name":"Bio+Larkian+Les Poissons Autistes","permalink":"bio-larkian-les-poissons-autistes","url":"/artist/bio-larkian-les-poissons-autistes"}],"categories":[{"id":2765229,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":2766287,"name":"album","permalink":"album","url":"/category/album"}]},{"id":5192517,"name":":take: - s/t (CD)","permalink":"take-s-t-cd","position":20,"price":7.0,"default_price":7.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/take-s-t-cd","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-01-06T01:46:17.000Z","description":"<b>Catalog number</b>: TFR006\r\n<b>Format</b>: CD\r\n<b>Edition</b>: 2 panel cover with insert\r\n<b>Release date</b>: september 2010\r\n\r\n<b>tracklist</b>\r\n<b>01.</b> Touche <i>(4:37)</i>\r\n<b>02.</b> L'endroit du crâne paisible <i>(7:28)</i>\r\n<b>03.</b> Guerre silence <i>(2:30)</i>\r\n<b>04.</b> Nom de plume <i>(5:31)</i>\r\n\r\nAfter opening our series of split vinyls with white/lichens last year, :take: is back with an EP, and this time, it's through a new media, i.e. CD format. This great adventure between the label and the guitarist goes on and we hope that we will continue our collaboration in the future. That being said, you should know that we are truly fond of this beautiful project that begun two years ago. Recorded and mixed at home with heart by Laurent Bichara, it was then mastered by Jeremy Lemos. This should be the last step before :take:'s debut album.\r\nThrough the four tracks of this self-titled mini-album, :take: softly brings you into his world, while adding dreamlike melodies and new instrumentations to his cyclic layers. His sonic range truly expanded compared to his first recordings. The guitar is still central, but it's either played to create drones and repetitive sampled patterns, or hit with sticks for a more percussive effect. This combination of accurately controlled techniques leads to this elusive twenty minutes' record.\r\nTouche develops virtually one note after another. It smoothly sets in motion, creating a surreal and soul-stirring sensation, like on the morning following a sleepless night, staring at the rising sun. L'endroit du crâne paisible could be somewhat misleading: if the harmonics follow one another as idle waves, they end into a blizzard of intertwined melodies, and crash onto the percussive and minimalist track guerre silence.

The latter acknowledges that the previous works from Cortez (under the lovesliescrushing moniker) greatly influenced his work, to the point of using the same way of writing the band’s name (no capital letter and no spaces between words) for his actual solo project. The main thing that they have in common is their unconventional use of the guitar, which they consider as a signal generator. They then process those sounds through various effects, to obtain a different result than that of the original signal until the source becomes almost undetectable. Meridians is also the first vinyl production from thisquietarmy, as it is Scott Cortez’s first under his real name.\r\n\r\nMeridians is a cross-project between the two artists. Separated by 1.000 miles, Eric Quach (thisquietarmy) and Scott Cortez simultaneously began to record the first guitar layer for both sides on December 18th 2009 at 1pm EST. The original drone was supposed to be played like a three tones piece, with the use of a different string for each tone. They then sent the result to each other to work on the piece that the other had begun. This is how they recorded the two tracks that feature on this record.\r\nThis is definitely an unusual practice, far from the classic split exercise and the result is fascinating: abstract, radiant and hypnotic drones that intertwine with numerous harmonic structures. They created a coherent whole that goes beyond their unique recording method.\r\nWritten and pressed to be played at 45 rpm, the record can also be played at 33 rpm. Darker and more mystical, the result is stunning.\r\n\r\n<b><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/three-four-records/sets/thisquietarmy-scott-cortez/\">Listen</a></b>","options":[{"id":16839893,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":105,"name":"France, Metropolitan","code":"FX"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":19,"name":"Iceland","code":"IS"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":4.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68972753/-/TFR005_big.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68972753/-/TFR005_big.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50990553/-/tfr005_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50990553/-/tfr005_2.jpg","width":800,"height":533},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50990561/-/tfr005_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50990561/-/tfr005_3.jpg","width":800,"height":533}],"artists":[{"id":99697,"name":"thisquietarmy & Scott Cortez","permalink":"thisquietarmy-scott-cortez","url":"/artist/thisquietarmy-scott-cortez"}],"categories":[{"id":2765293,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"},{"id":2766289,"name":"EP","permalink":"ep","url":"/category/ep"}]},{"id":5192409,"name":"V/A - Does Your Cat Know My Dog?, Bad Bonn&#x27;s selection for the new ear (LP 12\")","permalink":"v-a-does-your-cat-know-my-dog-bad-bonn-s-selection-for-the-new-ear-lp-12","position":22,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/v-a-does-your-cat-know-my-dog-bad-bonn-s-selection-for-the-new-ear-lp-12","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-01-06T01:35:09.000Z","description":"<b>Catalog number</b>: TFR004\r\n<b>Format</b>: LP 12\" including a free mp3 download of the album\r\n<b>Edition</b>: 650 hand numbered copies.

There, you can find a huge diversity between a breakthrough and a confirmed band, between electronic music, doom, folk and indie rock. You can consider this as a big catchall record but it is more likely a perfect reflection of the open-mindedness that qualifies the venue. Of a very friendly nature, Daniel Fontana and his crew created a unique network that allows them to book prestigious bands such as Sonic Youth, Bonnie 'Prince' Billy, Sunn O))) or Carla Bozulich - that many programmers would dream to have on their roster – but always with a particular interest to new and/or local bands. With an exclusive selection of rare or unreleased tracks, this record has not been made on the musical reputation of the bands, but stands for the friendship they developed with these bands over the years.","options":[{"id":16839795,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":92,"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZ"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":19,"name":"Iceland","code":"IS"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":105,"name":"France, Metropolitan","code":"FX"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":4.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68972707/-/TFR004_big.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68972707/-/TFR004_big.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50990081/-/tfr004_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50990081/-/tfr004_2.jpg","width":800,"height":533},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50990097/-/tfr004_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50990097/-/tfr004_3.jpg","width":800,"height":533}],"artists":[{"id":99657,"name":"Bonnie 'prince' Billy","permalink":"bonnie-prince-billy","url":"/artist/bonnie-prince-billy"},{"id":99659,"name":"Your Fault","permalink":"your-fault","url":"/artist/your-fault"},{"id":99661,"name":"Pierre Omer","permalink":"pierre-omer","url":"/artist/pierre-omer"},{"id":99663,"name":"Carla Bozulich & Ches Smith","permalink":"carla-bozulich-ches-smith","url":"/artist/carla-bozulich-ches-smith"},{"id":99667,"name":"sunn o)))","permalink":"sunn-o","url":"/artist/sunn-o"},{"id":99669,"name":"Sum of R","permalink":"sum-of-r","url":"/artist/sum-of-r"},{"id":99671,"name":"Joe Galen","permalink":"joe-galen","url":"/artist/joe-galen"},{"id":99673,"name":"Bulbul + Boris Hauf","permalink":"bulbul-boris-hauf","url":"/artist/bulbul-boris-hauf"},{"id":99675,"name":"combineharvester","permalink":"combineharvester","url":"/artist/combineharvester"},{"id":99677,"name":"Sonic Youth","permalink":"sonic-youth","url":"/artist/sonic-youth"}],"categories":[{"id":2765231,"name":"LPs","permalink":"lps","url":"/category/lps"},{"id":2766293,"name":"compilation","permalink":"compilation","url":"/category/compilation"}]},{"id":5191761,"name":"the fun years & .cut feat.

Here is the second volume of our split series that highlights 2 two-man bands living in two different cities. Whereas the fun years live in different parts of the United States, .cut is based in Montreal and Lyon, where gibet, Albérick's accomplice, lives. Musically, this record gathers two of the most exciting laptop & guitar duets.\r\n\r\nOn the A side, the fun years presents a particularly interesting score. As the band recorded two long albums with continuing tracks, we were expecting one or two long tracks. On the contrary, they are offering five short independent songs. Despite the short length of the support, their effort is presented as a real album, with an intro (Am I having a stroke?) and an end (We don't need no fucking theme songs). Between these two tracks, three various songs are unfolding, revealing the fun years' huge potential. From the impressive “Icon mockery” and its weightlessness massive explosions, to “Yellow is misleading and we might have just what you need”, more fastidious in terms of writing, nonetheless really easy to listen to.\r\n\r\nOn the B side, .cut featuring gibet offer two tracks in different formats but with equal intensity. “Up the River Da Nang…” could be the ideal soundtrack for The Thin Red Line by Terrence Malick. With their mix of meditative atmospheres leading to introspection and oppressive and violent elements against martial sounds, you can't really be unaffected by this 10 minutes piece. The band's radical approach glorifies the darkness, to the extent that it seems either sublime or unendurable.

We offer them the opportunity to share their passion for it by curating a record. For this first volume we have asked ali_fib, the most interesting and adventurous gig promoter in Paris, to handle it.\r\nThe result, Err on the Good Side, reflects their own musical tastes and friendships. Except Chambre 1, Ilitch's introductory track (which was released in 2005 as part of Thierry Müller's limited-edition picture disc, Rainy House) and Amen Dunes' contribution, Diane (here offered in its extended version; an alternative take will be released this year by Locust Music), this record is made of previously unreleased material and has been compiled using a very simple idea of symmetry: most of the tracks here have been assembled as pairs based on musical affinities.\r\n\r\n<b><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/three-four-records/sets/err-on-the-good-side/\">Listen</a></b>","options":[{"id":16835249,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":105,"name":"France, Metropolitan","code":"FX"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":19,"name":"Iceland","code":"IS"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":3.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":4.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68972459/-/TFR002_big.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68972459/-/TFR002_big.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50972881/-/tfr002_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50972881/-/tfr002_2.jpg","width":800,"height":533},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50972889/-/tfr002_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50972889/-/tfr002_3.jpg","width":800,"height":533}],"artists":[{"id":99579,"name":"Ilitch","permalink":"ilitch","url":"/artist/ilitch"},{"id":99581,"name":"Steve Gunn","permalink":"steve-gunn","url":"/artist/steve-gunn"},{"id":99583,"name":"Ben Nash","permalink":"ben-nash","url":"/artist/ben-nash"},{"id":99585,"name":"Sir Richard Bishop","permalink":"sir-richard-bishop","url":"/artist/sir-richard-bishop"},{"id":99587,"name":"Duane Pitre","permalink":"duane-pitre","url":"/artist/duane-pitre"},{"id":99589,"name":"Mike Wexler","permalink":"mike-wexler","url":"/artist/mike-wexler"},{"id":99591,"name":"él-g, sus and jakob","permalink":"el-g-sus-and-jakob","url":"/artist/el-g-sus-and-jakob"},{"id":99593,"name":"Liberez","permalink":"liberez","url":"/artist/liberez"},{"id":99595,"name":"Hellvete","permalink":"hellvete","url":"/artist/hellvete"},{"id":99597,"name":"Amen Dunes","permalink":"amen-dunes","url":"/artist/amen-dunes"},{"id":99599,"name":"ali_fib","permalink":"ali_fib","url":"/artist/ali_fib"}],"categories":[{"id":2765231,"name":"LPs","permalink":"lps","url":"/category/lps"},{"id":2766293,"name":"compilation","permalink":"compilation","url":"/category/compilation"}]},{"id":5190681,"name":":take: & white/lichens - three:four split series volume 1 (10\")","permalink":"take-white-lichens-three-four-split-series-volume-1-10","position":25,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/take-white-lichens-three-four-split-series-volume-1-10","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-01-05T20:22:18.000Z","description":"<b>Catalog number</b>: TFR001\r\n<b>Format</b>: 10\" vinyl including free mp3 download of the album\r\n<b>Edition</b>: 500 hand numbered copies.

Two different approaches of drone music: soft and melodic for :take:, loud and unbridled for the Chicagoans.\r\n\r\nThe A-side is composed of two :take:'s tracks. Paysage avec Fer evokes desert landscapes shaped by interlaced sine tone and minimalist guitar manipulation. It's a 5 min abstract guitar drone and epic effort. Joie de Résistance offers another side of :take:'s work. A bluesy guitar, melodic guitar patterns… The track ends with a repetitive beat leading to a hypnotic trance.\r\nThe B-side is a massive 10 min piece by White/Lichens. Tonight's the Night is a growing deflagration, powerful and loud. The intensity is magnified by a psyche reverbed guitar. Listening to it is as fascinating as waiting for a hurricane to come.","options":[{"id":16835075,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":17,"name":"Greece","code":"GR"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":105,"name":"France, Metropolitan","code":"FX"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":19,"name":"Iceland","code":"IS"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":4.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68972347/-/folder.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68972347/-/folder.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50972393/-/tfr001_2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50972393/-/tfr001_2.jpg","width":800,"height":533},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50972401/-/tfr001_3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50972401/-/tfr001_3.jpg","width":800,"height":533}],"artists":[{"id":99567,"name":":take:","permalink":"take","url":"/artist/take"},{"id":99569,"name":"white/lichens","permalink":"white-lichens","url":"/artist/white-lichens"}],"categories":[{"id":2765283,"name":"10\"","permalink":"10","url":"/category/10"},{"id":2766291,"name":"three:four split series","permalink":"three-four-split-series","url":"/category/three-four-split-series"}]}]
