Rising from the ashes of the mysterious and legendary Suicide Club, The Cacophony Society, at its zenith, hosted chapters in over a dozen major cities, and influenced much of what was once called the underground. Flash Mobs, Urban Exploration, and Culture Jamming are a few of the pop culture trends that Cacophony helped kick off. Chuck Palahniuk's <i>Fight Club</i>, Burning Man and Internet social networking powerhouse Laughing Squid were informed and inspired by Cacophony. The Burning Man Festival actually began as a Cacophony event as did the annual, and now world-wide SantaCon. Cacophony events could range from something as simple as climbing the Golden Gate Bridge or having a discussion over drinks about a movie seen together, to something as elaborate as The Atomic Café - an event involving a hundred bedraggled \"nuclear holocaust Survivors” mounting elaborate costumed rituals throughout the bowels of a massive abandoned tooth paste factory. \r\n\r\n<b>Hardcover</b>. 300 pages.\r\n<b>Pub</b>.

Set in 1920s Japan, The Strange Tale of Panorama Island follows the twisted path of failed novelist Hitomi, who bears an uncanny resemblance to the son of a rich industrialist family. Hitomi learns of the rich man's sudden passing and creates a desperate plan. He fakes his own death, digs up and hides the other man's body, and then washes himself up starving on a beach near the home of the dead man's family. After successfully impersonating the now-dead son, Hitomi takes over all aspects of the industrialist's life, including his company, his fortune, and eventually his wife. The failed author soon redirects the family's wealth to his own perverse aims. A graphic novel based on the revered novella by Edogawa Rampo. Rampo was the godfather of Japanese pulp mysteries. Stunning artwork by master manga artist Suehiro Maruo deftly illustrates this Japanese pulp classic in fine detail. * 13th Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize for New Artist.\r\n\r\n<b>Hardcover</b>. 274 pages.\r\n<b>Pub</b>. - Last Gasp (2013)","options":[{"id":47690178,"name":"Default","price":24.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":20.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127253040/-/PanIsland_SQ.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127253040/-/PanIsland_SQ.jpg","width":254,"height":254},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127253052/-/61O3tQNyMfL._SY344_BO1_204_203_200_.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127253052/-/61O3tQNyMfL._SY344_BO1_204_203_200_.jpg","width":254,"height":346}],"artists":[{"id":247839,"name":"Suehiro Maruo","permalink":"suehiro-maruo","url":"/artist/suehiro-maruo"}],"categories":[{"id":6258462,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":14801016,"name":"Scott Musgrove: The Late Fauna of Early North America Book","permalink":"scott-musgrove-the-late-fauna-of-early-north-america-book","position":20,"price":34.95,"default_price":34.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/scott-musgrove-the-late-fauna-of-early-north-america-book","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-12T20:04:27.000Z","description":"<i>The Late Fauna of Early North America</i> features lush, highly detailed landscapes and up-close encounters with all manner of strange and beautiful creatures. Full color reproductions of his paintings abound, including unique antique frames, custom gold engraved nameplates, carved wooden sculptures, watercolors, ink drawings, and pencil renderings from the field.\r\n\r\n<b>Scott Musgrove</b> unearths previously undiscovered animals through a dedicated and scientifically un-approved practice of zoological impressionism. A lone-star in the field, he ventures where the gray-maned, khaki-clad, anthropologists with ivory walking sticks have not--tunneling beneath freeways and ditch-combing along the rough borders of American mini-malls, in search of undiscovered and, up to this point, at least, extinct animals.\r\n\r\nScott's unorthodox “research” methods combined with his unmatched facility with paint and color result in a fascinating survey of what might have been North America, if not for the invasion of pernicious settlers. He restores these beasts to life in his studio, stretching and stapling carpet scraps across ribs and skulls. With the help of a glue gun and a needle and thread, Scott sews and sculpts until the <b><i>Harry Brook Trout</b></i> or the <b><i>Dwarf Basket Horse</b></i> is finally staring back at him. Then (and only then) he paints them back into their pristine, natural environment, bringing these wild idols, relics and bio-wonders back to life and legitimacy. \r\n \r\n<b>Hardcover</b>. 160 pages.\r\n<b>Pub</b>. - Last Gasp (2009)\r\n","options":[{"id":47970870,"name":"Default","price":34.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127459167/-/SQLateFauna_SMusgrove110304__110304.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127459167/-/SQLateFauna_SMusgrove110304__110304.jpg","width":404,"height":404},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127459179/-/LateFauna_SMusgrove110304__110304.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127459179/-/LateFauna_SMusgrove110304__110304.jpg","width":454,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":248949,"name":"Scott Musgrove","permalink":"scott-musgrove","url":"/artist/scott-musgrove"}],"categories":[{"id":6258462,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":14722176,"name":"Ron Garrigues Book","permalink":"ron-garrigues-garrigues-book","position":21,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ron-garrigues-garrigues-book","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-09T01:06:08.000Z","description":"The sculpture of <b>Ron Garrigues</b> is collected together in this comprehensive catalog of works that embody both his early focus on purity of form and line with his concern about the rampant man-made destruction he witnessed in his travels through the natural world.

In 25 years of groundbreaking exhibitions, this is La Luz's first published survey, featuring three generations of the most important artists working today. The book, a companion to the show, chronicles the rich legacy of La Luz de Jesus and the thriving art movement it helped launch. The talent involved with the La Luz de Jesus 25th Anniversary project reads like a veritable who's-who of art, including <b>Robert Williams, Joe Coleman, Gelnn Barr, Elizabeth McGrath, the Clayton Brothers, Gary Panter, Mark Mothersbaugh, Lou Beach, Hudson Marquez, Aaron Smith, Owen Smith, Frank Kozik, Manuel Ocampo, Don Ed Hardy, Jeff Soto, Dave Cooper, Daniel Martin Diaz, Scott Musgrove, Bari Kumar, Tim Biskup, Joe Sorren, Chris Mars, Jessica Joslin, The Pizz, Coop, shag, Gary Baseman, Bob Dob,</b> and many more.<p>\r\n\r\nBilly Shire is best known as the prodigious owner of The Soap Plant, Wacko and the La Luz de Jesus gallery, all in Los Angeles. A couple of years after graduating from Belmont High, Shire opened The Soap Plant where he sold hand-crafted soaps, unusual trinkets, and imported figurines from Mexico, thereby popularizing the art and culture of that country's Day of the Dead festivals. Shire gained notoriety in 1973 when he won a design competition sponsored by Levi Strauss & Company. Shire's gallery La Luz de Jesus, is one of the most important ground-breaking galleries in Los Angeles and has garnered a considerable reputation with collectors, galleries, and artists around the world.\r\n\r\n<b>Hardcover</b>. 320 pages.\r\n<b>Pub</b>. - Last Gasp (2011)","options":[{"id":47974152,"name":"Default","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127461732/-/SQLa_Luz.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127461732/-/SQLa_Luz.jpg","width":350,"height":350},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127461747/-/419XMEguJBL_SS500_170808__170808.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127461747/-/419XMEguJBL_SS500_170808__170808.jpg","width":350,"height":446}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6258462,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":13911117,"name":"Chuck Sperry: Chaos Screen Print Variants","permalink":"chuck-sperry-chaos-screen-print-variants","position":26,"price":250.0,"default_price":250.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/chuck-sperry-chaos-screen-print-variants","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-10-01T21:16:11.000Z","description":"Artist-Pulled 8-Color Screen Print on Archival Metallic GMUND Paper  \r\n22\" x 33\"\r\nEdition of 10\r\nSigned by Chuck Sperry\r\n2012\r\n\r\nThe Screen Print Variants are special versions based on the Chaos Screen Print by Chuck Sperry.

Here's one to decorate not only the coffee table, but the refrigerator, notebooks, laptop computers, public walls, automobiles, or practically any other surface. <i>Ron English's Stickable Art Offenses</i> is a book of stickers you can actually put up in your own environment, filled with mini-billboards, \"subvertisements\" and other visual enhancements from one of the most prolific and recognizable artists today.\r\n\r\nEnglish coined the term POPaganda to describe his signature mash-up of high & low cultural touchstones, populated with his vast and constantly growing arsenal of original characters, including MC Supersized, the obese fast-food mascot featured in the film Supersize Me, and Abraham Obama, the fusion of America's 16th and 44th presidents. Includes amusing anecdotes from English's stickered past.\r\n\r\n<i>Ron English's Stickable Art Offenses</i> puts you in control of the canvas. These hilarious parodies are more than enough to keep you entertained -- as well as arrested! Just ask the artist himself. Actually, you don't have to. English retells the story of how undercover agents in plainclothes rushed him outside of a popular Manhattan club. So, it goes without saying that neither Last Gasp nor Ron English are responsible for whatever trouble you get yourself into with these!

In tandem, they are known as <b>The Clayton Brothers</b>, producing dynamic, extemporaneous, yet purposeful images, sought after for commercial use as well as by private collectors. Their work is narrative, autobiographical, ethereal and subliminal, culled from memories of sub-urban decay, sprinkled with the sour irony of truth. \r\n\r\nThe Clayton Brothers' approach to painting, drawing, collage, and installation is a narrative feeding frenzy: one brother beginning a painting, then handing it off to the other for his interpretation. Back and forth the Brothers work; twisting, elaborating, reinterpreting, editing and redirecting each other's marks.

It served as a \"low art” counterpoint to its contemporary highbrow Raw. Early issues of <b><i>Weirdo</b></i> reflect Crumb's interests at the time: outsider art, fumetti, Church of the SubGenius-type anti-propaganda and assorted \"weirdness.” The incredibly varied stories include TV Blues, Life of Boswell, People Make me Nervous, The Old Songs are the Best Songs,Uncle Bob's Mid-Life Crisis, Kraft Ebbing's' Psycopathia Sexualis, Goldilocks, The Life of Philip K Dick, and many more.

One of the leading ladies of Pop Surrealism, Peck populates her dreamlike paintings with strange, cute creatures. As her magical and bucolic landscapes unfold, an uneasy melancholy fills the air -- the birds are chirping, but the sounds are not quite right. The viewer pauses and questions the reality Peck has created, as well as one's own. Themes of hope, despair, mystery, nostalgia, love and death recur throughout Peck's work alongside motifs of dreams, big-eyed animals, natural landscapes, doe-eyed children, royalty and peasantry. With references ranging from Pieter Brueghel to Holly Hobbie, Marion Peck mines the depths of art history, popular culture and the human experience for her meticulous scenes. While peasants dance in a painting of the same name, their son leers at a corralled ass while the evening's dinner runs around with its head cut off. In her painting <b><i>F*ck You</b></i> a nod to Francois Gerard's 1804 <b><i>Portrait de Mme Tallien</b></i> an elegant royal is anything but, as she tells us how she really feels. Peck looks beyond the subconscious, reminding us that the waking world is never quite as it seems. And with her dark sense of humor and irrepressible optimism, she assures us that while life can be ominous, tragic, even deceptive, it is also beautiful, magical and alive with hope. \r\n\r\n<b>Hardcover</b>. 128 pages.\r\n<b>Pub</b>. - Last Gasp (2010)","options":[{"id":43922946,"name":"Default","price":29.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":20.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124625757/-/AnimalLoveSummer_CROP.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124625757/-/AnimalLoveSummer_CROP.jpg","width":310,"height":310},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124625715/-/AnimalLoveSummer_Peck155228__155228.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124625715/-/AnimalLoveSummer_Peck155228__155228.jpg","width":310,"height":400}],"artists":[{"id":234987,"name":"Marion Peck","permalink":"marion-peck","url":"/artist/marion-peck"}],"categories":[{"id":6258462,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":13692600,"name":"Mark Ryden : The Snow Yak Show Book","permalink":"mark-ryden-the-snow-yak-show","position":41,"price":28.0,"default_price":28.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mark-ryden-the-snow-yak-show","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-20T20:39:22.000Z","description":"Traverse <b>Mark Ryden</b>'s vast wintry landscapes into the frigid domain of the majestic Snow Yak.

The inhabitants of this wintry world are bare angelic figures and their companion woolly snow yaks. The works were originally shown at the prestigious <i>Tomio Koyama Gallery</i> in Tokyo in February 2009.

Never reluctant to freight his work with layers of reference that range from Renaissance landscape and Neoclassical portrait painting to occultism and literature, in his latest works Ryden combines the arcane with pop-cultural images as ground from which to make his carefully executed leaps into fantasy. Ryden's series includes depictions of oak trees consuming children, floating tree stumps with \"seeing\" eyes, imaginary wood nymphs and mythological characters who personify Nature herself. Ryden paints his characters with a masterful, porcelain glow reminiscent of Ingres and renders his trees with a care that evokes Audubon's botanical illustration. Several of his paintings are presented in elaborately carved frames that project their narratives beyond the canvas. <i>The Tree Show</i> offers reproductions of these paintings and sculptures alongside the fruits of Ryden's research on the tree as myth--drawing from the Buddha's Bodhi Tree to Adam and Eve, the Sephiroth of the Kabbalah and matters of ecological science. As such, this volume constitutes an enticing dossier on Ryden's encyclopedic exploration of the subject and reproduces in its entirety this series centered around the arboreal world.\r\n\r\n<B>Hardcover</b>. 128 pages.\r\n<b>Pub</b>. - Porterhouse Fine Art Editions (2009)","options":[{"id":43920345,"name":"Default","price":40.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":20.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124624116/-/tree-show_bookCROP.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124624116/-/tree-show_bookCROP.jpg","width":282,"height":281},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124623960/-/tree-show_book.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124623960/-/tree-show_book.jpg","width":301,"height":400}],"artists":[{"id":234975,"name":"Mark Ryden","permalink":"mark-ryden","url":"/artist/mark-ryden"}],"categories":[{"id":6258462,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":14801133,"name":"Mark Ryden & Marion Peck: Sweet Wishes Book","permalink":"mark-ryden-marion-peck-sweet-wishes","position":43,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mark-ryden-marion-peck-sweet-wishes","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-12T20:10:20.000Z","description":"With its vibrant and colorful photographs, <i>Sweet Wishes</i> tells the tale of Dolly, Baby and Bear and what happens when they are granted a wish from a magical fairy.

It was Williams who brought the term \"lowbrow\" into the fine arts lexicon, with his groundbreaking 1979 book, <i>The Lowbrow Art of Robt. Williams</i> -- and from this point the seminal elements of West Coast Outlaw culture slowly started to aggregate. \r\n\r\nKnown as the \"artist's artist,\" in early punk rock art shows held in after-hours clubs, Williams soon pioneered the first break-away art movement in California since the Eucalyptus School's estrangement from Impressionism in the late 1920s. His bold use of underground cartoon figuration, paired with harshly contrasted psychedelic colors, set a style that was an easily recognizable hallmark throughout the 1980s and 1990s. \r\n\r\nWilliams' 2009 series of paintings, on display in the Conceptual Realism catalog, take the viewer into the world of subjective theory -- a mock realm of violated graphic physics, and the next logical step into abstract thought. Essays accompany approximately 25 works, insights into the process behind each painting, photos of sculptures in progress, and other surprises.  <i>Introduction by Don Ed Hardy</i>. \r\n\r\n<b>Softcover</b>. 88 pages.\r\n<b>Pub</b>. - Fantagraphics (2009)","options":[{"id":47974707,"name":"Default","price":24.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":20.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127462221/-/SQConceptualRealism_RWilliams164449__164449.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127462221/-/SQConceptualRealism_RWilliams164449__164449.jpg","width":348,"height":348},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127462236/-/ConceptualRealism_RWilliams164449__164449.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127462236/-/ConceptualRealism_RWilliams164449__164449.jpg","width":348,"height":400}],"artists":[{"id":235002,"name":"Robert Williams","permalink":"robert-williams","url":"/artist/robert-williams"}],"categories":[{"id":6258462,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":13693737,"name":"MAYDAY : The Art of Shepard Fairey Book","permalink":"mayday-the-art-of-shepard-fairey","position":62,"price":29.95,"default_price":29.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/mayday-the-art-of-shepard-fairey","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-20T21:41:23.000Z","description":"Drawing on work from the final exhibition before the closing of New York's seminal Deitch Projects, <i>MAYDAY</i> is simultaneously a call for heightened awareness and a celebration of the rebirth embodied in revolutionary movements. Fairey, one of the most important artists of our time, stakes the claim that artists, musicians and writers such as Joe Strummer, Jean Michel Basquiat and Cornel West all have parts to play in stimulating response to injustice. With energy and urgency befitting the title Mayday, Fairey captures the radical spirit of his subjects with portraiture, celebrating the artists, musicians and political activists he most admires. \r\n\r\nSays Fairey, \"These people I'm portraying were all revolutionary, in one sense or another. They started out on the margins of culture and ended up changing the mainstream. When we celebrate big steps that were made in the past, it reminds us that big steps can be made in the future.\" In Fairey's mind, the persistence of difficulties in the political, environmental, economic, and cultural arenas points to the definition of “mayday” as a distress signal: \"By now we thought we would be in post-Bush utopia, but we're still having to call attention to these problems.\" Like any mayday call, however, the sounding of the alarm also brings hope for help on the way. \"If we stay silent, there's no hope,\" Fairey muses. \"But if we make noise, if we put our ideas out there, then maybe we can make a change like the people in the portraits have done.\"\r\n\r\n<b>Hardcover</b>. 168 pages.\r\n<b>Pub</b>. - Gingko Press (2010)","options":[{"id":43923723,"name":"Default","price":29.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":14.0,"amount_with_others":20.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124626297/-/mayday_shepard_fairey_CROP.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124626297/-/mayday_shepard_fairey_CROP.jpg","width":214,"height":214},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124626258/-/mayday_shepard_fairey_LRG.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124626258/-/mayday_shepard_fairey_LRG.jpg","width":304,"height":400}],"artists":[{"id":235005,"name":"Shepard Fairey","permalink":"shepard-fairey","url":"/artist/shepard-fairey"}],"categories":[]},{"id":14722266,"name":"A Graphic Cosmogony: 24 Artists Take On 7 Pgs To Tell Their Tales Of The Creation Of Everything Book","permalink":"a-graphic-cosmogony-24-artists-take-on-7-pages-to-tell-their-tales-of-the-creation-of-everything","position":63,"price":38.0,"default_price":38.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/a-graphic-cosmogony-24-artists-take-on-7-pages-to-tell-their-tales-of-the-creation-of-everything","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-09T01:11:22.000Z","description":"There is something instinctual, almost primal about making and consuming comics, especially highly graphic ones with few or no words. So what better means than comics, the distillation of illuminated manuscripts, tapestries, meditational paintings and decorated scrolls and all of humanities' narrative arts, to tell that oldest story of them all, the story of creation? The Biblical creation myth proposes that God created the world in seven days, or six plus one day off to chill out, so in that spirit the two-dozen cartoonist-shamans corralled into this compendium were given just seven pages to devise their own version of how we all got here. Some draw on tales from ancient traditions, such as Norse or Ainu legends or a universal mother's womb of all things. Some illustrate mainly in stylized profiles, harking back to Egyptian tomb walls or Grecian friezes. Others mostly ignore previous versions -- 'It's been done to death. You have to make it up' -- and take more oblique or satirical stabs. They try explaining the origins of everything as a magician's act, a simulation game, a failed school assignment, a yurt-dweller's break from boredom, the tears of a grief-stricken stag or the contents of a cyclops' vacuum-cleaner bag or the head of Derek. It's up to you whether you believe such 'dubious facts' as 'ghost energy', 'ether-juice' or the heresies of the 'Masters of the Universe'. Entire world faiths have been built on equally unlikely accounts. Perhaps if enough readers of this volume start believing in certain stories, they might cause a spate of new religions to spring up based upon them. Pull up a rock and gather round the flickering fire -- the universe is about to be born again... \r\n\r\n<b>Participating Artists</b>: <i>Stuart Kolakovic, Mikkel Sommers, Brecht Vandenbroucke, Luke Best, Rob Hunter, Jon McNaught, Ben Newman, Andrew Rae, Luke Pearson, Jack Teagle, Jon Boam, Jakob Hindrichs, Clayton Junior, Daniel Locke, Isabel Greenberg, Mike Bertino, Nick White, Rui Tenreiro, Sean Hudson, Luc Melanson, Katia Fouquet, Yeji Yun, Matthew Lyons, Liesbeth De Stercke</i>.\r\n\r\n<b>Hardcover</b>. 176 pages.\r\n<b>Pub</b>. - Nobrow Press (2012)","options":[{"id":47696970,"name":"Default","price":38.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127258656/-/SQGraphicCosmogony.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127258656/-/SQGraphicCosmogony.jpg","width":236,"height":236},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127258671/-/GraphicCosmogony.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127258671/-/GraphicCosmogony.jpg","width":293,"height":400}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6258462,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":13692036,"name":"JUXTAPOZ New Contemporary Book","permalink":"juxtapoz-new-contemporary","position":64,"price":29.95,"default_price":29.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/juxtapoz-new-contemporary","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-20T20:11:31.000Z","description":"The infinite approaches to painting throughout human history have mirrored, illuminated and extended perceptions of artists and viewers alike.<i> Juxtapoz New Contemporary</i> presents works by our modern era's foremost instigators in their eternal quest to render arresting work.

This book presents the work of 50 contemporary artists of the Surreal Art, Fantastic Realism, and Visionary Art traditions. The publishers have endeavored to compile a balanced publication, showing the extremes of both \"light\" and \"dark\" themes. The two extremes are usually presented separately, but here they are together under the umbrella of human experience. It features the work of established artists such as <i>Ernst Fuchs, Alex Grey, Kris Kuski, Brom</i>, and <i>Robert Venosa</i>, alongside that of relatively unknown, though extraordinary, artists, bringing a host of new artists into the public eye. The <i>Metamorphosis</I> series provides exposure for artists who express themselves imaginatively with exceptional technique and uncompromised individuality. Metamorphosis showcases this ever-expanding international movement of figurative artists who have resisted current trends in the art world and remained true to their artistic vision.
