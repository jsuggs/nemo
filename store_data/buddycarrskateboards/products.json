Like to have utmost confidence and control? So do we, and that is why we developed the Slide Thirty-Five.\r\nNothing beats the feeling of buzzing through canyons connected only by the wheels and wood on which you stand. Negotiating steep drops and drifting through corners at high speeds requires a dose of skill, a heavy hit of courage and equipment that you can trust. We developed the Slide Thirty-Five with total control in mind. Stripping the deck of anything unnecessary, to give you a solid platform for complete board control. We have extended the nose and tail areas of this deck to give plenty of leverage and pop for ollie's and shuv-it maneuvers. The \"Thirty-Five\" with it's brick like shape, is the perfect compliment to any riders looking to spend as much time going sideways as straight.

Our Spinto is designed for getting you through your journey with the least amount of energy and maximum amount of comfort. How did we do this? The Spinto has one of the deepest drops of any decks, at nearly 2 inches, the Spinto sits extremely low to the ground. By dropping the deck as low as possible, we have allowed the rider to have an easier and more efficient push than standard top mount decks. The low deck height also allows the rider to foot brake with more control than traditional decks, as sometimes negotiating traffic can be brutal,  stopping shouldn't be. We have  pressed the Spinto with a medium depth concave that cups your feet securely, a perfect blend that doesn't cause any foot discomfort on those double digit distances days.  If you are a serious LDP pusher or a casual weekend warrior, the Spinto delivers the perfect balance between performance, quality and stunningly great looks.\r\n\r\nSpinto is a collaboration between California based skateboarder Buddy Carr and New York based graphic designer <a href=\"http://www.yearofthesheep.com/\">Antonio Carusone</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Details</h2>\r\n<strong>- Shaped by Buddy Carr<br /><br />\r\n- Graphics by <a href=\"http://www.yearofthesheep.com/\">Antonio Carusone</a><br /><br />\r\n- 8 Ply Maple Veneer, 2\" Drop, Medium Concave (9.25' x 41.25\" /  32.75 wheelbase)<br /><br />\r\n- Cast Aluminum Paris Trucks<br /><br />\r\n- 77mm 78 Durometer Metro Express Model Wheels<br /><br />\r\n- Precision ABEC Ball Bearings<br /><br />\r\n- Full Griptape<br /><br />\r\n- Made in the USA<br /></strong>","options":[{"id":30066011,"name":"Default","price":270.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":24.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":49.5,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94431087/-/spinto-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94431087/-/spinto-1.jpg","width":670,"height":329},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94431095/-/spinto-3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94431095/-/spinto-3.jpg","width":670,"height":329},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/94431103/-/spinto-5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/94431103/-/spinto-5.jpg","width":670,"height":329}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":281482,"name":"Skateboards","permalink":"skateboards","url":"/category/skateboards"}]},{"id":6553777,"name":"Hello Tank","permalink":"hello-tank","position":4,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/hello-tank","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-27T04:25:25.000Z","description":"Screen Printed on 100% Combed Ringspun Cotton\r\n\r\nSuper-soft, Lightweight, Slimfit\r\n\r\nMachine Washable and Preshrunk to Minimize Shrinkage\r\n\r\nColor: Black, White","options":[{"id":20835557,"name":"White-Small-Womens ","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":20835559,"name":"White-Medium-Womens ","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":20835567,"name":"White-Large- Womens ","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":20835561,"name":"White-Small-Kids ","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":20835563,"name":"White-Medium-Kids ","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":20835565,"name":"White-Large-Kids ","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64371317/-/hello-tank1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64371317/-/hello-tank1.jpg","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64371349/-/hello-tank2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64371349/-/hello-tank2.jpg","width":667,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/64371365/-/hello-tank3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/64371365/-/hello-tank3.jpg","width":1000,"height":667}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":281196,"name":"Shirts","permalink":"shirts","url":"/category/shirts"}]},{"id":5120349,"name":"Skate Tool","permalink":"skate-tool","position":5,"price":38.0,"default_price":38.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/skate-tool","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-12-21T07:01:47.000Z","description":"Swiss made Skate Tool.

This well designed kick tail also makes modern, street tricks like shuvits, ollies and kick flips a breeze.  \r\n\r\nWe’ve built a medium depth concave into “Chocolat”, enough for sure foot placement, yet with ample room for foot adjustment during trick set up.  \r\n\r\n“Chocolat” has a unique rail design, that provides room for maximum wheel clearance and continues through the entire belly of the board, creating a visually stunning and functional bottom side.  \r\n\r\nWe carried that same look and feel onto the top and layered “Chocolat” with a meticulously cut sheet of grip tape that carries that same good look, while supplying plenty of foot traction at the same time. \r\n\r\nThe colour-matched 70mm 80 durometer, center set-bearing wheels, provide plenty of roll speed. With their hand- sanded riding surface, predictable and controllable slides are the norm.  \r\n\r\nAs for the trucks, we have chosen Buck Trucks; these high quality 180mm aluminum trucks, allow the rider to get in and out of deep turns with confidence and control.  \r\n\r\n“Barre de Chocolat” is wrapped in a stunning graphic, produced by Antonio Carusone.

When you first step onto the deck, you will notice your feet stay firmly planted where you place them. We spent countless hours, developing the perfect concave for pools and parks, a concave that keeps your feet where you want them. We call this new concave, “vice” for obvious reasons.  The unique fade away shape of the “66” adds flare and removes some of the bulk where you don’t need it. \r\n\r\nFor trucks, we have chosen Independent stage 10 trucks, ridden by nearly every top pool and park skater from California to New York. Simply put, these trucks work.  \r\n\r\nYour “66” is assembled with our 63mm 83 duro custom wheels. We produced these wheels slightly softer, which make skating rougher pools and parks and even streets, a breeze. \r\n\r\nThe “66” is, of course, finished off with a laser cut sheet of high traction grip tape and arrives to you fully assembled, tuned and ready to rip.\r\n\r\nWhether just starting, or a seasoned pool and park skate veteran, our “66” can take all you dish out and give you the confidence and comfort to take your skating to the next level.\r\n\r\nThe 66 Signature Complete is a collaboration between California based skateboarder Buddy Carr and New York based graphic designer <a href=\"http://www.yearofthesheep.com/\">Antonio Carusone</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Details</h2>\r\n<strong>- Shaped by Buddy Carr<br /><br />\r\n- Graphics by <a href=\"http://www.yearofthesheep.com/\">Antonio Carusone</a><br /><br />\r\n- 7 Ply Maple Veneer (9\" x 32\")<br /><br />\r\n- 15\" Wheelbase<br /><br />\r\n- Independent Stage 10 trucks<br /><br />\r\n- 62mm 83 Durometer Wheels<br /><br />\r\n- Precision ABEC 7 Ball Bearings<br /><br />\r\n- Custom Laser Cut Griptape<br /></strong>","options":[{"id":10737689,"name":"Default","price":210.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":24.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":11.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":49.5,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30470959/-/66-board-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30470959/-/66-board-1.jpg","width":670,"height":326},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30470967/-/66-board-4.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30470967/-/66-board-4.jpg","width":670,"height":326},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/30470975/-/66-board-5.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/30470975/-/66-board-5.jpg","width":670,"height":326}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":281482,"name":"Skateboards","permalink":"skateboards","url":"/category/skateboards"}]},{"id":2663298,"name":"Velocita Longboard","permalink":"velocita-longboard","position":9,"price":265.0,"default_price":265.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/velocita-longboard","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-07-20T07:47:03.000Z","description":"In Italy L’ESIGENZA DELLA VELOCITÀ simply means “The Need for Speed“ .\r\n\r\nTaking cues from high performance European autos, the Velocita is a standout among many in both look and ride.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the deck, we pressed 8 ply’s of maple veneers in our deepest concave to give sure-foot placement and lateral strength, thus eliminating virtually all flex.  Next we developed what we call our drop flush, truck mount system.  Our unique truck mount system allows us to lower the deck height, which puts the rider closer to the ground, for more comfort and control. The deck also features our unique shelf for the truck to rest on, which creates a seamless, uninterrupted view from nose to tail.\r\n\r\nYour Velocita comes equipped with our all new, dual hub wheel design.  Unlike any wheel in the past, the Velocita wheel is guaranteed to give you traction when you need it and yet, remain predictable when allowed to slide.
