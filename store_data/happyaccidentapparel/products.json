Is it like-minded people, who share ideals, beliefs or some other common values? Does it take a certain number of people to make a community?\r\nIf the people around you encourage and support you, even when you’re full of it, are they being a good community? If you aspire to join a clique or elite, and that clique decides to accept you, are you then a part of a community?\r\nI believe that community is nothing but mutual respect. People can form a community without having common beliefs, without having shared identity or defining themselves in terms of each other. Numbers are irrelevant; ideals and desires are irrelevant; even the extent of mutual support and patronage is largely irrelevant. Community is a state of mind. It’s a sense of belonging that springs from feeling other people accept you despite, not because, of who you are?","options":[{"id":9948349,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29881859/-/community.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29881859/-/community.jpg","width":600,"height":650}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1689643,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":2851217,"name":"Dream","permalink":"dream","position":3,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/dream","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-11-09T10:59:19.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":9948335,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/27604579/-/dream.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/27604579/-/dream.jpg","width":321,"height":406}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1689643,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]},{"id":2851225,"name":"ExpressYourself","permalink":"expressyourself","position":4,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/expressyourself","status":"coming-soon","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2010-11-09T11:00:47.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":9948353,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/29881419/-/expressmock.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/29881419/-/expressmock.jpg","width":600,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1689643,"name":"Tees","permalink":"tees","url":"/category/tees"}]}]
