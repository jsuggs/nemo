Based on these experiences, the two brothers collaborated with Vitra over a period of four years to develop Vegetal.\r\n\r\nThe process involved countless prototypes and an intense exploration of injection moulding technology. The goal was create a chair that aspires to look like natural vegetation while simultaneously incorporating the necessary strength, stability and comfort. The flat, branch-like ribs are asymmetrically intertwined on three levels to form the seat shell, which is shaped as an irregular circle and supported by four legs that appear to sprout from the ground.\r\n\r\nVegetal is available in six colours that are unusual for plastic chairs, emphasising the underlying concept of replicating structures found in nature. It is suitable for indoor or outdoor applications and can be stacked up to three chairs high, which permits flexible use in a variety of settings and in large numbers. The chair is manufactured using a highly energy-efficient process and is made from 100% recyclable polyamide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDimensions: 606 x 813 x 577 mm\r\n\r\nColours:\r\n01 Basic Dark (Black)\r\n25 Mauve Grey\r\n29 Brick\r\n30 Cream\r\n40 Chocolate\r\n51 Cactus\r\n\r\nDelivery time: 6-8 weeks.

It adapts to fit the body snugly and delivers great comfort, even without extensive upholstery.\r\n\r\nVitra has produced the Aluminium Chair programme for many decades to a consistently high quality.

Its name refers to the two types of sitting experiences that characterise the chair – from a normal position, Tip Ton can be tilted a few degrees forward where it then stays in place. The innovation behind this seemingly simple feature lies in the skids, which rise at a nine-degree angle. The forward-tilt sitting position, until now the preserve of mechanical office chairs, straightens the pelvis and spine and thus improves circulation to the abdominal and back muscles.

From the normal\r\nposition, Tip Ton can be tilted a few degrees\r\nforward, where it then stays in place. The\r\nforward-tilt sitting position, until now the pre-\r\nserve of mechanical office chairs, straightens\r\nthe pelvis and spine and thus improves\r\ncirculation. Tip Ton is the first product to arise\r\nfrom the collaboration between Vitra, Edward\r\nBarber and Jay Osgerby.\r\n- Backrest, seat, base: Polypropylene.\r\n- Glides: Polyethylene.\r\n- Stackability: up to 4 Tip Ton chairs can be\r\nstacked on the floor.","options":[{"id":17520869,"name":"Colour: Basic dark","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":17521001,"name":"Colour:
