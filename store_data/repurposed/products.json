This book was bright and colorful and it's pages were turned many times. As the years went by the book got a little old and worn and the child grew up and moved on to other things. The poor book was discarded. It's taped pages had yellowed and it's inscription for a dear aunt had faded. It was discarded. (Don't be discouraged the story ends well). Then one day an environmentally conscious lady snagged the old book and with a little bit of magic she turned it into a georgous purse and it had purpose once again. The purse and it's new owner (that would be you) lived happily ever after.\r\n\r\nMade with the recycled pages of \"What Do People Do All Day\"'s Train Trip Story, recycled linens and various other recycled fabrics. Inside has two pockets, bottom sits flat. Stitched to clear vinyl for increased durability.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":726111,"name":"Default","price":78.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":7.5,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/995610/-/newtraintrip.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/995610/-/newtraintrip.JPG","width":461,"height":615}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":151881,"name":"Green Products","permalink":"green-products","url":"/category/green-products"}]},{"id":160346,"name":"The Monster at the End of This Book Recycled Storybook Purse","permalink":"the-monster-at-the-end-of-this-book-recycled-storybook-purse","position":2,"price":78.0,"default_price":78.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-monster-at-the-end-of-this-book-recycled-storybook-purse","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-10-01T18:40:55.000Z","description":"Recycled from a favorite of mine.
