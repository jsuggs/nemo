Coconut Oil creates large, fluffy, stable lather in handmade soap and also contributes toward hard, long lasting bars. Also great in hair conditioners, lotions, and creams. I typically use coconut oil at around 20 to 30% in my soapmaking.\r\n\r\nCoconut oil is absorbed by the skin well and doesn't stain clothing or sheets. Great for hair care products, scrubs and balms.\r\n\r\nTo make this oil, coconuts are cut and dried until the moisture content of the meat is minimized. The dried copra is then grated and expeller pressed to remove the oil. Finally, the oil is refined to produce an oil suitable for consumption.\r\n\r\nShelf life: 2 years\r\n\r\nDifferent sizes are available (8 ounces, 5 pounds, etc.) Please e-mail us for pricing.","options":[{"id":9146244,"name":"Default","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.5,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/24855201/-/iStock_000009260138XSmall.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/24855201/-/iStock_000009260138XSmall.jpg","width":400,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1542373,"name":"Carrier Oils","permalink":"carrier-oils","url":"/category/carrier-oils"}]}]
