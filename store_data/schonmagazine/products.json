Magazine has been given over to all that is dark, different, and above all extraordinary, combining the supermodel status of our cover star Tony Ward with news of fresh talent. With an exclusive preview of next season’s spring/summer menswear from Lanvin and Alexander McQueen, shot by Jannis Tsipoulanis before you see them anywhere else, it’s our most fashion-forward edition yet. The Parisian label JITROIS has recognised the rising brilliance of Schön! and chosen us for their first editorial outside of the major global magazines, featuring their signature stretched leather.\r\n\r\nWe’ve ventured into the deepest night through a series of dusky editorials, from the LaRoache Brothers’ shadow-like models, barely illuminated by their halos of piled-high hair, to the statuesque onyx of ‘Carbon’ by Pierre Dal Corso. Mysterious shapes in the night continue to intrigue in Stefan Milev’s lingerie story and Matthew Lyn’s gritty street-side fashion photography from the heart of New York. The tension reaches fever pitch in a ghostly, flame-lit collection of images from You Bin, refracted by chilling light and highlighted in a wash of acid blue, aptly entitled ‘Exorcism.’ \r\n\r\nThe mood lifts slightly with an interview with choreographer and director Shelly Love and the exotic, foreign beauty of a modern day geisha captured by Stefan Giftthaler. In our search for the next wave of global talent, we’ve been talking to innovative furniture designer Yahϊa Ouled-Moussa and the two halves behind fashion force Mastori*Motwary as well as delving into new photography art book, The Dualism. Sensational painter Liu Fei has given us an exclusive preview of his work while Yvonne Renard asks “Can you say ‘Dior,’ baby?” in her regular opinion column, exercising her sharp wit and sartorial irony.\r\n\r\nBreathing heat into an otherwise eerie edition of Schön! Magazine is the seductive beauty of lace-clad limbs on cool stone in our seductive ‘Marble’ editorial and Rayan Ayash’s autumnal fashion story. We’ve cherry picked and interviewed four of the best young European menswear designers, and travelled to some of the world’s most exclusive boutique hotels in our travel feature. A round-the-world trip through Africa, Asia, Europe and America wouldn’t be complete without a turn at one of these seductive hideaways. \r\n\r\nAs things heat up, we’ve been more provocative and daring than ever before in our full-length editorial featuring the legendary Tony Ward photographed by Dimitris Theochardis. Shot like you’ve never seen him before, Tony exudes strength and masculinity in a series of smouldering portraits. It’s been an honour to work with one of the most immediately recognisable men in fashion, and we’re thrilled with the results.  \r\n","options":[{"id":10049398,"name":"Glossy Cover \" Limited Edition\"","price":8.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.95,"amount_with_others":5.95,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":9.95,"amount_with_others":9.95}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/28008368/-/TONY_ISSUE9_small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/28008368/-/TONY_ISSUE9_small.jpg","width":760,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1846357,"name":"Print","permalink":"print","url":"/category/print"}]},{"id":3186321,"name":"Schön! 9 - eBook download","permalink":"schon-9-ebook-download","position":47,"price":4.99,"default_price":4.99,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/schon-9-ebook-download","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-01-26T00:26:41.000Z","description":"Schön! 9—Tony Ward\r\n\r\n\r\nIssue 9 has been given over to all that is dark, different and above all extraordinary, just like our cover star, supermodel Tony Ward.
