Each embellishment (flowers, ribbon etc) are adhered to the tutu by stitching first and using a professional adhesive for extra strength. \r\n\r\nEach tutu is made to fit your little one. When you order, you give the size she is currently wearing or a waist measurement and I make the tutu to fit her exactly. The tulle is full and fluffy and 4-8 inches long depending on her size.\r\n\r\nWhen checking out, please specify Newborn to 12m or 6y+ as these are different pricing. \r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":17939219,"name":"4 colors or more add on   $3","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17939221,"name":"size 6years   $3","price":28.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":17939223,"name":"Newborn to size 12m","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":17939225,"name":"Size 12m to 6y","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54716217/-/17976_281287783845_3940551_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54716217/-/17976_281287783845_3940551_n.jpg","width":604,"height":453},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54716257/-/17976_281287788845_281232518845_3339926_1158409_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54716257/-/17976_281287788845_281232518845_3339926_1158409_n.jpg","width":453,"height":604},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/54716273/-/17976_281287873845_281232518845_3339937_5832414_n.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/54716273/-/17976_281287873845_281232518845_3339937_5832414_n.jpg","width":604,"height":402}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2949585,"name":"Tutus","permalink":"tutus","url":"/category/tutus"}]}]
