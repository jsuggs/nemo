The deluxe set is presented in a high school annual-inspired hardbound book with personal recollections from the band's members, replicated classic artwork and memorabilia, photos from the band's archive, and handwritten yearbook-style inscriptions from Beach Boys Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston, and David Marks.\r\n\r\nProduced by The Beach Boys and The SMiLE Sessions' GRAMMY Award-winning team of Mark Linett, Alan Boyd, and Dennis Wolfe, \"Made In California\" chronologically charts the 50-year career of America's Band, from their earliest demos to their most recent recordings. With huge hits and rare gems including never-before-released original songs, home demos, alternate takes and mixes, and live concert, television and radio performances, the set showcases the breadth and diversity of The Beach Boys' recorded catalogue and illustrates the band's unique and evocative West Coast story. \r\n\r\n\"Made In California's\" memorabilia includes Brian Wilson's 1959 high school essay titled \"My Philosophy,\" which is reproduced in the collection's book in its original handwritten form (the original is currently on display in The GRAMMY Museum's yearlong Beach Boys exhibit celebrating the band's 50-year career). \r\n\r\n\"Made In California's\" previously unreleased and long sought-after recordings include \"Goin' To The Beach,\" \"California Feelin',\" \"Soul Searchin',\" \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling,\" and \"You're Still A Mystery,\" among others.

Nilsson is an artist with an intriguing story, he had the talent, the charisma, was acclaimed and endorsed by The Beatles and his peers and had a highly publicised friendship with John Lennon (who notably produced his Pussy Cats album). He won Grammy's, had hit songs and contemporary artists continue to cover Nilsson tracks. Yet it's purely through a small selection of songs he released at the peak of his commercial success in the early 1970s that he is mostly known to the mainstream, through the hit singles \"Everybody's Talkin'\" (1969), \"Without You\" (1971), and \"Coconut\" (1972). He never quite became a household name, however his importance and influence as an artist who remained true to his own path cannot be denied, and those in the Harry Nilsson appreciation club will tell you there was so much more to the man and the artist than the handful of hits. This extensive 17 CD box set represents almost every recording Nilsson made for RCA Victor Records: re-mastered classic albums, alternate versions, single- only tracks, demos, foreign language one-offs, interviews and radio spots. A body of work which demonstrates Nilsson's undeniable gift through his recordings 1967-1977.","options":[{"id":42073062,"name":"Default","price":200.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":20.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123315795/-/harry.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123315795/-/harry.jpg","width":293,"height":170}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5414001,"name":"Artist

Light is perhaps the greatest of Gene Clark's solo albums, arriving just after the former Byrds guitarist/singer severed his alliance with Doug Dillard. White Light was released in 1971 and while it was trippier, dreamier than anything Clark produced before, it paled in comparison to the wild, intricate psychedelia that came later, particularly on 1974's coke-blown No Other. Compared to that, White Light feels minimalist but Here Tonight: The White Light Demos, a collection released by Omnivore in 2013, is even sparer, capturing Clark alone with his acoustic guitar, working out the songs that would wind up on the finished album, along with tunes that would surface later: two songs (\"Opening Day,\" \"Winter\") wouldn't show up on the 2002 reissue of the LP; three (\"For No One,\" \"Please Mr. Freud,\" \"Jimmy Christ\") have never been released; another (\"Here Tonight\") wound up on the Flying Burrito Brothers collection Close Up the Honky-Tonks. This Spartan setting accentuates the broken heart at the center of the songs, underlining the melancholic undercurrent that flows beneath White Light, and it's certainly possible that some listeners may prefer the melancholic immediacy of these unadorned recordings. Often, the richer production is a benefit -- certainly it adds to the dreaminess of White Light -- but, stripped to the basics of guitar and voice, these songs retain their spooky, otherworldly quality and, arguably, are even eerier in this early incarnation. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi","options":[{"id":37966509,"name":"Default","price":24.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/118195794/-/gene.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/118195794/-/gene.jpg","width":500,"height":500}],"artists":[{"id":214503,"name":"Gene Clark","permalink":"gene-clark","url":"/artist/gene-clark"}],"categories":[{"id":5413998,"name":"Artist A-E","permalink":"artist-a-e","url":"/category/artist-a-e"},{"id":5181267,"name":"Recommended","permalink":"recommended","url":"/category/recommended"},{"id":5180865,"name":"CD","permalink":"cd","url":"/category/cd"},{"id":5180871,"name":"New Releases","permalink":"new-releases","url":"/category/new-releases"}]},{"id":11997864,"name":"Joy Division -

Though suffocated by Lake Erie's nitrate rich waters and the burning oil from a Cuyahoga River fire, between 1967-1977 Lou Ragland produced the most thoughtful, hopeful, and downright soulful work to come out of the Forest City. Bookended by his dynamic albums Hot Chocolate and Understand Each Other, I Travel Alone gathers period singles, collaborations, and an unreleased live album cut in 1973, revealing a Cleveland genius in a musical microcosm of fearless and confident creation.\r\n\r\nTRACKLISTING:\r\n<b>Hot Chocolate</b>\r\nA1 Hot Chocolate – Ain't That A Groove\t\t\r\nA2 Hot Chocolate – So Dam Funky\t\t\r\nA3 Hot Chocolate – Sexy Moods Of Your Mind\t\t\r\nA4 Hot Chocolate – Messin' With Sly\t\t\r\nB1 Hot Chocolate – We Had True Love\t\t\r\nB2 Hot Chocolate – What You Want To Do\t\t\r\nB3 Hot Chocolate – What Should I Do\t\t\r\n \t \r\n<b>Live From Agency</b>\r\nC1 Hot Chocolate – The World Is A Gheto\t\t\r\nC2 Hot Chocolate – It Ain't My Fault\t\t\r\nC3 Hot Chocolate – Could It Be I'm Falling In Love\t\t\r\nC4 Hot Chocolate – Until I Met You\t\t\r\nD1 Hot Chocolate – Spend My Life Loving You\t\t\r\nD2 Hot Chocolate – Brother Louie\t\t\r\nD3 Hot Chocolate - Good For The Gander\t\t\r\n \t \r\n<b>Understand Each Other</b>\r\nE1 Lou Ragland – Understand Each Other\t\t\r\nE2 Lou Ragland – What Happened To The Feeling\t\t\r\nE3 Lou Ragland – Since You Said You'd Be Mine\t\t\r\nE4 Lou Ragland – Just For Being You (Lovin' You)\t\t\r\nF1 Lou Ragland – What I Should Do ?\t\t\r\nF2 Lou Ragland – It's Got To Change\t\t\r\nF3 Lou Ragland – The Next World\t\t\r\nF4 Lou Ragland - Understand Each Other (Instrumental)\t\t\r\n\r\n<b>The Bandmaster</b>\r\nG1 Lou Ragland – I Travel Alone\t\t\r\nG2 Lou Ragland – Big Wheel\t\t\r\nG3 Volcanic Eruption – Red Robin\t\t\r\nG4 Volcanic Eruption – I've Got Something Going For Me\t\t\r\nG5 Hot Chocolate – Good For The Gander\t\t\r\nG6 Hot Chocolate – We Had True Love\t\t\r\nH1 Lou Ragland & Hot Chocolate – I Can't Take It\t\t\r\nH2 Lou Ragland & Hot Chocolate – What The Doctor Prescribed\t\t\r\nH3 Lou Ragland – Since You Said You'd Be Mine\t\t\r\nH4 Lou Ragland – I Didn't Mean To Leave You\t\t\r\nH5 Wildfire – Tend To Your Business","options":[{"id":36494931,"name":"Default","price":90.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/113875110/-/LouRagland-Alone.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/113875110/-/LouRagland-Alone.jpg","width":300,"height":300},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/113875158/-/LouRagland-Alone2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/113875158/-/LouRagland-Alone2.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":207432,"name":"Lou Ragland","permalink":"lou-ragland","url":"/artist/lou-ragland"}],"categories":[{"id":5414001,"name":"Artist L-R","permalink":"artist-l-r","url":"/category/artist-l-r"},{"id":5181276,"name":"Vinyl P-Z","permalink":"vinyl-p-z","url":"/category/vinyl-p-z"},{"id":5181267,"name":"Recommended","permalink":"recommended","url":"/category/recommended"},{"id":5180862,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"},{"id":5180868,"name":"Boxset","permalink":"boxset","url":"/category/boxset"},{"id":5180871,"name":"New Releases","permalink":"new-releases","url":"/category/new-releases"}]},{"id":11210832,"name":"Rodriguez ‎– Cold Fact LP","permalink":"rodriguez-cold-fact-lp","position":196,"price":32.0,"default_price":32.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rodriguez-cold-fact-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-17T09:19:13.000Z","description":"Rodriguez ‎– Cold Fact LP\r\nSealed Copy\r\n\r\nTRACKLISTING:\r\nA1 Sugar Man\r\nA2 Only Good For Conversation\r\nA3 Crucify Your Mind\r\nA4 This Is Not A Song, It's An Outburst: Or, The Establishment Blues\r\nA5 Hate Street Dialogue\r\nA6 Forget It\r\nB1 Inner City Blues\r\nB2 I Wonder\r\nB3 Like Janis\r\nB4 Gommorah (A Nursery Rhyme)\r\nB5 Rich Folks Hoax\r\nB6 Jane S.

It was a dark Friday afternoon before a long weekend away. On its first play I grossly underestimated just how many times the album would be repeated over the weekend - near-constantly. Those same thrills return to me hearing the duo’s follow-up album Crosswords. These are harmonies and lyrics that have me believe in the power of the sisterhood, like an imagined Thelma & Louise get-away soundtrack. It is instrumentation I connect to – not just as sounds, but participatory actions. While air-guitaring, -drumming or -one-handed-keyboarding along, I quickly realise the actual pace and placing of the garage-pop parts. Equal measures light and dark: proud partying and shared secrets. Haul yourself away to indulge privately in this album to start with, then resurface to celebrate its Melbourne launch May 31.","options":[{"id":34048053,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/106558089/-/3664_LRG.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/106558089/-/3664_LRG.jpg","width":400,"height":400}],"artists":[{"id":198429,"name":"Super Wild Horses","permalink":"super-wild-horses","url":"/artist/super-wild-horses"}],"categories":[{"id":5414004,"name":"Artist S-Z","permalink":"artist-s-z","url":"/category/artist-s-z"},{"id":5181276,"name":"Vinyl P-Z","permalink":"vinyl-p-z","url":"/category/vinyl-p-z"},{"id":5180862,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"},{"id":5181249,"name":"Australian Releases","permalink":"australian-releases","url":"/category/australian-releases"},{"id":5180871,"name":"New Releases","permalink":"new-releases","url":"/category/new-releases"}]},{"id":11120520,"name":"Tame Impala -

These volumes survey songs of labor and occupation, hardship and loss, dance tunes, comic numbers, and novelties that provided distraction and fun and the hymns and sacred pieces that reached beyond the raw material of daily existence for something enduring. Work Hard, Play Hard, Pray Hard features 19 previously un-reissued sides and is largely drawn from the collection of the late Don Wahle of Louisville, Kentucky. A hillbilly 78 collector for many years, his records were hours away from the dump when producer Nathan Salsburg recovered them.

3-LP set us pressed on 180 gram black vinyl. Side B of the third disc will contain an etching. The first album of original music from Neil Young and Crazy Horse in almost a decade, including over 85 minutes of music. Psychedelic Pill pokes down pathways that have been hinted at before in this teaming, but never fully explored. New textures emerge in the music, new landscapes in the lyrics. In many ways, Psychedelic Pill rounds out an array of probing works with prominent autobiographical threads.","options":[{"id":34048176,"name":"Default","price":90.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/106558425/-/tumblr_md309zFHju1qcx7d8o1_cover.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/106558425/-/tumblr_md309zFHju1qcx7d8o1_cover.jpg","width":400,"height":400}],"artists":[{"id":198420,"name":"Neil Young","permalink":"neil-young","url":"/artist/neil-young"},{"id":198423,"name":"Neil Young & Crazy Horse","permalink":"neil-young-crazy-horse","url":"/artist/neil-young-crazy-horse"}],"categories":[{"id":5414004,"name":"Artist S-Z","permalink":"artist-s-z","url":"/category/artist-s-z"},{"id":5181276,"name":"Vinyl P-Z","permalink":"vinyl-p-z","url":"/category/vinyl-p-z"},{"id":5181267,"name":"Recommended","permalink":"recommended","url":"/category/recommended"},{"id":5180862,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"},{"id":5180871,"name":"New Releases","permalink":"new-releases","url":"/category/new-releases"}]},{"id":11211012,"name":"Neil Young & Crazy Horse - Zuma LP **MINT**","permalink":"neil-young-crazy-horse-zuma-lp-mint","position":273,"price":30.0,"default_price":30.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/neil-young-crazy-horse-zuma-lp-mint","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-17T09:32:02.000Z","description":"Neil Young - Zuma LP **MINT**\r\n\r\nTRACKLISTING:.\r\nA1 Don't Cry No Tears\r\nA2 Danger Bird\r\nA3 Pardon My Heart\r\nA4 Lookin' For A Love\r\nA5 Barstool Blues\r\nB1 Stupid Girl\r\nB2 Drive Back\r\nB3 Cortez The Killer\r\nB4 Through My Sails","options":[{"id":35272059,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110271921/-/NeilYoung-Zuma.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110271921/-/NeilYoung-Zuma.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":198420,"name":"Neil Young","permalink":"neil-young","url":"/artist/neil-young"},{"id":198423,"name":"Neil Young & Crazy Horse","permalink":"neil-young-crazy-horse","url":"/artist/neil-young-crazy-horse"}],"categories":[{"id":5414004,"name":"Artist S-Z","permalink":"artist-s-z","url":"/category/artist-s-z"},{"id":5181276,"name":"Vinyl P-Z","permalink":"vinyl-p-z","url":"/category/vinyl-p-z"},{"id":5181267,"name":"Recommended","permalink":"recommended","url":"/category/recommended"},{"id":5180862,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"},{"id":5291646,"name":"Rare Vinyl","permalink":"rare-vinyl","url":"/category/rare-vinyl"}]},{"id":11145063,"name":"The Zombies ‎– Odessey & Oracle LP","permalink":"the-zombies-odessey-oracle-lp","position":274,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-zombies-odessey-oracle-lp","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-05-14T12:17:43.000Z","description":"The Zombies ‎– Odessey & Oracle LP\r\nRhino Records Reissue.\r\n\r\nTRACKLISTING:\r\nA1 Care Of Cell 44\t\t\r\nA2 A Rose For Emily\t\t\r\nA3 Maybe After He's Gone\t\t\r\nA4 Beechwood Park\t\t\r\nA5 Brief Candles\t\t\r\nA6 Hung Up On A Dream\t\t\r\nB1 Changes\t\t\r\nB2 I Want Her She Wants Me\t\t\r\nB3 This Will Be Our Year\t\t\r\nB4 Butchers Tale (Western Front 1914)\t\t\r\nB5 Friends Of Mine\t\t\r\nB6 Time Of The Season","options":[{"id":35059905,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109610889/-/TheZombies-OdesseyAndOracle.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109610889/-/TheZombies-OdesseyAndOracle.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":201645,"name":"The Zombies","permalink":"the-zombies","url":"/artist/the-zombies"}],"categories":[{"id":5414004,"name":"Artist S-Z","permalink":"artist-s-z","url":"/category/artist-s-z"},{"id":5181276,"name":"Vinyl P-Z","permalink":"vinyl-p-z","url":"/category/vinyl-p-z"},{"id":5181267,"name":"Recommended","permalink":"recommended","url":"/category/recommended"},{"id":5180862,"name":"LP","permalink":"lp","url":"/category/lp"}]}]
