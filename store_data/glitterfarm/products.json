The bags are unique, because I lined them with a vintage cotton table cloth. There's also a pocket inside for sunglasses, keys or a phone. All the fabric is vintage, so you'll undoubtedly see the color variations and character of its former life (holding the ingredients for baguettes and yummy pastries!)\r\n\r\n<b>MEASURES:</b> 20\" Wide x 13\" Tall x 3\" deep, with a 14\" strap (Distance from your shoulder to the top of the bag). Strap is 1.75\" wide.\r\n\r\n<b>COLOR:</b> Outside is the natural color of the grain sack material; inside is a vintage cotton print tablecloth pattern featuring blues and pinks.\r\n\r\n<b>OPTIONS:</b> I have one other slightly larger version of this bag with a print table cloth that uses yellows and greens for the lining. \r\n\r\n<b>SHIPPING:</b> Shipping to the U.S. is $8, and Canada is $10. UK, New Zealand, Australia, and Ireland $18. I ship to countries other than those listed.
