The opener ‘summer’ is Wits End channeling Christie Front Drive... Mellow guitars, dual vocals and the mid 90s all over again. Then ‘winter’, albeit a slow song, brings back the heavier lyrical topics and more driving sound. Sweden's favorites, Trembling Hands (mem of Suis La Lune), deliver one song from the same recording session as the self titled 7″ last year. Heavy emotional stuff like Majority Rule or Malady.

The band started as a group of 4 friends who create powerful, energetic melodic post hardcore with a message and lots of heart.  Noisy, distorted, melodic, beautiful, emotive, and sad sounding music. At times, it’s really hard to categorize the band’s sound. The songs are genuine and honest and it’s rare when a band like this comes along and sticks so close to how this style should sound, but Adorno has accomplished this sound to perfection. Fans of 1000 Travels Of Jawarhalal, Hot Cross, and Comadre take note!!! The songs on this LP are the songs from the band’s split 7″ with Black Heart Rebellion, their split 7″ with Eric Ayotte, the split 12″ with Sugartown Cabaret, their track from the Connections compilation, and one unreleased song.” – elementary revolt \r\n\r\n11 songs. Comes with: Hand-screened poly bag and CD of the songs too!  Released on SHOVE Records from Italy.","options":[{"id":30639901,"name":"Default","price":11.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":18,"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HK"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":125,"name":"Hungary","code":"HU"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":22,"name":"Israel","code":"IL"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":232,"name":"Vatican City State (Holy See)","code":"VA"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":12.5,"country":{"id":27,"name":"Malaysia","code":"MY"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":185,"name":"Puerto Rico","code":"PR"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/96214744/-/adorno_year_two_lp.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/96214744/-/adorno_year_two_lp.jpg","width":350,"height":350}],"artists":[{"id":52449,"name":"Adorno","permalink":"adorno","url":"/artist/adorno"},{"id":16881,"name":"Suis La Lune","permalink":"suis-la-lune","url":"/artist/suis-la-lune"}],"categories":[{"id":67822,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"},{"id":2538965,"name":"Distro Items","permalink":"distro-items","url":"/category/distro-items"},{"id":4820623,"name":"Vinyl - LP / 10\"","permalink":"vinyl-lp-10","url":"/category/vinyl-lp-10"}]},{"id":8544048,"name":"\"A Summer Tour With\" book (Algernon Cadwallader, Snowing, 1994!)","permalink":"a-summer-tour-with-book-algernon-cadwallader-snowing-1994","position":57,"price":18.0,"default_price":18.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/a-summer-tour-with-book-algernon-cadwallader-snowing-1994","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-12-14T03:46:04.000Z","description":"\"asummertourwith...\" is a collection of photographs taken while ALGERNON CADWALLADER, SNOWING, and 1994!, traversed the USA over a 6 week period.

In early 2008, for several reasons, Christian left both bands.\r\n\r\nHe spent the summer of 2008 working as a carpenter in eastern Long Island. Inhabiting a tiny basement room, he began working on the songs that shape On The Knife. In the fall he moved back to Brooklyn and teamed up with his old friend, multi-instrumentalist Dylan Edrich (Chain and the Gang), and Little Gold was born.\r\n\r\nRecorded to tape at Emandee Studio in Brooklyn, On the Knife is a deeply personal take on love and loss, and was very much shaped by Christian’s departure from his previous bands. Like his earlier work with Woods, the songwriting is earnest, and of course there are a few indulgent headphone tracks as well.\r\n\r\nNow joined by stand-up drummer Patty Conway, Little Gold has begun to incorporate more improvisational and psychedelic sounds into their mellow, country-rock oeuvre, and in the process are becoming a notable live act around NYC.\"\r\n\r\nReleased by ADAGIO830","options":[{"id":25414608,"name":"Default","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":18,"name":"Hong Kong","code":"HK"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":125,"name":"Hungary","code":"HU"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":21,"name":"Ireland","code":"IE"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":22,"name":"Israel","code":"IL"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":25,"name":"Japan","code":"JP"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":31,"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":232,"name":"Vatican City State (Holy See)","code":"VA"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":12.5,"country":{"id":27,"name":"Malaysia","code":"MY"}},{"amount_alone":16.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":28,"name":"Mexico","code":"MX"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":185,"name":"Puerto Rico","code":"PR"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":18.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/79154409/-/little-gold.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/79154409/-/little-gold.jpg","width":148,"height":149}],"artists":[{"id":2008,"name":"Teenage Cool Kids","permalink":"teenage-cool-kids","url":"/artist/teenage-cool-kids"}],"categories":[{"id":2538965,"name":"Distro Items","permalink":"distro-items","url":"/category/distro-items"},{"id":4820623,"name":"Vinyl -
