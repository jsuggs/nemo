This legendary series has introduced nearly 150 incredible bands including Jimmy Eat World, The Appleseed Cast, This Drama, Further Seems Forever (featuring Chris Carrabba of Dashboard Confessional), Planes Mistaken For Stars, The Movielife, Samiam and many more to fans wordwide. All songs are Exclusive and Unreleased making each chapter of The Emo Diaries a true compilation, not a sampler of previously released music. All bands were selected based on blind submissions of music (10,000+ submissions received)...so only the music matters, not who submits. We haven't intended to define the emo genre, but instead share with you the music that moves us and support these incredible bands...it's what we do. \"The best compilation series on this planet...period\" says Punk Rock Reviews.\r\n\r\nThe Emo Diaries, Chapter 12 features music by Dedicated To Dedications (Worthing, England), Arms Around The Stereo (Winnipeg, MB, Canada), The Dandelion War (Oakland, CA), The Sky Life (Edmonton, AB, Canada), Ease The Medic (Columbus, OH), Those Galloping Hordes (Reading, PA), Everlyn (Madrid, Spain), Goonies Never Say Die (Blackpool, England), Late Night Condition (Buenos Aires, Argentina), Nathaniel Sutton (Edmonton, AB, Canada), Collapse Under The Empire (Hamburg, Germany) and closes with a stunning submission by Summer Hours (Brooklyn, NY).
