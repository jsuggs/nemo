They include everything from a small local race to the Copper Basin 300.\r\n\r\nThe main focus of our racing season is the Iditarod in March. However, we participate in shorter distance races throughout the winter season. This insures that the dogs gain experience, in addition to their training. Just like any other sport, the more practice that you get the better you’re do.\r\n\r\nRacing is super expensive but critical to our kennels success. The cost of doing a race includes everything from an entry fee and supplies for the race itself to transportation, pre- and post- race accommodations, meals and more.\r\n\r\nSponsorship Benefits:\r\n• Second Listing and Link on Website\r\n• Logo on all Email Communications\r\n• Logo on IPK Dog Truck\r\n• Logo on Fundraising T-shirt Back\r\n• Recognition at Musher’s Banquet\r\n• IPK T-shirt ","options":[{"id":1558049,"name":"Default","price":2000.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3121809/-/race.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3121809/-/race.jpg","width":153,"height":153}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":76954,"name":"Donations","permalink":"donations","url":"/category/donations"}]},{"id":386786,"name":"2010 Sponsor a Checkpoint","permalink":"sponsor-a-checkpoint-1500","position":3,"price":1000.0,"default_price":1000.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/sponsor-a-checkpoint-1500","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-09-03T07:59:45.000Z","description":"Throughout the Iditarod, Tom will visit 20 different check points.
