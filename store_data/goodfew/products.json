It is a story of his attempt to escape from Crete by means of wings that his father, Daedalus, constructed with feathers and wax. Daedalus fashioned two pairs of wings, one for himself and one for his son. Before Daedalus took flight from the island, he warned his son not to fly too close to the sun or the sea, but to follow his path of flight. Overcome by the giddiness that flying lent him, Icarus soared through the sky curiously, but in the process he came too close to the sun, which melted the wax. Icarus kept flapping his wings but soon realized that he had no feathers left and that he was only flapping his bare arms and so Icarus fell into the sea.\r\n\r\nGoodfew applies the lessons in the tale of Icarus to how we acquire the solid characteristic of humility.  The plane with the sail underneath is meant to measure and balance out the distance from the water which symbolizes the stabilization of our ego and pride. If ego and pride begins to soar too close to the sun and plummets to the sea, we shall regain traction by the ship landing on its top side; displaying the ability of adaptation. We are as strong as the weakest passenger on our own vessel. The Goodfew is here to support your ambitions and your transformation into the great leader that we believe you to be.

The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.”  -Nelson Mandela\r\n\r\nThe journey of life takes you on a whirlwind that presents purpose. The design showcases an oversized rain drop hovering over a sailing individual wearing a heavy coat with his fishing pole in hand.   Each element of the design possesses a significant meaning that tells a story of life’s struggle.\r\n\r\nGoodfew is represented by an old English letter “G” which indicates the retention of the traditional morals and values that we carry out in our actions.  The oversized raindrop represents the unpredictable, uncontrollable, inevitable events; like Mother Nature, we have no control in how or when these obstacles may occur.  The coat is a representation of self- comfort and warmth in times of loneliness. In today’s society, it is becoming more difficult to reach out for and accept help from those around you without feeling as those you are being looked down upon; and although most of the battles are fought from within, we still are able to express our emotions superficially.  The fishing pole conveys our yearning to search for substance, ideas, and knowledge to aid in our transformation.  The paper boat is a symbol of our vulnerability.  It stands for the duration of hardship that we can endure. Just like a paper, we can fold, crumble, and separate when a cloud of disappointment begins to pour down on our paths.   The waves that run below the boat are separated by three colors: black, blue, and red.  The black layers represent the roughest obstacles. When in trouble, the average individual may result to hiding in their home base, a comfort zone. Departing from this location is the most difficult and crucial step to discovering who you are. At this point in life you are forced to either swim or will be swept away by the toughest current. The blue layer is the journey.  This is the seeking phase, meant to present new opportunities and a network of people/resources.  Lastly, the red represents the journey’s come to a self-realization where the waves are no longer an obstacle but instead a road that will act as the main path to lead us to success.\r\n\r\nCourage is the ability to face danger, difficulty, uncertainty, or pain without being overcome by fear.

No matter what city, country, or planet, HOME is where the heart is. Home  is where you were taught the basics of life, learned right from wrong, met some of your best friends, and  where you don't need a navigation system to get you from point A to point B; home is anything and everything.\r\n\r\nThe Goodfew FAMILY is a team that moves as a single unit; uplifting one another and always having each other's backs in times of need. We are all on the same court striving for something bigger than ourselves; contributing all we can to make what, some who may have told us, was impossible, possible.\r\n\r\nA team jersey was ideal to communicate our message. The number we felt best represented the Goodfew was INFINITY. Not only does the infinity sign signify that goodfew family is forever, it also signifies the infinite capabilities and possibilities that we believe every individual that joins our movement possesses. Never let one person tell you that you cannot do or achieve what you put your mind, heart, and soul into.

No matter what city, country, or planet, HOME is where the heart is. Home  is where you were taught the basics of life, learned right from wrong, met some of your best friends, and  where you don't need a navigation system to get you from point A to point B; home is anything and everything.\r\n\r\nThe Goodfew FAMILY is a team that moves as a single unit; uplifting one another and always having each other's backs in times of need. We are all on the same court striving for something bigger than ourselves; contributing all we can to make what, some who may have told us, was impossible, possible.\r\n\r\nA team jersey was ideal to communicate our message. The number we felt best represented the Goodfew was INFINITY.

You use it as a stepping stone. Close the door on the past. You don't try to forget the mistakes, but you don't dwell on it. You don't let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space.\" -Johnny Cash \r\n\r\nThe design is a story, simple and applicable to most of our journeys on how we decide our next big decision when the time came around. \r\n \r\nThe machete angled downwards signifies the ability to overcome trials and tribulations. We utilize the strengths gained from our experiences to learn to forgive, but most importantly learning to never forget  all that has helped us become who we are today.\r\n\r\nThe hammer aimed towards the sky symbolizes our ability to rebuild from our past. With a strong foundation based on lessons learned, one can revamp themselves in such a way to construct a whole new empire.  \r\n\r\n The crest along with the name Goodfew above the symbols reminds us that we have family behind us with undying support in everything we choose to do.  Sometimes all we need is a little bit of help, and who better to seek it from than family.  \r\n\r\n      ","options":[{"id":41238501,"name":"xlrg","price":20.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":41238504,"name":"large","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":41238507,"name":"medium","price":20.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":41238510,"name":"small","price":20.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122693859/-/IMG_6364.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122693859/-/IMG_6364.jpg","width":2755,"height":3456},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122693877/-/IMG_6366.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122693877/-/IMG_6366.jpg","width":3353,"height":2875}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5980833,"name":"Tanks","permalink":"tanks","url":"/category/tanks"},{"id":6796770,"name":"\"On Sale\"","permalink":"on-sale","url":"/category/on-sale"}]}]
