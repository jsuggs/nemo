The little point adds visual interest without being too, well, pointy.  The thick material makes them incredibly comfortable (and you won't have to worry about distorting the shape).  And every person who's seen them immediately asks for some of their own!\r\n\r\nThe droplet ring is also incredibly versatile - you can wear it alone, stack it with rings you already have, or do what I've been doing and wear a stack of three!\r\n\r\nMade from 14-kt gold-filled wire (that's 14-kt gold over brass).
