And while known as much for her voice as for her over-the-top wardrobe, few recognize Lady Gaga for her stunning business acumen – which has given her legions of loyal fans worldwide. Fans that are eager to buy her music, her concert tickets, and any and all products related to her. She’s not only created a brand, but is cultivating a fanatical group of consumers that that will follow her for the next two decades of her career and beyond.\r\n\r\nIn Monster Loyalty: How Lady Gaga Turns Followers into Fanatics, customer loyalty expert and best-selling author, Jackie Huba, argues that Lady Gaga didn’t become the success she is today based solely on her talent. She did so by engendering immense loyalty from her fans – not just through her music – but through the message she inspires and the community she has built around that message. To anyone in the business community, this sounds like a classic case of loyalty marketing and customer cultivation – and it is.\r\n\r\nIn four short years, Lady Gaga has built an army of passionate fans that numbers in the tens of millions around the globe. Here, Huba explores how she did it, uncovering seven loyalty lessons and providing a playbook for building this kind of loyalty in any organization:\r\n\r\nFocus on Your One Percenters – Gaga spends most of her effort on just 1% of her audience, the highly- engaged superfans who drive word of mouth.\r\n\r\nLead with Values – create an emotional connection with customers by showcasing what you believe in\r\n\r\nBuild Community – connect your most loyal customers with each other to strengthen the bond with you\r\n\r\nGive Fans a Name – Gaga calls her fans her “Little Monsters.” A name give customers a way to self-identify as part of the group.\r\n\r\nEmbrace Shared Symbols –shared symbols helps customers bond by creating a collective experience\r\n\r\nMake Them Feel Like Rock Stars – become a fan of your fans and find ways to make them feel special\r\n\r\nGenerate Something to Talk About – make your business “word-of-mouth-worthy” by continually giving your fans reasons to talk about you\r\n\r\nHuba looks at the world through the lens of business and marketing, and believes conventional businesses stand to value tremendously from studying and employing Lady Gaga’s intuitive customer strategies.\r\n\r\nWith examples from businesses such as MINI, Fiskars, and Maker’s Mark, Monster Loyalty offers a complete case study that can be modeled in companies large and small to build, maintain, and expand the core customer base central to their success.
