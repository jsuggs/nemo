The SP1 eliminates the need for carrying a back pack or stuffing skins inside your jacket while skiing or splitboarding in slack, side, \"hike to\", or back country settings. The SP1 is light weight but very strong constructed of 400 Denier Ripstop Nylon and heavy duty UV resistant nylon thread with a tensile strength of 7 lbs. A YKK 2 way heavy duty zipper allows access from either side. The SP1 will easily accommodate any length of skins as well as sizes up to 140mm in width. There might even be room for a sandwhich or an SC1 in there as well. All SP1 materials are made in the USA. The SP1 is constructed in Leadville, Colorado.
