Hold fast is a reminder to sailors to keep a firm grip upon the lines (ropes) they hold, and to ensure they are secure at all times while up in the rigging. Being aboard a ship at sea in gales and lashing rain, a moment’s lapse in concentration could result in a man being swept overboard; in everyday parlance, the phrase is used to encourage us to keep our resolve in times of adversity, and to stay on top of any difficult situation.

In 1944 she also carried Winston Churchill and other dignitaries across the channel during Operation Overlord, code-name for the Battle of Normandy (or D-Day). For this design we’ve chosen a striking image of Churchill in conversation with Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, Chief of the Imperial General Staff and his Prime Minister’s foremost military advisor, on board HMS Kelvin. Brooke played an important but not always well-known role in the allies’ victory in 1944.
