Percussion, Horn\r\nTrack 8: Piano\r\nAll Members:\r\nTrack 6: Hand claps and finger snaps\r\n\r\nFrom the very onset of this recording, I knew we were in for a treat.  Fred made us all feel totally at ease, relaxed, and welcome in his studio.  Most of the takes were firsts and seconds, because Fred believed in the spontaneity and discovery of just playing a song instead of learning it completely.  What really made it fun was the random noises Fred came up with, such as foot stomps and ring-knocks. The album is fresh and lively, with many, many different takes, interpretations, and feelings.  After a two day record-fest, we left the Briarpatch with quite a feeling of accomplishment.  I think I can speak for everyone involved by saying that you will really enjoy this album.","options":[{"id":1623650,"name":"Black Swamp Territory","price":10.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/3318223/-/BlackSwampTerritoryFront.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/3318223/-/BlackSwampTerritoryFront.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":20360,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]}]
