This is a massive album, huge walls of speaker shredding noise that soothe the inner beast, blissed out darkness, a desolate, frozen tundra that hasn’t seen snowfall in months, white noise that turns in on itself, unnerving high end with bleak industrial feedback, hints of Sujo’s metalgaze balanced out with Sun Hammer’s bleak subtleties, these guys work incredibly well together, pushing for sounds neither have done on their own, coming up with something that’s a shining star in both of their catalogues.” - <i>Anti-Gravity Bunny</i>\r\n\r\n“On the surface, this is static, both literal and figurative; at its core there is a slow dynamic at work. The disc builds to a frenzied tangle of sound, then works its way back out–but never entirely. The title track is a great example–the sudden release from the sound-beating you’re taking comes with the growing understanding that it’s about to start again. Is it enjoyable? Hell, no. And it’s not supposed to be. It’s a matter of gritting your teeth and enduring.” - <i>Hypnagogue</i>\r\n\r\n“With the name as an obvious initial example, 'Fistula' propels the listener back into that early era of noise music as a deliberate disturbance to one's immediate listening environment and a vehicle for appreciating all sounds, be they environmental or (more often than not) starkly mechanical in nature. The sounds present on 'Fistula' serve only to invite equal measures of environmental appreciation and outright dread, with the release as a whole being perfectly suited to a solo venture through a Chernobyl warehouse; attempting (and sometimes failing) to stifle rising nerves.” – <i>futuresequence</i>\r\n\r\n“Fistula isn’t noise for noise’s sake; it’s savagery on a leash.  The key to the album’s allure is the balance between the virus and the antidote, the distortion and the tune.” – <i>A Closer Listen</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Tracklist:</i>\r\n1. OSD (3:44)\r\n2.

The man behind both, Zen Zsigo, was kind enough to allow us to reissue \"Hushed Bloom\" on CD, and even provided us with an exclusive track.\r\n\r\n\"To say it blatantly, Hushed Bloom, Life in the Dark's most recent output, is about death. Not some violent, explosive death, but something more quiet and passing, like a candle that slowly, but surely, burns out. These two lengthy tracks (each crossing the 15-minute mark), titled \"Hushed Bloom\" and \"Comadeth,\" feature a much more low-key, highly minimalist side of Life in the Dark that, while hinted at in the past, has fully realized itself on this release. Solely featuring lush, distorted synthesizers, maybe reminiscent of Scott Cortez's guitar work with Lovesliescrushing, a drum machine, and Zsigo's own voice, Hushed Bloom is an adventure into the disembodied feeling of dying, like, as stated in the title of the second track, one might feel when in a coma. It is warm, there is no pain, only the distant feeling of leaving.\" <i>- The Inarguable</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Tracklist:</i>\r\n1. Hushed Bloom (15:15)\r\n2. Silent Stream (11:10)*\r\n3.
