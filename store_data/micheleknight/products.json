Her mother was a gifted psychic but highly unstable, unable to control the dark forces her powers unleashed or to look after Michele. When she was six her beloved father died and the last shreds of normality were gone forever. From then on Michele was at the mercy of sexual predators and her mother&#8217;s violent lovers. Evil surrounded her! But Michele wasn&#8217;t alone. The presence of her twin sister Lucy was constantly at her side, comforting and inspiring her. Lucy had died when the twin girls were babies. But her spirit stayed behind to watch over her little sister. Time and again, when Michele reached her darkest hour, Lucy reached out with a deep sense of love and gently guided her to safety. This is the heartbreaking, but ultimately inspirational story of a little girl, who was beaten, raped, neglected and despised, but rescued from despair by her faith in the power of love.\r\n\r\nMichele will personally sign your copy of the book\r\n","options":[{"id":334487,"name":"Default","price":12.99,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/142275/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/142275/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":77417,"name":"Featured Items","permalink":"featured-items","url":"/category/featured-items"},{"id":76426,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":73347,"name":"e-mailed Psychic Reading","permalink":"e-mailed-psychic-reading","position":2,"price":45.0,"default_price":45.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/e-mailed-psychic-reading","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-02-07T14:27:05.000Z","description":"Michele Knight Psychics also offer an email reading which answers three main questions with a general overview of your life path including your unique strengths and challenges you need to transform.
