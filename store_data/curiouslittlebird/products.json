He's just arrived from the wooded areas of northern Quebec, and he's found civilization, and I think he likes it. With a name like Geoffrey, you'd think he was born here. His mom was part city Yeti, part wooded Yeti, and he never knew his dad.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey measures 10.5 inches tall, and 11 inches wide. He's made out of soft, white faux fur, and brown felt horns. His face was hand embroidered.\r\n\r\n<b>**If you would like to customize his horn colour, please choose a colour from the options below. If you don't see a colour you want, please<a href=\"http://www.curiouslittlebird.ca/contact\"> contact me </a>to see if the colour you want is available. ** </b>\r\n\r\n<font color=\"red\"> If you would like to customize Geoffrey's face and hand colour, please<a href=\"http://www.curiouslittlebird.ca/contact\"> contact me </a>with the felt colour(s). Thank you for your understanding! </font>\r\n\r\nIf Geoffrey should get dirty, just spot wash him with warm water and a bit of soap and let air dry, or else you could wash him in the machine on warm (never hot), and tumble dry warm (not hot). He doesn't mind a little bath. A comb will straighten out his fur right away. If his horns straighten out a bit, just curl them with your hand.\r\n\r\nThis monster will ship within 3 days of being ordered.

Having trouble finding that special gift? Well, this custom furry monster tote bag is bound to brighten any dull shopping chores, and make the perfect gift! One can keep it in their handbag for those unexpected shopping ventures/library visits, or it could make a fun bag to carry work lunch in. Each monster you get on your bag will be the actual size of the plush toys I sell. Furry monsters are 7x9\". The creature you choose is then sewn to the canvas bag giving you a monster you can carry around with you! \r\n\r\nIt is machine washable in cool water, and on a delicate cycle, or better for the environment and for the bag, hand wash in warm water. It can be dried in the dryer, on permanent press (the cooler the air, the longer your fur will stay true and not melt - hot air will just melt the fur). This will keep it in tip top condition for longer. If after a washing the fur is a little messy, just comb it out, and you're good to go!\r\n\r\nThis monster is appliquéd by machine, and the bag is a medium weight 100% eco-friendly cotton bag. The bag measures 14 inches tall, by 14 inches wide. My logo is ironed on using transfer paper.\r\n\r\nNOTE: If you would prefer a bag that can be carried on your shoulder, please let me know before purchasing this bag. The larger bag is a little larger, and a bit more expensive.\r\n\r\nChoose any monster you would like added to your bag from this link:\r\nhttp://www.curiouslittlebird.ca/products\r\n\r\n<b>When you've arrived to pay in PayPal, under your address it will say NOTE TO SELLER: ADD In note to seller please state which monster you would like, example: \"Silla the monster on my bag, please!\"  (you can provide the link to be extra sure I know which one you mean). </b>\r\n\r\nPlease allow 1 week for the custom bag to be created before it's shipped out! :) Thanks so much!\r\n\r\nFor any questions, please contact me and I will be more than happy to assist you!","options":[{"id":43102857,"name":"Default","price":44.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":14.75,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.5,"amount_with_others":4.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124048569/-/custom-monster-tote-bag.gif","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124048569/-/custom-monster-tote-bag.gif","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124047141/-/IMG_5584-sm.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124047141/-/IMG_5584-sm.jpg","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124047162/-/custom_plush_toy_-_unique_gift_idea_tote_bag_closeup.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124047162/-/custom_plush_toy_-_unique_gift_idea_tote_bag_closeup.jpg","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124047120/-/bag___monster-description.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124047120/-/bag___monster-description.jpg","width":700,"height":700}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2784249,"name":"Monsters","permalink":"monsters","url":"/category/monsters"}]},{"id":6450639,"name":"Cell Phone Sleeve: Monster face iPhone / iPod cell phone case","permalink":"monster-cell-phone-sleeve","position":65,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/monster-cell-phone-sleeve","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-06-14T20:05:41.000Z","description":"Now's your chance to own a one of a kind Curious Little Bird cell phone sleeve!

I can do a stuffed toy from a drawing!\r\n\r\n**The sketch and monster in the photo are just examples of previous custom plush toys I did for a few customers. :-)\r\n\r\nProcedure: Email me a detailed sketch of the monster with any colour choices you would like and where. From that I will pick something from my fabric collection. Remember, color and fabric print will depend on the good stuff in my \"stash\". :) I use new and recycled fabrics from thrift store finds if I can, but I'll buy your fabric from the fabric store if I don't have it and can't find it.\r\n\r\n[b]**The reason there are no fabric photos is because my stash of fabric is ever changing. Please email me for current availability. Do not assume your monster will be made out of fur. Depending on the colour, I may make it in cotton/polyester, or some other fabric I have on hand. If you do insist on fur, please mention it beforehand![/b]\r\n\r\nEyes will be made with felt, or if available, plastic safety eyes. It's up to you.\r\n\r\nWith your purchase I'll send you a quick list of questions (if I have any), to help you create your one of a kind plush monster just the way you like it!\r\n\r\nThe final monster will be about 10 inches tall and width depends on your sketch (due to the size of my packaging, I cannot go any bigger than 10 inches). They're all machine stitched and stuffed with new polyester fiberfill.\r\n\r\nTurnaround time is about one week from order to shipping, but it may take longer if I have to hunt down a fabric color.
