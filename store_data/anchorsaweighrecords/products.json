The latter on the other hand, includes undergoing numerous lineup changes and on a greater scale, a tragedy in the death of a band member.\r\n\r\nIn November 2008 Break Even experienced the unthinkable, when their guitarist Rowan Willoughby took his own life. Rowans untimely death took a toll not only on the members of the band, but with everyone in the hardcore community, leaving a giant question mark over the future of the band.\r\n\r\nAfter some time the 4 remaining members returned to the rehearsal studio to see if they could go on with what they’d come to know as Break Even. Out of this process came their debut album, <b>The Bright Side</b>.\r\n\r\nAptly named, it's a story of birth and death and everything in between. Recorded in March at Reading Room Studios in Perth, it is an honest and passionate statement that was written to remember, to inspire and to never forget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://myspace.com/breakevenhc\"target=\"_blank\">click here </a> to listen to Break Even \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwax details : \r\nfirst press (SOLD OUT)\r\n-<b>200</b> copies green/black splatter\r\n-<b>300 </b>copies blue/black a haze (a side b side)\r\n\r\nsecond press\r\n-<b>200 transparent ultra clear </b>\r\n-<b>300 half and half transparent eletric blue solid baby blue splatter </b>\r\n\r\nall the orders will be shipped in a proper vinyl box to protect them from any kind of postal damage !\r\n","options":[{"id":5600331,"name":"green/black splatter","price":12.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":5600461,"name":"blue/black haze a side b side","price":12.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":11055285,"name":"transparent ultra clear","price":12.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":11055287,"name":"half and half transparent eletric blue solid baby blue splatter ","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":34,"name":"Singapore","code":"SG"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":3.0},{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/101570632/-/breakevensoldout.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/101570632/-/breakevensoldout.jpg","width":556,"height":379},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/42123039/-/the_bright_half.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/42123039/-/the_bright_half.jpg","width":556,"height":398},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/14397361/-/lp_cover_code_seven.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/14397361/-/lp_cover_code_seven.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[{"id":26741,"name":"BREAK EVEN","permalink":"break-even","url":"/artist/break-even"}],"categories":[{"id":44772,"name":"Music","permalink":"music","url":"/category/music"}]},{"id":7496755,"name":"CREATIVE ADULT \"Dead Air\" 7 inch ","permalink":"creative-adult-dead-air-7-inch-pre-order-ltd-300","position":18,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/creative-adult-dead-air-7-inch-pre-order-ltd-300","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-09T20:31:06.000Z","description":"Catalog n : AA024\r\n\r\nScott Philips' new project, along with members of All Teeth and Sirs, is set to explode.

Physically, but most of all musically. There’s still so much angst pumping in the veins of these 8 tracks, but the four swedish managed to create a more mature sound. The voice still pours emotionally driven anger, guitars develope distorted killer riffs and the rhythm section never sounded so sick, but somehow they created a more cerebral yet passionate songwriting. The result is “Samaritans”, 8 tracks of pure dark mid-tempo hardcore sickness in the vein of Cursed , well crafted, passionate and with a killer production.\r\nGrieved are ready to exit their obscure world and make a name for theirselves.  - <i>Michael Simeon</i>\r\n\r\nATTENTION : THIS IS A PRE-ORDER.

Written last year during some rare downtime, Endless Roads was recorded in early 2010 at Wild Arctic studios in New York by producer Dean Baltulonis (Sick Of It All, American Nightmare).

Hailing from Belgium, this four headed monster set out to leave nothing but ashes & dust. Their debut full-length \"Along The Acheron\" is a bastard of full speed aggression lurking in the gloom to prepare for the final blow.\r\n\r\nRecorded and mixed by Ben Phillips ( November Coming Fire, Bossk, Gold kids.. ) and mastered by Magnus Lindberg ( Cult Of Luna, In Flames ) <b>Along The Acheron</b> turned out to be also an uncompromising and pitch black piece of dark thoughts. It will tear down all false hope the world is feeding on. With their raw and pissed off sound they wrecked several stages all over Europe. With 2 years of existence Daggers is a relative young band, yet they know what they are aiming for. Each show more souls gather at these intense live performances and Daggers have already proven to be one of the most promising Belgian hardcore bands of the moment.\r\n\r\ntracks list : \r\n\r\n#  1
