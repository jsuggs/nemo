He gained a BFA in painting from Ilam School of Arts and then lived for a while in America and Britain before returning to New Zealand and settling in Motueka, a small rural town where he does freelance illustrations and works on his art. He has contributed comics to many local and international anthologies, including Kramer's Ergot (USA), Study Group 12 (USA), Pure Evil (Australia) and Comix 2000 (France). His comic Love Stories won the New Zealand Comics Eric Award for Best Comic in 2010.\r\n\r\nReviews of Love Stories\r\n \r\nFile Under Other: \"Love Stories contains five short stories. The themes and storytelling techniques vary but the drawing is very strong and consistent throughout. Tait's style is eloquent and efficient but there is also an edginess to the drawing. It may just be the tight shading lines or the boldness of the inks but Tait's characters exist in a world that seems to want to crush or slice them apart in any given panel. Both the writing and the drawing point to the fragility of life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh-Low Sequart Review: \"This is a visually striking collection told in stark and boldly outlined black & white, giving his pages a certain weight while not sacrificing the fluidity of the narrative. Tait's local and Maori stories like \"Graveyard Etiquette\" (comparing a Maori creation myth to the simultaneous gratitude and resentment children feel toward their parents) and \"The Heading Dog Who Split In Half\" (about a legendary sheepdog) are crisply told and a delight to look at. \"","options":[{"id":44501031,"name":"Default","price":6.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125043654/-/Love_Stories_reprint-1.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125043654/-/Love_Stories_reprint-1.jpg","width":1000,"height":1579},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125043681/-/Love_Stories_reprint-7.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125043681/-/Love_Stories_reprint-7.jpg","width":2064,"height":3168},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125043702/-/Love_Stories_reprint-29.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125043702/-/Love_Stories_reprint-29.jpg","width":1000,"height":1531}],"artists":[{"id":236817,"name":"Mat Tait","permalink":"mat-tait","url":"/artist/mat-tait"}],"categories":[{"id":3253469,"name":"Comics","permalink":"comics","url":"/category/comics"}]},{"id":13856313,"name":"Deep Park","permalink":"deep-park","position":2,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/deep-park","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-09-29T07:48:16.000Z","description":"Deep Park\r\n\r\n'The beloved amusement park with it all: carousels, drop rides, a hallucinogenic water slide,an orgasm inducing roller coaster and the cult that worships it. Join a colourful cast of characters wasting a day in the sun, exploring the thrills, and terrors, Deep Park has to offer.'\r\n \r\n\r\nDeep Park is a brand new Australian graphic novel from a fresh young voice, here making his book length debut. An equal parts amusing and uncomfortable exploration of repercussions and human failings, the story of Deep Park is presented as seemingly separated vignettes; we follow characters for two or four pages before moving on to another scenario. Only as the book progresses is it revealed how interconnected and co-dependant these stories are, all leading towards a climactic clash between a crazed, genocidal Disney-like figure and a roller coaster worshipping cult of desperation! The fun never stops at Deep Park.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAbout David\r\n\r\nDavid C Mahler was born in Vancouver, Canada, and after a few formative years in Belgium moved to Melbourne at age ten. Raised on a diet of Calvin and Hobbes, Tintin, Archie and Astroboy, drawing was second nature from childhood. He released his first self published mini-comic at age nine.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAfter years of experimenting and developing in the Melbourne small press scene, his quarterly short story comic collection Coracle debuted at the 2013 Melbourne zine fair.

This edition has all the story contents of the original, though with a different story order, the covers and centerfold printed in black and white and the splash page to \"Right to Kill!\" restored to Ditko's original intent.\r\n\r\nRex Graine is a newspaper reporter for the Daily Crusader. He is known for his uncompromising principles and incorruptibility. In order to fight crime, Graine wears metal gloves and a steel mask that resembles a placid face, thus becoming Mr. A. In keeping with the hardboiled detective theme, both personae typically wear suits and fedora hats; Mr. A's outfit is completely white. There is no origin story for the character, thus the only discernible reason why Graine sometimes disguises himself (both his identities are equally threatened by criminals and sometimes hated by the general public) is due to his choice to become a vigilante. Mr. A uses half white-half black calling cards to signify his arrival, as well as to represent his belief that there can only be good and evil, and no moral grey area.\r\n\r\nby Steve Ditko\r\n\r\nPublished by Robin Snyder/Steve Ditko 2010\r\n\r\nFormat: Oversize American Comic Size, 36 pages, glossy cover, bond interior pages, saddle stitch.","options":[{"id":34151655,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/106887477/-/mr_a.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/106887477/-/mr_a.jpg","width":500,"height":650}],"artists":[{"id":143955,"name":"Steve Ditko","permalink":"steve-ditko","url":"/artist/steve-ditko"}],"categories":[{"id":3253469,"name":"Comics","permalink":"comics","url":"/category/comics"}]},{"id":7092468,"name":"For The Term Of His Natural Life","permalink":"for-the-term-of-his-natural-life","position":17,"price":20.0,"default_price":20.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/for-the-term-of-his-natural-life","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-29T08:15:50.000Z","description":"For The Term Of His Natural Life by Peter Foster\r\n\r\nPeter Foster's adaption of Marcus Clarke's classic Australian novel For The Term of His Natural Life.
