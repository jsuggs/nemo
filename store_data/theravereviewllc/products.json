The Minimax SP3 is like having two lights in one since you can save two different complete glovesets at the same time. Save one set to be your favorite set and play around with the second set as many times as you want. Now you can custom make your own multi color and multi modes mix from a list of 20 great colors plus a blank color. Features that will give glovers the ability to make a chip do what they want with all new customizable modes . Now the SP3 chip allows you to save the modes so no more starting over! Just go in and change the colors on any saved mode without having to reprogram any of the other saved modes! This will save a lot of programming time. This is a very simple light to use! Now you can make any colors for each mode or any effect on each mode. Make effects like the stutter strobe, hyper strobe, 1-2 strobe, 2 color strobe, Stribbon all from only 9 easy to program modes!\r\n SP3 REV VIDEO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo Program:\r\n1. While light is off, hold button down and the light will flash RED to BLUE. Each color represents a different glove set to program.\r\n2. Let go of the button when you see which set you want to program. (RED or BLUE)\r\n3. Once in RED or BLUE set, click through all the modes to find the solid RED mode. This is the reset mode. When you first get your SP3 you need to reset both the RED and BLUE glove sets. To reset just hold button down on the RED mode. Light will reset and now you are ready to program modes.\r\nThe reset can be used at any time to restart over and make new modes. Please see below for more reset information.\r\n4. Click through the 9 programmable modes to find a mode you want to program. (Click slowly or you may double click by mistake and the light will jump out of program section.)\r\n5. Once you find a mode, hold the button down and the light will now allow you to choose the colors you want for that mode.\r\n6. Click through the colors to find a color then hold to save that color. The light will now turn RED to allow you to save the next color. Repeat this until all colors are chosen for that mode. You can stop programming colors at any time just by double clicking when on the RED color. So if you want just BG ,program Blue then Green. After saving Green the light goes back to RED so double click and you are done. The light will flash BGBGBGBG!\r\n7. After you have programmed the colors for a mode the light will go back into mode selection to allow you to choose another mode or to allow you to stop programming and jump out of programing.\r\n6. To jump out of programming and save your modes you simply double click. (only in program selection will this work,not color selection)\r\n7. Each glove or color set , RED or BLUE, allows 1-4 modes to be saved. After the 4th mode is saved the light will jump out of programing automatically.\r\n8. During normal on usage you shut off the light by holding the button down for 1.5 seconds.\r\n9. If you are programming and make a mistake you can just double click. All the modes you had saved are still saved so you can fix the mode you were trying to program.\r\n\r\n\r\nMode1 -STROBE ( allows 1-6 color choices)(New larger colors bands!)\r\nMode2 -HYPER STROBE (allows 1-6 color choices)\r\nMode3 -DOP TRACER (allows 1-6color choices, 1 background 5 dop colors) (Remove the background and make cool dop strobes)\r\nMode4 -HYPER TRIBBON (allows 1-6 colors choices)\r\nMode5 -HYPER FLASH (allows 1-6 colors)\r\nMode6 -QUICK FLASH (allows 1-6 colors)(same flash as Inova)\r\nMode7 -EXTENDED STUTTER STROBE ( allows 1-6 colors) (each color stutters 5 times)\r\nMode8 -RAINBOW MODE ( no color selection)\r\nMode9 -HYPER STUTTER STROBE ( allows 1-6 colors)(each color stutters 3 times)\r\nMode10 -RESET (Solid RED color) When you first get your SP3, you need to reset both the RED and BLUE glove sets.\r\n- After resetting for the first time, the reset will always erase the current glove set you are in so you can start over.\r\n- The reset has a built in safety feature so if you accidentally hit reset you can just quickly double click to jump out of the gloveset\r\n  and all the old saved modes are still saved. The light will not actually reset until you save a new mode.\r\n- After programming your sets, which ever set you were last in will be the gloveset used during ON normal usage. To switch the ON normal usage set, while light is off hold button down just the same as when you want to program. Let go on the set you want\r\nto be the ON usage set. Double click and this will be the new ON default set.","options":[{"id":46349373,"name":"REV2","price":58.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49574235,"name":"REV","price":58.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126260001/-/Minimax_glove_lights__57202.1357954116.1280.1280.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126260001/-/Minimax_glove_lights__57202.1357954116.1280.1280.JPG","width":960,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126260004/-/Minimax_rave_glove_light__74839.1357954116.1280.1280.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126260004/-/Minimax_rave_glove_light__74839.1357954116.1280.1280.jpg","width":960,"height":640},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126260007/-/minimax.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126260007/-/minimax.jpg","width":960,"height":640}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6483096,"name":"glove sets","permalink":"glove-sets","url":"/category/glove-sets"}]},{"id":14329047,"name":"EL Wire Glasses Aviator Style ","permalink":"el-wire-glasses-aviator-style","position":4,"price":29.95,"default_price":29.95,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/el-wire-glasses-aviator-style","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-10-22T02:39:25.000Z","description":"Does your outfit need that extra kick for the night time?
