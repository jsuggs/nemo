The second edition comes in a gatefold double CD sleeve, with poster insert featuring artwork by Alexander Tucker.\r\n\r\nFront & Follow present a collaboration with the UK’s foremost uncanny audiovisual event, The Outer Church. Chief programmer Joseph Stannard has compiled a stunning 28-track double album of all-new previously unreleased material from a host of incredible conspirators.\r\n\r\nThe artists list in full: \r\n\r\nEmbla Quickbeam / Grumbling Fur / Some Truths / Kemper Norton / Pye Corner Audio / Black Mountain Transmitter / Angkorwat / Position Normal / Ekoplekz / BrokenThree / Anna Meredith / Hong Kong In The 60s / Baron Mordant & Mr Maxted / Graham Reznick / Old Apparatus / VHS Head / The Wyrding Module / Silver Pyre / These Feathers Have Plumes / Hacker Farm / Robin The Fog / Vindicatrix / Wrong Signals / Sone Institute / Tidal / Paper Dollhouse / Time Attendant / IX Tab.\r\n\r\nJoseph writes:\r\n\r\n“Wind the tape all the way back to Brighton in 2009. The uncanny influence seeping into contemporary music from ‘elsewhere’ had become impossible to ignore. Magazine pieces I had written in my capacity as a music critic were revealed to contain subliminal memos for my own attention. Unusually vivid dreams and unsettling anonymous telephone calls imparted curious instructions. I was to establish a space in which various forms of unheimlich audio would converge with moving images of a similarly anomalous nature. Equipped only with a well-thumbed copy of The Beginner’s Guide To Psychic Architecture, I resolved to build a Church.\r\n\r\n“This compilation presents a selection of the artists who have performed at The Outer Church, with the exception of illustrious filmmaker and composer Graham Reznick, who lives in faraway Brooklyn and kindly permitted us to screen his tremendous psychedelic campfire tale, I Can See You, in Brighton and Dublin. All of the recordings here are previously unreleased. Together they advance the argument that something weird is stirring in modern music which resists categorisation, manifesting itself in unsettling cadences and temporal distortions across a wide variety of occult strategies.”\r\n\r\nThe Outer Church was established in 2009 by music writer Joseph Stannard (The Wire, Mojo, The Quietus). Since then it has brought the finest in uncanny film and music to Brighton, including live sets from Demdike Stare, Raime, Pye Corner Audio, Old Apparatus, Moon Wiring Club and The Haxan Cloak plus screenings of new independent films such as I Can See You, Die Farbe and Overhill.","options":[{"id":37029393,"name":"Default","price":13.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124610721/-/IMG_5481_square.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124610721/-/IMG_5481_square.jpg","width":2448,"height":2448},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124610529/-/IMG_5480.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124610529/-/IMG_5480.JPG","width":3264,"height":2448},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124610577/-/IMG_5482.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124610577/-/IMG_5482.JPG","width":3264,"height":2448}],"artists":[{"id":209835,"name":"The Outer Church","permalink":"the-outer-church","url":"/artist/the-outer-church"}],"categories":[{"id":1039411,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":10374931,"name":"Collision/Detection - 1st Edition Box Set + bonus download","permalink":"collision-detection-1st-edition-box-set-bonus-download","position":5,"price":16.0,"default_price":16.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/collision-detection-1st-edition-box-set-bonus-download","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-04-05T23:04:41.000Z","description":"**OUT NOW!**\r\n\r\n2xCD Box Set - Limited 1st Edition in letter press package.\r\n\r\nCollision/Detection is the second experimental audio project from Long Division with Remainders (LDWR) which sees invited artists submit audio clips into a central pot, which is then distributed around the group for them to do with as they see fit, resulting in a series of digital EPs released across 2012 and 2013. \r\n\r\nThese EPs are now collected together for this 2 CD box set, presented in a bespoke package, letter pressed by Red Plate Press (www.redplatepress.tumblr.com) with artwork from Paul Loudon (www.paulloudon.com). \r\n\r\nThe limited first edition also includes a bonus digital album containing new tracks by Collision/Detection contributors and the original sound clips which started the series (if you order from our shop, we will email a download code to you).\r\n\r\nEPs come from Psychological Strategy Board (Jonny Mugwump and Time Attendant), West Norwood Cassette Library, The Lord, Hong Kong in the 60s, BLK TAG, Kemper Norton, The Doomed Bird of Providence, Isnaj Dui and Sone Institute.\r\n\r\nDigital downloads of all the EPs are available from all the usual places (Boomkat, iTunes, Amazon etc).

Limited edition of 50.\r\n\r\nFront & Follow presents the new single from The Doomed Bird of Providence, featuring two brand new tracks.\r\n\r\nThe Bell of the Jardines tells the strange and ill-fated tale of Frank Jardine who took his brother and his wife, a Samoan princess he had abducted, 1000 miles across rough terrain to Somerset in North East Australia. His plan was to develop Somerset into a port and to this end he used an old ship's bell to attract ships travelling down the coast, but all his ambitions were thwarted by leprosy, which killed him and his wife.\r\n\r\nThe Death Flurry is a live favourite bringing a full blooded performance from singer Mark Kluzek and now recorded for the first time. Its inspiration lies in a song by Scottish-Australian singer Harry Robertson and the painting The Death Flurry by Oswald W. Brierly. The song, a slow but visceral arrangement with a single solemn hand drum running through, invokes the terror of the early whaling exploits of Norfolk Islanders who set out to risk a watery grave for the prize of 'the king of the sea'.\r\n\r\nDigital download available from iTunes, amazon, eMusic, Boomkat etc.","options":[{"id":16278359,"name":"Default","price":3.5,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":1.5,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":1.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50087995/-/F_F015-2_small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50087995/-/F_F015-2_small.jpg","width":519,"height":519},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50088011/-/F_F015-3_small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50088011/-/F_F015-3_small.jpg","width":648,"height":648},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/50088027/-/F_F015-9_small.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/50088027/-/F_F015-9_small.jpg","width":600,"height":600}],"artists":[{"id":29391,"name":"The Doomed Bird of Providence","permalink":"the-doomed-bird-of-providence","url":"/artist/the-doomed-bird-of-providence"}],"categories":[{"id":1039411,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":4291289,"name":"BLK w/BEAR / Yonokiero combo","permalink":"blk-w-bear-yonokiero-combo","position":9,"price":10.0,"default_price":10.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/blk-w-bear-yonokiero-combo","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2011-08-20T12:36:06.000Z","description":"BLK w/BEAR - Sorry about your (remixes) & Yonokiero - Blue Apples.\r\n\r\nBLK w/BEAR's latest release features 4 remixes of Yonokiero's Blue Apples.\r\n\r\nBlue Apples is the debut album from Nottingham duo Yonokiero, originally released in 2009.\r\n\r\nBuy both together in v. limited edition packaging for only a tenner.
