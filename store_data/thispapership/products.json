For a sailing ship powered completely by wind, storms make for rough going, but at least they’re still moving; complete calm leaves the boat floating dead as driftwood. This is the historical nautical term “the doldrums,” which eventually came to describe a state of inactivity, stagnation, and listlessness.\r\n\r\nWe love sailing metaphors not only because they’re cool and are integral to our brand, but also because they’re remarkably appropriate for the life of the freelancer. In this case: no matter how accurate your charted course, no matter how keenly you watch the skies, sometimes you still get to that place where the winds die down.\r\n\r\nFine art print: choice of 8 x 10\" or 11 x 14\"\r\n\r\n- Giclee printing with archival inks \r\n- 100% recycled cover paper, creamy off white with natural specks \r\n- Made by hand with love in Saxapahaw, North Carolina\r\n\r\nWe ship international and offer wholesale!
