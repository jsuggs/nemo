While his body remains hidden behind imagery, the imagery itself is surmised from his emotions and imagination. Hence, Gloomy is hidden behind his own revelations. Something I think many can relate to.","options":[{"id":15304229,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":8.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/45779003/-/Smalley_Wizard__Cloak__700.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/45779003/-/Smalley_Wizard__Cloak__700.jpg","width":700,"height":963}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2533517,"name":"Posters","permalink":"posters","url":"/category/posters"}]}]
