An anthology of intimate moments that give you a peek into the mysteries of life and the beauty in them. &hearts;\"\r\n- <i>Johnathan Nguyen</i>\r\n\r\n\"...Pleiades [is] a breathtaking, encouraging satisfaction that not many things I have read, and believe me I have read many, can display in words the fragility of a girl’s heart that is hidden by the strength of her beliefs and actions as Pleiades does.\"\r\n- <i>Kathy Fan</i> (<a href=\"http://aurelae.net/takki/?p=244\" target=\"_blank\">click here for full review</a>)\r\n\r\n\"Pleiades leads its readers into the spaces that one rarely sees in literature and in life. Through the use of carefully worded prose and prose-poetry Sui Solitaire clears a pathway to the quiet occurrences that exist in the spaces between actions.\r\n\r\n[..]Pleiades‘ tales range from humorous to heartbreaking with a narration that is refreshingly introspective and sincere. More than anything else, Solitaire’s wit and passionate nature are scrawled across the pages of this work and the combination of the author’s imagination, diction and obvious love for her readers make Pleiades into a success with which one finds immediate rapport.\"\r\n- <i>Veronica Glover</i>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<b>Only one printing of this book will ever be available-- so get it while it's still around!</b>\r\n\r\nLeaves on an exciting journey to your home in 2-3 business days!\r\n\r\n<b>Thank you for your support :)</b>","options":[{"id":9447371,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.99,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":7,"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}},{"amount_alone":3.99,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":14.99,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/25845434/-/IMG_2262__1024x768_.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/25845434/-/IMG_2262__1024x768_.JPG","width":1000,"height":667}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1570090,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]},{"id":1823351,"name":"LIMITED EDITION \"face off\" Print","permalink":"limited-edition-face-off-print","position":3,"price":50.0,"default_price":50.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/limited-edition-face-off-print","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2010-03-04T04:53:24.000Z","description":"Only one photograph will be available at any given time, and only an extremely limited number of prints of each photograph will ever be released publicly, so buy one while they’re still around! &hearts;\r\n\r\nThank you for your interest and support :)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<b>Only 10 prints of this photo will EVER be available to the public, so get this limited edition print now!</b>\r\n\r\n16x20 matte print.\r\n\r\nIf you are buying <b>internationally</b>, please email me at <i>hello(at)iurisandthesea.com</i> so we can work out the shipping.\r\n\r\nCurrently only 7 of 10 available.\r\n\r\n<i>5% of all proceeds go to <a href=\"http://www.ctf.org/\">Children's Tumor Foundation</a>.</i>","options":[{"id":6625381,"name":"Default","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/17448841/-/4172734059_40c9e2bf19_b.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/17448841/-/4172734059_40c9e2bf19_b.jpg","width":1000,"height":667}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":816401,"name":"Prints","permalink":"prints","url":"/category/prints"}]}]
