No point in having shoes just to look at is there :( So, upside is, one of you lucky people get to have and adore them! Perfect present for Christmas!\nThey&#8217;re marked a <span class=\"caps\">US 7</span> which I believe is a <span class=\"caps\">UK4</span>. They are a beautiful pair of black and white patent shoes with a slight platform. There&#8217;s a slight peep-toe and the heel (from the back of the shoe) measures 4&#8221;.\nThey will be posted in a <span class=\"caps\">TUK</span> box and wrapped in tissue paper inside.\n\n\t<strong>The black is patent not matte</strong>\n\n","options":[{"id":297443,"name":"Black & White","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":4.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":6.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123452/-/300.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/123452/-/300.jpg","width":300,"height":300}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":67426,"name":"Shoes","permalink":"shoes","url":"/category/shoes"}]}]
