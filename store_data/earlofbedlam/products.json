We aim to dress men who can handle a second glance, who dress with the intent of being noticed: elegance with edge for society's outlaws.\r\n\r\nBedlam's design studio is a gallery hung askew with sidelined pioneers, urban radicals, street urchins and wandering hobo misfits - these are all bees that pollinate Bedlam’s invention. Mods are part of that crew, and definitely a touch OCD with all that chrome to polish and badges to collect, and of course Earl of Bedlam excels at eccentric accents and fastidious finish. \r\n\r\nThis is a blue tonic mohair suit with pure silk golden lining - what Ace Face / Sting from Quadrophenia would have worn when he got a bit older and richer. The \"South Coast Special\" is cut from the mod's two-tone cloth of choice. According to which angle the searchlight hits, it's more blue or black - like  the Brighton sea as the sun goes down, or a proper shiner. The lining is pure silk crepe in a golden yellow for the bump of adrenalin when the fight's on. And the buttons are two-tone shell with a natural warp - same as a vinyl record left in the sun (photos below). It's a three button single breasted fitted gang leader with a five button working cuff. The trousers are exposed button fly with Earl of Bedlam's trademark deep waistband (ladies and matadors have known this a long time - it holds tummy, should one have a little surplus, in), cut loser round the thigh, narrowing to ruche at the ankle. \r\nMade for a reception on October 1st, 2012 to mark the close of the current Lord Mayor of London's year of office in which he championed the Campaign for Wool.

Traditionally used to make military and clerical coats and capes since the Middle Ages. 100% British wool with scarlet piping, acetate lining in whatever colour you care to choose (£800 made to measure). Looks as great on a gal as a gent.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the phrase \"Thin Red Line\" was the Crimean War – specifically, a military action by the red-coated Sutherland Highlanders 93rd Regiment at the Battle of Balaclava on 25 October 1854. Aided by a small force of Royal Marines and some Turkish infantrymen, and led by Sir Colin Campbell, the regiment routed a Russian cavalry charge against all odds. \r\n\r\nThe 93rd's survival was due to the caution of the Russian commander, who believed that such a small infantry force could not hope to withstand a full cavalry charge and so figured it had to be some kind of decoy or trap. Accordingly he ordered his men to disengage. The British press, of course, spun the story to raise morale amongst the public who regarded the war as an unpopular shambles. The Times correspondent, William H. Russell, wrote that he could see nothing between the charging Russians and the British regiment's base of operations but the \"thin red streak tipped with a line of steel\". The phrase has since come to represent calm British courage... as immortalized in Carry On... Up the Khyber when Private Jimmy Widdle paints a thin red line across the ground, declaring, \"They'll never get past this!\"\r\n","options":[{"id":19183299,"name":"Sample size","price":800.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19183301,"name":"Made to Measure","price":800.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":25.0,"amount_with_others":35.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":45.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58868723/-/IMG_8377.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58868723/-/IMG_8377.jpg","width":300,"height":400},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110689629/-/Janey_Jane_in_Thin_Red_Line.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110689629/-/Janey_Jane_in_Thin_Red_Line.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/110690148/-/James_Tod_in_Thin_Red_Line.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/110690148/-/James_Tod_in_Thin_Red_Line.jpg","width":750,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3545151,"name":"Jackets","permalink":"jackets","url":"/category/jackets"}]},{"id":6898759,"name":"The \"Errol Flynn\" two-piece belt-tie suit","permalink":"errol-flynn-two-piece-belt-tie-suit","position":17,"price":1800.0,"default_price":1800.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/errol-flynn-two-piece-belt-tie-suit","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-08-07T03:24:04.000Z","description":"This two-piece made from densely woven anti-thorn \"beaters\" fabric will render you immune from snags and problems.

We commissioned portraits from Anna McNeil of some of our favourite characters, people who find / found untinctured life a little dull but illuminated it for us. The Keith Richards and Syd Barrett scarves are both officially endorsed and approved.\r\n\r\nClara Bow (1905 – 1965):\r\nThe original \"It\" girl. Born in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn to a psychotic mother and often absent father, she entered a magazine competition to break into movies. At the height of her fame she was receiving 45,000 fan letters a week. The more prurient publications of the day failed to distinguish between her racy flapper girl roles and real personality, their lurid allegations hounding her into retirement in the Mojave Desert. Chronic insomnia had her treated for psychiatric illness and receiving shock treatment which was neither helpful nor healing.\r\n\r\nErrol Flynn ((1909 – 1959): \r\nTasmanian born with a devilish twinkle, an actor known for swashing his buckler in Hollywood films. A paragon of manliness, when the US entered WWII, he was eager to join up. Failed on physical fitness by all the US services - due in no small part to self-medicating chronic back pain with morphine and, later, heroin; lingering chronic tuberculosis; and numerous venereal diseases - he was criticised for \"failing to do his bit\". Unable to counter those accusations and undefended by the studios who preferred to conceal the base state of their box office gold, he took yet deeper solace in drink and drugs and the company of many, many ladies including Delores del Rio and Marlene Dietrich from a groaning buffet of willing womanhood;\r\n\r\nZelda Fitzgerald (1900 - 1948):\r\nA southern belle ballerina who married the writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. As they became celebrities both in the US and Europe, their marriage hissed and fizzed with jealousy and resentment. They both used the relationship as material in their writing, with her \"Save Me the Waltz\" providing the evidence against his version of events, \"Tender is the Night\". While he descended into alcoholism, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He went to Hollywood without her to try his hand at screenwriting and died there in 1940. Eight years later, Zelda, blazing icon of the Jazz Age, perished when the hospital in which she resided caught fire.\r\n\r\nKeith Richards (1943-):\r\nBorn in Dartford, Kent, a founder member of the Rolling Stones. Inspired by a passion for American blues artists he has written fourteen of Rolling Stone (no relation) magazine's \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" and ranks fourth on their list of 100 best guitarists. He has been tried on drug related charges five times, only one of those resulting in a custodial sentence in 1967 which was overturned after The Times of London ran an editorial entitled \"Who breaks a butterfly on a wheel?\" that portrayed him and Mick Jagger's sentences as persecution. He once claimed in an interview to have snorted his father's ashes but this was later retracted as a joke. By people that know, Richards is considered \"a good guy\". He christened his record label \"Mindless\". We are delighted that that his scarf is officially approved and endorsed and is under license to Bravado Merchandising.\r\n\r\nSyd Barrett (1946-2006):\r\nBorn in Cambridge. A founder member of Pink Floyd, his experiments with dissonance and distortion influenced David Bowie, Brian Eno, Jimmy Page and others. His experiments with acid were less successful, taking him on a trip from which he never properly returned. His behaviour became so erratic that eventually, en route to a show, the other band members decided it was less hassle not to pick him up. According to Roger Waters, Barrett came to their last practice session with a new song he called \"Have You Got It Yet?\". It seemed simple enough when presented it to his bandmates, but proved impossible to learn. As they practised it, Barrett kept changing the arrangement. He would then play it again, with arbitrary changes, singing, \"Have you got it yet?\". Roger Waters called it, \"a real act of mad genius\". During the recording of his first solo album, \"The Madcap Laughs\" , in 1968, his manager Peter Jenner said,  \"I had seriously underestimated the difficulties of working with him.\" Syd walked back to Cambridge from London to live with his mother and retreated from public life. He had studied painting at Camberwell College of Arts in London so resumed his painting and took up gardening. In an article published in 2006, Dave Gilmour was quoted as saying: \"In my opinion, his nervous breakdown would have happened anyway. It was a deep-rooted thing. But I'll say the psychedelic experience might well have acted as a catalyst. Still, I just don't think he could deal with the vision of success and all the things that went with it.\" Our friend, textile designer, Wendy King was close to him for many years and declares he was the most talented person at anything that she ever knew.\r\nOur scarf is officially endorsed by the Barrett estate and under licence to Perryscope Productions\r\n\r\nBedlam's in-house artist the prolifically talented Anna McNeil http://annamcneil.wordpress.com/ \r\n\r\nThe digital printing is so fine (thank you Hatley Print) you can see the brush strokes.\r\n\r\nWe are taking orders now.\r\n\r\nHand rolled silk crepe satin crepe 90 x 90 cms are £250 each. \r\n\r\nThe neckerchief size is 60 x 60 cm (big enough not to strangulate yourself when you knot, leaving nicely floofy ends) at £120; \r\n\r\nthe pocket squares measure 35 x 35cm and are £50.","options":[{"id":38329641,"name":"90 x 90 cm Clara","price":250.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":38329644,"name":"60 x 60 cm Clara","price":120.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":38329647,"name":"35 x 35 cm Clara","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":49284666,"name":"90 x 90 cm Errol","price":250.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49284669,"name":"60 x 60 cm Errol","price":120.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":49284672,"name":"35 x 35 cm Errol","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":49284675,"name":"90 x 90 cm Zelda","price":250.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49284678,"name":"60 x 60 cm Zelda","price":120.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":49284681,"name":"35 x 35 cm Zelda","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":49284684,"name":"90 x 90 cm Keef","price":250.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49284699,"name":"60 x 60 cm Keef","price":120.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":49284696,"name":"35 x 35 cm Keef","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":49284693,"name":"90 x 90 cm Syd","price":250.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49284690,"name":"60 x 60 cm Syd","price":120.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":49284687,"name":"35 x 35 cm Syd","price":50.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":6.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":9.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/119263770/-/IMG_3937.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/119263770/-/IMG_3937.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/119263782/-/IMG_3947.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/119263782/-/IMG_3947.jpg","width":750,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/119263446/-/IMG_4083.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/119263446/-/IMG_4083.jpg","width":750,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2140200,"name":"Accessories","permalink":"accessories","url":"/category/accessories"}]},{"id":5996001,"name":"Baby Bedlam Hoodie","permalink":"baby-bedlam-hoodie","position":26,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/baby-bedlam-hoodie","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-22T00:47:52.000Z","description":"It's never too early to get your kid in a South London gang and here's the kit - the super soft fleecy Bedlam hoodie.
