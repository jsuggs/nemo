This is a very eye catching trinket box, which stands on three wooden feet, the chest has a brass opening and has a glossy gold interior to hide away treasures. The Zombie head has tight little knot hair, the overall color is red, but the rubbed on gold ink gives it an aged antique look and also the 'zombie' look to the face (I think). One of my faves, thanks for looking.","options":[{"id":709663,"name":"Default","price":30.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/952204/-/IMG_0437.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/952204/-/IMG_0437.JPG","width":721,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":148730,"name":"One of a kind","permalink":"one-of-a-kind","url":"/category/one-of-a-kind"}]},{"id":155652,"name":"Little Lizard Guy Box","permalink":"little-lizard-guy-box","position":3,"price":21.0,"default_price":21.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/little-lizard-guy-box","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2008-09-22T07:06:43.000Z","description":"He wasn't really planned this way, but he looks like a lizard to me!

The base canvas is painted red, there is a nailed heart, with a star and face mounted on it. The layers of paint and adornment are too numerous to detail, but include a little imp face, a resin teardrop, nails and beads on top, you'll find something new in it each time you look. The face is crafted from polymer clay and has a wise expression, a slightly antique finish contrasts dramatically with the bold and colorful setting.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":709679,"name":"Default","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/952260/-/SuperChunkyCanvas.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/952260/-/SuperChunkyCanvas.JPG","width":689,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
