The unusual pendant features lots of detail including vibrant green enamelled dangling leaves with pink and purple glass stones set into the ornate gold base. \r\n\r\nAt the center of the pendant is a faceted saphiret stone. Due to the gold backing the stone has a slightly yellowish tone but still gives off the pinky blue hues a usual piece of saphiret has. The necklace has been added to a new gold metal chain that has been finished with a secure bolt ring clasp.\r\n\r\n<b>Condition </b>\r\nThe saphiret stone is slightly rough around the edges where is has been fitted into the pendant. There is light wear to parts of the green enamel. Aside from this the pendant is in good condition.\r\n\r\n<b>Measurements</b>\r\nWidth of pendant - 1 inch\r\nHeight of pendant - 1.5 inches\r\nLength of chain - 16 inches\r\n\r\n<img src=http://i.minus.com/i0jCWGSQx9ies.jpg>","options":[{"id":43682994,"name":"Default","price":95.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":0.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124446351/-/saphiret.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124446351/-/saphiret.jpg","width":1447,"height":1448},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124446360/-/saphiret2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124446360/-/saphiret2.jpg","width":1368,"height":1368},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/124446369/-/saphiret3.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/124446369/-/saphiret3.jpg","width":1338,"height":1338}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2855257,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"},{"id":6235695,"name":"Necklaces - Saphiret","permalink":"necklaces-saphiret","url":"/category/necklaces-saphiret"}]},{"id":14932809,"name":"Vintage Art Deco Open Back Amber Glass Floral Panel Paste Necklace","permalink":"vintage-art-deco-open-back-amber-glass-floral-panel-paste-necklace","position":28,"price":42.0,"default_price":42.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/vintage-art-deco-open-back-amber-glass-floral-panel-paste-necklace","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-18T20:49:13.000Z","description":"<b>Description </b>\r\nA beautiful Art Deco necklace featuring open backed amber glass stones.
