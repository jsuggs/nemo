High Life Films would like to show a unique style of mountain riding.  The style is faster, smoother, and more of a snocross approach to riding, bringing ramp and show tricks as well as snocross sled skills into the backcountry and taking backcountry amplitude and style to shows and racing.  It might start at a backyard compound or trail riding in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the mountains of the North West, or the snocross tracks of the Midwest but the feeling of connecting to your sled like it is an extension of ones self it what ultimately drives our sport.  \r\n\r\nShot in the Chugach Mountains of Alaska, Colorado, Montana, and Washington.
