After digging into their catalog I kicked myself for not having listened to them earlier, but sometimes discovering a band after they've already released a sizable amount of work can be pretty wonderful... particularly when life has served you an epic rough patch, as it had that year. I dove headfirst into everything I could find and have been listening ever since. There's a golden quality to Eric Johnson's songs, a feeling of hope around the bend.\r\n\r\nI don't often go asking for more work on purpose, but this time when I saw these anniversary shows were in the works I reached out to the band to ask if I could design another poster for them. I had done one for their European Tour a couple of years ago - the design was nod to the gorgeous song \"Wild Honey\" off of their latest release \"Tripper\". But after a recent creative shift back to my illustration roots, I wanted another stab at designing for them. Even better, for the anniversary of one of my favorite records.\r\n\r\nI had no idea that it would be their last. The news of the band's retirement was released the day I picked these posters up from the printer. I know there's plenty more coming from E.J., but I'm so thankful for this bit of wind and some rainbow signs.\r\n\r\nHand-illustrated / 18x24 / 4 Colors \r\nSigned & numbered on archival stock","options":[{"id":48421383,"name":"Default","price":25.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127788033/-/photo_3.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127788033/-/photo_3.JPG","width":1008,"height":760},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127788045/-/photo_5.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127788045/-/photo_5.JPG","width":1008,"height":753},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127788060/-/fruitbats_mouthfuls_lowres.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127788060/-/fruitbats_mouthfuls_lowres.jpg","width":864,"height":648}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3294065,"name":"GIG POSTERS","permalink":"gig-posters","url":"/category/gig-posters"}]},{"id":14561283,"name":"Botanical Print Tee","permalink":"botanical-print-tee","position":6,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/botanical-print-tee","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-01T21:07:16.000Z","description":"Natural chic!

This triptych commemorates three of Ben Gibbard's hometown (Seattle) shows celebrating the release of his first solo record, \"Former Lives\". \r\n\r\nThe posters celebrate these performances:\r\n- An intimate show at the historic Smith Tower - the inspiration behind the song \"Teardrop Windows\" and a benefit for Music for Marriage Equality.\r\n\r\n-A sold out performance at The Showbox in Seattle, with fellow songsmith Damien Jurado opening to an enraptured crowd.\r\n\r\n-A rare show at another historic Seattle landmark, Washington Hall - with the lovely singer/songwriter Shelby Earl. \r\n\r\nThe illustration was a very stream-of-conciousness process while listening to Ben's new record on repeat. I think I picked up on a lot of water symbolism somehow, a washing away of the old to start anew. And it was both a challenge and a joy to represent the historic Smith Tower, but put a twist on it with Ben's initials. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":25435236,"name":"Default","price":75.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":2.5}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/79450833/-/bg_trip.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/79450833/-/bg_trip.jpg","width":1000,"height":481},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/79233837/-/gibbard.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/79233837/-/gibbard.jpg","width":864,"height":387},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/79233885/-/tower.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/79233885/-/tower.jpg","width":563,"height":1000},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/79233921/-/wave.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/79233921/-/wave.jpg","width":1000,"height":563},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/79451325/-/bg_deets.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/79451325/-/bg_deets.jpg","width":720,"height":405}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3294065,"name":"GIG POSTERS","permalink":"gig-posters","url":"/category/gig-posters"},{"id":4145064,"name":"SOLD OUT","permalink":"sold-out","url":"/category/sold-out"}]},{"id":7275483,"name":"Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros","permalink":"edward-sharpe-and-the-magnetic-zeros","position":36,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/edward-sharpe-and-the-magnetic-zeros","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-17T23:40:41.000Z","description":"3 color illustrated screen-print for Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeros' September 2012 performance at Marymoor Amphitheater, Seattle WA.
