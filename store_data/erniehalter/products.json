Fast Forward (Featuring Jessica Campbell)\r\n03. Still Alive\r\n04. Lucy Wears Red\r\n05. Loved \r\n06. Brave Enough\r\n07. Something Beautiful\r\n08. I'd Look Good On You\r\n09. Radio\r\n10. Here & Gone\r\n11. Sweetness\r\n\r\nThis album is truly a Labor of Love as I put hundreds of hours into the writing, recording, producing, and mixing. I even designed the artwork. Oh yea, the record comes with paper 3D Red/Cyan glasses to view the album cover design. Because everything is better in 3D! #amirite?\r\n\r\nNOTE: Official release date is Oct 22, 2013. If pre-ordering, every effort will be made to deliver the record on ON the 22nd. \r\n\r\nCombine with a Labor of Love V-neck, or other multiple items to get a discount on shipping.
