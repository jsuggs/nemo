The reason was that the band didn&#8217;t have a suitable means by which to print them out, now they do. And here it is on it&#8217;s one year anniversary, ready to join the &#8220;seasonal themed&#8221; album collection, of which there will be four.\n\n\tAs with all <span class=\"caps\">ANWE</span> albums, these songs are still very relevant to the live show and are crucial to own if you have just discovered the band or are intending to enjoy them live at some point. &#8216;Stephanme&#8217;, &#8216;Slackers Manifesto&#8217; and &#8216;Lemonade&#8217; are all sing along tracks to the live set.\n\n\tAll cases will match the style of the other album &#8216;spines&#8217; for a complete set.\n\n\t<span class=\"caps\">PLEASE NOTE</span>! This album <span class=\"caps\">DOES NOT</span> contain lyrics but rather, an introduction inside the booklet about the band and the songs, one by one. To fit each lyric in such a book would require ant-sized fonts (The track &#8216;Skankalicious&#8217; alone would fill the booklet up!) and so it was decided that the book will contain &#8220;insight&#8221;.
