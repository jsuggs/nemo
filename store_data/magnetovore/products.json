Flipping and rotating the cards selects between the 17 major, minor and seventh chords that make up most guitar music. These cards are the same size as standard credit cards, and can be carried in a wallet or left on a music stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n<center><h1>For wholesale pricing for your music store <a href=\"mailto:levi@magnetovore.com\"><b><u>contact us here</u></b></a>.</h1><center>","options":[{"id":48577764,"name":"Default","price":5.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.45,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127666491/-/DminDsevGrayBack.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127666491/-/DminDsevGrayBack.png","width":3600,"height":3600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127668000/-/HandsTogetherCard.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127668000/-/HandsTogetherCard.png","width":3600,"height":2200},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127667457/-/HandsTogetherGuitar.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127667457/-/HandsTogetherGuitar.png","width":3600,"height":2200}],"artists":[],"categories":[]},{"id":14690715,"name":"The Magnetic Cello","permalink":"the-magnetic-cello","position":2,"price":1800.0,"default_price":1800.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-magnetic-cello","status":"sold-out","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-11-07T18:59:42.000Z","description":"The Magnetic Cello is an electronic musical instrument that gives musicians entirely new ways to make music. Using properties of magnetism previously unexplored in music, the instrument provides unexpected and expressive sounds.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<iframe width=\"368\" height=\"207\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/m2vgBEnzQv8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis new way of making music would be nothing more than a noise maker if it was difficult to play the instrument. Our first focus on the instrument was not on creating a novelty, but on creating a complete and playable instrument. We have accomplished this by fitting the instrument into the centuries old form factor of the acoustic cello. Because of this, the instrument can be picked up quickly by cellists, and is approachable to any musician.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n<center>\r\n<img src=\"http://magnetovore.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/labeledcellotrans.png\" alt=\"some_text\" width=\"62%\" height=\"62%\"></center>\r\n\r\nThis instrument creates electricity by moving a magnetic bow across a copper coil, which controls volume. Pressing along the resistive ribbon selects different pitches.\r\nThe player interacts with three regions of the instrument:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Magnetic Coil:</b> Whenever a wire is placed in a moving magnetic field, current is generated. By moving a strong magnetic bow about the instrument’s flat and wide copper coil, an electrical signal is created. This signal is used to articulate the instrument.</li>\r\n<li><b>Resistive Ribbon:</b> Pitch is controlled by pressing along a membrane potentiometer on the neck of the instrument. Pressing lower on the instrument creates a higher voltage signal, which, when sent through circuitry, creates a higher frequency sound.</li>\r\n<li><b>String Select:</b> This instrument has only one string, instead of acoustic cello’s four. A thumb switch mounted on the magnetic bow is used to select between different string tunings.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThis instrument also comes with:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Tone and Volume Control:</b> 4 preset tones to choose from, and a master volume control.\r\n</li><li><b>Precision Tuning:</b> each string can be tuned from trimmers accessible from the outside of the instrument. Each string can be tuned to any desired frequency, from E1 to C4.\r\n</li><li><b>Rechargeable Batteries:</b> 4 standard AA batteries, which provide more than 24 hours of battery life. These batteries are easy to access and can be replaced as needed.\r\n</li><li><b>Versatile Endpin:</b> The instrument can be supported against the ground by an included peg, or affixed to any standard microphone stand.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<center><h1>Visit our <a href=\"http://magnetovore.com/mc/\"><b><u>about page</u></b></a> for more details.</h1>\r\n<br>\r\n<h1>Still have questions? <a href=\"http://magnetovore.com/magnetic-cello-interest-form/\"><b><u>Contact me here</u></b></a>.</h1><center>","options":[{"id":48230655,"name":"Default","price":1800.0,"sold_out":true,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":40.0,"amount_with_others":40.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127668966/-/MCsquare.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127668966/-/MCsquare.png","width":1100,"height":1100},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127671072/-/Bodies.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127671072/-/Bodies.png","width":900,"height":550},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/127801308/-/100_0064.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/127801308/-/100_0064.JPG","width":3072,"height":1728}],"artists":[],"categories":[]}]
