She's a warm & friendly calligraphy font, ready to collaborate with you. \r\n\r\nDasha was vintage-inspired and hand-drawn, so her alphabet bounces naturally along the baseline. She has a host of Opentype features that allow you to control just how much whimsy spills out onto the page. Each copy of Dasha comes with:\r\n\r\n- a full set of alternate capital letters (contextual alternates)\r\n- seamless ligatures that automatically connect as you type (default and discretionary ligatures)\r\n- beginning and end-of-word swashes (swash feature, and stylistic set 1 for Word users*)\r\n- a set of elaborate swashed capital letters (swash feature, and stylistic set 1 for Word users*)\r\n- old-style numerals (old style numerals)\r\n- arbitrary fractions (fractions)\r\n- 22 (!) alternate ampersand characters** (contextual alternates)\r\n\r\n<i>For best results, be sure to use Dasha in Opentype-friendly applications like Adobe's CS Suite, any recent version of Microsoft Word (2010 or newer), or Quark. <b>To see the perfectly connecting letters, make sure you have the Opentype features, particularly the default/standard and discretionary ligatures, turned on.</b> If you don't have access to these programs you can still use Dasha, though you will need to view and manually access the extra 1,100+ characters through a third party application like Ultra Character Map (Mac) or PopChar (Windows).</i>\r\n\r\nAfter checking out, you will immediately receive an email with an exclusive download link.

Set Two replaces 8 commonly used prepositions (and, the, to, to the, or, of, for and at) with complementary wordforms.

Just like people, each leaf is one-of-a-kind and varies in both size & shape. Most leaves are between 2.5\" and 6\" long - all will fit perfectly onto dinner plates.\r\n\r\nOur eco-friendly preservation & dye techniques keep the leaves slightly supple so that your calligrapher can work with ease.\r\n\r\nFor best results, we recommend using felt-tipped markers or paint pens to address your leaves. Metal-tipped fountain pens can pierce the leaf's surface.\r\n\r\nPlease note that these leaves are a product of mother nature - variation in size, shape, and texture should be expected & enjoyed.","options":[{"id":11076091,"name":"Scarlet Red","price":0.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":11076093,"name":"Flame Orange","price":0.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":11076095,"name":"Golden Yellow","price":0.75,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.95,"amount_with_others":0.05,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":14.75,"amount_with_others":0.05}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/68040383/-/2011_Calligraphy_Oak_Leaf_Placecards-019.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/68040383/-/2011_Calligraphy_Oak_Leaf_Placecards-019.jpg","width":900,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31592289/-/2011_Calligraphy_Oak_Leaf_Placecards-014.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31592289/-/2011_Calligraphy_Oak_Leaf_Placecards-014.jpg","width":900,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31592297/-/2011_Calligraphy_Oak_Leaf_Placecards-018.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31592297/-/2011_Calligraphy_Oak_Leaf_Placecards-018.jpg","width":900,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31592313/-/2011_Calligraphy_Oak_Leaf_Placecards-059.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31592313/-/2011_Calligraphy_Oak_Leaf_Placecards-059.jpg","width":900,"height":900},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/31592281/-/2011_Calligraphy_Oak_Leaf_Placecards-063.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/31592281/-/2011_Calligraphy_Oak_Leaf_Placecards-063.jpg","width":900,"height":900}],"artists":[{"id":48613,"name":"Rustic","permalink":"rustic","url":"/artist/rustic"},{"id":48617,"name":"Woodland","permalink":"woodland","url":"/artist/woodland"}],"categories":[{"id":1786719,"name":"Receptions","permalink":"receptions","url":"/category/receptions"},{"id":3560121,"name":"Red Tag Sale","permalink":"red-tag-sale","url":"/category/red-tag-sale"}]},{"id":3111729,"name":"Fruit Tree Monogram","permalink":"fruit-tree-monogram","position":45,"price":36.0,"default_price":36.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/fruit-tree-monogram","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-01-09T03:04:01.000Z","description":"Let your love grow!
