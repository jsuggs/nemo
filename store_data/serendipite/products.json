On the morning of December 7, 2006, Maria Alexandra Vettese and Stephanie Congdon Barnes each took a digital photo of everyday objects randomly arranged on their kitchen tables and, unbeknownst to one another, uploaded them to the website Flickr. Noticing a remarkable similarity between their images, they agreed to document their mornings by posting one photo to a shared blog every weekday for a year. Their site, 3191 named after the distance in miles between their homes in Portland, Maine, and Portland, Oregon quickly acquired a worldwide following of devotees fascinated by the magical coincidences and pictorial synchronicity of their photographic pairings. \r\n\r\nA Year of Mornings collects 236 images always taken before 10 am without discussion between the two women from this uniquely 21st-century artistic collaboration. The intimacy of these photographs discarded clothing, a view of a snowy day from the window, a tablecloth combined with their striking similarities in color and composition defies the reality of their long-distance collaboration. While clearly kindred spirits, the two women have met in person only once. Their friendship is maintained solely online, sustained by a shared love for moments of serenity, solitude, and peacefulness. The annotated photographs in A Year of Mornings radiate an aura of sweetness and light the promise of a new day.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n« On January 1, 2007, we began posting daily photographs of our mornings. These intimate snapshots, unposed and never discussed beforehand, were posted side by side throughout the year. Originally meant as an intimate exercise between two new friends, the blog eventually began to attract thousands of daily visitors. We were thrilled to have Princeton Architectural Press publish the entire collection of photographs in book form in 2008. The book form is the only place these photographs can be found.\r\n\r\n…these are vignettes of simple everyday things: a cup of coffee, softboiled eggs, rain boots kicked off at the front door, the stem of a flower, many crumpled napkins, many spoons. Though the two women were 3,191 miles apart the images are complementary in their color and composition more often than not. »\r\n\r\nSometimes startlingly so. The blog, and the book that followed after a year’s worth of images (and 3,000 visitors a day from Australia to Iceland), capture the rhythms of everyday life, often surprising the viewer by the sheer beauty of the most quotidian element. That each woman paused to record the curve of a daughter’s ear, a bowl of cereal or a shadow cast across the floor before sitting down in front of a computer is an act that carries with it the most clichéd, yet essential, of all messages: stop and smell the roses (and the coffee, the toast, the morning air). We’re living in difficult times, and it seems it’s exactly these tiny details and fleeting moments that can offer us the most solace and even joy. —Allison Arieff, The New York Times","options":[{"id":50371824,"name":"Default","price":32.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":142,"name":"Liechtenstein","code":"LI"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129211212/-/MIB001.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129211212/-/MIB001.jpeg","width":363,"height":500}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5949306,"name":"3191 Miles Apart","permalink":"3191-miles-apart","url":"/category/3191-miles-apart"}]},{"id":14423247,"name":"Another Escape #2","permalink":"another-escape-2","position":10,"price":24.0,"default_price":24.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/another-escape-2","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-10-26T12:57:01.000Z","description":"/// A creative exploration ///\r\n\r\nAnother Escape looks to tap and bottle this invigorating subject matter, and subsequently encourage others to actively explore their own aspirations.\r\n\r\n+ In English (UK)\r\n+ anotherescape.com\r\n+ 112 pages, 20 cm × 26.5 cm\r\n+ 4 issues per year\r\n+ Advert-free\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAnother Escape, in recent months, has taken a step back and we have reassessed our voice within the editorial publishing world; we have always been a celebration of those being ambitious and creative in their own way – but with our transition from ‘zine to publication we have cemented our brand and editorial direction – and have looked to find a greater breadth of people that are creatively exploring the confines of their practices and lives.

We are contemplating over what we can do in the nature as it stands instead of seeking artificial benefits which are food, clothing and shelter. We want to re-highlight the beauty of the pure nature that is not organized, and to play a role that it can consolidate itself into a form of new culture. Instead of merely introducing the products, we focus on, \"Why this product necessary\" and \"How to use this product.\" People who used to consider the significance of activity as the movement that is merely linked to production are starting to enjoy leisure time for their own benefit. They started to contemplate how to spend that leisure time. We present rest, mental healing and time for relaxation to the people who are fatigued from hectic city life, away from the nature, by leveraging camping, bicycling, mountain climbing, picnic and traveling. We wish that people will think about those around us and the nature amidst this slowness. We are living in an absent minded manner even when there must be beautiful moments in our everyday life. We hope that you will smile as you enjoy the photos and the writings that capture the happy moments spent with your family members and friends amidst petty everyday life. *We always wait for the participation of diverse writers such as those with designer, photographer, film director, musician and chef background with a good fit with the <AROUND>.\r\n\r\n+ In Korean (Korea)\r\n+ a-round.kr\r\n+ 4 numéros par an\r\n+ 21 x 27 cm\r\n+ 192 pages\r\n+ édité par Play-ground\r\n\r\n     -----","options":[{"id":50455323,"name":"Default","price":31.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":142,"name":"Liechtenstein","code":"LI"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":17.0,"amount_with_others":17.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/129276297/-/ARO008.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/129276297/-/ARO008.jpg","width":953,"height":1229}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6888954,"name":"Around","permalink":"around","url":"/category/around"}]},{"id":12848061,"name":"Bad Day #15","permalink":"bad-day-15","position":18,"price":15.0,"default_price":15.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/bad-day-15","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-08-08T10:59:27.000Z","description":"/// Good things are found in the pages of a Bad Day ///\r\n\r\nBad Day is a biannual cross-cultural interview magazine founded in Toronto.\r\n\r\n+ In English (CA)\r\n+ baddaymagazine.com\r\n+ 136 pages, 15 cm × 23 cm\r\n+ 2 issues per year\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAli Michael, John Baldessari, Charlie White, Brad Troemel, Jeanette Hayes, How To Dress Well, Alice Waese, Inc. and more!","options":[{"id":40960398,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":6.0,"amount_with_others":6.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":8.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/122487375/-/BAD015.jpeg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/122487375/-/BAD015.jpeg","width":599,"height":919}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5949393,"name":"Bad Day","permalink":"bad-day","url":"/category/bad-day"}]},{"id":14381157,"name":"Carton #7","permalink":"the-carton-7","position":19,"price":19.0,"default_price":19.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/the-carton-7","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-10-24T11:36:08.000Z","description":"/// The Carton is a quarterly publication about food culture and the Middle East ///\r\n\r\nGreetings! This is Jade George and Rawan Gebran and we’re the founders of The Carton, an independent quarterly publication that tells the story of Middle Eastern culture through its food. Work on The Carton began in Lebanon in July of 2011 when we established Art And Then Some, a happy ideas factory and independent publishing house.\r\n \r\nThe idea behind The Carton was to capture the essence of our complex, hot-topic culture through something that makes up the foundation of its every tradition. We wanted to tackle aspects of this culture be it sociopolitical or anthropological from a lighter angle. And to do this, we chose food.\r\n \r\nWe work with a rotation of professional and emerging creatives, and this gives them a platform to showcase at times very experimental work without shunning their creative juices. We sit together at the beginning of each quarter and brainstorm an internal theme that we’ve chosen, to come up with something fresh and interesting every time.\r\n \r\nOur in-house illustrations are by our talented Sara Ali, who does everything by hand, as in no tablets, no digital nothing. Sara even paints with real food like zaatar, olive oil and carob molasses.\r\n \r\nIn The Carton, you’ll find memoires, tales and even poems of food culture in the Middle East or from the Middle East. We make sure to give visuals a fair amount of space in our issues and let our features breathe. This is also to celebrate and give justice to the amount of work that has gone into each illustration, photograph and design.  \r\n \r\nYou’ll realise that we make it a point not to have titles on the cover to leave room for the reader to make what they want out of the issue, making it a timeless collectible. The only place you’ll see our internal theme stated is on the spine (have a lookie!).\r\n \r\nSo The Carton is not a “reviews and recipes magazine”. It is a publication that you will find recipes in though, ones that we’ve carefully selected and portrayed in an alternative way to serve a purpose. Every recipe included makes a difference to the message we’re trying to put across and adds to the whole archiving function that The Carton aims to perform.\r\n \r\nSeeing as we’re going for print but we love our environment, we’ve sourced the most environmentally-friendly paper available in Lebanon – where we print. We make sure our paper is made with pulp from well-managed forests and is FSC and PEFC certified.\r\n\r\n+ In English (Lebanon)\r\n+ artandthensome.com\r\n+ 4 issues per year\r\n+ 88 pages\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSweet yolk\r\n\r\nThere's sweetness at the heart of everything. This Autumn's edition is a reflection of where we've spent the last few months. With a philosophy of owning the city we're in we went out digging deeper – down to the nucleus of what makes a city – without underestimating the substance in an open conversation over breakfast. To have eggs in our culture is synonymous with having cojones. We're rooters of the fact that being ballsy is far from being in opposition. Got eggs? Let's start on a sweet note.","options":[{"id":46529865,"name":"Default","price":19.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":142,"name":"Liechtenstein","code":"LI"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":33,"name":"Portugal","code":"PT"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":12.0},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126391281/-/CAR007.png","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126391281/-/CAR007.png","width":483,"height":645}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6502338,"name":"Carton","permalink":"carton","url":"/category/carton"}]},{"id":14370243,"name":"Casa Brutus extra issue Muji","permalink":"casa-brutus-extra-issue-muji","position":20,"price":25.0,"default_price":25.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/casa-brutus-extra-issue-muji","status":"sold-out","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-10-23T21:33:43.000Z","description":"Fantastic special issue of this Japanese design journal devoted to the iconic design and marketing giant MUJI.

With every passing page, you’ll leave behind everything around you as you enter your own world, a place where nothing bad can happen, where everything has yet to be discovered; a place where you had already been before but had forgotten.\r\n\r\n+ In English (Spain)\r\n+ dodomagazine.com\r\n+ 96 pages\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe first issue\r\n\r\n(double cover - side A & side B)\r\n\r\n+ Rube Goldberg Machines\r\n+ The Treehouse Man\r\n+ Surviving a Waterfall\r\n+ An ant's World\r\n+ Comics & Cartoons\r\n+ Free pull-out Poster\r\n\r\nYour own private haunted house\r\n\r\n+ The perfect scare\r\n+ Houdini and the ghosts\r\n+ Choose your own adventure\r\n+ Disgusting recipes\r\n+ Haunted houses around the world\r\n+ Official Ouija board\r\n+ DIY costumes\r\n+ Free mask & poster\r\n+ Screams galore…","options":[{"id":45032949,"name":"Default","price":24.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":142,"name":"Liechtenstein","code":"LI"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":4.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":10.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":12.0,"amount_with_others":12.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125382459/-/dod001A.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125382459/-/dod001A.jpg","width":680,"height":960},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125382561/-/dod001B.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/125382561/-/dod001B.jpg","width":206,"height":290}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":6363000,"name":"Dodo","permalink":"dodo","url":"/category/dodo"}]},{"id":14380905,"name":"Flow #3","permalink":"flow-3","position":26,"price":21.0,"default_price":21.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/flow-3","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-10-24T11:01:24.000Z","description":"/// A magazine for paper lovers ///\r\n\r\n+ In English (The Netherlands)\r\n+ flowmagazine.com\r\n+ 2 issues per year\r\n+ 22,4 x 27,7 cm\r\n+ 138 pages\r\n+ some advertising\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn this issue: Alain de Botton on the value of low expectations, \"Rubber time\" in Indonesia, The new sharing economy, jazz age artist Tamara de Lempicka, The joys of Instagram, why researchers say you should keep on smiling, and as extras free sticky notes & snail mail envelope.","options":[{"id":46528920,"name":"Default","price":21.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":13.0,"amount_with_others":13.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":142,"name":"Liechtenstein","code":"LI"}},{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":5.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}},{"amount_alone":17.0,"amount_with_others":17.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/126390501/-/FLO003_copie.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/126390501/-/FLO003_copie.jpg","width":2390,"height":2976}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5949417,"name":"Flow","permalink":"flow","url":"/category/flow"}]},{"id":14458947,"name":"Frankie #56","permalink":"frankie-56","position":28,"price":31.0,"default_price":31.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/frankie-56","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-10-28T14:27:28.000Z","description":"/// design, art, photography, fashion, travel, music, craft, home, life ///\r\n\r\nFrankie magazine is a national bi-monthly based in Australia, aimed at women (and men) looking for a magazine that’s as smart, funny, sarcastic, friendly, cute, rude, arty, curious and caring as they are.

Let the people sharing your dinner table be the foreground and superficial details such as fancy recipes and table decorations can fade into the background. One-third cookbook, one-third narrative tale and one-third international adventure, The Kinfolk Table is a collection of 85 delectable recipes spread over nearly 400 pages from creative types around the world. Filled with gorgeous photography and design you’re used to seeing in the magazine, the book will inspire your next small gathering.\r\n\r\nThe book reflects our ideas about the way we believe entertaining should be: comfortable, simple, slow and  meaningful. We traveled around the world, sharing food and collecting ideas from our growing community of chefs, home cooks, designers, bloggers, photographers and others, many of whom contributed recipes to The Kinfolk Table.\r\nWe collected recipes from all different cultures that are suitable for nearly every occasion. Some of the suggestions are refreshingly simple, like throwing freshly plucked mussels on the barbecue or filling half a cantaloupe with yogurt and honey. Others may take a little more time and patience, such as Ginger Ice Cream with Kumquat Compote or perfecting a shoulder of veal. Danish, Japanese, Mexican and Korean influences make appearances too, as do fresh takes on classics such as Sweet Potato-Quinoa Burgers, Kimchi Couscous or Spiced Raw Chocolate Mousse.\r\n\r\nThe main cities we chose to focus on were Brooklyn, Copenhagen, our hometown of Portland, Oregon, and the English countryside. Of course, great food and even greater people extend beyond these borders, so we’ve added a “Wandering Table” section, featuring tales from Salt Lake City to family secrets from founder Nathan Williams’ mother and grandmother back home in Alberta, Canada. In the future we hope to explore other neighborhood nooks and bring you more stories and recipes from the edges of the culinary world.","options":[{"id":49205730,"name":"Default","price":59.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":15.0,"amount_with_others":15.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":142,"name":"Liechtenstein","code":"LI"}},{"amount_alone":9.0,"amount_with_others":9.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128350275/-/KIB001.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128350275/-/KIB001.jpg","width":272,"height":369}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5949429,"name":"Kinfolk","permalink":"kinfolk","url":"/category/kinfolk"}]},{"id":14370201,"name":"Kinfolk #10","permalink":"kinfolk-10","position":37,"price":29.0,"default_price":29.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/kinfolk-10","status":"active","on_sale":true,"created_at":"2013-10-23T21:32:13.000Z","description":"/// Discovering new things to cook, make and do ///\r\n\r\nKinfolk magazine is a quarterly that collects ideas from a growing international community of artists, writers, designers, photographers, cooks and others who are interested in creating small gatherings and finding new things to make and do.\r\n\r\nPrinted in the US on matte paper, each issue is filled with lush photography, lyrical essays, recipes, interviews, profiles, personal stories and practical tips along with a keen attention to design and details.

It’s nothing new: hawaladar agents have moved cash across vast swaths of the Middle East and North Africa for centuries. What has changed are methods and currencies. San Francisco and Mogadishu are unlikely partners breeding a digital street trade, with mobile money—the new hawala—fueling vendors and remittances on both sides. Meanwhile, our tender is both unifying and fracturing, with bitcoins accessible anywhere and micro-currencies emerging where bottle caps or peanuts are deemed as valuable as cash. The hope of trade has always been that by opening doors, everyone can find what they want.

Some content vanishes in the abyss of the Internet but thrives in print. The immediacy of webbrowsing allows for absorbing inspiring bits and pieces in large quantities but doesn’t necessarily foster careful examination or rereading.
