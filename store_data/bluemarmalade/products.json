The overlapping petals create shapes of differing brightness when illuminated.  The openings at the top and bottom allow direct lighting without exposing the viewer to the glare of the light source.  You can add this touch of botanical elegance and style to any pendant fitting in your home quickly and easily with its universal hanger.  <em>Bud</em> is intended for use with energy saving compact fluorescent light bulbs or LED bulbs.\r\n\r\n“With <em>Bud</em> we set out with the idea of creating a pendant shade that resembled a flower <em>Bud</em>, a shape that evokes spring's promise of lushness to come.  We created a deliberately overlapping form between the elements.  When the light is turned on the differing brightness in this form changes and enhances the appearance of <em>Bud</em>.

We think there are two kinds of gardeners, the ones that think gardens are there to be productive and give you lots of veg and those who think gardens are there to look beautiful.  To satisfy both we have a labeling kit for veg gardeners called \r\n<a href=\"http://shop.bluemarmalade.co.uk/product/growtm\"><em>Grow</em></a> and for flower gardeners a kit called <em>Forget Me Not</em>.</p> \r\n\r\n<em>Forget Me Not</em> contains 10 labels in the shape of a flower and comes in a nice recycled cardboard pack with a white weatherproof marker pencil.  The pencil can be wiped off, so that the plant label is reusable for next season but doesn't wash off with the rain.\r\n\r\nPackaged in compostable or recyclable cardboard packaging.","options":[{"id":19064917,"name":"Forget Me Not Label Pack","price":5.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19064919,"name":"Bulk Bundle of 5 Forget Me Not Label Packs","price":22.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true},{"id":19064921,"name":"Grow Label Pack","price":5.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58494547/-/FMN_-_Tulip.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58494547/-/FMN_-_Tulip.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58494563/-/FMN_-_Potting_Shed_01.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58494563/-/FMN_-_Potting_Shed_01.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/58494589/-/FMN_-_Tools.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/58494589/-/FMN_-_Tools.jpg","width":800,"height":800}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3118849,"name":"Gifts","permalink":"gifts","url":"/category/gifts"}]},{"id":6026279,"name":"<em>Cog Intimo</em>™ Underground Edition Pendant Shade","permalink":"em-cog-intimo-underground-edition-em-tm-pendant-shade","position":11,"price":32.5,"default_price":32.5,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/em-cog-intimo-underground-edition-em-tm-pendant-shade","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-04-25T14:32:30.000Z","description":"<em>Cog Intimo Underground Edition</em> brings warm bright light to your interior with its softly illuminated slices emanating light from its core.  Its sleek shape is practical, striking and its classic proportions elegantly bridge the gap between, traditional and modern interiors.  But the Underground Version brings an elegant splash of colour with the Underground Map featured in the three slices.\r\n\r\nThe London tube map is our kind of design.  It's colourful, clear, useful, there is a method behind it and looks amazing, in fact it is just all round brilliant.  Imagine how excited we were when we got asked to design some products incorporating this icon of graphic communication.  You are right, very very excited.  We have tried to use the map in a fun understated way that doesn't take over your interior but adds a subtle hint of colour and intrigue.\r\n\r\nBlue Marmalade: When we produce a product for you we always make sure that it works well, looks great (in our opinion, anyway) \r\nand it has a clear eco conscience.  So we design out nasty chemicals and processes and use low energy ways of making them.  We \r\nuse recycled materials whenever we can (and with cog intimo we can) and ensure they remain recyclable.  Every product we make has \r\nbeen designed so that it is really simple to recycle and we promise to take it back for recycling at the end of its life.\r\nWe do all this because we think we should, to benefit the environment and the people who make our products, but most of all for \r\nyou, so that you can have a product that you’re happy with and can feel really good about.\r\n\r\n\r\nProduct Dimensions: \r\n30cm Diameter x 21cm deep \r\n\r\nMaterial: \r\n100% recycled plastic\r\n\r\nPackaging: \r\nFlat pack in retail packaging, assembly required.","options":[{"id":19269521,"name":"flat pack","price":32.5,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":19269523,"name":"pre-assembled by a pro","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":true}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59159383/-/Cog_Inimo_UNDERGROUND_With_Gradient.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59159383/-/Cog_Inimo_UNDERGROUND_With_Gradient.jpg","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/59157679/-/Blue_Marmalade_-_Cog__Intimo_Underground_ON.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/59157679/-/Blue_Marmalade_-_Cog__Intimo_Underground_ON.jpg","width":708,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3109909,"name":"Lighting - Pendant Shades","permalink":"lighting-pendant-shades","url":"/category/lighting-pendant-shades"},{"id":3119145,"name":"London Underground Editions","permalink":"london-underground-editions","url":"/category/london-underground-editions"}]},{"id":7680312,"name":"<em>Hollow</em>™ Underground Edition Mood Light","permalink":"em-hollow-em-tm-underground-edition-mood-light","position":12,"price":45.0,"default_price":45.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/em-hollow-em-tm-underground-edition-mood-light","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-10-25T15:55:51.000Z","description":"<em>Hollow</em> a cheerful light that suits every room\r\n\r\nEvery table lamp is basically the same, a base with the light bulb fixed to the top of it and a shade to cover it, it hasn't really evolved that far since the early days of electricity.

A bin, yes that right back in 2002 we designed a bin as our first product  because we wanted to immediately address the waste that's produced in our day to day lives.\r\nIt all began with a pencil.  Trent needed something on his desk to sharpen his pencil into so he folded a bit of waste paper in to a simple container for his pencil shavings.  This desktop container was the spark for <em>Polyrap</em> and we spent some time working out the folds, sketching out solutions (we are back to the pencil) and developed it into the smart <em>Polyrap</em> waste paper bin it is now.\r\nThe developed product was designed to be made from a single recycled plastic piece, an easy, welcoming shape to fill and empty and easy to clean.  We also wanted it to be a smaller sized bin, because with a growing opportunity to sort more of our waste for recycling, that is what we need. More smaller bins, that we can empty into the different recycling containers, which can be easily unfolded for cleaning and therefore don't need a bin liner.\r\n\r\nGood to know <em>Polyrap</em>:\r\nIs easy to clean. Just unfold it, wipe it clean and refold it.\r\n\r\nIs eco, because it is made from recycled and recyclable material and doesn't need a bin liner.\r\n\r\nIs flat-packed, so there is no problem with storage.\r\ncomes in 5 different colours: red, white, ice blue, grey and pink.\r\n\r\nIs packaged flat in a funky carry case made from recycled board. (another bag saved)\r\n\r\nEasy to empty as its shaped like a pouring spout when turned upside down.\r\n\r\nKeeps it close to home.
