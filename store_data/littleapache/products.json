According to their Legend, in the center of the Dream Catcher there is a hole.  Good dreams are permitted to reach the sleeper through this hole in the  web.  As for the bad dreams, the web traps them and they disappear at dawn with the first light.   For some, they try to determine what messages are being past onto them and what the message represents. \r\n","options":[{"id":49674942,"name":"Default","price":15.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128695572/-/14.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128695572/-/14.JPG","width":1600,"height":1600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5682360,"name":"jewellery","permalink":"jewellery","url":"/category/jewellery"},{"id":6494466,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]},{"id":15282558,"name":"Dakota","permalink":"little-st-christopher","position":21,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/little-st-christopher","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-02T23:06:53.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":49674423,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128695173/-/18.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128695173/-/18.JPG","width":1600,"height":1600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5682360,"name":"jewellery","permalink":"jewellery","url":"/category/jewellery"},{"id":6494466,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]},{"id":15282453,"name":"Onawa","permalink":"little-moon-shine","position":22,"price":12.0,"default_price":12.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/little-moon-shine","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-02T23:03:24.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":49674114,"name":"Default","price":12.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128694933/-/11.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128694933/-/11.JPG","width":1600,"height":1600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5682360,"name":"jewellery","permalink":"jewellery","url":"/category/jewellery"},{"id":6494466,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]},{"id":15282423,"name":"Lootah","permalink":"little-red","position":23,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/little-red","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-02T23:02:19.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":49674045,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128694843/-/15.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128694843/-/15.JPG","width":1600,"height":1600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5682360,"name":"jewellery","permalink":"jewellery","url":"/category/jewellery"},{"id":6494463,"name":"Bracelets","permalink":"bracelets","url":"/category/bracelets"}]},{"id":15282399,"name":"Catori","permalink":"a-little-cross","position":24,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/a-little-cross","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-02T23:01:18.000Z","description":"","options":[{"id":49673988,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128694807/-/7.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128694807/-/7.JPG","width":1600,"height":1600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5682360,"name":"jewellery","permalink":"jewellery","url":"/category/jewellery"},{"id":6494469,"name":"Earrings","permalink":"earrings","url":"/category/earrings"}]},{"id":15282345,"name":"Helaku","permalink":"little-hermatite-cross","position":25,"price":8.0,"default_price":8.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/little-hermatite-cross","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2013-12-02T22:59:28.000Z","description":"Hematite is used to improve relationships. If you need your personal relationship to be better, carry a hematite with you always.\r\n\r\nThe name comes from the Greek word for blood. It has been used as an amulet against bleeding, and so is known as the \"blood stone\". When arranged like the petals of a flower, it is referred to as the \"iron rose\". Native American folklore states that war paint made from hematite will make one invincible in battle. People in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries wore hematite jewelry during mourning.","options":[{"id":49673820,"name":"Default","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128694438/-/photo_3.JPG","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128694438/-/photo_3.JPG","width":1600,"height":1600}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":5682360,"name":"jewellery","permalink":"jewellery","url":"/category/jewellery"},{"id":6494469,"name":"Earrings","permalink":"earrings","url":"/category/earrings"}]}]
