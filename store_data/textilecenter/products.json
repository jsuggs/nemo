IKEA merchandise in genereal can create an interior that suggest a modern design. I interpreted a classic from the art world, a painted pot of poppies, to be modern and hip. Just as the traditional quilt world has changed to incorporate art quilts, what was a standard painted motif, has come a long way to be a part of our current artistic aesthetic. </i>\r\n\r\nThis quilt was awarded Best of Show in the Project Patchwork IKEA Challenge.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\nThis quilt was created as part of Project Patchwork, a partnership between IKEA and Textile Center.
