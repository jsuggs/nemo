The intelligent position recognition system analyses the position of the antennas and automatically switches to the optimal transmitting antenna. There is no longer any such thing as the 'worst position'.\r\n\r\n<b>You find faster</b>\r\nThe circular display lets you focus on the essentials. The distance to and the relative position of a victim. Always align the device to the arrow. The solid arrow and the central distance value keep you going in the right direction.\r\n\r\n<b>You find more exactly</b>\r\nThe patented circular display shows you at a glance whether you are getting closer to the signal or moving away from it. With the precise distance value you can very effectively determine the distance to the buried victim and limit the area to be probed.\r\n\r\n<b>You find more victims</b>\r\nThe 3+ allows you to maintain an overview even with multiple burials. The number of victims is shown in the display. As soon as you have found the first one you can blend out their signal with the pin key. The victim is displayed as pinned and you can immediately continue with your search.\r\n\r\n<b>Safety features:</B>\r\nSmart antenna technology enhances your own safety. Signal separation with pinning function. Very easy operation due to: clear control elements, precise real time display with directional arrows and circular display. Rubberized housing for protection and ergonomics. Display lighting for night searches, switchover in case of a follow-up avalanche, clear and optimized search acoustics, updateability. \r\n\r\n<b>Beast Shovel</b>\r\n\r\nOur Beast stands for maximum performance in any type of snow. The scoop vanishes into every touring backpack saving space and offers an optimal ratio between weight and maximum rigidity. The T-handle and sanded grip enable economic shoveling. The oval shovel shaft makes the Beast not only stiffer but also extremely resistant to breakage. \r\n\r\n<b>240 light probe</b>\r\n\r\nStable ultra-light sensor with the unique pfa quick-release tensioning system. With a handle, the probe can be absolutely safely stretched and just as quickly collapsed again and put together. The probe is tensioned with a Dyneema draw line. This is not only lightweight but also durable. For the 240 Carbon pfa, we use a tube diameter of 10 mm. The carbon probe is extremely rigid and therefore very accurate. The grip sleeve made of EVA foam allows comfortable handling during probing practices. The burial depth can be read from the markings on the segments.\r\nThe 240 Carbon pfa is delivered with a handy quick-release cover. \r\n","options":[{"id":15540645,"name":"Default","price":339.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":5,"name":"Belgium","code":"BE"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":11,"name":"Denmark","code":"DK"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":26,"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LU"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":30,"name":"Netherlands","code":"NL"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46581891/-/ortovox-avalanche-rescue-set.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46581891/-/ortovox-avalanche-rescue-set.jpg","width":1000,"height":898},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46582003/-/ortotransheld.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46582003/-/ortotransheld.jpg","width":800,"height":533},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46582019/-/ortotranstop.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46582019/-/ortotranstop.jpg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46581907/-/ortoshovel.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46581907/-/ortoshovel.jpg","width":400,"height":267},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/46581915/-/ortoprobe.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/46581915/-/ortoprobe.jpg","width":400,"height":267}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":1841763,"name":"Mens","permalink":"mens","url":"/category/mens"},{"id":1841765,"name":"Womens","permalink":"womens","url":"/category/womens"},{"id":2578775,"name":"Safety Equipment","permalink":"safety-equipment","url":"/category/safety-equipment"},{"id":2562861,"name":"Ortovox","permalink":"ortovox","url":"/category/ortovox"}]},{"id":7388739,"name":"Ortovox Merino 240 Long Sleeve Blue Mens","permalink":"ortovox-merino-240-long-sleeve-blue-mens","position":23,"price":79.0,"default_price":79.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/ortovox-merino-240-long-sleeve-blue-mens","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2012-09-28T23:38:23.000Z","description":"Excellent wear comfort due to the soft terry cloth liner.

With the neoprene hip belt, the backpack ideally hugs the body and therefore is perfect for fast sports. As free riders no longer restrict their activity only next to the pistes, but also climb a lot, we have provided fasteners for ski, snowboard and helmet, and loops for picks and other gear to the backpacks of the same name.
