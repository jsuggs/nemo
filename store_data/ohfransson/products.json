However, if you plan to buy new fabric, bag Styles A and B can be made with 1/4 yard or less each of exterior bag fabric, lining fabric, and interlining fabric.

This is an excellent scrap-busting project and a perfect way to incorporate all of your favorite fabrics into a single quilt!  \r\n\r\nThe pattern design is the same for each of the four quilt sizes, with the squares in the grid simply sized up or down to fit the quilt.\r\n\r\nThe subway “lines” and “stops” and the blocks on the quilt back are made from 12 different groups of colorful fabric print and solid fabric scraps including red, orange, yellow, light green, dark green, green-blue, light blue, dark blue, violet, pink, gray, and black.\r\n\r\nThe pattern includes two complete sets of block assembly diagrams, so you can choose the version that best fits your fabric stash.\r\n\r\nThe SUPER SCRAPPY VERSION is ideal for quilters with a large stash of scraps who want to use many different fabrics and have some flexibility in laying them out. The block assembly diagrams for the Super Scrappy Version show the path of each subway “line,” but the individual fabric squares within each line can be arranged according to the quilter’s preference.  \r\n\r\nThe FIVE FABRIC VERSION uses larger scraps of 5 different fabrics for each color group. The 5 fabrics can be all prints, all solids, or some combination thereof. This version is ideal for quilters who want to use larger pieces of fewer fabrics and for quilters who prefer more specific placement guides. The block assembly diagrams for the Five Fabric Version include specific placements for each fabric.\r\n\r\nThe pdf pattern will be automatically delivered via e-mail as soon as your payment is received.

Please read the entire listing for more specific information about what is included in the pattern. Thank you!\r\n\r\nInspired by plastic letters scattered across a refrigerator door, Refrigerator Magnets includes 72 different (216 total) quilt block patterns for small, medium, and large letters, numbers, and punctuation marks. The blocks can be pieced together to create an endless variety of words and phrases for your quilt projects.\r\n\r\nThe pattern describes a unique piecing process using freezer paper templates. Unlike conventional paper piecing, the templates are not destroyed during the process, making it possible to use them multiple times. This process will also allow you to press all seams open, reducing bulk and allowing your blocks to lie nice and flat. The template patterns can be printed directly onto printable freezer paper sheets or traced onto freezer paper from a roll \r\n\r\n<b>BLOCK SIZES</b>\r\nThe finished (not including seam allowance) height of most blocks is:\r\nSmall Blocks = 3\" tall\r\nMedium Blocks = 4\" tall\r\nLarge Blocks = 5\" tall\r\n\r\nRefrigerator Magnets blocks are not all the same size. To ensure that the blocks can be combined to resemble standard text, the width of the blocks varies from 1/2\" to 5\", depending on the character and the block size. For instance, a letter <b>i</b> is naturally skinnier than a letter <b>w</b>. Additionally, a few characters such as letters <b>g</b> and <b>y</b> have descending parts, making them a little bit taller than the other blocks. The pattern includes information on how to combine the various blocks effectively.\r\n\r\n<b>FABRIC REQUIREMENTS</b> \r\nEach block is made with background fabric and letter fabric. The background fabric is for the background or negative space in the block. The letter fabric is for the letter (or number or punctuation mark). You can make your blocks from just two fabrics (one for the background and one for the letter) or combine multiple coordinating fabrics for a scrappier look. \r\n\r\nThe amount of fabric you’ll need will vary depending on which block size and style you’re making. As a general guideline, any block in this pattern can be made with a 6” x 10” piece of background fabric and a 6” x 10” piece of letter fabric. In most cases, much less fabric will be required, making Refrigerator Magnets blocks a great scrap-busting project. \r\n\r\n<b>FREEZER PAPER</b>\r\nThe pattern sheets are formatted for printing onto 8-1/2\" x 11\" sheets of printable freezer paper, which can be purchased in quilt shops. Alternately, the patterns can be traced onto regular freezer paper from a roll, which can be purchased at larger grocery stores.\r\n\r\n<b>IMPORTANT NOTES</b>\r\nThe pattern's name was inspired by refrigerator magnets. However, this is a quilt block pattern that doesn't involve any actual magnets. This pattern includes templates and instructions for making 216 letter, number, and punctuation mark blocks. I’ve included basic information about joining the blocks together, but the pattern does not include instructions or diagrams for making finished quilts. \r\n\r\nThe pdf pattern will be automatically delivered via e-mail as soon as your payment is received.

The elasticized cozy is easily slipped on and off most standard-sized household irons, while the strap helps to hold the iron’s cord in place. A quilted heat-resistant bottom and sides lined with heat-resistant fabric help make a recently-used iron easier to move.\r\n\r\nThe pdf pattern includes one pattern piece, which is made by printing 2 pages and taping them together. All other pieces are rotary cut.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the listing images for a materials list. Yardage is listed on the chart, but scraps may also be used (a chart with sizes is provided in the pattern). Ironing board fabric and thermal fleece are typically found in the utility fabrics section of a fabric store.  In addition to the materials on the list and your standard sewing supplies, you will need a water-soluble fabric marker, small safety pins, basic machine quilting supplies, tape, and a printout of the pattern piece on Pages 8 and 9 of the pdf.\r\n\r\n<b>Important Notes</b>\r\nThis pattern describes how to make an iron cozy lined with heat-resistant materials. However, the user is still advised to exercise caution when handling and transporting a hot iron.\r\n\r\nThe pattern was designed to fit most standard irons used by home sewers. I tested the cozy on a wide variety of irons, but I cannot guarantee that it will fit <i>every</i> iron. Irons with retractable cords will probably not fit in this iron cozy. The cozy will fit more loosely on smaller irons. \r\n\r\nThe pdf pattern will be automatically delivered via e-mail as soon as your payment is received.

Covers have patchwork-pieced fronts and solid-color backs and are designed to hold 20” x 20” pillow forms. \r\n\r\nDirections for piecing four different patchwork pillow fronts are included.  Piecing is a combination of conventional and improvisational patchwork, making this a great project for those who want to try improvisational piecing, but prefer a little structure.\r\n\r\nThe pattern describes how to finish the pillows with an invisible zip closure hidden in a seam or a visible zip closure on the pillow back.  Both closures can be sewn with a standard zipper foot, but the invisible zipper application will be easier with an invisible zipper foot.
