Coming July 1st 2013, on the heels of their 2012 EP \"Mildred, Margie, Annie, Clarice\", \"Anaesthesiology\" is a reaction to a era of repressive austerity measures, corrupt conservative politicians, violent far right movements and racist border controls. The record really rages - 10 earnest and informed pop songs for these trying times. Featuring a global cast of contributors (Spoonboy, Erica Freas of RVIVR, Robin Leitch of Random Hand + loads more) \"Anaesthesiology\" pairs a fully orchestrated pop sound with ONSIND's infectious and raw acoustic punk. Nathan and Daniel have created a gorgeous political pop record, placing them comfortably between Propagandhi and the Proclaimers.\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":35090109,"name":"Default","price":5.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.4,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":2.4,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":1.0,"amount_with_others":0.8,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":2.4,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":4.0,"amount_with_others":3.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109697961/-/ONSINDcovermed.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109697961/-/ONSINDcovermed.jpg","width":656,"height":656}],"artists":[{"id":45761,"name":"ONSIND","permalink":"onsind","url":"/artist/onsind"}],"categories":[{"id":1637216,"name":"CDs","permalink":"cds","url":"/category/cds"}]},{"id":3639564,"name":"Spoonboy - The Papas ","permalink":"spoonboy-the-papas","position":4,"price":5.0,"default_price":5.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/spoonboy-the-papas","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-04-22T19:07:22.000Z","description":"<iframe width=\"300\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 300px; height: 100px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=4219399319/size=grande/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/transparent=true/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"http://spoonboy.bandcamp.com/track/stab-yer-dad\">Stab Yer Dad by spoonboy</a></iframe>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the first Spoonboy album in 6 years! 6 years!\r\nThe record was recorded in April 2010 with a backing band consisting of members of Nana Grizol, Hot New Mexicans, Grape Soda, Madeline, Elf Power, Defiance Ohio, and more.

They started five years ago as a distraction from the final year of university, they have grown up slightly over time from a wide-eyed mess into the semi-coherent, rough and tumble cuddlecore behemoth that is shambling round the country currently. The songs are brief,stubbornly avoid repetition and are a bit fancy-pants sloppy-ass pop-punk, all up in your face all of the time.\r\n\r\nThe band have recorded an album a year since their inception, each acurt blast of enthusiasm barely scraping the twenty minute mark. 'Outside It's Cold Just Like The Inside Of Your Body And', their fifth full length (and first released on vinyl), is nearly half an hour of thrashing, shouting football references and attempts to harmonise. It's not a massive progression but you can tell they've learned their instruments a bit better this time round.\r\n\r\nAfter touring a few times, the band can boast a moderate following and two record labels (London's Odd Box and Durham's Discount Horse) who are jointly releasing the new record and associated detritus.\r\n\r\n300 copies on blue vinyl w/download code\r\n","options":[{"id":23576259,"name":"LP ","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":21850793,"name":"LP w/Best of CD","price":8.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":2.8,"amount_with_others":1.5,"country":{"id":42,"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}},{"amount_alone":7.0,"amount_with_others":3.0},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":4,"name":"Austria","code":"AT"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":14,"name":"Finland","code":"FI"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":15,"name":"France","code":"FR"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":16,"name":"Germany","code":"DE"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":23,"name":"Italy","code":"IT"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":32,"name":"Norway","code":"NO"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":36,"name":"Spain","code":"ES"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":37,"name":"Sweden","code":"SE"}},{"amount_alone":3.5,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":38,"name":"Switzerland","code":"CH"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/109268589/-/abs400.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/109268589/-/abs400.jpg","width":400,"height":400}],"artists":[{"id":65104,"name":"Ace Bushy Striptease","permalink":"ace-bushy-striptease","url":"/artist/ace-bushy-striptease"}],"categories":[{"id":2279972,"name":"12\"","permalink":"12","url":"/category/12"},{"id":1690061,"name":"DH releases","permalink":"dh-releases","url":"/category/dh-releases"}]}]
