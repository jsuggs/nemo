The Atrocity Exhibit swerve the use of blistering speed sometimes shown in their past work and instead spit out the snail-paced 'Throne Of Bile', a masterclass in tension-filled suffering; a track rippling with a violent, unpredictable swagger that's constantly threatening to explode in your face. Iron Witch offer no respite, with 'Her Cheating Heart'  being perhaps their best song yet; a track of such colossal heaviness and down-tuned, down-beat, forceful depression that's it's like having your face forced down into the muck that lines the banks of the Mersey. With both bands on such rampantly aggressive form, this is without a doubt the ugliest 7\" to crawl its way out of the UK this year.\r\n\r\nIron Witch track was recorded by Bri and Devo Doom at the 1in12 Studio, Bradford, in September 2013\r\n\r\nThe Atrocity Exhibit track was recorded, mixed and mastered by Ian Boult at Stuck On A Name Studios, Nottingham, in July 2012\r\n\r\nA joint release between Dead Chemists and Witch Hunter Records, this split 7\" is limited to 500 copies, on none more black vinyl, and comes with a 4 panel gatefold sleeve, with artwork & layout by James Caygill\r\n\r\nwww.facebook.com/deadchemistsrecords\r\ndeadchemists@gmail.com\r\n\r\nwww.facebook.com/WitchHunterRecords\r\nwitchhunterrecords@gmail.com\r\n\r\nwww.facebook.com/ironwitch1977\r\niron.witch@hotmail.com\r\n\r\nwww.facebook.com/theatrocityexhibit\r\natrocityexhibitgrind@gmail.com\r\n\r\n** THIS IS A PRE-ORDER AND WILL SHIP AS SOON AS WE GET THE RECORDS BACK FROM THE PRESSING PLANT, WHICH SHOULD HOPEFULLY BE IN A FEW WEEKS.
