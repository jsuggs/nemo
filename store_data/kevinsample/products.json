It is comprised of acrylic paint on cut pieces of MDF. The central figure in this piece is looking to the sky, not able to get airborne, soiled by the harsh world around him, and not believing he might fit into the comfort of the building right in front of him. However, as evidenced by the numerous windows, it is full of entities just like him.\r\n\r\nEmail with questions & visit my website kevinsample.com if you get the chance.","options":[{"id":18410447,"name":"Default","price":936.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":0.0,"amount_with_others":0.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/56291311/-/I_Dont_Think_I_Fit_In.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/56291311/-/I_Dont_Think_I_Fit_In.jpg","width":1000,"height":678}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":2493875,"name":"Paintings","permalink":"paintings","url":"/category/paintings"}]},{"id":4602927,"name":"Rufus Schmanley vs. The Invisible Robot of Doom","permalink":"rufus-schmanley-vs-the-invisible-robot-of-doom","position":2,"price":864.0,"default_price":864.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/rufus-schmanley-vs-the-invisible-robot-of-doom","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2011-10-10T17:08:42.000Z","description":"Rufus Schmanley is totally manly, and he's on the watch for ne'er-do-wells.

All eight feature close-ups of different characters from the Lewis Carroll books, and they are available to purchase as a set.\r\n\r\nI tried to capture some traits of each character, as if they were having their picture taken and were told to \"show off\" in their own way. Every one of the eight has a solid custom-made frame with black paint and a silver wash. The frame contrasts with the pop art feel to each piece and helps bring it back to the subject matter’s 19th century English roots. \r\n\r\nThe eight paintings are as follows:\r\n\r\n- Cheshire Cat\r\n- Alice\r\n- Mad Hatter\r\n- White Rabbit?\r\n- Queen of Hearts\r\n- March Hare\r\n- The Tweedles\r\n- The Caterpillar\r\n\r\nAll of them are original oil paintings on 24” x 48” canvas except for the Cheshire Cat which is an original acrylic on a 24\" x 36\" canvas.  \r\n\r\nStraight-on pictures of them individually can be seen on my website - http://kevinsample.com/paintings\r\n\r\nShipping is included, but I'll give a discount if you live close enough to Nashville to arrange a drop-off/pick-up. Please email with any questions.
