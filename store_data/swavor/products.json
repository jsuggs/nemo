So we are like 10 mins in and they are doing a dramatic slow-mo through some type of museum. This man Chris just starts getting super antsy. He stops the video and won't shut up about the art on this vase. So from the little excerpt screenshot, this kid recreates the ENTIRE design on the vase from scratch.

No matter who you are our where you see this painting, it is bound to provoke some sort of reaction from you. It is gruesome. It is provocative. Even more so if you are sitting next to someone who is wearing it. But apart from the obvious things that the naked eye provides, Goya captures the Greek (Romanised) myth of Saturn, the father of time. He feared that he would be overthrown by one of his children, so he ate each one as soon as they were born. This shirt made my little sister cry when she saw it for the first time. It was at that moment that I knew, Christofer Brito (who wanted to use this painting), had a genius idea. Very few paintings provoke that much emotion upon site.

In fashion, no matter who you are or how big of a figure you are, it always seems inevitable that skirmishes will occur.
