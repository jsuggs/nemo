I stamp and embellish the smaller, initial square, then solder it to a larger piece of sterling silver sheet. Each charm is different and unique, as I use design stamps to embellish the edges of the initial layer of silver. The charms are about 15 mm long by 13 mm wide. It dangles from the necklace on a very sturdy jump ring. The chain flat link chain is 18 inches long. Add as many charms as you like!\r\n\r\nPlease specify a letter when ordering. Any letter (or number) is available. I will gladly add additional charms for $28 each (additional chains can also be purchased). Also, If you would like any additional wording or date stamped on the back, it will be an additional charge of $7. If you would like to purchase the charm for a charm bracelet or separately, please let me know! The length of the chain can also be customized. Please contact me with any questions. \r\n\r\nThese charms are special and have a rustic, handmade look to them. They make great bridesmaids' gifts. Also available on a torque bracelet (see listing).","options":[{"id":29453090,"name":"A","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453093,"name":"B","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453096,"name":"C","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453099,"name":"D","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453102,"name":"E","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453105,"name":"F","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453108,"name":"G","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453111,"name":"H","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453114,"name":"I","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453117,"name":"J","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453165,"name":"K","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453162,"name":"L","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453159,"name":"M","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453156,"name":"N","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453153,"name":"O","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453150,"name":"P","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453147,"name":"Q","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453144,"name":"R","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453141,"name":"S","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453138,"name":"T","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453135,"name":"U","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453132,"name":"V","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453129,"name":"W","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453126,"name":"X","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453123,"name":"Y","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":29453120,"name":"Z","price":42.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.75,"amount_with_others":1.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}},{"amount_alone":8.0,"amount_with_others":1.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/92530394/-/il_fullxfull.101327986.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/92530394/-/il_fullxfull.101327986.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":138723,"name":"Necklaces","permalink":"necklaces","url":"/category/necklaces"}]},{"id":219218,"name":"Stamped Stacker Rings","permalink":"stamped-stacker-rings","position":2,"price":48.0,"default_price":48.0,"tax":0.0,"url":"/product/stamped-stacker-rings","status":"active","on_sale":false,"created_at":"2009-01-18T22:14:20.000Z","description":"A set of four stacking rings are handmade from square sterling silver wire.

They are great when worn as a group of four, but I also love them individually, two, or three. \r\n\r\nBecause they are made to order, and are handmade, there will be subtle differences from the rings pictured. You will see the hammer strikes on the silver, and the impressions may be lighter or darker. Each ring measures about 2 mm. wide and set together they are just a hair over 8 mm. wide. Stacker rings are made to order in any size. They can be customized with different stampings or even lettering.
