Handmade, strung on chain or natural silk.\r\n\r\nThese bracelets are the perfect way to subtly accessorise, and make a great gift even for someone who might not usually wear jewellery.\r\n\r\nThe design is a contemporary interpretation of the ancient Egyptian belief that the scarab beetle was a symbol of rebirth.  The beetle was used to represent the god Khepri, who was thought to push the sun disc through the morning sky, as a scarab beetle pushes its ball of dung.  Each day the sun disappeared, always to rise again and be reborn the following day.  Thus the scarab beetle became a symbol of hope and renewal.\r\n\r\nThe design is double-sided, with the abstracted hieroglyph of the scarab on one side and the eternally rising sun on the other.  The chains are oxidised to match the detail of the amulet, and the 100% natural silk cords are extremely strong and flexible. \r\n\r\nCrafted in: matt finished solid 925 sterling silver or rose bronze\r\nDimensions: for amulets on chains, the standard length is 20.5cm.  Amulets on silk are adjustable length - at the largest, the standard length is 25cm.\r\n\r\nWe can custom make a bracelet to a particular length if you'd like, simply message or email us once you have ordered.\r\n\r\n\r\n","options":[{"id":49187889,"name":"Rose Bronze Amulet on chain","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49187892,"name":"Rose Bronze Amulet on black silk","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49187895,"name":"Rose Bronze Amulet on red silk","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49187898,"name":"Silver Amulet on chain","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49187901,"name":"Silver Amulet on black silk","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false},{"id":49187904,"name":"Silver Amulet on red silk","price":35.0,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":5.0,"amount_with_others":3.0,"country":{"id":3,"name":"Australia","code":"AU"}},{"amount_alone":10.0,"amount_with_others":5.0}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128337285/-/NovoAmulets.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128337285/-/NovoAmulets.jpg","width":984,"height":1312},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/128337294/-/NovoAmulets2.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/128337294/-/NovoAmulets2.jpg","width":984,"height":1312}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3592203,"name":"details for the body","permalink":"details-for-the-body","url":"/category/details-for-the-body"}]},{"id":14923815,"name":"NEW!
