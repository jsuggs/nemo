Murakami\r\n\r\n\r\nTutu Kane can’t afford a new birthday present for his grandson Kula, so he gives him an old ‘ukulele. Grateful and happy, Kula plays the ‘ukulele day and night. Then one day, he enters the Town Talent Show. After many performers, some big and some small, brave Kula walks on stage with his old ‘ukulele, and has the chance to make his Tutu Kane proud. This children’s book will teach important lessons about humility and generosity in a colorful, keiki-friendly format. Young readers will learn that the best gifts are the ones that allow you to give to others. Parents and children alike will be delighted by Wheeler’s lyrical text and Murakami’s whimsical drawings. \r\n\r\nISBN Hard Cover: 1-56647-844-1\r\n\r\n$12.95 ","options":[{"id":19845103,"name":"Default","price":12.95,"sold_out":false,"has_custom_price":false}],"shipping":[{"amount_alone":3.0,"amount_with_others":2.0,"country":{"id":43,"name":"United States","code":"US"}}],"images":[{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61089111/-/kula_COVER.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61089111/-/kula_COVER.jpg","width":573,"height":652},{"url":"http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/61089143/-/kula_preview.jpg","secure_url":"https://d1j5c7u4mzbpxw.cloudfront.net/bigcartel/product_images/61089143/-/kula_preview.jpg","width":541,"height":634}],"artists":[],"categories":[{"id":3181237,"name":"Books","permalink":"books","url":"/category/books"}]}]
