This is a pre-order and calendars will be ordered in bulk.\r\n\r\nAlmost all of us have been touched by cancer in some way and some have been touched more than once. Greenville, South Carolina is a community that is passionate about cycling AND about raising money for cancer research. Last year I participated in the Challenge to Conquer Cancer Ride To Austin and it touched me deeply. The hard work and dedication by everyone was and is admirable. Some of the riders are currently battling cancer which makes it even more amazing. This year I decided to create a calendar that merged photography, cycling and raising money to fight this awful disease. Each of these women graciously donated their time and allowed me the creative freedom to create this 18-month photo calendar...all with heels on! Some are avid cyclists and others simply enjoy it as a recreation. Either way, they all have their hearts in the right place and are ready to help raise money for the cause.
